00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.790

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.400
 in getting to Mexico and we're leaving last 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.340
 truth first come and we have to 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.259
 go last identified if that was true and 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.210
 at what time did you feel that 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:24.180
 they could be champions for one thing is 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:26.329
 dream the other thing and another thing say that 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.800
 we went match after match 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:31.410
 you went wrong I do not know if bad 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.699
 with another not with confidence and we 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:41.620
 nobody just fired his family my old 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:43.740
 he said good luck said nobody 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.650
 but good 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.710
 we went strong with the group 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.620
 a very important meeting there that 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.200
 we talked about that it was talked quite hard and 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.420
 we were understanding what is to talk 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.100
 true that they look each other in the eye and they 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.050
 they put they could they made the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.320
 things that were done as many times as 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.380
 they looked for an enemy in common ticket and 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.880
 Iraqi rifle and look I had meetings 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.750
 I played football 20 years it gives me 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.750
 repeat meetings 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.500
 safe 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.040
 things we said things but things 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.610
 true truth with consent not 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.340
 no one was acting 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.620
 and we talked and listened to each other 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.300
 I listened to the one who spoke that all 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.090
 We could talk about a capable man 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.770
 that that did not come out but you do not 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.240
 I want to ask detail but that 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.470
 able man if they have to grab 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.670
 fist blows and one have to 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:43.010
 cry cry lines all around and there we 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.220
 we made forts of that meeting we 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.620
 we made strong we told ourselves things 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.570
 we made it clear that there was a group 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.210
 big that I was not going to play that I had to 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.440
 be very good because we had to 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.310
 accompanying there those who touched us 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.850
 to play and we understood was to identify 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.340
 he did it a free night it was not like that 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.010
 They put together a dance and then just like that 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.229
 tells us 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.250
 Bilardo sees that they are putting together the dance and 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.380
 says good 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.310
 does not make a meeting and you can go up 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.310
 the length of the morning 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:24.510
 we are there you saw looking and we had it 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.510
 we are having a good time 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.239
 and one that did not have it we were 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:32.610
 having a good time but good they took care of us 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.220
 first people the truth of there 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.550
 and next to the morning 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:42.000
 I see that the bowling door opens 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:46.270
 of the place but in a tea room 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.060
 dancing and we were there stopping 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.040
 did you see that blanket 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.180
 well I had in the town those 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.580
 red stockings half pictures and in I see 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.390
 hooded one who is dancing like that 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.740
 you saw said 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.130
 you were 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.500
 I say this pillar 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.810
 and comes comes comes to me and dresses right 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.900
 A) Yes 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.850
 today there are 100 orders opens the 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.730
 pool 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.340
 and then that this is to dry it tells me 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.610
 it's good cl 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.730
 stay until 4 and he went dancing and 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.220
 a thing Mascherano said to pass the 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.080
 quarterfinals would be very good for the 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.340
 Argentina and you saw that people say 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.320
 well we have to be champion in the 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.940
 world and you think that people do not know 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.010
 what it is to be world champion that 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.290
 think like in argentina always champion 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.630
 of the world nothing that he though spatial 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.500
 that the grand finale is a success what is 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.540
 more than match you know how difficult it is 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.629
 play all seven games 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.489
 we had as Argentinian the 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.270
 true the fortune that the two best 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:56.330
 players of the world were born here 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.520
 we had one not what 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.260
 we take full advantage 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.090
 we said we have the best of 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.920
 world and good come on we have to 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.010
 do so that the ball is good and 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.900
 let's give all to him 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.459
 and these guys have the same 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.019
 possibility but I think that of 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.500
 Mascherano I heard it and it's very good 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:17.590
 because it lowered a little the anxiety that 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.540
 we have all because you notice that 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.000
 every time three months before it arrives 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.620
 a world championship we come out champions 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.530
 of the world the others john for the second 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.120
 position from 98 had a great 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.850
 selection it seems to me that one of the 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.250
 best selections until today I think 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.250
 that is not bad is not wrong there are six in 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.889
 all the world champions not always champions 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.750
 always but I do not think it's wrong 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.970
 I think it's wrong now they know 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.440
 that they have a great possibility of 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.229
 what can you become champion 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:50.840
 players inside know if they are going to 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:53.120
 champion if they're going to get to Mexico like this 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.030
 in Mexico when the first round passed and 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.980
 we eliminated Uruguay when 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.440
 we arrived because it was for me one of the 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.360
 more difficult matches with Uruguay because 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.490
 we know each other a lot we are very similar 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.180
 and when we got to the locker room by 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.180
 Uruguay we said 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.390
 It's going to be difficult to get rid of us 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.580
 it's going to be difficult to get us out like that 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.119
 You're just going to have to perspire that 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.339
 want to win us 

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:23.039
 mexico-86 movie hero as they sang 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:24.839
 the hymn of you or in the 90 world 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:28.710
 who insulted the anthem whistled 

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:30.779
 angry maradona that's why boyacÃ¡ dresses 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.029
 here for you to say no, this does not sing 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:36.419
 is so important the anthem or able 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:38.699
 it's important and tell it to sing it 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.729
 it's not the only time they are not seeing 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:44.909
 kilos before a game is the anthem its us 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:47.580
 respects but not the player does not have to 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:49.169
 he will not go out and play and he will not go 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.069
 defend the shirt and will not defend 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:55.229
 to the country that is according to each player I do not 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:58.319
 I think it 's so important to me 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:00.509
 there was a movie in the anthem what 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:04.139
 I used to sing, but I passed a movie to the 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:07.259
 Once the country is stopped, I have to 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:08.969
 break fast fan you start to 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:11.550
 identify all the fans in the 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:15.300
 commune your look is like hd you said 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:17.249
 there is one does not listen in Mexico and 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.009
 he did in a hymn 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:22.319
 but the first band of Argentines a 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:26.399
 band with all t-shirts like that 

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:30.269
 pumas 3 who was the bambino veira carme 

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:32.369
 the pharaohs and a group all scream and 

00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:34.870
 I saw the mom was not my coach 

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:38.290
 at that time in the group 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:40.150
 and look is that it gives you strength and 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.730
 strange at that time of the selection 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:45.400
 in this time now now and when 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.370
 we are not even 34 months before the 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.680
 world 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:55.729
 swallow a desperation to be there 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.729
 stopped you do not come the memories all
