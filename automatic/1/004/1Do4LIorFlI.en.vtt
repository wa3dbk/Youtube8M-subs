00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.500
 today we will talk about how to make the mixture 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.330
 with oil for better two times 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.970
 also how to fill with oil 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.960
 chain and fuel your chainsaw 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.000
 first let's make the mixture of 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.130
 oil gasoline the mixture should be 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.900
 make 2% therefore the proportion 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.900
 it should be 50 1 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.060
 for example 5 liters of fuel and 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.070
 100 milliliters of oil 2 times 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.150
 We are going to make the mixture according to the 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.150
 indicated proportions 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.460
 once we add oil we fill in 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.030
 gasoline until you have the proportion of 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.750
 that we shake the container and the mixture 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.750
 will be ready 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.450
 remember it is very important to do well 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.040
 mixture to avoid damage to the engine in 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.750
 this module in particular we have the 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.110
 fuel tank and oil 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.110
 chain 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.950
 both have indicative drawings in the 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.560
 stopper or on the same chainsaw this 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.880
 indicates fuel tank and this 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.880
 indicates chain oil 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.100
 tighten the plug taken care of not 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.530
 pass the thread 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.250
 then fill in the deposit 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.250
 chain oil 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.800
 we close and tighten the cap remembering 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.569
 of not happening with the tightening we are already 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.230
 ready to put our chainsaw 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.230
 I launch
