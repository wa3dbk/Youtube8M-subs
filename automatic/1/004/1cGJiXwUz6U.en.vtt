about this barb

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.920 
about this barb
you<00:00:53.670> don't<00:00:53.820> have<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.090> reach<00:00:54.300> down<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
you don't have to reach down in the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.110 
you don't have to reach down in the
right<00:00:55.110> reaches<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.770> we<00:00:55.949> just<00:00:56.129> force<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:57.000> in

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
right reaches so we just force it in

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:23.160 
right reaches so we just force it in
there<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:58.379> then<00:00:58.559> after<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.579> couple<00:00:59.820> times

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:36.670 

so<00:01:34.570> okay<00:01:35.570> so<00:01:35.600> after<00:01:35.900> we<00:01:36.140> clean<00:01:36.380> it<00:01:36.530> with<00:01:36.650> the

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
so okay so after we clean it with the

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.770 
so okay so after we clean it with the
syringe<00:01:37.010> we<00:01:37.340> ran<00:01:37.580> some<00:01:38.120> apple<00:01:38.510> cider<00:01:38.630> vinegar

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
syringe we ran some apple cider vinegar

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.510 
syringe we ran some apple cider vinegar
through<00:01:39.380> it<00:01:39.470> we<00:01:39.590> just<00:01:39.710> put<00:01:39.920> some<00:01:39.950> of<00:01:40.160> the<00:01:40.220> tank

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
through it we just put some of the tank

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:48.430 
through it we just put some of the tank
you<00:01:40.820> could<00:01:41.330> probably<00:01:41.480> use<00:01:41.690> any<00:01:41.870> vinegar<00:01:47.440> here

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
you could probably use any vinegar here

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.660 
you could probably use any vinegar here
this<00:01:48.560> I'll<00:01:48.740> run<00:01:49.010> it<00:01:49.100> through<00:01:49.220> a<00:01:49.280> few<00:01:49.430> times

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
this I'll run it through a few times

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.830 
this I'll run it through a few times
really<00:01:50.210> can<00:01:50.780> clean<00:01:51.080> up<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.380> inside
