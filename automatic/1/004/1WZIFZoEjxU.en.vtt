00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.440 
shoot and they base it off of how old it
is<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:50.070> genetics<00:01:50.520> they<00:01:50.700> have<00:01:50.939> if<00:01:51.270> they're

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
is the genetics they have if they're

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.230 
is the genetics they have if they're
problem<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.310> take<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.000> one<00:01:54.210> that's

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
problem so you take the one that's

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
and I'm paraphrasing here baby

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.330 
and I'm paraphrasing here baby
I<00:05:14.260> hunt<00:05:14.650> it's<00:05:15.010> legal<00:05:15.430> get<00:05:15.820> over<00:05:16.090> it<00:05:16.270> exactly<00:05:17.340> I

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
I hunt it's legal get over it exactly I

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.890 
I hunt it's legal get over it exactly I
mean<00:05:18.370> if<00:05:18.669> I<00:05:18.790> was<00:05:18.910> going<00:05:19.180> out<00:05:19.360> and<00:05:19.630> shooting

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
mean if I was going out and shooting

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.590 
mean if I was going out and shooting
everything<00:05:20.320> I<00:05:20.590> saw<00:05:20.800> okay<00:05:21.340> like<00:05:21.760> that<00:05:22.419> would<00:05:22.570> be

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
everything I saw okay like that would be

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.270 
everything I saw okay like that would be
poaching<00:05:23.110> that<00:05:23.140> would<00:05:23.500> be<00:05:23.650> illegal<00:05:24.070> and<00:05:24.130> I'd

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
poaching that would be illegal and I'd

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.480 
poaching that would be illegal and I'd
be<00:05:24.490> in<00:05:24.580> jail<00:05:24.610> so<00:05:25.210> right<00:05:25.990> can<00:05:26.860> you<00:05:26.919> do<00:05:27.130> this<00:05:27.280> with

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
be in jail so right can you do this with

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.550 
be in jail so right can you do this with
a<00:05:27.520> conservationist<00:05:28.240> mindset<00:05:28.780> I<00:05:28.810> mean<00:05:28.990> really

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
a conservationist mindset I mean really

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.370 
a conservationist mindset I mean really
in<00:05:29.860> many<00:05:30.370> respects<00:05:31.120> there's<00:05:31.450> a<00:05:31.540> population

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
in many respects there's a population

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.590 
in many respects there's a population
control<00:05:33.040> aspect<00:05:33.700> of<00:05:33.820> money<00:05:34.000> goes<00:05:34.180> absolutely

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
control aspect of money goes absolutely

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.409 
control aspect of money goes absolutely
and<00:05:35.320> if<00:05:35.410> I<00:05:35.560> could<00:05:35.860> explain<00:05:36.460> conservation<00:05:37.240> to

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
and if I could explain conservation to

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.780 
and if I could explain conservation to
all<00:05:37.570> of<00:05:37.720> them<00:05:37.900> I<00:05:38.140> would<00:05:38.410> but<00:05:39.040> it's<00:05:39.190> hard<00:05:39.490> and

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
all of them I would but it's hard and
