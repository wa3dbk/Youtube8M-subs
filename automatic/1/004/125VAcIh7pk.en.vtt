00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.019
 today I find for a 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:16.610
 new video that will be the opening of 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.630
 my swap so I arrive with jeanne de 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.330
 the facebook page 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.760
 weleda young people to have against that has 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.430
 been a little weird we'll say it either 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.440
 because she received her so in time 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.660
 wanted to do them in front of me we did not 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.149
 could film and so on unfortunately and 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.039
 the less of her in front of me I 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.719
 received only two things and the rest 

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:37.819
 I have just received this morning at home 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.889
 so it was a command of a site I 

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:41.569
 do not know at all what it is 

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:43.190
 seem mind mutation was not 

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:45.859
 at all marked on the horse pole I 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.440
 do not know then to begin to be I 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:50.929
 will show you my free stairs 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.179
 when I opened the swap bakot she 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:57.260
 opened his earlier there was a 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:58.729
 map like that so it's basically at 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.479
 instead of making a minuet the vecquerie 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:03.049
 led from the restaurant to the four irons it's 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.360
 the door 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:10.700
 overly luck with a photo of 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:13.550
 me and here is so there are plenty of 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.080
 little ones a little wood behind and 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.960
 then she did something for me 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.820
 I'm just a little book 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:25.330
 where it tells all my story to 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:28.100
 horse so there are four points 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.660
 finally it's just great this little trick 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:35.240
 would go all the pictures with my mare 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.990
 it's beautiful in fact it's just 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.720
 magnificent 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.250
 but I will not just read it to you 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.480
 because as I will make a video 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.800
 to read that because it tells 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.170
 really everything for a story actually 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.430
 so in detail 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:52.310
 so it's perfect then to start 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.880
 already montcalm has offered two varnishes of the 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:01.930

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.740

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.460

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.460

 so fist the man I put a lot 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.019

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.000
 at the opa de troque so I could 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.519
 find used things and 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.239
 she really does not me much 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:24.800

 oh there, she'll be so bad 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.389
 with that I honestly think it's going to him 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.270
 she is too good on the track with the colors 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.100
 so it's just awesome 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:44.539

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:50.840

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:57.139
 so here I do not know what to say 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.139

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.610

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.410

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.599
 jeanne because the ferry is that 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.729
 I was a very very strong to you and that 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:10.310
 not the first man I did not see too much 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:13.580
 with whom to do apart from you sincerely 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:16.060
 because it's like my sister actually 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.320
 this girl from the blow 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.039

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.210
 only in Japan 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.740
 I could have found things for him 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.940

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.940

 can still find him sincerely 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.160
