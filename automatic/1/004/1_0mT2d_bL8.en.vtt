00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
nicely resting on my left leg it's got a

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:14.879 
nicely resting on my left leg it's got a
nice<00:01:13.299> little<00:01:13.479> kerf<00:01:13.869> you're<00:01:14.229> allowing<00:01:14.530> that

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:14.889 
nice little kerf you're allowing that

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:17.699 
nice little kerf you're allowing that
and<00:01:15.700> it<00:01:15.789> feels<00:01:15.969> really<00:01:16.209> comfortably<00:01:16.749> allowing

00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:17.709 
and it feels really comfortably allowing

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:20.039 
and it feels really comfortably allowing
my<00:01:17.829> left<00:01:18.069> hand<00:01:18.310> to<00:01:18.459> practice<00:01:18.939> my<00:01:19.749> skill

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
my left hand to practice my skill

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.870 
my left hand to practice my skill
positions<00:01:20.759> my<00:01:21.759> runs<00:01:23.219> anything<00:01:24.219> left<00:01:24.549> hand

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
positions my runs anything left hand

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.109 
positions my runs anything left hand
orientated<00:01:25.479> so<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:27.159> mostly<00:01:27.399> a<00:01:27.490> legato<00:01:27.819> kind

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
orientated so it's mostly a legato kind

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.059 
orientated so it's mostly a legato kind
of<00:01:28.179> technique<00:01:28.539> right<00:01:28.869> because<00:01:29.289> the<00:01:29.889> right

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:30.069 
of technique right because the right

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:32.340 
of technique right because the right
hand<00:01:30.100> is<00:01:30.429> not<00:01:30.520> really<00:01:30.819> involved<00:01:31.259> although<00:01:32.259> you

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
hand is not really involved although you

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.809 
hand is not really involved although you
could<00:01:32.770> theoretically<00:01:33.990> practice<00:01:34.990> on<00:01:35.229> this

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
could theoretically practice on this

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:37.980 
could theoretically practice on this
surface<00:01:36.819> here<00:01:37.270> for<00:01:37.450> your<00:01:37.569> right<00:01:37.749> hand

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
surface here for your right hand

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.349 
surface here for your right hand
movement<00:01:38.319> but<00:01:38.499> it's<00:01:39.490> not<00:01:39.700> very<00:01:39.909> comfortable

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:40.359 
movement but it's not very comfortable

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:42.029 
movement but it's not very comfortable
it's<00:01:40.569> really<00:01:40.840> designed<00:01:41.020> for<00:01:41.289> the<00:01:41.499> left<00:01:41.679> hand<00:01:41.950> I

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
it's really designed for the left hand I

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.710 
it's really designed for the left hand I
think

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
think

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.870 
think
while<00:01:43.320> your<00:01:43.500> sequences<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.340> stuff<00:01:44.550> like<00:01:44.670> that

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
while your sequences and stuff like that

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.020 
while your sequences and stuff like that
so<00:01:45.120> that's<00:01:45.390> how<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.110> should<00:01:46.140> rest<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:47.040> your<00:01:47.160> on

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
so that's how it should rest in your on

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.120 
so that's how it should rest in your on
your<00:01:48.360> leg<00:01:50.750> it's<00:01:51.750> got<00:01:51.900> some<00:01:52.110> tuning<00:01:52.500> knobs<00:01:52.740> here
