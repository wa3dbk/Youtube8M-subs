there we go so now it seems like the

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.969 
there we go so now it seems like the
battery<00:04:54.820> is<00:04:54.970> holding<00:04:55.360> it<00:04:55.479> in<00:04:55.800> again<00:04:56.800> this<00:04:56.919> is

these out so we need a flathead
screwdriver<00:05:03.669> which<00:05:04.800> we<00:05:05.800> have<00:05:06.039> right<00:05:06.340> here<00:05:07.110> put

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
screwdriver which we have right here put

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.700 
screwdriver which we have right here put
that<00:05:08.320> in<00:05:08.470> there<00:05:09.300> get<00:05:10.300> that<00:05:10.419> battery<00:05:10.690> up<00:05:11.080> there

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
that in there get that battery up there

that in there get that battery up there
we<00:05:11.860> go<00:05:13.770> and<00:05:16.740> there's<00:05:17.740> some<00:05:17.889> tape<00:05:18.280> pulling<00:05:18.669> the

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
we go and there's some tape pulling the

battery on so there now the unit looks

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.240 
battery on so there now the unit looks
like<00:05:25.150> it's<00:05:25.300> being<00:05:25.539> held<00:05:25.870> by<00:05:28.440> two<00:05:29.440> small<00:05:29.680> ribbon

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
like it's being held by two small ribbon

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.460 
like it's being held by two small ribbon
cables<00:05:31.530> that<00:05:32.530> we<00:05:32.650> could<00:05:32.800> probably<00:05:34.470> they're

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
cables that we could probably they're

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.379 
cables that we could probably they're
removable<00:05:36.039> but<00:05:36.430> those<00:05:36.910> are<00:05:37.120> going<00:05:37.210> to<00:05:37.270> be<00:05:37.330> a

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:37.389 
removable but those are going to be a

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:42.750 
removable but those are going to be a
pain<00:05:37.780> to<00:05:37.810> get<00:05:38.229> back<00:05:38.410> in<00:05:39.690> let's<00:05:40.690> see<00:05:40.900> here<00:05:41.760> we

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
pain to get back in let's see here we

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.200 
pain to get back in let's see here we
can<00:05:42.940> take<00:05:43.150> this<00:05:43.240> flathead<00:05:43.599> I<00:05:44.880> don't<00:05:45.880> want<00:05:46.090> to

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
can take this flathead I don't want to

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.810 
can take this flathead I don't want to
pry<00:05:46.599> those<00:05:46.840> too<00:05:47.110> hard<00:05:50.310> it<00:05:51.310> seems<00:05:51.550> like<00:05:51.699> the

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
pry those too hard it seems like the

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.189 
pry those too hard it seems like the
base<00:05:52.060> will<00:05:52.300> start<00:05:52.539> to<00:05:52.599> come<00:05:52.690> up<00:05:52.840> there<00:05:52.990> there

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 
base will start to come up there there

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:56.460 
base will start to come up there there
we<00:05:53.349> go<00:05:53.729> alright<00:05:54.780> so<00:05:55.780> that<00:05:55.900> gives<00:05:56.050> you<00:05:56.169> a<00:05:56.229> good

we go alright so that gives you a good
look<00:05:57.130> at<00:05:57.250> the<00:05:57.340> board<00:05:57.550> right<00:05:57.669> there<00:05:57.880> obviously

00:05:58.339 --> 00:05:58.349 
look at the board right there obviously

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:00.750 
look at the board right there obviously
this<00:05:59.349> is<00:05:59.560> the<00:05:59.680> four<00:05:59.889> gigabyte<00:06:00.280> chip<00:06:00.580> right

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
this is the four gigabyte chip right

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.189 
this is the four gigabyte chip right
there<00:06:01.110> that's<00:06:02.110> the<00:06:02.699> Samsung<00:06:03.699> memory<00:06:04.199> right

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 
there that's the Samsung memory right

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:07.409 
there that's the Samsung memory right
there<00:06:05.470> that's<00:06:05.500> a<00:06:05.919> 4<00:06:06.190> gigabyte<00:06:06.639> like<00:06:07.120> little

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
there that's a 4 gigabyte like little

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:10.830 
there that's a 4 gigabyte like little
double-sided<00:06:08.400> solid-state<00:06:09.400> memory<00:06:10.030> here's

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
double-sided solid-state memory here's

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.740 
double-sided solid-state memory here's
the<00:06:11.020> little<00:06:11.169> lithium-ion<00:06:11.620> battery<00:06:12.130> so<00:06:12.970> come

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
the little lithium-ion battery so come

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.279 
the little lithium-ion battery so come
you<00:06:14.349> know<00:06:14.470> a<00:06:14.500> year<00:06:15.659> year<00:06:16.659> and<00:06:16.720> a<00:06:16.780> half<00:06:16.900> out<00:06:17.110> when

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
you know a year year and a half out when

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:18.450 
you know a year year and a half out when
you<00:06:17.349> need<00:06:17.380> to<00:06:17.560> replace<00:06:17.830> it<00:06:17.919> this<00:06:18.220> is<00:06:18.340> what

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
you need to replace it this is what

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.310 
you need to replace it this is what
you're<00:06:18.550> going<00:06:18.639> to<00:06:18.729> be<00:06:18.820> replacing<00:06:18.970> and<00:06:19.630> then

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320 
you're going to be replacing and then

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.140 
you're going to be replacing and then
the<00:06:20.500> circuit<00:06:20.800> board<00:06:20.919> itself<00:06:21.190> is<00:06:21.430> actually

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
the circuit board itself is actually

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.570 
the circuit board itself is actually
quite<00:06:22.599> small<00:06:23.020> you<00:06:23.080> can<00:06:23.349> see<00:06:23.530> a<00:06:23.770> little<00:06:24.370> bit<00:06:24.520> of

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
quite small you can see a little bit of

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.779 
quite small you can see a little bit of
a<00:06:24.729> design<00:06:25.030> change<00:06:25.419> in<00:06:25.780> the<00:06:26.110> Nano<00:06:26.320> this<00:06:27.130> is<00:06:27.400> the

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:27.789 
a design change in the Nano this is the

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:29.550 
a design change in the Nano this is the
where<00:06:28.360> the<00:06:28.449> headphones<00:06:28.840> go<00:06:29.020> into<00:06:29.260> so<00:06:29.409> now<00:06:29.530> I

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 
where the headphones go into so now I

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.960 
where the headphones go into so now I
actually<00:06:29.800> don't<00:06:30.099> plug<00:06:30.340> the<00:06:30.460> headphones<00:06:30.610> into

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:30.970 
actually don't plug the headphones into

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.909 
actually don't plug the headphones into
the<00:06:31.120> top<00:06:31.330> they<00:06:31.900> go<00:06:32.050> right<00:06:32.229> into<00:06:32.409> the<00:06:32.560> base<00:06:32.710> of

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 
the top they go right into the base of

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:35.040 
the top they go right into the base of
the<00:06:32.979> unit<00:06:33.070> along<00:06:33.909> with<00:06:34.120> the<00:06:34.240> dock<00:06:34.870> adapter

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.050 
the unit along with the dock adapter

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.620 
the unit along with the dock adapter
right<00:06:35.500> there<00:06:35.800> so<00:06:36.550> pretty<00:06:36.940> straightforward

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630 
right there so pretty straightforward

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.810 
right there so pretty straightforward
connected<00:06:38.409> directly<00:06:38.800> to<00:06:39.010> this<00:06:39.219> color<00:06:39.460> screen

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:39.820 
connected directly to this color screen

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.510 
connected directly to this color screen
we<00:06:39.969> could

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
we could

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.339 
we could
the<00:06:40.699> color<00:06:40.879> screen<00:06:41.210> out<00:06:41.360> it<00:06:41.479> looks<00:06:41.629> like<00:06:41.750> you

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:42.349 
the color screen out it looks like you

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:44.499 
the color screen out it looks like you
can<00:06:42.500> pull<00:06:42.680> the<00:06:42.800> color<00:06:42.979> screen<00:06:43.250> out<00:06:43.400> but<00:06:43.699> we're

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:44.509 
can pull the color screen out but we're

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:46.360 
can pull the color screen out but we're
actually<00:06:44.660> going<00:06:44.960> to<00:06:45.050> continue<00:06:45.800> to<00:06:46.039> use<00:06:46.220> this

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.370 
actually going to continue to use this

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.529 
actually going to continue to use this
now<00:06:46.580> I<00:06:46.610> don't<00:06:46.819> want<00:06:47.060> to<00:06:47.120> keep<00:06:47.240> it<00:06:47.389> in<00:06:47.479> the

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:47.539 
now I don't want to keep it in the

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:49.659 
now I don't want to keep it in the
working<00:06:47.870> state<00:06:48.110> so<00:06:48.470> we're<00:06:49.190> not<00:06:49.310> going<00:06:49.430> to<00:06:49.490> yank

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:49.669 
working state so we're not going to yank

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:52.029 
working state so we're not going to yank
that<00:06:49.729> out<00:06:50.000> so<00:06:50.500> we're<00:06:51.500> going<00:06:51.620> to<00:06:51.710> go<00:06:51.740> ahead<00:06:51.860> and

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:52.039 
that out so we're going to go ahead and

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:54.279 
that out so we're going to go ahead and
put<00:06:52.970> this<00:06:53.090> back<00:06:53.300> together<00:06:53.419> and<00:06:53.870> hopefully

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:54.289 
put this back together and hopefully

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:56.680 
put this back together and hopefully
it'll<00:06:54.590> work<00:06:55.060> so<00:06:56.060> there<00:06:56.210> you<00:06:56.300> have<00:06:56.330> it<00:06:56.449> an

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:56.690 
it'll work so there you have it an

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.589 
it'll work so there you have it an
inside<00:06:56.990> look<00:06:57.199> at<00:06:57.349> the<00:06:57.470> ipod<00:06:57.919> nano<00:06:58.360> 1.5<00:06:59.360> ounces
