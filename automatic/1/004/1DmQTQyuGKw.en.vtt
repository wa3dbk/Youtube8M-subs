00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.750 
Stewart they were smashing pair but Dave
I<00:00:58.170> think<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.680> thing<00:00:58.829> with<00:00:58.920> Dave<00:00:59.129> Brian<00:00:59.550> was

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
I think the thing with Dave Brian was

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.310 
I think the thing with Dave Brian was
that<00:00:59.940> he<00:01:00.270> had<00:01:00.359> some<00:01:00.570> Flair<00:01:00.809> players<00:01:01.079> around

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
that he had some Flair players around

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.729 
that he had some Flair players around
him<00:01:01.530> like<00:01:01.680> Cooke<00:01:02.579> Hudson<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.329> myself<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.899> he

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
him like Cooke Hudson and myself and he

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.140 
him like Cooke Hudson and myself and he
had<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.949> work<00:01:05.070> hard<00:01:05.400> at<00:01:05.519> his<00:01:05.610> game<00:01:05.820> when<00:01:05.939> he<00:01:06.030> was

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
had to work hard at his game when he was

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.600 
had to work hard at his game when he was
a<00:01:06.180> player<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:07.080> think<00:01:07.290> he<00:01:07.439> saw<00:01:07.680> us<00:01:07.710> as<00:01:08.130> being

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
a player and I think he saw us as being

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.880 
a player and I think he saw us as being
very<00:01:08.790> very<00:01:08.909> natural<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.689> didn't<00:01:10.560> work<00:01:10.710> as

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
very very natural and didn't work as

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.560 
very very natural and didn't work as
hard<00:01:11.040> as<00:01:11.159> he<00:01:11.220> had<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.580> work<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.030> some<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
hard as he had to work and some of the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.210 
hard as he had to work and some of the
other<00:01:12.689> lads<00:01:12.900> had<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.140> work<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.920> think<00:01:14.130> he

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
other lads had to work and I think he

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.260 
other lads had to work and I think he
resent<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.580> little<00:01:14.850> bit<00:01:14.939> but<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.119> was<00:01:15.150> a

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
resent that little bit but it was a

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.450 
resent that little bit but it was a
fantastic<00:01:15.450> coach<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.320> didn't<00:01:17.009> think<00:01:17.130> he<00:01:17.310> was<00:01:17.400> a

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
fantastic coach I didn't think he was a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.460 
fantastic coach I didn't think he was a
brilliant<00:01:18.360> manager<00:01:18.659> because<00:01:19.140> he<00:01:19.229> couldn't

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
brilliant manager because he couldn't

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.560 
brilliant manager because he couldn't
you've<00:01:19.619> got<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.860> talk<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.880> people<00:01:21.090> you've<00:01:21.479> got

to give somebody a rollicking and when

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.960 
to give somebody a rollicking and when
it's<00:01:26.040> only<00:01:26.189> not<00:01:26.369> too<00:01:26.460> good<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.640> me

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970

right but as a coach he was second to

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.649 
right but as a coach he was second to

fearful probably one of the best in the
world<00:03:44.280> at<00:03:44.430> that<00:03:44.459> time<00:03:44.690> and<00:03:45.690> I<00:03:46.139> just<00:03:46.560> think<00:03:46.680> as<00:03:46.739> a

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
world at that time and I just think as a

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.860 
world at that time and I just think as a
critic<00:03:47.099> in<00:03:47.280> four<00:03:47.519> goals<00:03:47.819> but<00:03:48.419> Eddie<00:03:48.599> gray

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
critic in four goals but Eddie gray

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.680 
critic in four goals but Eddie gray
murdered<00:03:49.379> David<00:03:49.590> Webb<00:03:49.919> and<00:03:50.099> they've<00:03:50.879> got<00:03:51.569> that

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
murdered David Webb and they've got that

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.479 
murdered David Webb and they've got that
wrong<00:03:51.930> they<00:03:52.079> put<00:03:52.260> David<00:03:52.560> Webb<00:03:52.680> had<00:03:53.099> fall<00:03:53.310> back

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
wrong they put David Webb had fall back

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.699 
wrong they put David Webb had fall back
and<00:03:53.639> put<00:03:53.760> Ronnie<00:03:53.940> in<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.180> middle<00:03:54.470> with<00:03:55.470> John

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
and put Ronnie in the middle with John

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.559 
and put Ronnie in the middle with John
Dempsey<00:03:55.919> when<00:03:56.549> you<00:03:56.639> had<00:03:56.760> Clarke<00:03:57.030> and<00:03:57.209> Jones<00:03:57.389> up

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
Dempsey when you had Clarke and Jones up

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.479 
Dempsey when you had Clarke and Jones up
front<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:57.989> I<00:03:58.470> think<00:03:58.889> he<00:03:58.980> put<00:03:59.160> Ronnie<00:03:59.340> on

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
front and I think he put Ronnie on
