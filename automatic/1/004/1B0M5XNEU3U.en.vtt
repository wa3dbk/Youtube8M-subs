00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.520
 I'm still cheap I've written on the flags today times 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.250
 down-to-earth court with the certain for confidence therefore it gives over 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.479
 Pigs big roast with cowardly act of terror 

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:18.460
 for the swank us-brands myself, I have a nice piece about lean 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.429
 Pork belly at a butcher ordered and had also outen formally 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:25.349
 let the division scrape the division itself, but then again with me 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.539
 His blessed Schaffner side use such a blessed is particularly suitable 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.169
 good for it 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.169
 classified about half an inch lower 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.040
 the little box itself not to call me because I have already 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.660
 not to torture her too long, so-called, says Honert 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.850
 heated with three liters of water four tablespoons of salt and four leaves leaves 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.769
 and gives now 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:50.390
 deen pork belly here with the weak side on points in the 

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:52.860
 hot salt water 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.370
 We call again close and the whole to 45 minutes ever pretended 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.800
 In the meantime, I can also specialize all the great godparents 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.340
 Take care of a similar look 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.020
 but sometimes 3 cloves of garlic are here in a pub along with 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.340
 approximately 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.640
 much is everything 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.640
 now the big issue is 12 from the market 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.200
 Chr 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.880
 8th 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.880
 on 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.210
 and this fit 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.980
 in a key game 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.060
 it was 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.450
 so that's it with the whole thing that I'm just fighting a lot now 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.689
 better yes for the direction is Cejka 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.770
 ADVA with something 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.600
 divorced and rubbed Ebert 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.000
 the Argentine 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.030
 chopped with rosemary 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.930
 Josie even hinted at being commercially available 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.930
 chugs like red sugar syrup it's not that sweet 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.510
 but 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.750
 that is the reason why but already 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.750
 there is still to come 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.579
 Finally, stir in about two tablespoons of flour 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.579
 from 

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:26.519
 from already on 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.519
 This step moves everything back to the side 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.519
 Show Sauerkraut I have ever butterschmalz to stay 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.890
 In the evening I give now the quartered and asked already places so 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.689
 like the curry powder 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:44.609
 sweaty now differently 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.189
 ever nice 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.189
 it will take about two to three minutes 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:53.779
 now I want Ford Focus too 

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:57.839
 but sometimes on withdrawal 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:59.819
 mix everything well 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.419
 Here, by blackening out the drivers of who exactly how they see them 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:06.419
 that also Puma could marvelously on the falcon 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:08.870
 that said quite well 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:09.950
 this is the whole thing with 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.249
 Apple juice on 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:15.639
 and that has to cook about an hour now they should from time to time 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:16.570
 percent 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.439
 and now 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:19.719
 in this hour 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:22.719
 against them will be in Becquerel 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.259
 after the end of the default time 

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:29.740
 whether it's the big words 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.370
 especially taken out of the water on a baking sheet set with the black 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.420
 Robes and had 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.720
 a cut but with a clearing again and even one 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.229
 Centimeters deepened 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:43.209
 So I summed up as well as final sprint was filled 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.490
 and now gives way to Dr Row 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.709
 Those jokes, so to speak, missed a crisis from that 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.129
 that can penetrate as far as the butcher and so does the big one 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.499
 Roast seasoned in a very spicy way 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.839
 but already at the end 

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:03.100
 that's just too side 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.499
 and now the big words 

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:05.660
 again, too 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.479
 To rust 

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:09.529
 whoever side anyway 

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:12.529
 there is to write the bottom rail here in the book 

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:17.429
 and then advise the rust with the costs practically right over there 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.109
 The whole thing he has to spend another hour and a half at 200 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:26.459
 cook and from time to time I will either water or something Bremen Tim 

00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:27.810
 Meadow that perhaps also have at home 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.810
 the rounds like this says Warnecke 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.300
 30 minutes before the end of the cooking time the sauerkraut 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.580
 the fellow students dried figs too and I think that has us a lot 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.580
 Use and enthusiasm removed 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:50.300
 Mix everything well 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.020
 and as I said 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.020
 another 30 minutes with Krantz 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.330
 after the end of the cooking time 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.830
 but sympathetic brought out of the oven and 8 leaves the roast of the compact or 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.990
 Fandel says in an extra tip given the whole boiled up and 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.160
 I'm here now that spits the on the surface Schund simply with a 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.159
 big chain or ladle ever something to eat 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.180
 try the whole topic 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.590
 because you should 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.200
 after that the roast says 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.100
 something to 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.699
 which can not be finished 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:25.110
 but it would have been delicious 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.280
 if you just something 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.860
 continue shopping 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.520
 for roasting itself again 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.520
 I'm just a couple of beautiful woman so cheerfully 

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:41.529
 with they talk wonderfully crispy that's why the roast is too dark 

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:42.309
 become 

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:45.200
 neither about 15 to 20 minutes before Gottwald end 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.940
 something off 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.439
 and on top of that 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:49.490
 the wonderful cowardly sauerkraut 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.490
 just on a plate 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.270
 Arslan and show 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.270
 wonderful bright yellow color 

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:01.689
 I had the partner on top or maybe two 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:04.689
 depending on your appetite 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:09.289
 and of course from the bike 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:17.680
 You should make this wonderful dish one 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.599
 World s 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:21.789
 Have a meal account or even start Sunday roast start of series quite easily 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:23.470
 on a wooden plate with expiring 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.890
 and even for this protein constant one is simply blown over its special 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.720
 Event when something withdraws
