00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.640 

and<00:02:28.239> it's<00:02:28.599> going<00:02:28.689> to<00:02:28.810> do<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:28.900> lot<00:02:29.260> of<00:02:29.319> that

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
and it's going to do a lot of that

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:38.250 
and it's going to do a lot of that
threat<00:02:29.920> song<00:02:35.730> all<00:02:36.730> right<00:02:36.879> in<00:02:37.629> between<00:02:37.810> the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
threat song all right in between the

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.289 
threat song all right in between the
house<00:02:39.010> of<00:02:39.040> our<00:02:39.610> power<00:02:39.849> cords<00:02:40.209> again<00:02:42.299> there's

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
house of our power cords again there's

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:44.580 
house of our power cords again there's
going<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.540> be<00:02:43.599> some<00:02:43.840> different<00:02:44.290> things<00:02:44.319> that

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
going to be some different things that

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.530 
going to be some different things that
go<00:02:44.650> on<00:02:44.739> between<00:02:44.950> it<00:02:45.220> like<00:02:45.730> for<00:02:45.940> instance<00:02:46.030> the

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
go on between it like for instance the

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.470 
go on between it like for instance the
part<00:02:46.780> where<00:02:47.650> it<00:02:47.769> seems<00:02:48.040> garlic<00:02:48.370> sweet<00:02:48.549> picking

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.869 

that's<00:02:52.480> what<00:02:53.290> that<00:02:53.440> is<00:02:53.620> is<00:02:53.950> that's<00:02:54.129> just<00:02:54.459> going

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
that's what that is is that's just going

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.910 
that's what that is is that's just going
from<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.420> with<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.900> string<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.439> the<00:02:56.530> D<00:02:56.739> string

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
from a with the string to the D string

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.080 
from a with the string to the D string
of<00:02:57.159> the<00:02:57.220> g<00:02:57.400> string<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.879> you<00:02:58.299> can<00:02:58.390> be<00:02:58.480> hitting

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
of the g string and you can be hitting

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.140 
of the g string and you can be hitting
like<00:03:01.200> for<00:03:02.200> instance<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.799> SUV<00:03:03.190> on<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.459> five<00:03:03.730> and

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
like for instance a SUV on the five and

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.360 
like for instance a SUV on the five and
then<00:03:04.299> you<00:03:04.329> go<00:03:04.510> to<00:03:04.569> eight<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:06.010> you're<00:03:06.190> going<00:03:06.310> to

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
then you go to eight so you're going to

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.640 
then you go to eight so you're going to
go<00:03:06.459> use<00:03:07.329> your<00:03:07.359> pointer<00:03:07.690> finger<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:08.049> five<00:03:08.290> and

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
go use your pointer finger to five and

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.039 
go use your pointer finger to five and
then<00:03:08.739> eight<00:03:09.129> to<00:03:09.730> go<00:03:09.760> which<00:03:10.269> three<00:03:10.569> frets<00:03:10.780> above

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
then eight to go which three frets above

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.640 
then eight to go which three frets above
it<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:12.389> you<00:03:13.389> do<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.690> same<00:03:13.720> thing<00:03:13.959> on<00:03:14.409> the<00:03:14.470> D

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
it and you do the same thing on the D

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.740 
it and you do the same thing on the D
string<00:03:14.680> except<00:03:15.310> you<00:03:15.370> move<00:03:15.609> up<00:03:15.790> a<00:03:15.970> fret<00:03:16.209> so<00:03:16.720> I

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
string except you move up a fret so I

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.540 
string except you move up a fret so I
counts<00:03:17.200> 58<00:03:17.739> it<00:03:17.980> becomes<00:03:18.400> 69

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.860 

seven-tenths<00:03:23.550> and<00:03:23.879> then<00:03:24.000> 7<00:03:24.330> 10<00:03:24.480> on<00:03:24.629> the<00:03:24.659> g

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
seven-tenths and then 7 10 on the g

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.000 
seven-tenths and then 7 10 on the g
string

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.729 

I<00:03:30.129> haven't<00:03:31.060> gotten<00:03:31.239> that<00:03:31.689> alternate<00:03:32.500> picking

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
I haven't gotten that alternate picking

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:38.130 
I haven't gotten that alternate picking
down<00:03:33.010> but<00:03:33.370> it<00:03:33.970> should<00:03:34.360> sound<00:03:34.510> like

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.130 

I<00:03:38.819> was<00:03:39.819> giving<00:03:40.030> a<00:03:40.060> lot<00:03:40.180> faster<00:03:40.630> than<00:03:40.690> that<00:03:40.870> and

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
I was giving a lot faster than that and

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.900 
I was giving a lot faster than that and
probably<00:03:41.380> not<00:03:41.620> as<00:03:41.800> many<00:03:41.980> picking<00:03:42.370> this<00:03:42.490> I<00:03:42.700> just

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
probably not as many picking this I just

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.940 
probably not as many picking this I just
wanna<00:03:43.090> show<00:03:43.300> you<00:03:43.360> instead<00:03:44.200> were<00:03:44.410> selling

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.250 

if<00:03:49.700> you<00:03:49.879> don't<00:03:50.000> want<00:03:50.120> to<00:03:50.209> do<00:03:50.270> that<00:03:50.330> what<00:03:51.170> you

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
if you don't want to do that what you

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.510 
if you don't want to do that what you
can<00:03:51.470> do<00:03:51.650> you<00:03:51.920> won't<00:03:52.069> be<00:03:52.129> able<00:03:52.190> to<00:03:52.310> do<00:03:52.400> it

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
can do you won't be able to do it

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.619 
can do you won't be able to do it
alternating<00:03:52.610> with<00:03:53.030> this<00:03:53.209> but<00:03:53.360> you<00:03:53.420> can<00:03:53.510> just

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 
alternating with this but you can just

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:58.509 
alternating with this but you can just
tap<00:03:53.840> like<00:03:54.080> you<00:03:54.800> just<00:03:54.920> have<00:03:55.129> it<00:03:57.129> all<00:03:58.129> right<00:03:58.220> and

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
tap like you just have it all right and

00:03:58.519 --> 00:03:59.740 
tap like you just have it all right and
the<00:03:58.580> next<00:03:58.760> thing<00:03:58.940> like<00:03:59.120> that<00:03:59.150> it<00:03:59.420> attempts<00:03:59.720> to

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
the next thing like that it attempts to

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.479 
the next thing like that it attempts to
go<00:04:00.110> back<00:04:00.379> to<00:04:00.470> that<00:04:00.530> power<00:04:00.709> core<00:04:01.010> thing<00:04:03.489> and

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
go back to that power core thing and

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.920 
go back to that power core thing and
then<00:04:04.610> it<00:04:04.730> hits<00:04:04.959> open<00:04:05.959> heads<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:07.400> then<00:04:08.030> a<00:04:08.239> power

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
then it hits open heads and then a power

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:21.160 
then it hits open heads and then a power
cord<00:04:09.170> on<00:04:09.290> three<00:04:09.470> on<00:04:09.530> a<00:04:09.680> shin<00:04:10.720> so<00:04:11.720> you<00:04:11.780> get<00:04:12.080> it

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:27.860 

a<00:04:21.290> to<00:04:21.800> start<00:04:22.100> over<00:04:22.220> again

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.700 

and<00:04:28.560> then<00:04:28.710> it's<00:04:29.010> going<00:04:29.130> to<00:04:29.190> be<00:04:29.400> a<00:04:29.699> dive<00:04:30.479> bomb<00:04:30.840> or

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
and then it's going to be a dive bomb or

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.650 
and then it's going to be a dive bomb or
pull<00:04:32.100> pull<00:04:32.580> out<00:04:32.820> which<00:04:32.940> is<00:04:33.060> pulling<00:04:33.360> up<00:04:33.449> with<00:04:33.600> a

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
pull pull out which is pulling up with a

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.659 
pull pull out which is pulling up with a
wine<00:04:33.810> bar<00:04:34.110> I<00:04:34.350> don't<00:04:34.889> have<00:04:35.010> a<00:04:35.040> waiting<00:04:35.400> for<00:04:35.639> a

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
wine bar I don't have a waiting for a

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.610 
wine bar I don't have a waiting for a
matar<00:04:36.030> but<00:04:36.300> it's<00:04:36.750> going<00:04:36.900> to<00:04:36.960> be<00:04:37.110> just<00:04:37.139> hitting

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
matar but it's going to be just hitting

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:46.270 
matar but it's going to be just hitting
a<00:04:37.710> harmonic<00:04:38.300> like<00:04:41.180> something<00:04:42.180> like<00:04:44.600> just<00:04:45.600> like

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
a harmonic like something like just like

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.740 
a harmonic like something like just like
I'm<00:04:47.280> not<00:04:47.550> sure<00:04:47.729> which<00:04:47.850> harmonics<00:04:48.330> are<00:04:48.479> because

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
I'm not sure which harmonics are because

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.590 
I'm not sure which harmonics are because
i<00:04:49.020> know<00:04:49.500> for<00:04:49.710> jockey<00:04:50.040> but<00:04:50.310> like<00:04:50.490> it's<00:04:51.389> just

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
i know for jockey but like it's just

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.659 
i know for jockey but like it's just
basically<00:04:52.020> not<00:04:52.320> pressing<00:04:52.830> down<00:04:53.010> and<00:04:53.280> out<00:04:53.370> like

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
five on the toilet like 15 on the g

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.510 
five on the toilet like 15 on the g
string<00:04:56.720> like<00:04:57.720> if<00:04:57.990> like<00:04:58.800> what<00:04:58.979> it<00:04:59.070> is<00:04:59.190> is<00:04:59.430> you
