00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
be like a vlog or maybe even more of my

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.700 
be like a vlog or maybe even more of my
June<00:00:36.180> 3<00:00:36.480> playthrough<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.050> like<00:00:37.290> two<00:00:37.559> hundred

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
June 3 playthrough that like two hundred

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.760 
June 3 playthrough that like two hundred
of<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.040> watched<00:00:38.899> but<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.110> will<00:00:40.260> definitely<00:00:40.469> be

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
of you watched but I will definitely be

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.440 
of you watched but I will definitely be
doing<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.040> video<00:00:41.160> every<00:00:41.309> day<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:41.850> anyway<00:00:42.059> we're

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
doing a video every day but anyway we're

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.880 
doing a video every day but anyway we're
gonna<00:00:42.540> get<00:00:42.780> right<00:00:43.110> into<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.500> outtie

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
gonna get right into this outtie

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.799 
gonna get right into this outtie
so<00:00:44.219> it's<00:00:44.460> got<00:00:44.610> four-wheel<00:00:44.879> drive<00:00:45.270> which<00:00:45.600> means

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
so it's got four-wheel drive which means

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.619 
so it's got four-wheel drive which means
it<00:00:45.930> should<00:00:46.140> be<00:00:46.170> good<00:00:46.440> offroad<00:00:46.770> it's<00:00:47.579> it's<00:00:48.239> okay

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
it should be good offroad it's it's okay

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.319 
it should be good offroad it's it's okay
offroad<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.289> mean<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:50.070> way<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:50.460> split<00:00:51.000> is

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
offroad I mean the way it's split is

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.380 
offroad I mean the way it's split is
like<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.899> torque<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.410> like<00:00:52.969> 85/15<00:00:54.000> towards<00:00:54.300> in

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
like the torque is like 85/15 towards in

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.689 
like the torque is like 85/15 towards in
the<00:00:54.449> rear<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.800> mean<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.070> can<00:00:56.190> do<00:00:56.280> burnouts

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
the rear so I mean you can do burnouts

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.889 
the rear so I mean you can do burnouts
in<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.329> should<00:00:57.480> be<00:00:57.570> able<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.809> do<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
in this you should be able to do a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.010 
in this you should be able to do a
burnout<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.559> four-wheel<00:00:58.890> drive<00:00:59.190> car<00:00:59.520> so

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
burnout in a four-wheel drive car so

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.750 
burnout in a four-wheel drive car so
it's<00:01:01.020> not<00:01:01.170> great<00:01:01.530> offroad<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.370> mean<00:01:02.670> this

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
it's not great offroad I mean this

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.830 
it's not great offroad I mean this
thing's<00:01:03.000> got<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.650> 5.2<00:01:04.650> liter<00:01:04.680> v10<00:01:05.430> engine<00:01:05.840> 560

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
the T right as far performs goes it's

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.980 
the T right as far performs goes it's
really<00:01:20.700> nice<00:01:20.850> on<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.180> road<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.659> handles

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
really nice on the road it handles

just got out of the upgrade garage this
thing<00:02:14.519> is<00:02:14.610> an<00:02:14.760> r1<00:02:15.420> mode<00:02:15.780> now<00:02:16.050> it's<00:02:16.290> got<00:02:16.440> over

800<00:02:17.250> horsepower<00:02:17.810> it's<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:18.959> beast<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.980> upgrade

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
800 horsepower it's a beast you upgrade

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.800 
800 horsepower it's a beast you upgrade
everything<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.940> can<00:02:21.060> upgrade<00:02:21.180> being

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
everything you can upgrade being

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.840 
everything you can upgrade being
turbocharged<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.680> engine<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.190> can<00:02:23.340> put<00:02:23.550> some

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
turbocharged the engine you can put some

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.370 
turbocharged the engine you can put some
fours<00:02:24.330> of<00:02:24.540> things<00:02:24.750> on<00:02:24.930> there<00:02:25.110> but<00:02:25.290> it

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
fours of things on there but it

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.770 
fours of things on there but it
decreases<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.890> top<00:02:26.160> speed<00:02:26.519> and<00:02:26.790> basically

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
decreases the top speed and basically

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.229 
decreases the top speed and basically
when<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.110> upgrade<00:02:28.350> this<00:02:28.709> car<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.430> turns<00:02:30.030> it

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
when you upgrade this car it turns it

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.039 
when you upgrade this car it turns it
into<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:31.080> plane<00:02:31.700> similar<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.480> effects<00:02:33.780> that

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
into a plane similar to the effects that

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.680 
into a plane similar to the effects that
the<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.970> Lamborghini<00:02:35.970> had<00:02:36.239> if<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.450> missed

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
car I recommend going slow and staying

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.150 
car I recommend going slow and staying
on<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.840> road<00:03:03.959> because<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.320> will<00:03:04.530> fly<00:03:04.799> and

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
on the road because you will fly and

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.250 
on the road because you will fly and
it's<00:03:05.700> terrifying<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.299> mean<00:03:06.810> this<00:03:06.900> thing<00:03:07.110> weighs

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.440 
it's terrifying I mean this thing weighs
like<00:03:07.290> 3000<00:03:08.040> pounds<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.670> it's<00:03:08.850> got<00:03:08.970> 800

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
like 3000 pounds and it's got 800

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.110
