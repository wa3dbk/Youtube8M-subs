00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.830
 as we have seen in the videos 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.800
 previous tutorials related to 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.950
 wake on lan what we have to do is 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.470
 find out the mch of the remote computer that 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.689
 we want to wake up well we are going to 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.820
 see it both on a windows system as 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.670
 in a linux system how to get the mac 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.040
 of the team 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.220
 well imagine that we are in the team 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.290
 In this case, remote is valid in an 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.250
 windows as we find out the brand 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.890
 so very simple there are different ways 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.260
 one of them is to go to the little drawing 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.750
 that we have down to the right of the network 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.230
 of the two computers we click with 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.230
 the secondary button 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.480
 we select the state option 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.480
 and we click on the support tab 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.119
 and then we click on the button 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.119
 details 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:14.540
 and here in the address section 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.730
 physical we have the mac address of the 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.460
 computer in this case the network card 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:22.970
 that we are going to use to awaken this 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.470
 computer in agreement this would be one of 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.020
 the ways to get the 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.219
 mac address 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.579
 or physical address of the network card 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:35.110
 another which would be going to close 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.840
 we close 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.820
 we would go to a symbol of the system 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.280
 we click on command prompt and if 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.520
 we do not have it here we go to all 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.329
 programs 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.329
 accessories 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.210
 and system symbol 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:02.680
 and type the ipconfig command 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.700
 bar space 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.700
 press enter 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.869
 and what we have to look for is in this 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.869
 case 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.890
 here we have it physical address in this 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:21.439
 case be careful if you have several 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.769
 network cards is worth because you will have to 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:26.269
 look for the card that in this case is 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.879
 we are using to awaken the 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:33.079
 computer ok in this case we have a 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:36.560
 as it is 80% of the time and there 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:37.849
 You see here we have physical address of 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.950
 agreement what we would do would be 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:45.019
 point that mac to then use it 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.030
 it then this would be the other way 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.170
 we could use from an environment 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.599
 windows 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.580
 ok now let's see how we could 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.610
 do it in an easy way from a 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.190
 linux system 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.490
 well in this case we are going to use 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.860
 this machine that has installed 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.040
 devia and let's see how we could 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.040
 do 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.280
 just as we have done in the 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.769
 environment windows we are going to do in the 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.410
 vial system that is going to see 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.440
 first a graphic way and then a 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:26.280
 way in command mode it comes in way 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.450
 graphic a simple method would be open 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.450
 the applications menu 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:37.910
 System tools 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.910
 and we select network tools 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.019
 then in this window that simply 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.480
 has a series of utilities 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.690
 related to 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.220
 with the world of networks ' we have to 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.930
 appears on this tab first 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.989
 devices and the different 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.190
 network devices or cards us 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.459
 what we have to do is simply 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.739
 open this list and select the 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:06.390
 network card that we are using in 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:09.900
 this case the etea h3 we click 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:13.050
 and set down here address hardware 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.200
 the one that appears here the one that I am 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.200
 pointing right now is the mac this 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.390
 Terre card worth this would be the one 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.270
 we should use if we are going to 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:27.180
 wake up this computer in agreement 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.030
 from another from another team well 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.390
 we would sign it and we could already 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.680
 use from the other computer to 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:38.130
 wake up this we are seeing now 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:42.720
 same here agree well let's see another 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:47.450
 way of power in this case get the 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.450
 I love it well let's go out 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.979
 with tools and go out 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.220
 and in this case what we are going to do 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:58.950
 now it's in command mode so what 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:01.689
 we have to do is go to accessories 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:05.240
 inside the main menu 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:09.620
 and then click on terminal 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:13.630
 and now just type the command and 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:18.289
 efe config space 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:21.229
 today trust dry we press intro 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:24.830
 and in this case gives us an error because 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:26.500
 we are like as users therefore 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:31.890
 we will enter 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.890
 We type room's password 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.660
 we go back to typing the command and 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.880
 efe 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.580
 press enter 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.440
 and fix it appears the name of the 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:49.240
 network card as we saw before the etea 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:52.420
 h3 in a linux system and fix this 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.670
 that we have here is the mac address of 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.260
 the network card the same as we have 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:06:00.020
 seen before graphically 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.210
 okay then well 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.150
 in this way in this video tutorial 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.639
 we have seen how to obtain the brand of 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.650
 remote computer where we would have 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:12.169
 simply that you start the system so much 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:16.069
 windows or linux and then being in the 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:18.830
 system get the mac address or well 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:22.009
 graphically or in command mode 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:24.590
 As we have done, we would point it out in 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:26.990
 a piece of paper and in this way the 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.930
 we could use to wake up 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.569
 these computers as we will see in the 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:35.599
 Next tutorial video is worth 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:38.470
 here we have finished agreement come 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:38.470
 see you later
