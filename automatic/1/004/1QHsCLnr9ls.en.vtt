00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.630 
think that they may if he makes the team
and<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.440> think<00:02:33.590> it's<00:02:33.680> 5050<00:02:34.190> that<00:02:34.280> he<00:02:34.340> makes<00:02:34.489> the

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
and I think it's 5050 that he makes the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.790 
and I think it's 5050 that he makes the
team<00:02:34.850> they<00:02:35.420> may<00:02:35.450> try<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:35.900> find<00:02:36.170> a<00:02:36.260> situation

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800

where there are some place drawn up for
him<00:02:38.360> I<00:02:38.540> think<00:02:38.930> it<00:02:39.019> got<00:02:39.140> like<00:02:39.319> Carol<00:02:39.709> and

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830

going<00:02:48.410> to<00:02:48.470> do<00:02:48.650> I<00:02:48.860> think<00:02:49.220> it's<00:02:49.459> that<00:02:49.519> kind<00:02:50.000> of

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
going to do I think it's that kind of

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.340 
going to do I think it's that kind of
thinking<00:02:50.360> it's<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.690> sort<00:02:50.900> of<00:02:50.930> thing<00:02:50.989> you<00:02:51.170> can

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
thinking it's the sort of thing you can

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.900 
thinking it's the sort of thing you can
do<00:02:51.560> when<00:02:52.100> you<00:02:52.220> have<00:02:52.370> a<00:02:52.400> team<00:02:52.459> like<00:02:52.760> the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
do when you have a team like the

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.789 
do when you have a team like the
Seahawks<00:02:53.239> as<00:02:53.420> elite<00:02:53.720> as<00:02:53.750> they<00:02:53.989> are<00:02:54.170> you<00:02:54.650> can

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
Seahawks as elite as they are you can

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.350 
Seahawks as elite as they are you can
take<00:02:54.920> a<00:02:54.950> flyer<00:02:55.250> on<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:55.459> guy<00:02:55.670> which<00:02:56.000> i<00:02:56.120> think<00:02:56.180> is

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
take a flyer on a guy which i think is

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.910 
take a flyer on a guy which i think is
all<00:02:56.540> they've<00:02:56.690> done<00:02:56.720> here<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:57.319> if<00:02:57.650> it<00:02:57.739> works

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
all they've done here and if it works

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.250 
all they've done here and if it works
out<00:02:58.130> all<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.430> better<00:02:58.670> if<00:02:58.760> not<00:02:59.140> didn't<00:03:00.140> cost

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
out all the better if not didn't cost

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.259 
out all the better if not didn't cost
you<00:03:00.410> thing<00:03:00.620> yeah<00:03:00.920> you<00:03:01.400> risk<00:03:01.610> a<00:03:01.730> guy<00:03:01.880> that<00:03:02.090> may

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
you thing yeah you risk a guy that may

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:03.550 
you thing yeah you risk a guy that may
not<00:03:02.450> have<00:03:02.569> made<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.840> roster<00:03:02.989> anyway<00:03:03.530> a

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
but you know we talked about potential

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.910 
but you know we talked about potential
plays<00:03:08.750> form<00:03:09.049> where<00:03:09.230> we've<00:03:09.380> seen<00:03:09.620> you<00:03:09.890> know

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
plays form where we've seen you know

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.710

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
they throw the ball to Sidney Rice who

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.120 
they throw the ball to Sidney Rice who
then<00:03:11.870> becomes<00:03:12.200> a<00:03:12.260> quarterback<00:03:12.650> throws<00:03:12.980> the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.190 
then becomes a quarterback throws the
ball<00:03:13.280> Golden<00:03:14.090> Tate<00:03:14.269> or<00:03:14.330> Marshawn<00:03:14.810> Lynch<00:03:15.019> we've

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
ball Golden Tate or Marshawn Lynch we've

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.319 
ball Golden Tate or Marshawn Lynch we've
seen<00:03:15.410> that<00:03:15.560> play<00:03:15.820> I'd<00:03:16.820> like<00:03:17.060> him<00:03:17.180> in<00:03:17.299> that

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
seen that play I'd like him in that

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:18.910 
seen that play I'd like him in that
sense<00:03:17.690> touching<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.230> ball<00:03:18.350> and<00:03:18.560> throwing<00:03:18.859> the

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
sense touching the ball and throwing the

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.800 
sense touching the ball and throwing the
ball<00:03:19.100> I<00:03:19.310> don't<00:03:19.640> see<00:03:19.850> him<00:03:20.000> ever<00:03:20.180> taking<00:03:20.540> a<00:03:20.600> snap

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
ball I don't see him ever taking a snap

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.270 
ball I don't see him ever taking a snap
as<00:03:20.989> a<00:03:21.019> quarterback<00:03:21.380> when<00:03:21.650> Russell<00:03:21.980> Wilson's

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
as a quarterback when Russell Wilson's

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.250 
as a quarterback when Russell Wilson's
healthy<00:03:22.609> so<00:03:23.060> that<00:03:23.359> again<00:03:23.840> leads<00:03:24.049> to<00:03:24.140> the

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
healthy so that again leads to the

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.780 
healthy so that again leads to the
ultimate<00:03:24.560> question<00:03:24.590> and<00:03:25.010> how<00:03:25.100> he's<00:03:25.280> used<00:03:25.549> I

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
ultimate question and how he's used I

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.460 
ultimate question and how he's used I
think<00:03:26.030> he<00:03:26.090> becomes<00:03:26.390> a<00:03:26.480> specialty<00:03:26.840> guy<00:03:27.049> we'll

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
think he becomes a specialty guy we'll

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.680 
think he becomes a specialty guy we'll
see
