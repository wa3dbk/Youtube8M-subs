00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
headphones in a way that would appeal to

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.560 
headphones in a way that would appeal to
most<00:03:33.769> regular<00:03:34.519> music<00:03:34.880> listeners<00:03:35.329> out<00:03:35.510> there

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
notice is that it offered a sort of

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.490 
notice is that it offered a sort of
360-degree<00:03:40.910> feeling<00:03:41.360> soundstage<00:03:41.989> which<00:03:42.350> is

always<00:03:42.650> great<00:03:42.890> and<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.430> sound<00:03:43.700> as<00:03:43.910> a<00:03:43.940> whole

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
always great and the sound as a whole

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.690 
always great and the sound as a whole
was<00:03:44.540> very<00:03:44.900> clear<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.530> mids<00:03:45.799> and<00:03:45.980> highs<00:03:46.070> seem

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
was very clear the mids and highs seem

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.640 
was very clear the mids and highs seem
relatively<00:03:47.239> balanced<00:03:47.870> together<00:03:48.140> but<00:03:48.500> the
