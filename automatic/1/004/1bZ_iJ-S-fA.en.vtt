00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:03.959
 especially after the unexpected defeat against the om 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.480
 the malawi team so we need six points 

00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:11.239
 eq so we gained three outlets 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:13.499
 against mans said 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:16.499
 today we had to constrain 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:20.970
 against the angola team who were paying so organizers 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.090
 I had to save time I think we gave the maximum in the first 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.599
 half time 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.919
 actually I think you have complicated 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.919
 we learn at the half-time that mali led 2 goals to 0 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.730
 we managed 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.000
 for opera because of course I think it's playing conditions have 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 also rejected difficult today but a lot of things 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.160
 humidity 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.809
 and I think we have 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.560
 in all six years 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.150
 of 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.630
 then you have to like to score and so in budgets 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.040
 to give more sitting 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.340
 defensive 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.990
 koh-lanta guy mettan because he in the city center a lot of risk 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.630
 we will speed up the game 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.980
 we wanted at all costs but in the second half and I think that even 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.520
 players later tomorrow m 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.990
 they wanted to handle the game 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.200
 and I think that the essential 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.850
 I think we come from far away sincerely 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.200
 we come back from far away because without pain 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.270
 difficult and even on tuesday 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.310
 it must be said but it is also of attacks go to the quarterfinals 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.840
 it's a great team 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.160
 but that's football I think we go by recommending there 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.440
 in this course also for ol even if the mali is not bad but it 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.870
 remains very practical 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.870
 I do not do calculations that night I think part of the moment 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.630
 we are already qualified whatever the city 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.640
 whatever the opponent 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.640
 she because our goal I have been seized from the beginning 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.240
 we will try to manage their disease roger age match by match 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.850
 danke 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.850
 harmony by bringing together a match of equipment being improved 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.040
 so to demonstrate it to 1 I think the last two games especially she 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.729
 came 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.679
 a potential so both physically on the tactical level it's good 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.090
 of mentality 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.400
 and I think it does not please very well so for now this can 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.000
 also for the world cup 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.200
 I think we are on the right track and the more we can not see how 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.900
 better and still does not lose his child no matter who the opponent 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.460
 first concerning the production of my team I think 100 million 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.929
 Match match 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:23.579
 there is in particular in the conservation of the ball round point actions 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.359
 also offensive 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:28.259
 kill the time we're on the right track we have to continue to 

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:31.389
 actually work the still lack of efficiency before 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:32.649
 at the club 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:35.359
 but that's football because also the playing conditions are 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.679
 difficult as well for the single goal post for example angola 

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:40.899
 she was 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:42.849
 the monthly amount of first match 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.409
 in their eyes a lot follows the team was very well prepared clinton and 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.569
 a lot of energy in the game today was a little bit more about them 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:51.579
 so physically 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.379
 in any case in the country we talked about it 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.930
 we could coordinate ourselves and I think we felt his 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:57.969
 forearm 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.969
 now we always smile this lack of efficiency 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.939
 so we know it and it's by working in the premises for a year in 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.199
 concordance 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:16.509
 we have enjoyed everywhere we liked a lot in Algeria another 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:20.429
 grievance bubble bobble problem we played very well behaved 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:25.719
 we have a good opportunity of naples by guillemette do not have 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:30.529
 materialized rates fly away leotard the Peugeot 308 adults with the 

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:33.709
 unhappy they stop it is obvious that for his passion his love 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.429
 the agreement - algeria we are in the search after the propensity can 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:42.259
 not take risks not because that goal is going to be big risk I think it's not 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:44.819
 not good for the public those who would like to attend in the house 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.149
 of a preparatory class but for the sake of football even bÃ©rubÃ© had acted 

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:52.789
 in this way we like they do not have a lot of collectors go 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:55.889
 again we qualified and we did what was 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.759
 practically our obligation to qualify ourselves and secondly we have 

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:02.029
 avoid 

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:06.479
 she we now play it why the kid's haven settlement 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:10.549
 to the small size of the nfl no doubt that saddam hussein that time would be 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:11.849
 I'm worth 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.829
 the program starts now as you will have the time we want 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.409
 but what we want for the section of love love this lady to the 

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:23.109
 masonry but only before the next big free concert 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.330
 this year still over so that we can go to the final the same 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.930
 period last year canada do not start now after doing 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.410
 the object of several facets of the coast obligations the record is 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.700
 currently the only argument a young at the maximum then we will have to play 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.450
 our tottenham ottoman football are not comparable we will be when I have 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.170
 still places 6 months previous regardless of the search engine of 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.670
 google not to start again 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.280
