00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
symbol a little disappointing that they

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.750 
symbol a little disappointing that they
didn't<00:01:13.950> go<00:01:14.070> sort<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.490> more<00:01:14.610> traditional

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
didn't go sort of the more traditional

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.899 
didn't go sort of the more traditional
look<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:16.500> see<00:01:16.740> why<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.790> will

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
look but I can see why this will

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.499 
look but I can see why this will
probably<00:01:18.060> be<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.299> favorite<00:01:18.720> or<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:20.119> lot<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.150> can

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
probably be a favorite or a lot of can

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.030 
probably be a favorite or a lot of can
of<00:01:21.630> spray<00:01:21.840> paints<00:01:22.259> because<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.799> will<00:01:22.890> get

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
of spray paints because it will get

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.640 
of spray paints because it will get
probably<00:01:23.670> repainted<00:01:24.330> or<00:01:24.390> redone<00:01:24.750> quite<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> lot

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
probably repainted or redone quite a lot

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.800 
probably repainted or redone quite a lot
of<00:01:25.740> enthusiasts<00:01:26.280> out<00:01:26.369> there<00:01:26.430> who<00:01:27.180> can't

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
of enthusiasts out there who can't

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.660 
of enthusiasts out there who can't
