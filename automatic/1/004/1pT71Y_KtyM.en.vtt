think was against Armenia he scored a

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.429 
think was against Armenia he scored a
goal<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.030> was<00:01:30.150> one<00:01:30.270> although<00:01:30.450> our<00:01:31.170> but<00:01:31.380> he

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
goal and it was one although our but he

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.170 
goal and it was one although our but he
did<00:01:31.590> score<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.860> goal<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.310> did<00:01:32.520> kick<00:01:32.729> off<00:01:32.880> he's<00:01:33.030> an

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
did score a goal so did kick off he's an

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.260 
did score a goal so did kick off he's an
international<00:01:33.509> scoring<00:01:34.229> career<00:01:34.970> so<00:01:35.970> overall

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
international scoring career so overall

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.450 
international scoring career so overall
I<00:01:36.299> think<00:01:36.509> PA<00:01:36.990> has<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> wonderful<00:01:38.040> potential<00:01:38.250> in

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
I think PA has a wonderful potential in

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.249 
I think PA has a wonderful potential in
fifa<00:01:38.729> 14<00:01:38.939> year<00:01:39.240> decent<00:01:39.659> potential<00:01:40.020> as<00:01:40.110> well

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
fifa 14 year decent potential as well

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.380 
fifa 14 year decent potential as well
but<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.500> fifa15<00:01:40.920> i<00:01:41.280> think<00:01:41.700> i'll<00:01:41.759> rise<00:01:42.000> even

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
but in fifa15 i think i'll rise even

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.700 
but in fifa15 i think i'll rise even
higher<00:01:42.420> seeing<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.960> seeing<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.470> he<00:01:43.560> has<00:01:43.680> I

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
higher seeing the seeing that he has I

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.679 
higher seeing the seeing that he has I
sorry<00:01:44.040> cracked<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.850> first<00:01:45.060> time<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.450> Bayern

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
sorry cracked the first time of Bayern

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.660 
sorry cracked the first time of Bayern
Munich<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.200> its<00:01:46.680> are<00:01:46.799> playing<00:01:47.040> there<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.310> guess

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
Munich and its are playing there I guess

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.270 
Munich and its are playing there I guess
consistently<00:01:48.500> so<00:01:49.500> then<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.740> could<00:01:49.920> expect

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
consistently so then you could expect

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.340 
consistently so then you could expect
his<00:01:50.430> potential<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:51.420> be<00:01:51.509> almost<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.170> high

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
his potential to be almost in the high

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.460 
his potential to be almost in the high
80s<00:01:52.770> if<00:01:52.860> not<00:01:53.009> mid<00:01:53.189> 80s<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.759> think<00:01:54.270> his<00:01:54.930> base<00:01:55.140> card

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
80s if not mid 80s I think his base card

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.560 
80s if not mid 80s I think his base card
will<00:01:55.590> be<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.710> silver<00:01:56.040> waiting<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:56.700> from<00:01:56.939> 65<00:01:57.540> to

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
will be a silver waiting so from 65 to

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.530 
will be a silver waiting so from 65 to
74<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:59.340> maybe<00:01:59.549> like<00:01:59.729> early<00:02:00.030> seventies<00:02:00.390> never

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
74 so maybe like early seventies never

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.090 
74 so maybe like early seventies never
like<00:02:00.659> 70<00:02:01.020> or<00:02:01.079> maybe<00:02:01.229> 69<00:02:01.710> or<00:02:01.860> something<00:02:02.040> like

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
like 70 or maybe 69 or something like

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.830 
like 70 or maybe 69 or something like
that<00:02:02.159> but<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.880> would<00:02:03.000> definitely<00:02:03.210> be<00:02:03.479> picking

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
that but I would definitely be picking

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.389 
that but I would definitely be picking
