 presentation of our new adventure 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.380
 minecraft lord of the rings who is going 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.799
 be based on version 8 mode 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.719
 points 3 the beta version the version that 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.859
 has added a lot of things 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:23.850
 on the side of the units of the property as well as 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.640
 the roles rhyme so warriors during 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.439
 the inhabitants of the king and I 'm not going 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.949
 play the good side this time like 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.140
 promised way thing thing thing I 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.960
 will play on the side of evil and more 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.590
 especially on the side of the mordor I 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.540
 will actually embody an orc an orc 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.989
 who will have to fill a number 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.399
 of missions that are going to be actually the 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.289
 the victory conditions of this 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.670
 new adventure that will definitely 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.399
 last a little while 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.590
 this fall so the first thing that 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.170
 will have to fill me this is my 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.530
 alignment I'm going to have to wait at 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.090
 less - 500 alignment who what will 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.220
 allow me to actually unlock the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.830
 recruitment challenges for finally 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.630
 unlock the lolo gayet that I'm going 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.720
 have to recruit and I feel that it's going 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.439
 severely pony pony so that's it 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.979
 if recruitment challenge each match 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.900
 to an orc warrior or a troll a 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.939
 hollow gaye or a world 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.470
 knowing that since I play on the side of 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.140
 biting I will not be able to recruit 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.290
 rock waters something else on the side of the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.950
 seller i'm going to have to build a 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.689
 portal of death gÃ¼l to be able to me 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.369
 actually make a portal to lover 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.650
 worlds 2 minecraft come 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.600
 if ever I need it but why 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.799
 this challenge there simply because the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.320
 death gate gul it's something 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.659
 difficult enough to create 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.750
 so that's why we're going to go 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.390
 throw in this challenge there because that's it 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.130
 will give a little challenge 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.259
 another challenging challenge is 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.920
 recovered most of the armor from the game 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.460
 there armor mode so the armor 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.450
 of bronze the armor to do the 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.160
 dwarf walls the armor connects rim the 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.920
 gold armor that obviously or casts and 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.400
 caetera and that I will have to place on 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.959
 say on armories and which you 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.569
 go see it will finally give a 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.000
 nice room with all the armor 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.650
 of the game in probably not the armor of 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.060
 mithril because it's complicated when 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.400
 we are evil players to have armor 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.200
 of mithril but just i will try not 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.890
 so you do not wear the armor and 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.280
 arms 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.500
 so it's going to be quite a challenge enough 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.510
 important is quite difficult especially 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.360
 because I will not be able to kraft 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.190
 and the armor of good so he goes 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.590
 I'll have to kill a number of 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.390
 two good warriors to recover 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.670
 their armor here is simply 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.560
 then the plundering challenges that go a 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.989
 little bit with these challenges 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.560
 armor I'll have to get into 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.209
 the biomes of good and that's this dish a 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.640
 little bit of zizanie you'll see that 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:06.130
 it will be rather nice especially in 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:09.739
 account and and that's what's going on too 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.180
 together with the exploration challenge for 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.340
 discover all the structures of the 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.230
 mordor and the structures of evil then he 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.720
 does not have much there are three it's 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.329
 at the turn of the mordor the encampment orcs the 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.560
 camp uruk and that's it then you 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.480
 go see that anyway me I 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.630
 I'm going to build them the 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.370
 buildings that are missing for for 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.709
 warriors of evil so do not worry 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.799
 no other challenge this time very very 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.410
 long is the challenge of killing the challenge 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:41.090
 massacre who will ask me to kill 25 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:44.060
 mob 25 mom keith exists in this mode of 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.340
 game the lord of the rings so that's it 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.540
 there are all the warriors of good and there 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.670
 some have been added 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.799
 especially the eagle and horrible warrior 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.410
 so it'll be pretty cool 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.000
 discover especially that in addition they have they 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.070
 have changed in terms of spawn that's at 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.549
 say that now the whole king is going to be 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:04.430
 populated by two rim warriors and the 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.680
 oral that go pop and others by the 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.630
 know is rather complicated already that the 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.230
 fashion and not necessarily easy so if in 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.699
 more play gd mobs a little bit 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.380
 everywhere it's going to be complicated and it's 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:17.510
 that's why I'm running this 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.490
 man this seignosse adventure 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.630
 for the bad is that it is really 

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:24.230
 to be complicated that will ask us 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.090
 a lot a lot of 1.2 what he 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.840
 sense that we will say something else to 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.570
 to susten myself 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.410
 yes I will not be able to do it one 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.150
 real farm 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.310
 as usual what am I going to do 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.920
 it's a farm mushroom farm 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.480
 with morgen mushrooms on on 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.370
 mordor land that's the only thing 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.100
 who pushes so you'll see it's going 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.750
 to be nice and finally the biggest 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.600
 challenge i want to say these are the 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.700
 construction challenges without construction 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.590
 massive enough that will ask us for 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.600
 hours and hours of work but who 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.270
 in the end are going to be absolutely crazy I 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.750
 think we'll build bach together 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.530
 adour 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:03.800
 we will build six rites or google 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.020
 the black door the antre darracq nose and the 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.980
 mountain of destiny 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.010
 So here it is to give you a 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.810
 little bit the tone of this adventure 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.820
 lord of the rings on the side of the mordor 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.360
 I think there is a lot of 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.220
 things to do 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.080
 that's why I do not want to actually launch 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:21.650
 an adventure to the lord of the rings on 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.030
 the short run but on the mordor and 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.300
 maybe in the future we will do something else 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.800
 thing 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.180
 so here I hope you like it 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.190
