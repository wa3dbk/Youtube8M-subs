hey<00:00:07.160> guys<00:00:08.139> ok<00:00:09.139> going<00:00:09.469> to<00:00:09.530> introduce<00:00:09.740> you<00:00:09.980> to

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340 
hey guys ok going to introduce you to

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.130 
hey guys ok going to introduce you to
the<00:00:10.610> machine

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:12.140 
the machine

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.640 
the machine
that<00:00:12.620> I<00:00:13.210> have<00:00:14.210> picked<00:00:14.480> up<00:00:14.660> and<00:00:15.320> being

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
that I have picked up and being

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.590 
that I have picked up and being
developing<00:00:16.190> at<00:00:16.280> last<00:00:17.140> year<00:00:18.140> or<00:00:18.260> so<00:00:19.420> okay<00:00:20.420> it

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
developing at last year or so okay it

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.370 
developing at last year or so okay it
start<00:00:20.900> off<00:00:21.020> being<00:00:21.320> a<00:00:21.650> pick<00:00:22.400> and<00:00:22.520> place<00:00:22.730> robot

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
start off being a pick and place robot

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.290 
start off being a pick and place robot
which<00:00:24.380> I<00:00:24.560> picked<00:00:24.770> up<00:00:24.950> a<00:00:25.189> pretty<00:00:26.029> good<00:00:26.150> price

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
which I picked up a pretty good price

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.420 
which I picked up a pretty good price
and<00:00:26.840> I<00:00:28.000> have<00:00:29.000> modified<00:00:29.779> it<00:00:29.990> away<00:00:30.890> from<00:00:31.189> what<00:00:31.340> it

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
and I have modified it away from what it

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
and I have modified it away from what it
was<00:00:31.460> into<00:00:32.450> what<00:00:32.750> it<00:00:32.840> is<00:00:32.870> today<00:00:34.360> stripped<00:00:35.360> it

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
was into what it is today stripped it

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.819 
was into what it is today stripped it
back<00:00:35.600> a<00:00:35.630> bit<00:00:35.750> and<00:00:36.560> this<00:00:37.490> is<00:00:37.670> what<00:00:37.880> you<00:00:38.030> got<00:00:38.210> so

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 
back a bit and this is what you got so

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.889 
back a bit and this is what you got so
we<00:00:39.829> have<00:00:40.010> a<00:00:41.200> x<00:00:42.200> and<00:00:42.410> y<00:00:42.560> axes<00:00:43.040> are<00:00:43.340> driven<00:00:43.700> by

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
we have a x and y axes are driven by

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:47.349 
we have a x and y axes are driven by
direct<00:00:44.899> drive<00:00:45.109> linear<00:00:45.530> motors<00:00:46.059> which<00:00:47.059> have

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:47.359 
direct drive linear motors which have

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.240 
direct drive linear motors which have
pretty<00:00:48.199> damn<00:00:49.090> high<00:00:50.090> speed<00:00:50.570> in<00:00:50.809> them<00:00:50.930> and

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
pretty damn high speed in them and

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.259 
pretty damn high speed in them and
amazing<00:00:52.250> control<00:00:54.010> if<00:00:55.010> you<00:00:55.160> look<00:00:55.309> at<00:00:55.489> the<00:00:55.730> great

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
amazing control if you look at the great

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.020 
amazing control if you look at the great
thing<00:00:56.449> about<00:00:56.539> linear<00:00:57.320> motors<00:00:57.769> is<00:00:58.609> that<00:00:58.879> when

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
thing about linear motors is that when

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.150 
thing about linear motors is that when
it's<00:00:59.179> off<00:00:59.390> I<00:00:59.719> can<00:01:00.679> do<00:01:00.829> this<00:01:02.649> I'll<00:01:03.649> push<00:01:03.890> it<00:01:03.920> by

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
it's off I can do this I'll push it by

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.840 
it's off I can do this I'll push it by
hand<00:01:04.460> i<00:01:04.790> can<00:01:05.740> drag<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:06.950> machine<00:01:07.280> to<00:01:07.430> river<00:01:07.670> i

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
hand i can drag the machine to river i

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.500 
hand i can drag the machine to river i
want<00:01:09.610> except<00:01:10.610> my<00:01:10.790> said<00:01:10.970> of<00:01:11.060> course<00:01:11.240> because

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
want except my said of course because

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.250 
want except my said of course because
that's<00:01:11.690> on<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:11.930> traditional<00:01:12.680> ball<00:01:12.860> screw<00:01:13.160> and

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
that's on the traditional ball screw and

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.789 
that's on the traditional ball screw and
then<00:01:15.670> away<00:01:16.670> i<00:01:16.700> go<00:01:18.430> it's<00:01:19.430> the<00:01:20.290> big<00:01:21.290> machine<00:01:21.439> I've

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
then away i go it's the big machine I've

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.749 
then away i go it's the big machine I've
got<00:01:22.310> a<00:01:22.670> huge<00:01:23.360> bloody<00:01:23.720> machine<00:01:24.110> you<00:01:24.259> could<00:01:24.409> say

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
got a huge bloody machine you could say

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.469 
got a huge bloody machine you could say
now<00:01:26.560> this<00:01:27.560> is<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.159> size<00:01:28.520> table<00:01:28.909> I'm<00:01:29.180> working

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
now this is the size table I'm working

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.450 
now this is the size table I'm working
with<00:01:29.509> that's<00:01:30.259> how<00:01:30.409> big<00:01:30.590> this<00:01:30.710> machine<00:01:31.100> is<00:01:31.250> it's

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
with that's how big this machine is it's

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.940 
with that's how big this machine is it's
a<00:01:31.549> 600<00:01:32.680> wide<00:01:33.680> by<00:01:34.040> about<00:01:34.070> a<00:01:34.310> meter<00:01:34.880> long<00:01:34.970> table

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
a 600 wide by about a meter long table

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.539 
a 600 wide by about a meter long table
I've<00:01:36.950> just<00:01:36.979> converted<00:01:37.640> that<00:01:37.790> as<00:01:38.000> an<00:01:38.960> old<00:01:39.549> part

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
I've just converted that as an old part

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.100 
I've just converted that as an old part
of<00:01:40.670> a<00:01:40.759> laundry<00:01:41.329> renovation<00:01:41.899> and<00:01:43.299> it's<00:01:44.299> like<00:01:44.509> 11

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
of a laundry renovation and it's like 11

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.649 
of a laundry renovation and it's like 11
of<00:01:45.140> my<00:01:45.229> cuts<00:01:45.619> the<00:01:46.189> bench<00:01:46.399> looks<00:01:47.240> like<00:01:47.420> marble

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
of my cuts the bench looks like marble

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.240 
of my cuts the bench looks like marble
or<00:01:48.649> granite<00:01:48.710> that's<00:01:49.549> just<00:01:49.729> a<00:01:49.820> plastic<00:01:50.149> top<00:01:50.509> and

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
or granite that's just a plastic top and

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.029 
or granite that's just a plastic top and
then<00:01:52.250> I've<00:01:52.640> got<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.590> internals<00:01:54.590> of<00:01:54.860> this

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
then I've got the internals of this

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.240 
then I've got the internals of this
machine<00:01:55.460> which<00:01:55.700> are<00:01:55.909> again<00:01:56.149> even<00:01:57.070> pretty<00:01:58.070> well

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
machine which are again even pretty well

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:05.420 
machine which are again even pretty well
spellbinding<00:02:01.149> so<00:02:02.149> you<00:02:02.240> can<00:02:02.420> see<00:02:02.689> that

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.169 

got<00:02:06.090> some<00:02:06.240> pretty<00:02:06.420> tricky<00:02:06.840> stuff<00:02:07.080> in<00:02:07.230> there<00:02:08.179> we

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
got some pretty tricky stuff in there we

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.590 
got some pretty tricky stuff in there we
have<00:02:10.370> and<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.460> fair<00:02:11.640> bit<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.790> rewriting<00:02:12.210> is<00:02:12.450> my

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
have and a fair bit of rewriting is my

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:21.970 
have and a fair bit of rewriting is my
smooth<00:02:12.900> stepper<00:02:14.210> freaking<00:02:15.210> away

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.820 

beautiful<00:02:22.909> little<00:02:23.110> bit<00:02:24.110> of<00:02:24.230> hardware<00:02:24.530> that

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
beautiful little bit of hardware that

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.820 
beautiful little bit of hardware that
it's<00:02:25.400> done<00:02:25.640> me<00:02:25.879> a<00:02:25.909> treat<00:02:26.420> there's<00:02:27.140> my<00:02:27.500> digi

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
it's done me a treat there's my digi

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.570 
it's done me a treat there's my digi
speed<00:02:28.220> which<00:02:28.610> is<00:02:28.640> yet<00:02:28.970> to<00:02:29.120> be<00:02:29.150> connected<00:02:29.510> and

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
speed which is yet to be connected and

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.070 
speed which is yet to be connected and
hopefully<00:02:31.580> soon<00:02:31.940> that's<00:02:32.480> all<00:02:32.690> going<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:32.930> be

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
hopefully soon that's all going to be

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.040 
hopefully soon that's all going to be
fired<00:02:33.709> up

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.460 

so<00:02:37.680> I've<00:02:37.920> got<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.840> pc<00:02:41.570> pc<00:02:42.570> box<00:02:42.960> and<00:02:43.260> down<00:02:43.380> the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
so I've got the pc pc box and down the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:50.660 
so I've got the pc pc box and down the
bottom<00:02:43.710> there<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:46.220> so<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:49.380> enable<00:02:49.800> it<00:02:49.890> drive

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
bottom there and so to enable it drive

00:02:50.670 --> 00:03:00.550 
bottom there and so to enable it drive
an<00:02:50.880> able<00:02:53.960> machines<00:02:54.960> on<00:02:57.470> everything<00:02:58.470> is<00:02:58.590> now

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
an able machines on everything is now

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:29.610 
an able machines on everything is now
pretty<00:03:01.560> well<00:03:01.680> solid<00:03:03.860> so<00:03:04.860> far<00:03:04.890> as<00:03:05.280> speed<00:03:05.580> goes

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.080 

I've<00:03:30.620> got<00:03:30.829> it<00:03:30.920> running<00:03:31.159> at<00:03:31.250> this<00:03:31.370> speed<00:03:31.670> mainly

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
I've got it running at this speed mainly

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.740 
I've got it running at this speed mainly
because<00:03:32.769> it<00:03:33.769> can<00:03:34.040> go<00:03:34.280> probably<00:03:35.120> four<00:03:35.450> times

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
because it can go probably four times

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.899 
because it can go probably four times
