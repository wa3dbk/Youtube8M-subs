gonna be interesting to see if this

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.850 
gonna be interesting to see if this

back and start going back towards the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.900 
back and start going back towards the
gun<00:02:54.050> licensing<00:02:54.590> but<00:02:55.160> this<00:02:55.280> what<00:02:55.700> does<00:02:55.790> this

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
gun licensing but this what does this

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.370 
gun licensing but this what does this
actually<00:02:56.030> mean<00:02:56.210> for<00:02:56.450> battlefield<00:02:56.870> well<00:02:57.080> it

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
actually mean for battlefield well it

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.770 
actually mean for battlefield well it
could<00:02:57.890> mean<00:02:58.070> two<00:02:58.280> things<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:58.700> could<00:02:59.600> not

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
could mean two things it could not

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.630 
could mean two things it could not
affect<00:03:00.050> the<00:03:00.140> game<00:03:00.290> at<00:03:00.410> all<00:03:00.560> but<00:03:01.190> my<00:03:01.400> guess<00:03:01.460> is

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
affect the game at all but my guess is

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.310 
affect the game at all but my guess is
that<00:03:01.760> it's<00:03:02.000> actually<00:03:02.300> going<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.660> allow<00:03:02.930> for

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
that it's actually going to allow for

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.050 
that it's actually going to allow for
the<00:03:03.380> game<00:03:03.560> to<00:03:03.650> have<00:03:03.740> more<00:03:03.950> guns<00:03:04.220> because<00:03:04.790> in

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
the game to have more guns because in

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.540 
the game to have more guns because in
the<00:03:05.540> past<00:03:05.720> I<00:03:05.990> would<00:03:06.140> imagine<00:03:06.350> that<00:03:06.590> developing

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
the past I would imagine that developing

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.250 
the past I would imagine that developing
something<00:03:07.730> like<00:03:07.910> battlefield<00:03:08.360> 3<00:03:08.660> they<00:03:09.140> have

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
something like battlefield 3 they have

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.830 
something like battlefield 3 they have
to<00:03:09.380> pay<00:03:09.590> a<00:03:09.860> licensing<00:03:10.580> fee<00:03:10.820> for<00:03:11.120> each<00:03:11.210> gun<00:03:11.600> that

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
to pay a licensing fee for each gun that

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.750 
to pay a licensing fee for each gun that
they<00:03:11.990> designed<00:03:12.530> for<00:03:12.890> a<00:03:12.920> certain<00:03:13.220> game<00:03:13.430> and<00:03:13.700> if

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
they designed for a certain game and if

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.280 
they designed for a certain game and if
they<00:03:13.850> don't<00:03:13.970> have<00:03:14.209> that<00:03:14.360> licensing<00:03:14.900> fee<00:03:15.110> then

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
they don't have that licensing fee then

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.550 
they don't have that licensing fee then
there's<00:03:15.530> much<00:03:16.370> less<00:03:16.700> price<00:03:17.480> overhead<00:03:17.989> for

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
there's much less price overhead for

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.930 
there's much less price overhead for
designing<00:03:18.920> weapons<00:03:19.130> they<00:03:19.370> don't<00:03:19.520> have<00:03:19.640> to<00:03:19.760> pay

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
designing weapons they don't have to pay

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.699 
designing weapons they don't have to pay
