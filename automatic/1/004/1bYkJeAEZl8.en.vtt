00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
with all this stuff this is certainly

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.720 
with all this stuff this is certainly
much<00:00:50.270> wider<00:00:50.660> than<00:00:51.020> most<00:00:51.260> desks<00:00:52.130> would<00:00:52.430> be<00:00:52.580> in

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
much wider than most desks would be in

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.190 
much wider than most desks would be in
Japan<00:00:53.030> but<00:00:53.210> it's<00:00:53.390> a<00:00:53.480> pretty<00:00:53.660> standard

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
Japan but it's a pretty standard

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.440 
Japan but it's a pretty standard
especially<00:00:55.160> for<00:00:55.340> a<00:00:55.370> first<00:00:55.670> grader<00:00:56.090> to<00:00:56.210> have

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
especially for a first grader to have

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.630 
especially for a first grader to have
this<00:00:56.600> kind<00:00:56.810> of<00:00:56.930> a<00:00:57.020> desk<00:00:57.290> with<00:00:57.680> these<00:00:58.280> things

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
this kind of a desk with these things

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.640 
this kind of a desk with these things
here<00:00:59.000> you<00:00:59.120> can<00:00:59.270> see<00:00:59.450> this<00:00:59.570> is<00:00:59.720> the<00:00:59.750> schedule<00:01:00.440> in
