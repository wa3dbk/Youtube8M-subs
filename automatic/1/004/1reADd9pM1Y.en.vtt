 so tall 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.050
 yes that's the culture of Karajan versus Exten 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.249
 his songs to the system 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:13.249
 Verdi has started the navigation we see already 

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:16.410
 Windows based system 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.400
 he moves in the 6th 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.400
 Artist or 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:28.449
 there it is 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.790
 Weltbild de Ltd review of the 7 inch touch screen has ensured us navigation 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:34.690
 the zew index 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.630
 Map material for Europe 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.030
 the forms in which one could not continue to test fast search enter 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.640
 TMC professionals here 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.340
 come now 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.309
 up down 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:50.680
 you are hiding 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.280
 written 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.739
 so come here 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.400
 of course now 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.070
 places of interest to let ads environment must Amy Sparkasse Post 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.150
 the forum 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.150
 Workshops petrol stations 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.930
 that's more than you've ever heard of that before 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.800
 say 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.329
 Practice fee Clooney 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:15.210
 Place that's interesting place you have to live on it 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.990
 we will not tomorrow 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.120
 noticeable third 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.420
 Roche's calculations went quickly 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.220
 at distance 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.220
 estimated time of arrival routes 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.010
 and here we have a 3d 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.970
 If you can put it diagonally you can still move a zoom 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.969
 bigger little bit more 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:40.730
 not good 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.040
 to keep our shape 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.780
 and still really 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.920
 At least the customers would not 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.280
 one is not on 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.500
 they see it fits seamlessly or seamlessly 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.090
 the 4 against Spain 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.990
 Incidentally, the debut also moves the minus here under Settings 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.680
 you can 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.890
 Lighting at always not only brought to 30 Vettel 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.450
 check wool 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.359
 but does not fit so very good woman b 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:13.359
 you have to do it 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.089
 yes, what else do you want to witness 

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:20.460
 School Board praise so closely Europe will come June 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.460
 One has to enter navigation a few days ago 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.619
 The navigation software says the distinctive thing is that you just have to go first and foremost 

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:30.119
 their favor nullified me 

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:33.969
 Lisa's success must also have described some truth or camera camera 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:37.169
 you can turn on the normal and mirror image 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:40.169
 Hartmann out 

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:45.979
 here you can adjust and DDV thick 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:50.209
 not every lack represented 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.980
 so and problems solved Emilia times Radio Lupus CD DVD via SD card USB iPod 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.159
 and so on 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.159
 Frodeno Radio 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.519
 What a surprise the Kamen Israelites 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.739
 two petrovs 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.739
 Can you do something like that I'm starting the best rules again 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:15.489
 and so on after switching off different users create profiles 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.239
 and so on 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.239
 So no great surprise here 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:23.899
 back on Radio Munich 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:27.089
 By the way, you can also do that 

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:30.789
 Completely annihilated, neither a constant spring is required 

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:33.259
 either over the keys 

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:37.269
 or by landing on this little pool and just moving there 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.269
 want to have a sound 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.049
 the wm chances 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.900
 Minutes the draw Lukasz gets all really great with the IPO mainly post 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.679
 the right and taxes 

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:04.729
 that you call 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:07.799
 JCB troupe 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.789
 does it take something he did have an mp3 cd was detected 

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:23.169
 so in the ProTour way the setup went well I'm yes 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.639
 also 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:26.880
 Kluckert strive 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.979
 And so it should stay 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.870
 becomes complicated if it is today acquisitions still Nicoles dictatorships 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.120
 do 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.770
 this serves a third 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.770
 USB I also never connected past correctly 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.080
 iPad I have not connected, namely the ipad control 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.289
 take over 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:51.080
 you can also 1 and 2 I have here too, nothing to say with the recognizes 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.790
 So you do not seem to be shown 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.790
 no appeal connected 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.039
 Hofbauer cut one off 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:05.700
 only succeed 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.900
 that the pirates do not adjust the brightness 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.169
 Here I come back 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.509
 15 kilos of jak which now take again terrifyingly long 

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:18.180
 I am here 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.330
 unfortunately, God 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.150
 faster used 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.539
 Mayer 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:26.819
 hey is here again 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:31.499
 forty percent is so fortunate is always relatively fast hungry and thirsty 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:35.559
 In between, people have a bit longer there 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.960
 after the present stood 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.940
 probably that's about it 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.940
 from Monaco 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.560
 the routes are the same date the time here you can see us citizens 

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:56.020
 hire and call others and thus make a difference 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.689
 actually a miracle by Timo Glock 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:01.689
 from the SD card store and so on top right one can took 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.240
 7m is send the card 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:17.719
 after exactly 30 minutes 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:20.719
 At first, Detlef did not investigate 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.319
 Already now one can accept conversations 

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:26.580
 a second to Baden 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.619
 Percentage schools and promotion screen just do not currently stand up 

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:31.979
 not clear 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:35.610
 more effects should add December programs 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.090
 4 in the districts they come too then we just have to score Â»my life 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:45.189
 Nathan get no signal rear view camera 

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:48.210
 connected and also the parking sensors 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.889
 have no optical output it means 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:53.059
 it would normally fall country 

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:54.439
 and we do not know if 

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:57.149
 and then immediately goes to Duisburg 

00:06:57.149 --> 00:06:59.819
 Eat Marburg 

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:03.680
 Ganley 9 you can not tell them that she's in there 

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:10.899
 So do not turn off 

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:13.719
 so not only the dock 

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:16.719
 and so de 

00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:25.029
 if I forgot something here are running 

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:28.029
 Ehrenhauser waggons 

00:07:28.599 --> 00:07:30.259
 two seconds on button 

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:33.469
 and the best thing is out of the process 

00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:34.869
 Of course I will stay 

00:07:34.869 --> 00:07:35.789
 she sees in the house
