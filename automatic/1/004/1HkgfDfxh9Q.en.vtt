00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.640
 musical good if in fact lopez is that 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.160
 I set aside a little musician style 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.840
 for preparing me in the act of fact 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.760
 I started in 2009 with the show of the 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.340
 dreams where to sing with him paul strauss 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.680
 and thanks to them I was lucky to win and 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.950
 which allowed me to see the picture 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.350
 this rethink what things he wanted to do and 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.509
 is to continue studying good at school 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.970
 of Bernal theater the cultural section that 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.860
 is talents and prepare me because always 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.660
 I was struck by the performance but 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.369
 without leaving aside the music and for me 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.660
 good luck the first works that 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.240
 I started doing parallel in my 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.900
 formation were musical first I made 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.020
 rehn 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.940
 I did it carmine and then seeing that it was 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.100
 jersey that in one way or another is what 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.360
 allowed me to show a lot 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.360
 larger 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.440
 for me 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.630
 we will see 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.070
 I first had a band of Esperanto 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.070
 which also have dabbled and lime 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.350
 then with other friends through another 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.360
 band that is a good wood and then 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.700
 because of personal problems I had to 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.620
 leaving is when the wooden group 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.260
 you share this scenario is with Sandra 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.140
 muente is with sandra with sandrita se 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.490
 avoid good until recently the year 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.560
 last December we took a workshop 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:16.170
 with a prelude and is a super singer and 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.020
 we have a very nice friendship and how is it 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.220
 the relationship with your parents or as your 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.660
 parents received you this was accurate there 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.790
 many parents who sometimes see the art 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.450
 that propens does not give you much money 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.460
 here in the country not good what happens is 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.930
 that in one way or another I have always 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.240
 had some independence is from boy 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.940
 then of course perhaps they were worried about 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.160
 little how was I going to hold on 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.850
 economically but at the end of accounts 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.220
 have realized that 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.780
 that it becomes sustainable to the 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.450
 as long as you take it seriously 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.790
 then one way or another also with 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.170
 a little luck is luck for me 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.810
 be at the right time in the place 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.280
 indicated to look for fabrics like good Creole 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.069
 I would say this one 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.200
 you find it beneficial how is the 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.060
 experience with holidays in greece is 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.950
 the first time you record a miniseries 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.520
 good if the first production of the 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.480
 TV 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.040
 in fact the annual exam the most 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.280
 missions much maximum criterion I what 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.690
 I love a lot and in fact I learned 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.910
 a lot of things like I told you a 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.830
 while each work experience is part 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.900
 of a process in which you learn many 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.850
 things is totally different being theater 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.140
 of energy is another time in us 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:32.540
 It is totally different but very beautiful 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.730
 a stronger joy still to know 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.250
 that in Bolivia this series is a success 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.080
 imagine who would think that the 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.290
 three years there is an image in all three 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.319
 years that I have been dedicating this without sin 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.790
 stop this was going to be part one 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.319
 so cool production a vacation in 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.940
 greece and that make an immersive success 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.240
 abroad and 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.400
 wow or maybe I still do not finish 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.820
 assimilate the whole thing because thanks to 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.560
 God I still have a lot of work and many 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.030
 iva and giving giving giving him but the 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.010
 just made sure it was a success 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.500
 It fills me with great joy and I 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.970
 that everyone is waiting for a 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.360
 second season let's see if she is 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.880
 the same is true and this is true to the 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.459
 people stuck pretty with the series have 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.940
 you traveled to Bolivia not but you see 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.820

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.820
 Count on that place with you I want 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.650
 be primacy love is real does not exist 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.730
 social class 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.730
 I love the time 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.440
 I am a production, we have to ensure that 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.740
 that romeo and julieta is directed by 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.410

 a film production that movie yes 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.700
 good with these texts takes giving a 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.410
 little fast but hey I'm super 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.420

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.180
 had giving things 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.730
 sandro ventura who has been the fonsal 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.880
 even in the visual career I 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:20.569
 called for a new production that 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.050
 This riding 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:26.879
 It's also called 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:29.199
 and is a fun comedy scene 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:31.810
 I'm sure they 'll know soon 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:33.190
 our English vacation since the 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.500
 lesson has said that you can possibly 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.169
 have a second part how do you 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.569
 you feel I would be more than happy that 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.129
 there is a second season but more 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:44.770
 I think as I told you a while ago all 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:46.090
 we are looking forward to the prolific 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.509
 then that the answer is given that 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:52.479
 there is a second low if yes or I will 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:53.830
 I say because many people tell me 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:55.389
 even sometimes on the street he says 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.190
 wench was going to see one season and told 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:59.310
 puig my brother who would make me more 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.440
 happy that the one 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.480
 and I think that yes I think that I think that 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.340
 given how things are happening and 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.360
 comments that are being made for now 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.010
 it is very likely that there is a second 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.010
 season but suspense 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.830
