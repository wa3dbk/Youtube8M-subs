you can do that in my display two
turrets<00:00:15.870> have<00:00:16.230> hardly<00:00:16.470> changed<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.949> display

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
turrets have hardly changed the display

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.000 
turrets have hardly changed the display
of<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.580> Lenovo<00:00:18.090> y50<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.810> didn't<00:00:19.619> mention<00:00:19.770> that

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
of the Lenovo y50 I didn't mention that

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.950 
of the Lenovo y50 I didn't mention that
I<00:00:20.070> will<00:00:20.310> teach<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:20.640> how<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:20.939> change<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.630> RAM

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
I will teach you how to change the RAM

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.320 
I will teach you how to change the RAM
as<00:00:22.109> well<00:00:22.289> it's<00:00:23.070> pretty<00:00:23.250> simple<00:00:23.580> except<00:00:24.180> this

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
as well it's pretty simple except this

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.170 
as well it's pretty simple except this
one<00:00:24.840> thing<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.140> unit<00:00:25.380> take<00:00:25.529> note<00:00:25.769> off

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
one thing the unit take note off

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.670 
one thing the unit take note off
especially<00:00:27.180> when<00:00:27.449> removing<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.109> back<00:00:28.410> case

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
especially when removing the back case

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.370 
especially when removing the back case
here<00:00:28.920> which<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.670> made<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> mistake<00:00:30.119> off<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.900> I

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
here which I made a mistake off and I

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.400 
here which I made a mistake off and I
actually<00:00:31.529> broke<00:00:32.279> some<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.450> clips<00:00:33.690> inside

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
actually broke some of the clips inside

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.350 
actually broke some of the clips inside
I<00:00:34.559> believe<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.309> hopefully<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.910> did<00:00:36.059> not<00:00:36.180> make

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
I believe so hopefully you did not make

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.240 
I believe so hopefully you did not make
the<00:00:36.480> same<00:00:36.660> mistake<00:00:37.079> after<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.829> read<00:00:38.040> this

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
the same mistake after you read this

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.670 
the same mistake after you read this
I'll<00:00:38.520> watch<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:39.059> video<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.780> very<00:00:40.230> simply<00:00:40.500> you

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
I'll watch this video so very simply you

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.760 
I'll watch this video so very simply you
should<00:00:40.890> have<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.250> correct<00:00:41.790> size<00:00:42.030> tools<00:00:42.770> there

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
should have the correct size tools there

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.369 
should have the correct size tools there
are<00:00:43.800> trap<00:00:44.280> 12<00:00:44.910> screws<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.840> filters<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.289> you

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
are trap 12 screws and filters that you

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.190 
are trap 12 screws and filters that you
undo<00:00:46.620> this<00:00:47.030> unscrew<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.480> they're<00:00:48.690> all<00:00:48.870> along

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
undo this unscrew so they're all along

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.100 
undo this unscrew so they're all along
the<00:00:49.350> edges<00:00:49.710> here<00:00:50.670> one<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> mirror<00:00:51.809> as<00:00:52.079> well

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
the edges here one in the mirror as well

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.130 
the edges here one in the mirror as well
as<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.250> at<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.940> top<00:00:54.180> here<00:00:54.480> then<00:00:54.989> you

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
as you have to at the top here then you

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.810 
as you have to at the top here then you
have<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.350> take<00:00:55.559> off<00:00:55.739> as<00:00:56.250> well

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
have to take off as well

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.900 
have to take off as well
so<00:00:57.059> once<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.420> take<00:00:57.449> all<00:00:57.840> these<00:00:58.140> screws<00:00:58.440> out

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
so once you take all these screws out

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.099 
so once you take all these screws out
what<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.030> do<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.570> you're<00:01:00.690> gonna<00:01:00.809> slowly

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
what you do is that you're gonna slowly

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.189 
what you do is that you're gonna slowly
pry<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.590> open<00:01:01.940> from<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.090> bottom<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.719> then<00:01:04.170> you

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
pry it open from the bottom and then you

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.350 
pry it open from the bottom and then you
realize<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:05.040> will<00:01:05.250> like<00:01:05.700> clip<00:01:05.970> open

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
realize that you will like clip open

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.950 
realize that you will like clip open
like<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.320> like<00:01:07.710> clip<00:01:07.979> out<00:01:08.689> and<00:01:09.689> then

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
like that and you like clip out and then

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.320 
like that and you like clip out and then
you<00:01:10.080> realize<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.500> it's<00:01:10.770> like<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.369> laptop

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
you realize that it's like the laptop

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.450 
you realize that it's like the laptop
doesn't<00:01:12.570> open<00:01:13.020> right<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.920> like<00:01:14.070> something's

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
doesn't open right it's like something's

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.120 
doesn't open right it's like something's
pulling<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.970> down<00:01:15.240> now<00:01:15.750> do<00:01:15.810> not<00:01:16.170> worry<00:01:16.439> because

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
pulling it down now do not worry because

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.039 
pulling it down now do not worry because
this<00:01:17.580> what's<00:01:17.939> happened<00:01:18.270> what's<00:01:18.780> happening

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
this what's happened what's happening

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.359 
this what's happened what's happening
here<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.740> edge<00:01:19.979> here

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
here is that this edge here

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.460 
here is that this edge here
it's<00:01:20.580> like<00:01:20.880> curve<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:22.140> what<00:01:22.320> you're<00:01:22.409> gonna

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
it's like curve in so what you're gonna

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.620 
it's like curve in so what you're gonna
do<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.040> push<00:01:23.520> out<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.030> then<00:01:24.270> lift<00:01:24.420> it

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
do is that you push out and then lift it

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.450 
do is that you push out and then lift it
up<00:01:24.780> if<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.590> do<00:01:25.710> not<00:01:25.830> do<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.220> you're<00:01:26.340> gonna

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
up if you do not do that you're gonna

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.370 
up if you do not do that you're gonna
like<00:01:27.090> force<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.900> then<00:01:28.170> you're<00:01:28.290> gonna

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
like force it and then you're gonna

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.289 
like force it and then you're gonna
break<00:01:28.650> some<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.009> clips<00:01:29.250> here<00:01:29.400> which<00:01:30.060> I

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
break some of the clips here which I

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.990 
break some of the clips here which I
which<00:01:31.049> happened<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.500> me<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.130> hopefully<00:01:32.759> you

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.100 
which happened to me so hopefully you
did<00:01:33.119> not<00:01:33.240> do<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.630> once<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:33.960> unscrew

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
did not do that so once you unscrew

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.319 
did not do that so once you unscrew
everything<00:01:34.710> which<00:01:34.829> I've<00:01:34.979> already<00:01:35.189> done<00:01:35.369> you

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.789 
of your need deep back cover and you'll
see<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.570> internals<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.110> I'm<00:01:46.200> just<00:01:46.470> gonna<00:01:46.619> show

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
see the internals so I'm just gonna show

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.010 
see the internals so I'm just gonna show
you<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.100> parts<00:01:47.970> here<00:01:48.090> I'm<00:01:48.210> talking<00:01:48.630> about<00:01:48.659> you

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
you the parts here I'm talking about you

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.569 
you the parts here I'm talking about you
can<00:01:49.170> see<00:01:49.200> here<00:01:50.060> it's<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.360> curve<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:53.310> have<00:01:53.460> to

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
can see here it's a curve so you have to

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.850 
can see here it's a curve so you have to
push<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.299> out<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.720> then<00:01:55.079> lift<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.380> up<00:01:55.530> if<00:01:55.680> not

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
push it out and then lift it up if not

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.810 
push it out and then lift it up if not
you're<00:01:55.950> gonna<00:01:56.040> break<00:01:56.250> some<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.579> clips

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
you're gonna break some of the clips

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.330 
you're gonna break some of the clips
that<00:01:57.060> are<00:01:57.570> here<00:01:58.020> which<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.439> have<00:01:58.740> unfortunately

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
that are here which I have unfortunately

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.810 
that are here which I have unfortunately
done<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.570> once<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.740> open<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.340> up<00:02:02.460> what

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
done so so once is you open it up what

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.050 
done so so once is you open it up what
you're<00:02:02.939> seeing<00:02:03.180> here<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:04.969> internal<00:02:05.969> of

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
you're seeing here is the internal of

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.330 
you're seeing here is the internal of
the<00:02:06.390> laptop<00:02:06.780> do<00:02:07.020> not<00:02:07.170> be<00:02:07.290> intimidated<00:02:07.439> they

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
the laptop do not be intimidated they

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.380 
the laptop do not be intimidated they
only<00:02:08.520> two<00:02:08.729> things<00:02:08.940> they're<00:02:09.060> going<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.239> take

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
only two things they're going to take

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.419 
only two things they're going to take
note

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
note

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.089 
note
the<00:02:11.360> is<00:02:11.810> more<00:02:12.110> important<00:02:12.590> for<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.769> and<00:02:12.920> this

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
the is more important for you and this

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.330 
the is more important for you and this
it<00:02:13.579> is<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.909> RAM<00:02:14.239> over<00:02:14.840> here<00:02:15.079> and<00:02:15.290> then<00:02:15.890> we<00:02:16.189> have

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
it is the RAM over here and then we have

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.699 
it is the RAM over here and then we have
the<00:02:16.489> hot<00:02:16.610> drive<00:02:16.849> over<00:02:17.120> here<00:02:17.150> very<00:02:17.930> simply<00:02:18.379> if

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
the hot drive over here very simply if

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.830 
the hot drive over here very simply if
you<00:02:18.920> don't<00:02:19.069> take<00:02:19.189> off<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.489> hot<00:02:19.640> drive<00:02:19.879> you

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
you don't take off the hot drive you

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.440 
you don't take off the hot drive you
take<00:02:21.140> off<00:02:21.319> these<00:02:21.500> screws<00:02:21.890> over<00:02:22.040> here<00:02:22.370> as<00:02:23.299> you

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
take off these screws over here as you

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.259 
take off these screws over here as you
can<00:02:23.480> see<00:02:23.720> here<00:02:23.959> this<00:02:24.530> screws<00:02:24.950> here<00:02:25.239> unscrew<00:02:26.239> it

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
can see here this screws here unscrew it

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.929 
can see here this screws here unscrew it
and<00:02:26.599> then<00:02:27.230> you<00:02:27.319> can<00:02:27.439> lift<00:02:27.590> it<00:02:27.799> up<00:02:27.859> and<00:02:28.129> then<00:02:28.189> of

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:28.939 
and then you can lift it up and then of

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:30.280 
and then you can lift it up and then of
course<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.299> connector<00:02:29.750> here<00:02:29.900> you<00:02:30.019> slowly

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
course the connector here you slowly

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.309 
course the connector here you slowly
push<00:02:30.829> it<00:02:30.859> out<00:02:31.129> to<00:02:31.569> take<00:02:32.569> out<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.840> hard<00:02:33.079> drive

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
push it out to take out the hard drive

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.170 
push it out to take out the hard drive
and<00:02:33.620> then<00:02:33.859> you<00:02:33.920> just<00:02:34.220> do<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.430> same<00:02:34.790> thing<00:02:35.030> in

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
and then you just do the same thing in

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.460 
and then you just do the same thing in
Reverse<00:02:35.359> for<00:02:36.349> your<00:02:36.739> own<00:02:36.920> hard<00:02:37.280> drive<00:02:37.340> or<00:02:38.209> SSD

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
Reverse for your own hard drive or SSD

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.470 
Reverse for your own hard drive or SSD
whichever<00:02:39.470> as<00:02:39.709> for<00:02:40.400> RAM<00:02:40.609> it's<00:02:40.879> very<00:02:41.030> simple

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
whichever as for RAM it's very simple

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.780 
whichever as for RAM it's very simple
you<00:02:41.810> can<00:02:42.200> see<00:02:42.379> here<00:02:42.530> this<00:02:42.650> is<00:02:42.709> an<00:02:43.010> I<00:02:43.250> am

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
you can see here this is an I am

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.699 
you can see here this is an I am
actually<00:02:44.060> testing<00:02:44.599> out<00:02:44.720> some<00:02:44.900> other<00:02:45.200> Ram<00:02:45.470> from

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
actually testing out some other Ram from

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.229 
actually testing out some other Ram from
a<00:02:45.859> notebook<00:02:46.250> but<00:02:47.799> yeah<00:02:48.799> this<00:02:49.159> is<00:02:49.400> an<00:02:49.579> RM<00:02:49.970> all

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
a notebook but yeah this is an RM all

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.660 
a notebook but yeah this is an RM all
you<00:02:50.450> have<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.629> do<00:02:50.750> is<00:02:50.989> to<00:02:51.290> push<00:02:52.190> open<00:02:52.489> these

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
you have to do is to push open these

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.420 
you have to do is to push open these
clips<00:02:52.909> which<00:02:53.120> I'm<00:02:53.239> gonna<00:02:53.389> show<00:02:53.599> you<00:02:53.659> right<00:02:53.750> now

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
clips which I'm gonna show you right now

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.309 
clips which I'm gonna show you right now
so<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:55.489> push<00:02:55.790> open<00:02:56.180> it<00:02:56.389> would<00:02:56.540> pop<00:02:56.840> out<00:02:56.989> and

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
so you push open it would pop out and

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.210 
so you push open it would pop out and
then<00:02:57.829> you<00:02:58.010> can<00:02:58.189> actually<00:02:58.609> just<00:02:59.060> slight<00:02:59.689> a<00:03:00.220> pull

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
then you can actually just slight a pull

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.259 
then you can actually just slight a pull
the<00:03:01.370> RAM<00:03:01.519> out<00:03:03.159> there<00:03:04.159> you<00:03:04.220> go<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.790> Rams<00:03:05.030> out

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
the RAM out there you go the Rams out

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.149 
the RAM out there you go the Rams out
that<00:03:05.689> you<00:03:05.780> just<00:03:05.930> put<00:03:06.139> in<00:03:06.170> your<00:03:06.379> new<00:03:06.530> wonder<00:03:06.950> and

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
that you just put in your new wonder and

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:08.500 
that you just put in your new wonder and
then<00:03:07.609> you're<00:03:07.790> good<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.120> go

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
then you're good to go

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.020 
then you're good to go
same<00:03:08.959> thing<00:03:09.200> for<00:03:09.379> the<00:03:09.470> bottom<00:03:09.650> you<00:03:10.220> push<00:03:10.609> the

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
same thing for the bottom you push the

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.319 
same thing for the bottom you push the
two<00:03:11.239> pins<00:03:11.510> here<00:03:11.689> out<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.170> then<00:03:12.650> you<00:03:13.299> pull<00:03:14.299> out

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
two pins here out and then you pull out

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:14.949 
two pins here out and then you pull out
the<00:03:14.599> ramp

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
the ramp

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.930 
the ramp
your<00:03:15.199> pop<00:03:15.440> out<00:03:15.590> and<00:03:15.709> program<00:03:16.069> just<00:03:16.609> to<00:03:16.760> take

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
your pop out and program just to take

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.490 
your pop out and program just to take
note<00:03:17.150> if<00:03:17.359> you're<00:03:17.569> gonna<00:03:17.690> put<00:03:17.989> it<00:03:18.139> back<00:03:18.260> in<00:03:18.410> I'm

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
note if you're gonna put it back in I'm

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.520 
note if you're gonna put it back in I'm
just<00:03:18.650> gonna<00:03:18.769> use<00:03:18.919> back<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.129> same<00:03:19.310> Ram<00:03:20.530> you

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
just gonna use back the same Ram you

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.819 
just gonna use back the same Ram you
want<00:03:21.709> to<00:03:21.829> push<00:03:22.430> it<00:03:22.549> in<00:03:22.669> like<00:03:22.819> that<00:03:22.970> first<00:03:23.299> and

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
want to push it in like that first and

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.670 
want to push it in like that first and
once<00:03:24.829> it's<00:03:25.010> lawton<00:03:25.459> you<00:03:25.760> just<00:03:25.970> push<00:03:26.209> it<00:03:26.239> down

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
once it's lawton you just push it down

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.009 
once it's lawton you just push it down
there<00:03:27.680> you<00:03:27.769> go<00:03:27.949> very<00:03:28.579> simple<00:03:28.940> very<00:03:29.810> very

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
there you go very simple very very

there you go very simple very very
simple<00:03:30.319> hard<00:03:30.889> drive<00:03:31.099> same<00:03:31.430> as<00:03:31.609> well<00:03:31.819> just<00:03:32.569> take

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
simple hard drive same as well just take

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.470 
simple hard drive same as well just take
note<00:03:33.019> off<00:03:33.199> the<00:03:33.440> connector<00:03:34.180> slowly<00:03:35.180> push<00:03:35.449> it

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
note off the connector slowly push it

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.750 
note off the connector slowly push it
out<00:03:35.750> so<00:03:36.260> that's<00:03:36.680> about<00:03:36.799> it<00:03:36.949> really<00:03:37.190> there

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
out so that's about it really there

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.939 
out so that's about it really there
isn't<00:03:37.849> much<00:03:38.150> to<00:03:38.299> say<00:03:38.449> about<00:03:38.569> the<00:03:38.949> the

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:39.949 
isn't much to say about the the

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:42.189 
isn't much to say about the the
upgrading<00:03:40.459> of<00:03:40.519> RAM<00:03:40.790> as<00:03:41.030> well<00:03:41.269> as<00:03:41.449> the<00:03:41.780> hard

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:42.199 
upgrading of RAM as well as the hard

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:45.250 
upgrading of RAM as well as the hard
drive<00:03:42.879> if<00:03:43.879> you<00:03:44.090> change<00:03:44.389> of<00:03:44.479> batteries<00:03:44.840> etc<00:03:44.989> it

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
drive if you change of batteries etc it

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.559 
drive if you change of batteries etc it
is<00:03:45.349> more<00:03:45.709> difficult<00:03:45.919> but<00:03:46.310> that's<00:03:46.790> not<00:03:47.060> the

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
is more difficult but that's not the

best to answer and for those of you are
worried<00:04:12.500> about<00:04:12.609> electro<00:04:13.609> about

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
worried about electro about

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.800 
worried about electro about
electrostatic<00:04:15.820> just<00:04:16.820> ground<00:04:17.180> yourself<00:04:17.329> what

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
electrostatic just ground yourself what

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.349 
electrostatic just ground yourself what
means<00:04:18.019> is<00:04:18.109> that<00:04:18.169> just<00:04:18.500> touch<00:04:18.979> like<00:04:19.219> in<00:04:19.459> a<00:04:19.700> metal

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
means is that just touch like in a metal

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.510 
means is that just touch like in a metal
part<00:04:20.690> that<00:04:20.779> links<00:04:21.289> it<00:04:21.409> ground

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
part that links it ground

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.409 
part that links it ground
and<00:04:22.940> then<00:04:23.330> you're<00:04:23.449> good<00:04:23.599> to<00:04:23.630> go<00:04:24.110> usually<00:04:24.740> it<00:04:25.419> if

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
and then you're good to go usually it if

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.499 
and then you're good to go usually it if
it<00:04:27.050> wouldn't<00:04:27.440> it<00:04:27.889> wouldn't<00:04:28.099> happen<00:04:28.509> listen

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:29.509 
it wouldn't it wouldn't happen listen

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:31.659
