00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.400
Hi, my name is Corentin Tavernier and I'm Inlayer.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.000
I'll explain how I make a wooden picture.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Welcome to my workshop, I'll show you all the steps for making an marquetery.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.000
I'll create a wood picture step by step, 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.300
from the drawing to the preparation of wood, then after, cut the woods,

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.300
shade, gluing, and finish the marquetry.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.200
To do marquetry, I need a drawing.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.670
The drawing here is a design inspired by a picture of Tamara de Lempicka. 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:08.400
I have made a layout, then, I have put it in color. Each color corresponds to a different type of wood.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.450
All colors are available with natural woods. 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.600
I just have to choose them to be close to the colors of the original picture.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.090
I have selected in various veneers 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.600
the parts that interested me. 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.520
And I've cut the wood surfaces that correspond to the size of the marquetery pieces. 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.000
For example

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.100
I need this black wood (blackened pear tree) to realize the background. 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.600
This area needs to cover all of marquetry.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.200
Now I'm going to carry wood packets. 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.000
Wood packets will consist of a "contre-plaque" 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.000
a wood that will be used to avoid splinters,

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.600
and two veneer sheets, 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.480
the first veneer will help me if I broke a piece 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.500
and the second veneer will allow me to inlay the marquetry.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.250
Once I have prepared the wood packets, 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.300
I'm going to cut, to create all the pieces and finally inlay the marquetry.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.200
We have here the "contre-plaque" which it will be discarded, 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.720
and the two pieces of veneer. 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:07.916
The upper veneer is covered with paper on this two side, one to reinforce the veneer and one who's used as caliber.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.920
The veneer from below have a visible wood side and a reinforcement paper behind.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.000
Since I have cut a piece, I deposits with other pieces in a tablet. 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.250
Here, I put this green piece at the good place.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.300
I'll do that for each piece, then, once I will finish cutting, I'll pass to the inlay.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.100
This cutting is finished. Now I'm going to make a "calle tendue". 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.400
What's a "calle tendue" ?? 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.200
This is a paper that I wet, then I fixate on a wooden plate, to let it dry.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.480
It will allow the paper to tighten.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.200
Then I'll inlay my marquetry on this "calle tendue" whith bone glue, 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.280
une colle réversible, pour pouvoir ensuite la coller définitivement sur son support.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.240
The inlay is finished. 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.200
Now, I'll squeeze the marquetry. 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.500
The inlay is mounted upside down, 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.200
I'm going to glue it to the good direction on its final support.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.800
Here, you can see the inlay after squeeze, 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.320
the picture is covered of papers, 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.550
the woods veneers are now glued to the support. And I will have to remove all these papers.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.450
The papers are removed, 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.200
now it will stay the sanding step, 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.800
to remove various thicknesses between veneers

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.240
and finish the marquetry. 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.200
After, I'll plating sides to create the illusion of a massive blackened pear wood block,

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.200
to finally varnish and wax the picture. 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.920
The varnish will give a luxurious look to marquetry.
