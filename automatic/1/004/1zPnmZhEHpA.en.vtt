00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
then talking about the potential and

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.660

estimating what their potential under

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.660 
estimating what their potential under
starting<00:01:02.520> price<00:01:02.730> could<00:01:03.300> be<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.780> fifa<00:01:04.439> 14<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.640> as

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
starting price could be on fifa 14 so as

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.789 
starting price could be on fifa 14 so as
you<00:01:06.090> can<00:01:06.210> see<00:01:06.450> firstly<00:01:06.960> we<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.260> got<00:01:07.500> Jack

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
you can see firstly we have got Jack

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.210 
you can see firstly we have got Jack
Butland<00:01:08.189> for<00:01:08.640> Stoke<00:01:08.970> City<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:10.020> FIFA<00:01:10.380> 13<00:01:10.409> he

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
had the potential of 85 and a starting

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.039 
had the potential of 85 and a starting
price<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.310> career<00:01:14.610> mode<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.390> millionaire

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
price on career mode of to millionaire

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.800 
price on career mode of to millionaire
pounds<00:01:16.530> however<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.280> fifa<00:01:17.640> 14<00:01:17.850> he<00:01:18.509> has<00:01:18.600> been

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
pounds however on fifa 14 he has been

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.310 
pounds however on fifa 14 he has been
upgraded<00:01:19.380> by<00:01:19.740> 2<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.430> 71<00:01:21.119> rated<00:01:21.780> goalkeeper

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
upgraded by 2 to a 71 rated goalkeeper

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.109 
upgraded by 2 to a 71 rated goalkeeper
and<00:01:22.530> therefore<00:01:23.189> i<00:01:23.220> think<00:01:23.640> he<00:01:23.820> may<00:01:23.970> have

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
and therefore i think he may have

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.830 
and therefore i think he may have
potential<00:01:24.540> on<00:01:24.930> fifa<00:01:25.560> 14<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:26.220> 88<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.360> therefore

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
potential on fifa 14 of 88 and therefore

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.780 
potential on fifa 14 of 88 and therefore
a<00:01:27.869> starting<00:01:28.560> price<00:01:28.710> which<00:01:29.430> has<00:01:29.610> been

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
a starting price which has been

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.649 
a starting price which has been
increased<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:31.460> 3.75<00:01:32.460> million<00:01:33.000> pounds<00:01:33.540> on

six<00:02:02.310> overall<00:02:02.909> upgrade<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:04.140> make<00:02:04.290> him<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.530> 70

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
six overall upgrade to make him a 70

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.029 
six overall upgrade to make him a 70
rated<00:02:05.490> left-back<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.439> therefore<00:02:07.439> i<00:02:07.469> reckon

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
rated left-back and therefore i reckon

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.199 
rated left-back and therefore i reckon
he<00:02:08.190> will<00:02:08.310> have<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.610> huge<00:02:09.149> potential<00:02:09.899> on<00:02:10.050> fifa<00:02:10.500> 14

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
he will have a huge potential on fifa 14

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.610 
he will have a huge potential on fifa 14
definitely<00:02:12.209> in<00:02:12.390> high<00:02:12.750> 80s

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
definitely in high 80s

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.880 
definitely in high 80s
and<00:02:13.709> possibly<00:02:14.250> even<00:02:14.640> in<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.360> low<00:02:15.510> 90s<00:02:15.989> I<00:02:16.200> have

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
and possibly even in the low 90s I have

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.190 
and possibly even in the low 90s I have
gone<00:02:17.040> for<00:02:17.280> potential<00:02:17.819> of<00:02:17.940> 89<00:02:18.599> and<00:02:18.810> they

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
gone for potential of 89 and they

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.559 
gone for potential of 89 and they
starting<00:02:19.769> price<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.250> four<00:02:20.670> million<00:02:20.940> pounds<00:02:21.480> on

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
starting price of four million pounds on

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.960 
starting price of four million pounds on
career<00:02:21.989> mode<00:02:22.200> but<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:23.159> could<00:02:23.400> actually<00:02:23.549> even

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
career mode but this could actually even

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.089 
career mode but this could actually even
be<00:02:24.269> higher<00:02:24.510> in<00:02:24.780> my<00:02:24.930> opinion<00:02:25.230> because<00:02:25.409> Luke

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
be higher in my opinion because Luke

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.070 
be higher in my opinion because Luke
Shaw<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.519> a<00:02:26.549> ridiculously<00:02:27.450> good<00:02:27.690> player<00:02:27.900> on

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
Shaw is a ridiculously good player on

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.869 
Shaw is a ridiculously good player on
career<00:02:28.409> mode<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.769> it's<00:02:29.129> definitely<00:02:29.610> one<00:02:29.760> the

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
career mode and it's definitely one the

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.309 
career mode and it's definitely one the
players<00:02:30.090> that<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.420> do<00:02:30.659> need<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:30.900> pick<00:02:31.200> up

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
players that you do need to pick up

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.110 
players that you do need to pick up
early<00:02:31.680> because<00:02:31.799> he<00:02:32.040> does<00:02:32.280> turn<00:02:32.489> into<00:02:32.819> one<00:02:33.000> the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
early because he does turn into one the

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.020 
early because he does turn into one the
best<00:02:33.329> players<00:02:33.599> on<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.170> game<00:02:34.489> so<00:02:35.489> we're<00:02:35.640> moving
