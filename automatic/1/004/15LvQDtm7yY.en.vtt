modes everything on there a class and we

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.210 
modes everything on there a class and we
will<00:02:22.629> choose<00:02:22.780> this<00:02:22.930> example<00:02:23.410> see<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.650> GTR<00:02:24.040> see

how<00:02:24.370> smooth<00:02:24.670> it<00:02:24.790> is<00:02:24.940> see<00:02:25.750> how<00:02:25.930> they<00:02:26.110> took<00:02:26.379> all

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
how smooth it is see how they took all

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.440 
how smooth it is see how they took all
the<00:02:26.980> little<00:02:27.220> pixelation<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.000> just<00:02:28.120> smooth<00:02:28.299> it

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
the little pixelation and just smooth it

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.839 
the little pixelation and just smooth it
