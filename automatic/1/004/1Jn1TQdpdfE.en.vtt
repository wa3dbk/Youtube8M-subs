00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello friends in this video we 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.500
 consider the range rover scale model 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.360
 one to 43 from the manufacturer han glo 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.000
 very well executed model 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.199
 made of metal has an opening 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.060
 front doors on later models 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.699
 the doors were not opened 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.650
 window frames were simplified 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.070
 but so far the model remained good 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.760
 completed and this model still produces 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.090
 producer out uart and honestly say 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:38.010
 This model is not much worse than out uart 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:41.070
 and and you can safely put them near and 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.030
 you won't see much difference though this 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.059
 model costs 910 times cheaper than from 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.820
 Oltu Art model has separate 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.750
 headlights they are painted like you 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.850
 see there is an imitation diffuser 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.730
 headlights model has a separate grille 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.160
 grille there are slots 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.610
 there is an imitation wiper on 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.930
 headlights model has a plastic separate 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:14.640
 bumper wipers are cast together with the bottom 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:17.520
 the edges of the windshield of the mirror are cast 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.390
 along with the door model but made very 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.509
 carefully and it seems like 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.130
 as if they were made separate parts 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.330
 door handles are marked with paint model 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.320
 has well-developed wheel 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.750
 wheels they shod in rubber tire 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.869
 This model has a bright interior 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.049
 right-hand drive 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.049

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.720
 separate taillights they also 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.910
 colored reversing lights marked 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.970
 turn signals 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:53.310
 imitation of 3 stop lights 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.260
 separate rear bumper all very 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:01.310
 neatly done very well 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.310
 perceived well worked bottom 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:12.150
 mits tread on wheels and I still have 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.060
 there is the same wrangler in a slightly different 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.810
 color and if i'm not mistaken with him 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:22.800
 interior is painted for this model 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.470
 painted but in my opinion on the other he 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.280
 colored line 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.200
 how the instrument panel is painted on the skin and 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.170
 If I need this model, I made a review for me 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.020
 and you can compare different models from 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.880
