00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.240 
up a lot of alliteration there as well
that's<00:03:58.280> important<00:03:58.850> because<00:03:59.030> prior<00:03:59.660> to<00:03:59.690> this

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
that's important because prior to this

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.620 
that's important because prior to this
that<00:04:01.250> recipe<00:04:01.670> has<00:04:01.790> been<00:04:01.970> very<00:04:02.270> very<00:04:02.540> difficult

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
that recipe has been very very difficult

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.720 
that recipe has been very very difficult
to<00:04:03.080> pull<00:04:03.260> off<00:04:03.290> but<00:04:03.770> Portsmouth<00:04:04.280> does<00:04:04.490> it<00:04:04.610> why

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
to pull off but Portsmouth does it why

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.140 
to pull off but Portsmouth does it why
because<00:04:05.290> he<00:04:06.290> has<00:04:06.440> three<00:04:06.680> names<00:04:06.890> Paul<00:04:07.520> Reed

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
because he has three names Paul Reed

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.440 
because he has three names Paul Reed
Smith<00:04:08.780> okay<00:04:09.560> that's<00:04:10.400> a<00:04:10.550> lot<00:04:10.940> of<00:04:11.000> extra

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
Smith okay that's a lot of extra
