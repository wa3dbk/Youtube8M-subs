00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
port because I know in the UK there's a

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.599 
port because I know in the UK there's a
lot<00:03:10.019> of<00:03:10.049> stating<00:03:10.709> that<00:03:10.829> they<00:03:11.010> have<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.459> have

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
it's for a mini USB port so we'll have

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.720 
it's for a mini USB port so we'll have
to<00:03:34.230> wait<00:03:34.349> and<00:03:34.410> see<00:03:34.590> as<00:03:34.859> it<00:03:34.889> gets<00:03:35.040> closer<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.579> the

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
remove them in an update so now there's

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.099 
remove them in an update so now there's
that<00:04:05.340> there's<00:04:05.639> another<00:04:05.879> update<00:04:06.450> in<00:04:06.599> the<00:04:06.720> SDK

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109

which removed the finger gestures so it

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.569 
which removed the finger gestures so it
looks<00:04:11.400> like<00:04:11.609> maybe<00:04:12.680> we<00:04:13.680> might<00:04:13.980> not<00:04:14.220> see<00:04:14.280> the

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579
