you're gonna start with these pins and

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.660 
you're gonna start with these pins and
put<00:01:09.050> these<00:01:09.259> pins<00:01:09.590> they<00:01:10.009> go<00:01:10.130> right<00:01:10.250> in<00:01:10.399> here

halves of the tank and alignment okay
we've<00:01:19.819> got<00:01:19.940> all<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.119> pins<00:01:20.330> in<00:01:20.569> what's<00:01:20.810> next

00:01:21.449 --> 00:01:21.459 
we've got all the pins in what's next

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:23.680 
we've got all the pins in what's next
all<00:01:22.459> right<00:01:22.670> so<00:01:23.090> now<00:01:23.209> we're<00:01:23.330> going<00:01:23.420> to<00:01:23.479> take

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
all right so now we're going to take

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.080 
all right so now we're going to take
this<00:01:23.840> gasket<00:01:24.440> and<00:01:25.099> we're<00:01:25.220> going<00:01:25.340> to<00:01:25.369> trail

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
this gasket and we're going to trail

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.749 
this gasket and we're going to trail
this<00:01:26.270> gasket<00:01:26.569> around<00:01:27.880> just<00:01:28.880> lay<00:01:29.060> it<00:01:29.179> over

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
this gasket around just lay it over

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.169 
this gasket around just lay it over
we're<00:01:31.759> going<00:01:31.849> to<00:01:31.970> set<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.420> gasket<00:01:32.929> in<00:01:33.380> place

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
we're going to set the gasket in place

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:37.650 
we're going to set the gasket in place
the<00:01:35.179> gasket<00:01:35.390> makes<00:01:35.899> the<00:01:36.020> tank<00:01:36.229> watertight

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
the gasket makes the tank watertight

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.029 
the gasket makes the tank watertight
they<00:01:38.660> got<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:38.929> gasket<00:01:39.349> in<00:01:39.470> we<00:01:39.590> get<00:01:39.709> some

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
they got the gasket in we get some

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.359 
they got the gasket in we get some
you're<00:01:40.429> confident<00:01:41.000> that<00:01:41.209> this<00:01:41.599> is<00:01:42.039> fast<00:01:43.039> down

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
you're confident that this is fast down

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.070 
you're confident that this is fast down
in<00:01:43.550> there<00:01:44.200> now<00:01:45.200> we're<00:01:45.319> going<00:01:45.410> to<00:01:45.470> lube<00:01:45.709> this

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
in there now we're going to lube this

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.040 
in there now we're going to lube this
here's<00:01:48.080> your<00:01:48.200> loop<00:01:49.119> what<00:01:50.119> is<00:01:50.239> this<00:01:50.450> stuff<00:01:50.660> this

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
here's your loop what is this stuff this

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.919 
here's your loop what is this stuff this
is<00:01:51.319> just<00:01:51.830> a<00:01:51.920> water<00:01:52.069> based<00:01:52.340> lubricant<00:01:52.910> score<00:01:53.899> a

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
is just a water based lubricant score a

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:55.990 
is just a water based lubricant score a
little<00:01:54.080> bit<00:01:54.200> in<00:01:54.380> your<00:01:54.410> hands<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.099> just<00:01:55.640> lube

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
little bit in your hands and just lube

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.699 
little bit in your hands and just lube
it<00:01:56.119> up<00:02:01.360> it's<00:02:02.360> just<00:02:02.539> an<00:02:02.690> acrylic<00:02:02.989> lubricant

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
it up it's just an acrylic lubricant

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:05.469 
it up it's just an acrylic lubricant
it's<00:02:03.860> a<00:02:03.979> mystery<00:02:04.399> lubricant<00:02:05.000> that's<00:02:05.270> a

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
it's a mystery lubricant that's a

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.350 
it's a mystery lubricant that's a
mystery<00:02:05.959> lubricant

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.790 

so<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.450> purpose<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.930> lubrication<00:02:13.349> is

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
so the purpose of the lubrication is

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.479 
so the purpose of the lubrication is
just<00:02:14.519> to<00:02:14.700> make<00:02:14.879> an<00:02:15.030> easy<00:02:15.209> fit<00:02:16.040> so<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.190> when<00:02:17.310> we

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
just to make an easy fit so that when we

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.250 
just to make an easy fit so that when we
drop<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.390> top<00:02:18.629> yeah<00:02:20.690> as<00:02:21.690> we<00:02:21.750> leave<00:02:22.110> the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
drop the top yeah as we leave the

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.009 
drop the top yeah as we leave the
gaskets<00:02:22.769> Sean<00:02:23.730> tells<00:02:24.000> me<00:02:24.180> how<00:02:24.360> much<00:02:24.510> water<00:02:24.810> can

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
hole yeah - it's a big tank - now that

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.949 
hole yeah - it's a big tank - now that
we're<00:03:23.639> done<00:03:23.730> prepping<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.299> we<00:03:24.450> can<00:03:24.600> finally

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
we're done prepping it we can finally

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.710 
we're done prepping it we can finally
put<00:03:25.109> the<00:03:25.200> two<00:03:25.380> halves<00:03:25.620> together<00:03:26.510> first<00:03:27.510> we

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
put the two halves together first we

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.670 
put the two halves together first we
make<00:03:27.870> sure<00:03:27.900> all<00:03:28.079> the<00:03:28.410> pegs<00:03:28.620> line<00:03:28.950> up<00:03:30.560> then<00:03:31.560> we

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
make sure all the pegs line up then we

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.240 
make sure all the pegs line up then we
put<00:03:31.889> clamps<00:03:32.310> around<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.609> sides<00:03:34.010> hammer<00:03:35.010> them

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
put clamps around the sides hammer them

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.040 
put clamps around the sides hammer them
into<00:03:35.459> place

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
into place

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:47.420 
into place
now<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:37.980> tank<00:03:38.280> is<00:03:38.460> watertight

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.489
