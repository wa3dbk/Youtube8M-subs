00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
shaped design workbench so let me just

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.630 
shaped design workbench so let me just
start<00:02:34.810> putting<00:02:35.020> off<00:02:35.290> some<00:02:35.320> tools<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:36.130> show<00:02:36.580> you

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.540 
start putting off some tools to show you
how<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.150> works<00:02:37.360> out<00:02:37.600> so<00:02:38.470> I'm<00:02:39.100> searching<00:02:39.340> for

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
how it works out so I'm searching for

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.360 
how it works out so I'm searching for
the<00:02:39.790> trend<00:02:40.060> command<00:02:40.420> in<00:02:40.720> this

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.000 

trim<00:02:44.000> split<00:02:44.150> click<00:02:44.750> on<00:02:44.930> this<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:45.410> drag<00:02:45.739> it<00:02:45.769> and

trim split click on this and drag it and

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.490 
trim split click on this and drag it and
drop<00:02:46.099> it<00:02:46.280> over<00:02:46.670> here<00:02:47.120> so<00:02:47.870> this<00:02:48.080> is<00:02:48.200> how<00:02:48.349> it

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
drop it over here so this is how it

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.660 
drop it over here so this is how it
works<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.959> Tri<00:02:51.230> tangent<00:02:51.800> fill<00:02:51.920> it<00:02:52.069> click<00:02:52.519> it

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
works the Tri tangent fill it click it

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.210 
works the Tri tangent fill it click it
drag<00:02:53.120> it<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:53.540> drop<00:02:53.599> it<00:02:54.319> here<00:02:54.709> and<00:02:55.330> turn<00:02:56.330> on<00:02:56.450> hit
