00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
they did the name off the rivers like

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.940 
they did the name off the rivers like
what<00:01:09.369> yeah<00:01:10.369> overcame<00:01:11.149> row<00:01:11.330> back<00:01:12.200> on<00:01:12.350> Rome<00:01:12.590> well

what yeah overcame row back on Rome well

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.490 
what yeah overcame row back on Rome well
this<00:01:13.130> one<00:01:13.310> this<00:01:13.580> one<00:01:13.789> is<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:14.240> brand<00:01:14.690> name<00:01:14.869> of

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
this one this one is the brand name of

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.160 
this one this one is the brand name of
the<00:01:15.710> previously<00:01:16.100> known<00:01:16.369> as<00:01:16.509> River<00:01:17.509> Nephilim

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
the previously known as River Nephilim

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.440 
the previously known as River Nephilim
which<00:01:18.590> is<00:01:18.740> now<00:01:18.890> being<00:01:18.950> called<00:01:19.190> I<00:01:19.550> seven<00:01:20.119> small

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
which is now being called I seven small

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.529 
which is now being called I seven small
I<00:01:20.479> number<00:01:21.229> seven<00:01:21.770> and<00:01:22.179> that's<00:01:23.179> led<00:01:23.330> to<00:01:23.390> much

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
I number seven and that's led to much

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:24.639 
I number seven and that's led to much
confusion<00:01:23.869> as<00:01:24.080> to<00:01:24.110> how<00:01:24.259> they<00:01:24.380> came<00:01:24.500> out<00:01:24.560> of

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
confusion as to how they came out of

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.070 
confusion as to how they came out of
that<00:01:24.770> name<00:01:25.009> because<00:01:25.190> it's<00:01:25.849> a<00:01:26.030> quad<00:01:26.450> core<00:01:26.660> part

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
that name because it's a quad core part

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.900 
that name because it's a quad core part
so<00:01:27.679> not<00:01:27.920> sure<00:01:28.039> what's<00:01:28.220> evan's<00:01:28.459> got<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:28.729> do<00:01:28.819> it

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
so not sure what's evan's got to do it

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.370 
so not sure what's evan's got to do it
and<00:01:29.060> not<00:01:29.149> sure<00:01:29.360> what<00:01:29.539> eyes<00:01:29.690> got<00:01:30.020> to<00:01:30.140> do<00:01:30.229> with<00:01:30.349> it

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
and not sure what eyes got to do with it

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.050 
and not sure what eyes got to do with it
either<00:01:30.619> so<00:01:31.250> I<00:01:31.280> thought<00:01:31.520> as<00:01:31.670> you<00:01:31.700> didn't<00:01:31.970> even

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
either so I thought as you didn't even

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.040 
either so I thought as you didn't even
know<00:01:32.240> this<00:01:32.420> Nick<00:01:32.630> what's<00:01:32.780> your<00:01:32.899> first

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
know this Nick what's your first

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.419 
know this Nick what's your first
impression<00:01:33.229> of<00:01:33.500> that<00:01:33.619> is<00:01:33.770> it<00:01:33.890> something<00:01:34.099> to<00:01:34.220> do

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
impression of that is it something to do

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.460 
impression of that is it something to do
with<00:01:34.580> the<00:01:34.729> number<00:01:35.599> of<00:01:35.630> instructions<00:01:36.080> that

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
with the number of instructions that

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.859 
with the number of instructions that
each<00:01:36.860> core<00:01:37.190> can<00:01:37.369> work<00:01:37.550> on<00:01:37.759> because<00:01:38.119> I<00:01:38.149> remember

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
each core can work on because I remember

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.559 
each core can work on because I remember
that<00:01:39.170> AMD<00:01:39.800> could<00:01:40.220> do<00:01:40.369> three<00:01:40.610> instructions<00:01:41.090> per

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:41.569 
that AMD could do three instructions per

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:44.080 
that AMD could do three instructions per
clock<00:01:41.599> cycle<00:01:41.929> where<00:01:42.649> as<00:01:42.890> Intel<00:01:43.459> can<00:01:43.640> do<00:01:43.759> for

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
clock cycle where as Intel can do for

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.029 
clock cycle where as Intel can do for
its<00:01:44.720> automatically<00:01:45.440> any<00:01:45.560> chip<00:01:45.739> they<00:01:45.860> bring

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
its automatically any chip they bring

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.490 
its automatically any chip they bring
out<00:01:46.160> is<00:01:46.429> twenty-five<00:01:46.970> percent<00:01:47.119> faster<00:01:47.509> right

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
out is twenty-five percent faster right

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.210 
out is twenty-five percent faster right
or<00:01:49.149> sell<00:01:50.149> any<00:01:50.300> make<00:01:50.509> it<00:01:50.630> five<00:01:50.869> if<00:01:51.739> there's<00:01:52.009> two

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
or sell any make it five if there's two

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.330 
or sell any make it five if there's two
calls<00:01:52.550> you<00:01:52.729> had<00:01:52.849> the<00:01:52.970> two<00:01:53.179> on<00:01:53.360> all<00:01:53.929> right<00:01:54.229> no<00:01:55.130> I

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
calls you had the two on all right no I

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.130 
calls you had the two on all right no I
know<00:01:55.640> that's<00:01:56.119> the<00:01:56.209> work<00:01:56.390> that's<00:01:56.539> a<00:01:56.780> good<00:01:56.929> tires

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
know that's the work that's a good tires

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.770 
know that's the work that's a good tires
good<00:01:57.289> type<00:01:57.560> anything<00:01:57.860> I've<00:01:58.369> managed<00:01:58.729> I<00:01:58.880> some<00:01:59.360> I

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
good type anything I've managed I some I

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.180 
good type anything I've managed I some I
actually<00:02:00.080> actually<00:02:00.470> spoke<00:02:00.800> to<00:02:00.830> seventh

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
actually actually spoke to seventh

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.790 
actually actually spoke to seventh
generation<00:02:01.899> don't<00:02:02.899> think<00:02:03.050> so<00:02:03.229> know<00:02:03.619> that

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
generation don't think so know that

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.839 
generation don't think so know that
there<00:02:03.950> has<00:02:04.069> been<00:02:04.099> some<00:02:04.399> argument<00:02:04.729> for<00:02:04.819> that

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:04.849 
there has been some argument for that

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:06.729 
there has been some argument for that
but<00:02:05.119> you<00:02:05.599> could<00:02:05.780> go<00:02:05.899> back<00:02:06.050> more<00:02:06.229> generations

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:06.739 
but you could go back more generations

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:09.760 
but you could go back more generations
than<00:02:06.800> that<00:02:07.009> if<00:02:07.220> you<00:02:07.580> wanted<00:02:07.879> to<00:02:08.500> and<00:02:09.500> anyway

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
than that if you wanted to and anyway

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:10.990 
than that if you wanted to and anyway
even<00:02:09.920> if<00:02:10.069> it<00:02:10.190> was<00:02:10.280> seventh<00:02:10.550> generation<00:02:10.670> be

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
even if it was seventh generation be

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.309 
even if it was seventh generation be
pretty<00:02:11.239> arbitrary<00:02:11.450> they've<00:02:11.900> never<00:02:12.020> named

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
pretty arbitrary they've never named

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.500 
pretty arbitrary they've never named
precious<00:02:13.280> after<00:02:13.730> which<00:02:13.849> generation<00:02:14.300> it<00:02:14.390> was

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
precious after which generation it was

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.760 
precious after which generation it was
before<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:14.989> doesn't<00:02:15.200> mean<00:02:15.290> anything<00:02:15.319> to

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
before and that doesn't mean anything to

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.589 
before and that doesn't mean anything to
normal<00:02:16.040> consumers<00:02:16.520> so<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.180> think<00:02:17.270> that's<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.480> bit

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
normal consumers so I think that's a bit

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.270 
normal consumers so I think that's a bit
i'll<00:02:17.720> but<00:02:17.840> really<00:02:18.110> I<00:02:18.140> seems<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.069> be<00:02:19.129> pretty

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
i'll but really I seems to be pretty

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.089 
i'll but really I seems to be pretty

there<00:02:22.670> is<00:02:22.790> that<00:02:22.819> but<00:02:23.330> there's<00:02:23.540> also<00:02:23.660> I<00:02:23.780> in<00:02:24.230> that

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
okay so I think what we've concluded

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.540 
okay so I think what we've concluded
there<00:04:40.840> really<00:04:41.289> is<00:04:41.380> between<00:04:41.650> Nick<00:04:41.979> and<00:04:42.010> I<00:04:42.220> and
