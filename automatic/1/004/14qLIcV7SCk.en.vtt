00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.980
 such and welcome back on the course traits 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.750
 new ra.it one of our users has us 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.790
 requested on our forum 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.780
 the song then yes of daniele pine 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.389
 let's see the song is composed 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.039
 by unconventional agreements ie 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.470
 however not in the first position 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:24.060
 let's see what we have a 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:28.470
 to which we will remove this case here I have to 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:32.910
 say that this way better ring finger 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:39.809
 then we will have addressed with fa sharps al 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:46.460
 low with the video with the glue screaming is 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.460
 a first video below we will have 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:56.629
 often present but is a minor felt 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:01.519
 in this case the agreements are the same 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.519
 then it will have to be very simple 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:10.430
 liter and the verse are so we leave 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.430
 with this he knows 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.280
 we are in shades there of all 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:26.409
 stairs will be made shades of life 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.840
 we analyze these agreements precisely 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:33.100
 this arpeggios in the disk version 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.520
 use this type of pine arpeggio 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.880
 daniele 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.689
 so on but let's take fifth and third 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.689
 second rope 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.510
 twice 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.350
 with love 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.230
 let's play the second one 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.310
 and he had it on board 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:02:01.280
 making sure to do this legato 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:03.970
 here with the video 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.970
 so it will be 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:21.970
 53 25 32 bending is a tied 2 0 2 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:25.030
 and then 0 on the first door on the agreement 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:32.019
 say reported art people will be in 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:35.860
 this way we have sixth third e 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:45.459
 We play the second string once 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:49.830
 together we support 432 and again 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.830
 all together so I'll be 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.320
 the stanza will sound this way 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:33.150
 so the turned it is I would say they will come back 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:38.879
 equal to the parts of the intro then we will have 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:42.530
 this facts exist the seventh with 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.530
 this piece of scale 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:54.480
 again facts and then the seventh minor king 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:04:01.290
 the arpeggio on the seventh factor would be 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:13.730
 vent after four strings then bassolino 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:17.100
 the four strings the only one will be 0245 rope 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.710
 52 when 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.680
 5 

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:26.740
 4 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:33.180
 again he makes himself seventh and then king 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:35.830
 plus and seventh we can start again 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:43.530
 the chorus agreements are these 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:43.530
 we have a king our again 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:50.460
 minor me 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.780
 does sharps this time with the bass 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:08.180
 then ladies made sir seventh of 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.180
 new is improved 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:21.200
 lots of income nor seventh e 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.200
 let's start from the beginning 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.750
 in this case the mountain pasture of the refrain 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:35.569
 it must follow the melodic line a little 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:38.030
 let's start from the king then fourth third 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:45.400
 second first and all together for two 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:48.400
 sometimes then we go to the se smiles more 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.400
 fear 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.670
 b 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.860
 which trying to make the villain feel 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:04.999
 let's move on to the accord of the F sharp 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:09.219
 minor seventh with the there in and 

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:09.219
 we all play the strings together 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:17.990
 then yes min oe seventh all together 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:30.690
 and then the fourth third second same thing 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:30.690
 wants to stop seventh again 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:43.800
 still rowing 9 seventh single then 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:48.389
 all four strings together we 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:50.040
 we will start with the arpeggio we said 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:52.680
 that the tone of the song is the 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.330
 more then you need the stairs 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.790
 more if you don't remember them
