00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.439
 very good kids that as you are 

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:09.790
 Welcome back to the channel 

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:12.430
 welcome to the last video this 2013 I have 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.830
 selected a total of 22 videos that 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.500
 I think they have marked the channel that I think 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.450
 that have marked a before and after and 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.970
 that have had a lot of repercussion 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.550
 about you and that I sincerely believe 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.070
 personal level that are special these 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.900
 videos that I'm going to put fragments of 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.300
 each of them while doing this 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.579
 comment dismissing the year and several 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.129
 things that I have to tell you first 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.769
 I want to be honest with you 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:43.690
 because how many days I have not gone up 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:46.239
 a fucking video 4 maybe five that cojones 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.579
 has happened with the commitment that we had 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.489
 of daily video which I am fulfilling 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.379
 with my part maybe when we go up a 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.629
 video from our point of view what 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.120
 you see how it matters of tap and 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.280
 has not uploaded such video but I swear 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.109
 that as in youtube is something that since 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.449
 part of my life that affects me 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.730
 personal level when I do not upload video 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.800
 When I've been 23 days without uploading a video 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.350
 I keep thinking about the channel and I 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.590
 I feel very bad with myself 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.510
 because because I looked back I see 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.760
 the hours dedicated to my channel the 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.370
 hours that I've been doing thumbnails 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.490
 videos in front of the computer the effort 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.380
 that I have invested in the channel and I say 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.180
 to throw everything to take for ass now 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.670
 above everything is Christmas I have all the 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.310
 world time and maybe that's why I 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.900
 I feel so bad about myself because with 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.510
 all the effort that I dedicated with everything 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.820
 what I have achieved and with what I can 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.370
 get 22 days without uploading video and 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.230
 honestly I feel terrible with me 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.800
 same so once again kids 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:50.260
 I want to apologize and I have failed you 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.300
 I'm sorry I want to apologize 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.280
 it and it is something that I have to reflect 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.680
 because if one day I want to get 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.900
 something really great I have to 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.540
 dedicate seriously to invest a lot 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.760
 hours to my channel and that's what I want 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.260
 really so why am I doing 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.450
 this because I throw days without uploading 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.929
 videos having all the type all the 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.120
 world time so I sincerely 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.920
 I want to apologize I do not want what 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.209
 I just said it affects you to the 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.920
 time to watch the videos or anything like that 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.420
 but I do want it to affect me 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.650
 something that I have to reflect on 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.200
 it and I just wanted to share this 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.850
 feeling with you so when 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.350
 it's something that I have to reflect on 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.390
 it and after having told them this 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.480
 what I'm telling you is a bit weird but 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.940
 is what I feel I want now 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.010
 look back and see everything that 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.460
