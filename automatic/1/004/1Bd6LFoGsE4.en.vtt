 oversaturated area spells and that's 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.820
 really a little bit wholesale it's a 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:09.299
 pacifist doubt nothing to the taste of you t'en 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:12.180

 twenty four years to 4 spell has indicated and 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.860
 5th is the good the problem is that 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.299
 it's a pipe promised from the manade 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.450
 land two helpers but what is good 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:31.020
 is that what you want to take 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.640
 at level two which one is free if 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.020
 when you do it on a henchman the henchman 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.170
 actually dies by and large you sit them 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.430
 with the to torture Cuba tamada ok but 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.710
 if ever the spirent does not die of your 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.460
 folded seven strokes of the sea will do 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.460
 my entourage 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.270
 you speak you take your va to which vis 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.580
 of this kind flu yamago shayla site the 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.320
 winner nickel there you go kate you 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.369
 austen and recover behind so there 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.890
 you can sow you try to put a 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.600
 point of being on someone the z at wholesale 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.740
 it's a sense of others you can you can 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.080
 to do both the problem is that it 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:08.750
 has less reach than the ah if I have 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.770
 understood finally if I do it at and in 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.870
 the tunes of aston yeah I listened to him 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.100
 rescuers but the zest of his 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.650
 palate okay so here's the thing 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.930
 it's that it's far away 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.580
 to miss in fact that's what is more 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.110
 to you can you can stop you can do 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.620
 the game you can but you can miss you 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:34.180
 can this theme the two titans to do 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.390
 a spell there was still some people 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.390
 where the tension 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.060
 no stress 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.000
 it's a strong position in the second 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.800
 position as to the case where so there and 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.940
 it 's torture that you want and 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.820
 gear when you put the motorcycle stunt 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.710
 attack with hello a little to and ste 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.640
 thècle 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.720
 be careful when you do it 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.010
 it will take the grid that spirou 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.480
 you're going to get hit back 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.920
 takes the rather because genre 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.390
 big plus you go road and rail more 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.460
 will have passed from the city ​​me you will be able 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:15.080
 fail sure especially not agree the only one 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.910
 the flat of the person is that when you have your 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.320
 loaded stone by basically you do not really 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.520
 to make sure that I make sure to say that 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.820
 because kind of writing do not have to 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:26.209
 mess 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:27.740
 for example if you are ready attention 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.459
 it's actually if you're called you do not have 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.060
 do it all is not done we know 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.140
 again nor what a dirty car ashton I 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:40.280
 thought I had done it actually 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:41.900
 it's by the spa I'm as soon as I 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.970
 found that it had gone well 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:49.160
 do you see lamy environment me it's 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:51.560
 I took relatively expensive but one but 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.540
 if you point it out with yves excuse 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.250
 I was not good I told you I 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.320
 did not see any games with a friend alice 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.000
 is the only person finally it's the only one 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.010
 perso I find or not to break him 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:10.370
 these teams because if they do not have 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:13.459
 been a little sad galley a little how 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.380
 it's going to be worried and at level 6 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:22.100
 it's really cool then the z by 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:24.640
 to put good plans george what that 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.640
 made me 3 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.860
 that's what they first have that you can 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.540
 at the base you can change at the base 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.490
 came back on the eye in general often 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.960
 leahy bac because like that 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.310
 they can charge their fate to the 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:51.410
 base so you never have to live to 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:56.060
 near or what daddy is not your 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:57.320
 place and already cars to the 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.540
 bastille tapas and what do you get to 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.800
 the basis for jury that you do is a z 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.610
 28 years is in the void I laugh when 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.860
 you arrive at the base must always 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.740
 get off the base with at least three 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.150
 styles 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.590
 so he can then generate 3 in one go 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.780
 I did not understand that I was only one 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.070
 times I did not have three of a sudden we had to 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.490
 do you have to make several routes 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.400
 were already there where I think no bah 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.600
 Well, it's starting from scratch 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.090
 when you do but imagine when you 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.930
 do you also do your a at the same time 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.669
 I hold you do I do not want to do 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.039
 that your this case genton z and we have 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:38.350
 and the patrick couple of style since the 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:38.350
 to say but I do not know here they come 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.760
 of attempted 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:59.910
 the lute rsa nickel at the bled centaine 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:59.910
 gillet 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:14.590
 a sum the fall what is done is 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.590
 done is he will try to satisfy 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:42.320
 ok ok you're ready him one of the robbers 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:43.610
 left beaten and gj ggg did not have to 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.560
 that it was necessary that it happened 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.320
 well because there were people 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:51.050

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.640
 discovery with annie good after there 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.440
 where I did a little bit my bastard I do 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.930
 a bit angry direct like a biatch 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.220
 jeans head of the toy be quieter 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.230
 to test and develop a little more 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:03.490
 its mechanics of the animation are you going 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.490
 understood a little bit the chip was cool 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.980
 you want to make a reservation to messi
