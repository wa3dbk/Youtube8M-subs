00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
see here now the type of treatment

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.960 
see here now the type of treatment
recommended<00:00:16.350> by<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:16.980> American<00:00:17.130> Orchid

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
recommended by the American Orchid

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.970 
recommended by the American Orchid
Society<00:00:18.320> article<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.500> read<00:00:19.740> on<00:00:19.800> the

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
Society article that I read on the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
Society article that I read on the
internet<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:21.439> the<00:00:22.439> first<00:00:22.980> treatment<00:00:23.580> would<00:00:23.789> be

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
internet is the first treatment would be

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.620 
internet is the first treatment would be
with<00:00:24.240> isopropyl<00:00:25.019> alcohol<00:00:25.609> so<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.000> what<00:00:27.599> I

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
with isopropyl alcohol so this is what I

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.359 
with isopropyl alcohol so this is what I
got<00:00:27.869> from<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.140> pharmacy<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.160> called

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
got from a pharmacy this is called

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.970 
got from a pharmacy this is called
rubbing<00:00:29.730> alcohol<00:00:30.140> so<00:00:31.140> they<00:00:31.289> recommend<00:00:31.710> not<00:00:31.920> to

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
rubbing alcohol so they recommend not to

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.060 
rubbing alcohol so they recommend not to
use<00:00:32.219> home<00:00:32.940> alcohols<00:00:33.690> or<00:00:34.020> methanol<00:00:34.860> or<00:00:34.920> ethanol

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
use home alcohols or methanol or ethanol

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.760 
use home alcohols or methanol or ethanol
which<00:00:35.969> can<00:00:36.210> burn<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.570> leaves<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.620> the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
which can burn the leaves so this is the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.729 
which can burn the leaves so this is the
particular<00:00:38.129> alcohol<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.120> be<00:00:39.239> used<00:00:39.480> we<00:00:40.260> use<00:00:40.530> it

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
particular alcohol to be used we use it

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.270 
particular alcohol to be used we use it
with<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.100> paper<00:00:41.370> towel<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.559> rub<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.770> off<00:00:44.010> the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
with a paper towel and rub it off the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.760 
with a paper towel and rub it off the
leaf<00:00:44.430> now<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.570> don't<00:00:45.690> think<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.350> going<00:00:46.680> to

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
leaf now I don't think this is going to

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.799 
leaf now I don't think this is going to
be<00:00:46.860> enough<00:00:47.250> because<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.329> first<00:00:48.510> line

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
be enough because this is the first line

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.229 
be enough because this is the first line
of<00:00:48.840> treatment<00:00:49.230> not<00:00:50.219> enough<00:00:50.579> for<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.000> level

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
of treatment not enough for this level

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.069 
of treatment not enough for this level
of<00:00:51.600> infestation<00:00:52.670> so<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.000> next<00:00:54.239> line<00:00:54.570> would<00:00:54.870> be

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
of infestation so the next line would be

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.950 
of infestation so the next line would be
to<00:00:55.289> use<00:00:55.469> horticultural<00:00:56.370> oil<00:00:56.610> or<00:00:56.910> neem<00:00:57.539> spray

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
to use horticultural oil or neem spray

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.520 
to use horticultural oil or neem spray
that<00:00:58.680> will<00:00:58.949> smother<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.940> insects<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
that will smother the insects and the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.290 
that will smother the insects and the
third<00:01:01.800> line<00:01:02.100> would<00:01:02.520> be<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.699> use<00:01:03.059> an

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
third line would be to use an

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.299 
third line would be to use an
insecticidal<00:01:03.989> soap<00:01:04.350> which<00:01:04.650> I'm<00:01:04.860> going<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.129> use

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
insecticidal soap which I'm going to use

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.539 
insecticidal soap which I'm going to use
actually<00:01:05.790> today<00:01:06.450> because<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.680> far<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.369> go

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
actually today because this is far to go

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.030 
actually today because this is far to go
on<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.420> first<00:01:09.750> I'm<00:01:10.020> going<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.290> try<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.680> remove

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
on so first I'm going to try and remove

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.560 
on so first I'm going to try and remove
all<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.619> insects<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:14.100> know<00:01:14.189> physically<00:01:14.790> with

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
all the insects you know physically with

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.679 
all the insects you know physically with
with<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.380> rubbing<00:01:16.950> alcohol<00:01:17.119> so<00:01:18.119> here<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.479> goes

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
with the rubbing alcohol so here it goes

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:33.980 
with the rubbing alcohol so here it goes
it<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.830> rubbing<00:01:20.159> alcohol

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.700 

so<00:01:34.990> here<00:01:35.320> we<00:01:35.410> go<00:01:36.870> to

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
so here we go to

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.810 
so here we go to
rub<00:01:40.400> the<00:01:40.610> insects<00:01:41.060> right<00:01:41.390> off<00:01:41.780> I<00:01:42.310> think<00:01:43.310> can

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
rub the insects right off I think can

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.360 
rub the insects right off I think can
you<00:01:43.970> see<00:01:44.650> what<00:01:45.650> I'm<00:01:45.860> doing<00:01:47.770> so<00:01:48.770> here<00:01:49.010> it<00:01:49.220> is

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
you see what I'm doing so here it is

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.030 
you see what I'm doing so here it is
here<00:01:50.360> is<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:50.630> bits<00:01:50.990> of<00:01:51.200> insects<00:01:51.830> that<00:01:51.980> are

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
here is the bits of insects that are
