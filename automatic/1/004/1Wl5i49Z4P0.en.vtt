00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.710
 hello the weak point of the verandas 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.110
 it is the sealing on the borders 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.809
 this porch many years we see 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.980
 that the joint so much the joint in 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.029
 rubber has aged well 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:23.900
 as much the lead flap starts to 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.699
 to be friends but especially the wall is him 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.670
 very damaged when we go to see how 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:31.760
 redo the top of this wall and the 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.340
 features burgundy has here 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.770
 so the results of infiltrations 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.880
 of water in the veranda because of the seal 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.880
 so we saw in water 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:50.059
 so once cleaned we will do on 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.719
 those on the wall top a little 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.340
 flaking bastard mortar for waterproofing 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.559
 and then we'll see this fellow for 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.059
 work the side side so 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.550
 to improve the tightness 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.140
 the problem when the wall symbio like that 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.780
 when masonry is damaged it is 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.300
 the water ends up entering between the 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.160
 masonry and the silicone seal that 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:15.110
 had been put that's why he's going 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:17.330
 internal need of diatoms then a 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.270
 once we have scratched well removed 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.380
 clean the edges 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.380
 we will dust off 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.719
 an interesting question when we do 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.000
 of renovation like that of 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:34.299
 maintenance is the quality ratio 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.729
 price 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.049
 we spend some time doing so 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.560
 the works is what is better 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.420
 change the bib that will cost in 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.220
 fifty or so euros with the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.280
 silicone or is it better to 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.750
 renovate I would say it's up to you to 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.939
 see if your budget is very tight and 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.469
 try to renovate knowing that you 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.670
 may need to start in two years 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:58.240
 so if you change it you are 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.000
 quiet for a decade or so 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.700
 will also take care to clean under the 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.860
 rubber rod then after blackberry 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.899
 reflection we decided to remove because 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.530
 that the wand is really theirs 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:14.590
 bad condition 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:19.510
 so we're going to take off and then we'll see 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.700
 how well cleaned and fixed a band 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.870
 in place for that is the old band is 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.670
 removed 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.660
 it's pretty much dust and like 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.760
 it is necessary and then at this place toulon 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.530
 so I put a sealant in 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.190
 waiting for the kernel to be added 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.130
 so they can like another time the 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.709
 preparation we now have to shave 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.090
 on the top of the wall and we have to 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.380
 will have made the raze deliver to our 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.380
 bank for sealing 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.409
 to make the raze we will put good 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:56.170
 a wooden guide that will take us 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:59.099
 actually allow to do a little 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.099
 outside slope 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.200
 so to start wet before 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:15.049
 to put the bastard tow show 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.049
 lime and cements in hold 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.820
 trowel is applied 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:33.400
 doing 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:35.080
 a small outside slope then 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.060
 let pass at home and it takes 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.060
 we will put our waterproof tape here 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:52.450
 so once we're done with 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.370
 dust off we'll ask so this 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.200
 band which is a band actually it was 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.910
 at the time and it and stickers 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.120
 we go there and apply it 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:08.290
 so or two- thirds on the wall a third 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.200
 on the rubber band here so we 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.209
 go there unrolled the presentz makes you the 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.450
 good length and then do it 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.450
 adhere 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.780
 find the protective band that is 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:28.540
 behind this fair is free and we 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:31.410
 will adhere initially 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.410
 the race card 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:47.600
 before accusing the form 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:55.610
 and then we will roll to do well 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:05:04.000
 adhere on the vertical support the band 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:07.610
 sealing and ditto on the lower part 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.380
 we can give a psychologist 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.630
 here I hope it will have given you a 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.810
 good idea how to seal 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.000
 on one edge 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.410
 veranda or roofing elsewhere 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.180
 because it can be the same case of 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.440
 figure 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.440
 see you soon goodbye
