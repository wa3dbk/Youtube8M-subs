00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.290 
reasons that's Warren Buffett I think
that<00:01:08.990> left-wing<00:01:09.530> parties<00:01:10.010> generally<00:01:10.280> do<00:01:11.030> more

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
that left-wing parties generally do more

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
to help the average person who genuinely

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.590 
to help the average person who genuinely

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
a reasonable judge of character I think

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.780

that<00:01:23.630> Kevin<00:01:23.810> Rudd<00:01:24.140> has<00:01:24.290> the<00:01:24.500> potential<00:01:24.890> to<00:01:25.310> be

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
that Kevin Rudd has the potential to be

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.750
