00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.089
 some anti-Catholics argue that the Catholic church is the harlot of 

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:07.529
 Babylon of chapters 17 and 18 of the apocalypse 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.809
 the fundamentalist author of ypf jun in his 1994 book a woman rides the 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:16.980
 beast presents nine arguments to try to prove this 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:22.229
 their claims are useful summary of everything used by fundamentalists and a 

00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:25.839
 brief review of this material teaches us that such claims simply 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:27.119
 they do not work 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.380
 number one 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.989
 seven hills 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.690
 junta argues that the harlot is a city built on seven hills 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.730
 which identifies with the seven hills of ancient Rome 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.860
 this argument is based on apocalypse 17 9 that expresses that the 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.530
 woman sits on seven mountains 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.390
 the Greek word in this passage soros 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.030
 of the 65 occurrences of this word in the new testament only three are 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.970
 views like hill in the version of the king jaime i 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.410
 the remaining 62 are translated as mountain or mount point Bibles 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.080
 modern have similar proportions 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.680
 if the passage expresses that the harlot sits and seven mountains could 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.600
 refer to anything 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.939
 the mountains are common biblical symbols often symbolize kingdoms 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.280
 integers see 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.530
 Psalm 68 15 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.540
 daniel 2 35 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.830
 masters 4 1 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.810
 ap days a 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.150
 8 21 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.420
 the seven mountains of the harlot can be seven kingdoms over which reigned or 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.340
 seven kingdoms that had something in common with her 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.450
 the number 7 can also be symbolic frequently represents 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.320
 complete in the bible 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.160
 if this is so the seven mountains can mean that the harlot reigned 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.440
 over all the kingdoms of the earth 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.200
 even if we accept that the word oros should be literally translated as 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.440
 Hill in this passage still does not bring us closer to Rome 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.790
 other cities are known to have been built on seven hills 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:53.880
 as well 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.990
 even if the reference is allowed to be blunt of four more tambos speaking the 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.910
 pagan roma or the christian 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.290
 as we will see the pagan roma coincidental gold with the criterion that together because the 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.690
 rome christian 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.150
 making the distinction between Rome and the Vatican the city where the church 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.930
 catholic has its headquarters now the argument of jung becomes less 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.409
 credible still 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:18.340
 the city the Vatican is not built on seven hills if not 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:22.950
 just on a hill namely the vatican hill that is not even one of 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:26.099
 the seven on which the ancient Rome was built 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.859
 these hills are east of the tiber river 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.739
 the vatican hill is what it is
