00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.219 
down a little bit deadlifts are
something<00:01:53.330> that<00:01:53.479> have<00:01:53.569> never<00:01:53.750> been<00:01:53.959> a<00:01:53.989> staple

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
something that have never been a staple

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.410 
something that have never been a staple
in<00:01:54.410> my<00:01:54.530> routine<00:01:54.890> ever<00:01:55.459> since<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.789> age<00:01:55.879> of<00:01:56.000> 14

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
in my routine ever since the age of 14

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.300 
in my routine ever since the age of 14
when<00:01:56.569> I<00:01:56.660> started<00:01:56.690> training<00:01:57.410> I<00:01:57.709> did<00:01:57.860> a<00:01:58.069> strength

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
when I started training I did a strength

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.609 
when I started training I did a strength
and<00:01:58.459> performance<00:01:58.610> camp<00:01:59.149> for<00:01:59.300> four<00:01:59.450> years<00:01:59.720> we

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
and performance camp for four years we

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.529 
and performance camp for four years we
didn't<00:02:00.860> do<00:02:00.979> deadlifts<00:02:01.550> one<00:02:01.789> time<00:02:02.000> through

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
didn't do deadlifts one time through

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.449 
didn't do deadlifts one time through
that<00:02:02.690> whole<00:02:02.840> four<00:02:03.080> years<00:02:03.110> I<00:02:03.409> was<00:02:03.530> there<00:02:03.709> we<00:02:04.340> did

00:02:04.449 --> 00:02:04.459 
that whole four years I was there we did

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:06.580 
that whole four years I was there we did
a<00:02:04.519> lot<00:02:04.670> of<00:02:04.700> benchpress<00:02:05.060> a<00:02:05.269> lot<00:02:05.539> of<00:02:05.599> squats<00:02:05.959> we

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
a lot of benchpress a lot of squats we

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.770 
a lot of benchpress a lot of squats we
would<00:02:06.709> do<00:02:06.860> an<00:02:07.220> occasional<00:02:07.519> overhead<00:02:08.209> press<00:02:08.450> or

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
would do an occasional overhead press or

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.259 
would do an occasional overhead press or
like<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.649> push<00:02:09.890> press<00:02:10.159> as<00:02:10.640> our<00:02:10.879> compound

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
like a push press as our compound

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:12.880 
like a push press as our compound
movement<00:02:11.599> so<00:02:11.690> we<00:02:11.810> would<00:02:12.019> lunches<00:02:12.560> but<00:02:12.769> we

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
movement so we would lunches but we

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.920 
movement so we would lunches but we
would<00:02:13.010> never<00:02:13.190> really<00:02:13.430> do<00:02:13.730> deadlifts<00:02:14.269> so<00:02:14.900> I

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
would never really do deadlifts so I

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.350 
would never really do deadlifts so I
think<00:02:15.290> a<00:02:15.739> combination<00:02:16.040> of<00:02:16.610> never<00:02:16.879> doing<00:02:16.970> them

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
think a combination of never doing them

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.750 
think a combination of never doing them
for<00:02:17.540> four<00:02:17.720> years<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.140> then<00:02:18.709> a<00:02:19.069> combination<00:02:19.370> of

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
for four years and then a combination of

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.520 
for four years and then a combination of
pinching<00:02:20.180> some<00:02:20.360> nerves<00:02:20.569> my<00:02:20.780> lower<00:02:21.019> back<00:02:21.260> in

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
pinching some nerves my lower back in

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.830 
pinching some nerves my lower back in
during<00:02:21.769> high<00:02:21.950> school<00:02:22.220> kind<00:02:22.790> of<00:02:23.000> they<00:02:23.540> kind<00:02:23.750> of

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
during high school kind of they kind of

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.180 
during high school kind of they kind of
scared<00:02:24.110> me<00:02:24.170> away<00:02:24.409> from<00:02:24.470> deadlifts<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:25.099> know

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
scared me away from deadlifts you know

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.369 
scared me away from deadlifts you know
the<00:02:25.640> idea<00:02:25.970> of<00:02:26.120> using<00:02:26.269> my<00:02:26.450> lower<00:02:26.690> back<00:02:26.989> which<00:02:27.230> is

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
the idea of using my lower back which is

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.670 
the idea of using my lower back which is
my<00:02:27.620> injured<00:02:28.010> body<00:02:28.340> part<00:02:28.900> so<00:02:29.900> as<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.200> primary

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
my injured body part so as a primary

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.949 
my injured body part so as a primary
mover<00:02:31.069> in<00:02:31.280> this<00:02:31.610> lift<00:02:31.879> just<00:02:32.360> didn't<00:02:32.659> sound<00:02:32.840> too

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
mover in this lift just didn't sound too

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.750 
mover in this lift just didn't sound too
appealing<00:02:33.080> to<00:02:33.440> me<00:02:33.560> so<00:02:33.830> when<00:02:33.950> I<00:02:34.010> was<00:02:34.099> 18<00:02:34.280> I

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
appealing to me so when I was 18 I

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.550 
appealing to me so when I was 18 I
branched<00:02:35.390> off<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.720> did<00:02:35.840> my<00:02:35.900> own<00:02:36.049> training<00:02:36.290> and

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
branched off I did my own training and

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.410 
branched off I did my own training and
did<00:02:36.650> my<00:02:36.739> own<00:02:36.860> nutrition<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:37.519> just<00:02:38.000> never<00:02:38.090> wanted

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
did my own nutrition I just never wanted

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.059 
did my own nutrition I just never wanted
to<00:02:38.480> incorporate<00:02:38.780> them<00:02:39.200> but<00:02:39.440> you<00:02:39.799> were<00:02:39.920> doing

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
to incorporate them but you were doing

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.270 
to incorporate them but you were doing
365<00:02:40.730> I<00:02:41.300> kind<00:02:41.900> of<00:02:42.020> just<00:02:42.200> I<00:02:42.500> was<00:02:42.740> increasing<00:02:43.190> the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.900 
back straight and that's honestly my
biggest<00:03:19.769> issue<00:03:20.099> is<00:03:20.310> keeping<00:03:20.640> my<00:03:20.730> back

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
biggest issue is keeping my back

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.559 
biggest issue is keeping my back
straight<00:03:21.620> really<00:03:22.620> on<00:03:22.739> any<00:03:22.920> movement<00:03:23.430> I<00:03:23.700> guess

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
straight really on any movement I guess

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.600 
straight really on any movement I guess
it's<00:03:24.750> just<00:03:24.810> my<00:03:25.049> posture<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:25.620> my<00:03:26.010> pinched

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
it's just my posture and my pinched

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.640 
it's just my posture and my pinched
nerves<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.180> like<00:03:27.360> my<00:03:27.870> spine<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.470> I've<00:03:28.590> been

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650
