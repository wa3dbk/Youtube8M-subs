00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
co2 and I got the power sand small like

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.450 
co2 and I got the power sand small like
that<00:01:57.300> maybe<00:01:57.660> we<00:01:57.869> could<00:01:58.080> get<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.160> smaller

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
that maybe we could get in a smaller

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.630 
that maybe we could get in a smaller
tank<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.950> then<00:02:02.220> AD<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.020> soil<00:02:04.039> and<00:02:05.039> Mazzoni<00:02:05.490> in

just<00:02:06.330> a<00:02:06.479> smaller<00:02:06.750> bag<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.830> just<00:02:08.899> just<00:02:09.899> these

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
just a smaller bag so just just these

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.360 
just a smaller bag so just just these
two<00:02:10.739> bags<00:02:10.950> would<00:02:11.280> public<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:11.940> cuz<00:02:12.239> it's<00:02:12.390> Hank

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
two bags would public you cuz it's Hank

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.620

so<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.459> can<00:02:14.610> probably<00:02:14.790> kind<00:02:15.209> of<00:02:15.269> guess<00:02:15.450> it's

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
so you can probably kind of guess it's

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.140 
so you can probably kind of guess it's
gonna<00:02:15.720> be<00:02:15.900> awesome<00:02:16.110> nano<00:02:16.590> or<00:02:16.980> smaller

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.420

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
get soil in it and then final item in

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:38.180
