better and then we have our zip ties in

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.920 
better and then we have our zip ties in
order<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.690> mount<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.559> flag<00:01:02.239> using<00:01:03.239> pull<00:01:03.449> from<00:01:03.809> my

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
order to mount a flag using pull from my

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.770 
order to mount a flag using pull from my
pole<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.229> just<00:01:04.589> used<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:05.100> standard<00:01:05.670> PVC<00:01:06.119> pipe<00:01:06.630> I

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
pole I just used a standard PVC pipe I

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.050 
pole I just used a standard PVC pipe I
spray<00:01:07.229> painted<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.710> black<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.970> drilled<00:01:11.060> two

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
spray painted it black and I drilled two

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.410 
spray painted it black and I drilled two
holes<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.630> top<00:01:12.869> 34<00:01:13.619> inches<00:01:13.920> apart<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.640> order

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
holes the top 34 inches apart in order

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.330 
holes the top 34 inches apart in order
to<00:01:15.750> mount<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.320> flag<00:01:16.560> which<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.009> three<00:01:17.220> by

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
to mount the flag which is in three by

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.890 
to mount the flag which is in three by
five<00:01:17.549> flag<00:01:17.880> that's<00:01:18.150> usually<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.630> standard

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
five flag that's usually the standard

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.740 
five flag that's usually the standard
since<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:19.590> 36<00:01:20.189> inches<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.820> it's<00:01:21.150> one<00:01:21.570> inch

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
since it's 36 inches and it's one inch

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.820 
since it's 36 inches and it's one inch
higher<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.820> lower

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
higher and lower

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.539 
higher and lower
so<00:01:25.830> my<00:01:26.280> truck<00:01:26.610> bed<00:01:26.820> has<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.030> liner<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.780> and

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
so my truck bed has a liner in it and

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.410 
so my truck bed has a liner in it and
therefore<00:01:29.549> I'm<00:01:29.820> going<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.030> use<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.150> plastic

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
therefore I'm going to use a plastic

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.109 
therefore I'm going to use a plastic
adhesive<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.549> either<00:01:32.729> make<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.000> can

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
adhesive and you can either make you can

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.310 
adhesive and you can either make you can
mount<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.390> pretty<00:01:33.630> much<00:01:33.750> anywhere<00:01:34.140> if<00:01:34.259> you

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
mount this pretty much anywhere if you

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.710 
mount this pretty much anywhere if you
want<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.500> put<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.740> more<00:01:34.950> towards<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:36.119> front<00:01:36.570> of

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
want to put it more towards the front of

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.749 
want to put it more towards the front of
the<00:01:36.780> cab<00:01:37.079> or<00:01:37.560> if<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.950> want<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.130> put<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.490> towards

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
the cab or if you want to put it towards

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.590 
the cab or if you want to put it towards
the<00:01:38.880> back<00:01:39.210> I'm<00:01:39.960> gonna<00:01:40.350> mount<00:01:40.530> mine<00:01:41.210> right<00:01:42.210> here

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
the back I'm gonna mount mine right here

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.240 
the back I'm gonna mount mine right here
and<00:01:42.810> notice<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.530> have<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.710> little<00:01:43.860> bit<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.130> room

and notice I have a little bit of room
on<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.490> bottom<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:45.060> it's<00:01:45.570> not<00:01:45.720> sticking<00:01:46.049> up

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
on the bottom and it's not sticking up

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.050 
on the bottom and it's not sticking up
over<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.470> top<00:01:46.649> because<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.790> don't<00:01:47.939> really

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
over the top because you don't really

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.120 
over the top because you don't really
want<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.299> be<00:01:48.439> driving<00:01:49.439> around<00:01:49.470> with<00:01:49.890> something

do<00:03:52.720> is<00:03:52.900> I'm<00:03:53.049> going<00:03:53.080> to<00:03:53.290> apply<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.010> PVC<00:03:54.670> pipe

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
do is I'm going to apply the PVC pipe

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.850 
do is I'm going to apply the PVC pipe
and<00:03:56.250> j-b<00:03:57.250> weld<00:03:57.280> and<00:03:58.440> then<00:03:59.440> I'm<00:03:59.530> just<00:03:59.620> going<00:03:59.830> to

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
and j-b weld and then I'm just going to

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.280 
and j-b weld and then I'm just going to
duct<00:04:00.070> tape<00:04:00.280> it<00:04:00.430> down<00:04:00.610> to<00:04:00.970> hold<00:04:01.209> it<00:04:01.390> when<00:04:02.140> it

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
duct tape it down to hold it when it

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.320 
duct tape it down to hold it when it
cures<00:04:02.590> it<00:04:02.739> takes<00:04:02.890> about<00:04:02.980> 25<00:04:03.549> minutes<00:04:03.790> to<00:04:04.030> set

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
cures it takes about 25 minutes to set

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.500 
cures it takes about 25 minutes to set
and<00:04:04.600> three<00:04:05.500> hours<00:04:05.620> you<00:04:05.890> cure<00:04:06.220> so<00:04:07.060> here<00:04:07.360> we're

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
and three hours you cure so here we're

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.550 
and three hours you cure so here we're
going<00:04:07.600> to<00:04:07.720> do<00:04:07.840> this<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.110> next<00:04:08.260> step<00:04:10.410> so<00:04:11.410> it

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
going to do this the next step so it

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.920 
going to do this the next step so it
turns<00:04:11.799> out<00:04:11.980> that<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.430> jb<00:04:13.359> weld<00:04:13.540> actually

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
turns out that the jb weld actually

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:14.740 
turns out that the jb weld actually
doesn't<00:04:14.170> need<00:04:14.350> to

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
doesn't need to

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.130 
doesn't need to
it's<00:04:14.960> a<00:04:15.050> putty<00:04:15.950> material<00:04:16.579> right<00:04:16.760> here<00:04:16.959> so<00:04:17.959> just

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
it's a putty material right here so just

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.990 
it's a putty material right here so just
going<00:04:18.260> to<00:04:18.380> pop<00:04:18.829> this<00:04:19.070> out<00:04:19.310> and<00:04:21.610> it<00:04:22.610> comes<00:04:22.820> in<00:04:22.940> a

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
going to pop this out and it comes in a

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.270 
going to pop this out and it comes in a
little<00:04:23.150> plastic<00:04:23.690> thing<00:04:23.960> so<00:04:24.500> I'm<00:04:25.010> just<00:04:25.160> going

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
little plastic thing so I'm just going

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.760 
little plastic thing so I'm just going
to<00:04:25.310> take<00:04:25.580> it<00:04:25.880> all<00:04:26.330> off<00:04:26.360> and<00:04:26.990> you're<00:04:27.590> going<00:04:27.680> to

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
to take it all off and you're going to

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.480 
to take it all off and you're going to
cut<00:04:28.070> two<00:04:28.340> them<00:04:28.520> out<00:04:28.730> you<00:04:28.940> need<00:04:30.100> almost<00:04:31.100> this

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
cut two them out you need almost this

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.220 
cut two them out you need almost this
whole<00:04:31.820> thing<00:04:32.120> and<00:04:32.570> then<00:04:32.930> you're<00:04:33.050> going<00:04:33.140> to

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
whole thing and then you're going to

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:42.180 
whole thing and then you're going to
hold<00:04:33.740> it<00:04:33.950> show<00:04:34.910> you<00:04:39.880> comes<00:04:40.880> in<00:04:41.060> two<00:04:41.270> colors<00:04:41.780> the

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
hold it show you comes in two colors the

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.670 
hold it show you comes in two colors the
hardening<00:04:43.190> stuff<00:04:43.520> and<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:43.940> regular<00:04:44.390> adhesive

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
hardening stuff and the regular adhesive

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
hardening stuff and the regular adhesive
so<00:04:45.680> there's<00:04:45.800> going<00:04:45.890> to<00:04:45.950> cut<00:04:46.220> to<00:04:46.400> the<00:04:46.520> amount

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
so there's going to cut to the amount

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.020 
so there's going to cut to the amount
you<00:04:46.850> need<00:04:46.880> and<00:04:47.240> mix<00:04:47.630> up<00:04:47.810> in<00:04:47.930> hand<00:04:48.290> and<00:04:48.500> a<00:04:49.030> apply

to PVC pipe and press down hard to the

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.670 
to PVC pipe and press down hard to the
roughed<00:04:52.580> up<00:04:52.700> air<00:04:52.910> on<00:04:53.060> the<00:04:53.150> bedliner<00:04:53.480> duct<00:04:54.470> tape

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
roughed up air on the bedliner duct tape

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.670 
roughed up air on the bedliner duct tape
it<00:04:54.860> and<00:04:54.890> you'll<00:04:55.580> be<00:04:55.610> set<00:04:56.320> high<00:04:57.320> so<00:04:57.590> you're

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
it and you'll be set high so you're

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.800 
it and you'll be set high so you're
going<00:04:57.860> to<00:04:57.950> want<00:04:58.430> to<00:04:58.490> apply<00:04:58.610> about<00:04:59.030> that<00:04:59.510> much

it's actually a little much but you
don't<00:05:02.840> need<00:05:02.930> to<00:05:03.080> it's<00:05:04.010> okay<00:05:04.280> if<00:05:04.370> you<00:05:04.490> have<00:05:04.520> just

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820

a little bit more a little less than

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.000 
a little bit more a little less than
that<00:05:06.440> but<00:05:07.070> you're<00:05:07.280> someone<00:05:07.520> a<00:05:07.550> nice<00:05:07.820> even<00:05:08.240> coat

that but you're someone a nice even coat
for<00:05:10.010> to<00:05:10.100> be<00:05:10.190> pliable<00:05:10.520> it's<00:05:10.790> gonna<00:05:10.880> be<00:05:11.030> really

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
for to be pliable it's gonna be really

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.180 
for to be pliable it's gonna be really
gummy<00:05:11.510> when<00:05:11.840> you<00:05:11.930> touch<00:05:12.110> it<00:05:12.350> I'm<00:05:12.919> just<00:05:13.070> gonna

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
gummy when you touch it I'm just gonna

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.670 
gummy when you touch it I'm just gonna
take<00:05:13.430> it<00:05:16.720> and<00:05:17.720> just<00:05:17.780> apply<00:05:18.169> it<00:05:18.200> to<00:05:18.380> where<00:05:18.590> you

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
take it and just apply it to where you

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.650 
take it and just apply it to where you
scratched<00:05:19.100> out<00:05:19.430> and<00:05:20.000> you<00:05:20.120> want<00:05:20.180> to<00:05:20.300> push<00:05:20.480> down

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
scratched out and you want to push down

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:30.129 
scratched out and you want to push down
really<00:05:20.690> hard

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:32.900 

all<00:05:31.139> right<00:05:31.289> so<00:05:31.560> it's<00:05:31.889> been<00:05:32.130> hardening<00:05:32.639> for

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
all right so it's been hardening for

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.570 
all right so it's been hardening for
about<00:05:33.120> three<00:05:33.539> hours<00:05:33.750> now<00:05:34.199> and<00:05:34.620> here<00:05:35.310> going<00:05:35.520> to

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
about three hours now and here going to

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.029 
about three hours now and here going to
give<00:05:35.699> it<00:05:35.789> a<00:05:35.849> little<00:05:35.970> test<00:05:36.389> to<00:05:36.690> see<00:05:36.919> did<00:05:37.919> it

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
give it a little test to see did it

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:41.150 
give it a little test to see did it
properly<00:05:38.520> should<00:05:38.669> be<00:05:38.970> pretty<00:05:39.860> pretty<00:05:40.860> durable

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
properly should be pretty pretty durable

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.670 
properly should be pretty pretty durable
I<00:05:41.460> mean<00:05:41.699> it's<00:05:41.910> not<00:05:42.060> really<00:05:42.210> going<00:05:43.139> anywhere

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
I mean it's not really going anywhere

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.850 
I mean it's not really going anywhere
and<00:05:43.830> I'm<00:05:43.949> giving<00:05:44.639> it<00:05:44.729> enough<00:05:45.000> force<00:05:45.740> but<00:05:46.740> I'm

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
and I'm giving it enough force but I'm

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.120 
and I'm giving it enough force but I'm
going<00:05:47.009> to<00:05:47.069> let<00:05:47.190> it<00:05:47.280> sit<00:05:47.460> overnight<00:05:47.699> and<00:05:48.120> then

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
going to let it sit overnight and then

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.930 
going to let it sit overnight and then
spray-paint<00:05:50.130> it<00:05:50.280> because<00:05:50.520> it<00:05:50.610> dries<00:05:50.789> a<00:05:50.819> little

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
spray-paint it because it dries a little

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.790 
spray-paint it because it dries a little
whitish<00:05:51.449> color<00:05:51.660> and<00:05:51.960> I<00:05:52.020> don't<00:05:52.080> want<00:05:52.590> it<00:05:52.680> to

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
whitish color and I don't want it to

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.100 
whitish color and I don't want it to
stick<00:05:53.039> out<00:05:53.250> very<00:05:53.520> much<00:05:53.610> but<00:05:54.150> yeah<00:05:54.960> you're
