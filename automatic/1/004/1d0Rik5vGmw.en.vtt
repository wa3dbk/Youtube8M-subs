studied in the store as body fat but you

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.120

will be very very very very little fat
for<00:03:39.370> fuel<00:03:39.520> like<00:03:39.850> you'll<00:03:40.150> be<00:03:40.209> lucky<00:03:40.720> if<00:03:41.110> your

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.930 
body burns 300 calories of fat for fuel
a<00:03:43.780> day<00:03:44.020> it<00:03:44.500> will<00:03:44.650> be<00:03:44.770> burning<00:03:45.040> glucose<00:03:45.610> and

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
a day it will be burning glucose and

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.100 
a day it will be burning glucose and
that's<00:03:46.300> what<00:03:46.450> it<00:03:46.540> will<00:03:46.630> pick<00:03:46.840> as<00:03:46.959> its

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
that's what it will pick as its

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.600 
that's what it will pick as its

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
predominant fuel source and it will burn

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.530 
predominant fuel source and it will burn
it<00:03:48.790> off<00:03:49.590> which<00:03:50.590> means<00:03:50.860> any<00:03:51.070> fat<00:03:51.370> you<00:03:51.400> eat<00:03:51.610> over

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
it off which means any fat you eat over

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.750 
it off which means any fat you eat over
about<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:53.080> to<00:03:53.260> 300<00:03:53.890> calorie<00:03:54.190> mark<00:03:54.459> is<00:03:54.580> going

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
about the to 300 calorie mark is going

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.430 
about the to 300 calorie mark is going
to<00:03:54.850> get<00:03:54.970> stored<00:03:55.330> so<00:03:55.600> what<00:03:55.750> I<00:03:55.780> tell<00:03:56.020> people<00:03:56.200> is

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
to get stored so what I tell people is

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.630 
to get stored so what I tell people is
if<00:03:56.709> you're<00:03:57.040> eating<00:03:57.600> 900<00:03:58.600> calories<00:03:58.810> of<00:03:59.230> fat

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
if you're eating 900 calories of fat

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.020 
if you're eating 900 calories of fat
expect<00:04:00.640> 5<00:04:00.850> 600<00:04:01.650> or<00:04:02.650> more<00:04:03.070> calories<00:04:03.310> of<00:04:03.730> it<00:04:03.850> to

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
expect 5 600 or more calories of it to

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.370 
expect 5 600 or more calories of it to
get<00:04:04.180> stored<00:04:04.750> as<00:04:05.050> body<00:04:05.560> fat<00:04:06.070> on<00:04:06.220> that<00:04:06.250> day<00:04:06.580> and

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
get stored as body fat on that day and

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.870 
get stored as body fat on that day and
that<00:04:08.380> in<00:04:08.560> turn<00:04:08.739> equals<00:04:08.950> a<00:04:09.220> few<00:04:09.400> ounces<00:04:09.550> you

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
that in turn equals a few ounces you

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.310 
that in turn equals a few ounces you
could<00:04:10.030> gain<00:04:10.180> a<00:04:10.209> couple<00:04:10.420> of<00:04:10.570> the<00:04:10.840> body<00:04:10.989> fat<00:04:11.170> so

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
could gain a couple of the body fat so

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.320 
could gain a couple of the body fat so
don't<00:04:11.500> do<00:04:11.650> that<00:04:11.800> cut<00:04:12.070> your<00:04:12.280> fat<00:04:12.550> down<00:04:12.760> to<00:04:13.060> no

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
don't do that cut your fat down to no

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.140 
don't do that cut your fat down to no
more<00:04:13.480> than<00:04:13.540> 10<00:04:13.870> percent<00:04:14.230> of<00:04:14.320> your<00:04:14.380> calories

more than 10 percent of your calories

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.940 
more than 10 percent of your calories
for<00:04:16.150> just<00:04:16.419> that<00:04:16.600> one<00:04:16.870> day<00:04:17.109> and<00:04:17.350> then<00:04:17.470> boost<00:04:17.680> it

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
for just that one day and then boost it

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.490 
for just that one day and then boost it
back<00:04:18.130> up<00:04:18.400> after<00:04:18.580> a<00:04:19.150> refeed<00:04:19.720> like<00:04:19.959> that<00:04:20.169> and<00:04:20.410> if

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
back up after a refeed like that and if

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.710 
back up after a refeed like that and if
you<00:04:20.620> do<00:04:20.830> that<00:04:21.010> you'll<00:04:21.310> probably<00:04:21.609> equalize<00:04:22.419> out

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
you do that you'll probably equalize out

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.520 
you do that you'll probably equalize out
you<00:04:22.960> won't<00:04:23.110> gain

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
you won't gain

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.680 
you won't gain
any<00:04:23.770> fat<00:04:24.070> on<00:04:24.250> that<00:04:24.430> day<00:04:24.610> because<00:04:25.540> you'll

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
any fat on that day because you'll

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.660 
any fat on that day because you'll
probably<00:04:25.720> burn<00:04:26.350> right<00:04:26.650> about<00:04:27.010> the<00:04:27.250> amount<00:04:27.550> of

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
probably burn right about the amount of

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:28.800 
probably burn right about the amount of
fat<00:04:27.850> that<00:04:27.880> you<00:04:28.030> eat<00:04:28.240> and<00:04:28.420> then<00:04:28.600> all<00:04:28.720> the

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
fat that you eat and then all the

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.170 
fat that you eat and then all the
glucose<00:04:29.230> will<00:04:29.500> be<00:04:29.650> used<00:04:29.950> for<00:04:30.130> fuel<00:04:30.370> and<00:04:30.400> stored

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
glucose will be used for fuel and stored

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.340 
glucose will be used for fuel and stored
in<00:04:31.300> muscle<00:04:31.570> glycogen<00:04:31.660> and<00:04:32.050> liver<00:04:32.200> glycogen

in muscle glycogen and liver glycogen

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.560 
in muscle glycogen and liver glycogen
and<00:04:32.710> that's<00:04:32.860> what<00:04:32.950> you<00:04:33.070> want<00:04:33.340> for<00:04:34.300> later

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
and that's what you want for later

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:35.820 
and that's what you want for later
performance<00:04:35.110> in<00:04:35.200> the<00:04:35.290> week<00:04:35.440> and<00:04:35.590> to<00:04:35.680> get<00:04:35.800> a

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
performance in the week and to get a

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.520 
performance in the week and to get a
very<00:04:36.010> large<00:04:36.130> anabolic<00:04:36.790> effect<00:04:37.090> that<00:04:37.240> day<00:04:37.530> so

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
very large anabolic effect that day so

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.800 
very large anabolic effect that day so
it's<00:04:38.710> very<00:04:38.950> low-fat<00:04:39.400> that<00:04:39.610> day<00:04:39.790> and<00:04:40.090> also<00:04:40.330> that

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
it's very low-fat that day and also that

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.240 
it's very low-fat that day and also that
will<00:04:41.050> not<00:04:41.290> hurt<00:04:41.650> you<00:04:41.830> if<00:04:41.980> you're<00:04:42.130> getting

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
will not hurt you if you're getting

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.940 
will not hurt you if you're getting
sufficient<00:04:42.610> fat<00:04:43.240> on<00:04:43.600> say<00:04:44.200> three<00:04:44.500> days<00:04:44.680> and

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
sufficient fat on say three days and

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.530 
sufficient fat on say three days and
then<00:04:45.040> you<00:04:45.100> take<00:04:45.280> one<00:04:45.520> day<00:04:45.700> a<00:04:45.730> low-fat<00:04:46.150> or<00:04:46.389> you

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
then you take one day a low-fat or you

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.080 
then you take one day a low-fat or you
do<00:04:46.660> five<00:04:46.930> days<00:04:47.230> of<00:04:47.590> solid<00:04:48.520> fat<00:04:48.669> under<00:04:48.970> the

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
do five days of solid fat under the

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.210 
do five days of solid fat under the
weekends<00:04:49.540> to<00:04:49.660> refeed<00:04:50.080> you're<00:04:50.680> not<00:04:50.800> gonna<00:04:50.950> have

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
weekends to refeed you're not gonna have

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.920 
weekends to refeed you're not gonna have
hormonal<00:04:51.730> issues<00:04:52.090> from<00:04:52.270> that<00:04:52.419> that's<00:04:52.600> not

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
hormonal issues from that that's not

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.520 
hormonal issues from that that's not
going<00:04:53.200> to<00:04:53.290> happen<00:04:53.710> it<00:04:53.860> is<00:04:53.889> very<00:04:54.040> low<00:04:54.520> fat

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530
