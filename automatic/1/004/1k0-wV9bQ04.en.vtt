00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
i painted it with the chassis saver set

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.040 
i painted it with the chassis saver set
in<00:03:10.950> black<00:03:11.070> and<00:03:11.340> it's<00:03:11.460> drying<00:03:11.760> up<00:03:12.000> but<00:03:12.660> we<00:03:12.840> have

in black and it's drying up but we have
the<00:03:13.230> Eastwood<00:03:13.860> rust<00:03:14.280> encapsulator<00:03:14.690> with<00:03:15.690> the

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
the Eastwood rust encapsulator with the

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.880 
the Eastwood rust encapsulator with the
PIO<00:03:16.350> our<00:03:16.640> or<00:03:17.780> chassis<00:03:18.780> saver<00:03:18.990> black<00:03:19.290> on<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.590> and

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
PIO our or chassis saver black on it and

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.650 
PIO our or chassis saver black on it and
that<00:03:20.310> looks<00:03:20.430> really<00:03:20.700> super<00:03:21.150> cool<00:03:21.330> and<00:03:21.360> it's

on the real bees and adjustables but

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.080 
on the real bees and adjustables but
that<00:03:36.870> looks<00:03:37.080> great<00:03:37.320> so<00:03:38.220> let's<00:03:38.430> keep<00:03:38.550> going<00:03:38.610> on

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
taking a look at our lift kit alright

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.460 
taking a look at our lift kit alright
here's<00:03:42.450> our<00:03:42.540> lift<00:03:42.780> kit<00:03:42.990> comes<00:03:43.230> with<00:03:43.320> the

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
here's our lift kit comes with the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.990 
here's our lift kit comes with the
instructions<00:03:43.980> in<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.220> bag<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.730> all<00:03:44.790> the

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
instructions in the bag and all the

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.760 
instructions in the bag and all the
springs<00:03:45.330> yada<00:03:45.870> yada<00:03:46.110> we're<00:03:46.380> going<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.560> be<00:03:46.650> in

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
springs yada yada we're going to be in

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.280 
springs yada yada we're going to be in
practicing<00:03:47.520> those<00:03:47.700> but<00:03:48.420> it<00:03:48.540> looks<00:03:48.750> good<00:03:48.960> man

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
practicing those but it looks good man

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.180 
practicing those but it looks good man
and<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:49.860> is<00:03:50.010> pretty<00:03:50.250> heavy<00:03:51.710> one<00:03:52.710> of<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:52.950> things

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
and it is pretty heavy one of the things

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.230 
and it is pretty heavy one of the things
that<00:03:53.340> I<00:03:53.370> would<00:03:53.580> say<00:03:53.760> when<00:03:53.940> you're<00:03:54.060> installing

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
that I would say when you're installing

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.000 
that I would say when you're installing
a<00:03:54.600> lift<00:03:54.810> kit<00:03:54.990> is<00:03:55.170> make<00:03:55.350> sure<00:03:55.530> you<00:03:55.710> take<00:03:55.890> the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
a lift kit is make sure you take the

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.530 
a lift kit is make sure you take the
time<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.370> read<00:03:56.520> the<00:03:56.670> stinking<00:03:57.030> instructions

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
time to read the stinking instructions

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.760 
time to read the stinking instructions
because<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:58.050> know<00:03:58.140> I<00:03:58.170> can<00:03:58.470> look<00:03:58.560> at<00:03:58.680> the

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
because you know I can look at the

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
because you know I can look at the
spring<00:03:58.980> and<00:03:59.130> go<00:03:59.190> well<00:03:59.310> that<00:03:59.340> goes<00:03:59.550> on<00:03:59.700> the

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
spring and go well that goes on the

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.280 
spring and go well that goes on the
front<00:04:00.030> but<00:04:00.660> you<00:04:00.690> know<00:04:00.840> what<00:04:00.990> there<00:04:01.140> may<00:04:01.260> be

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
front but you know what there may be

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.840 
front but you know what there may be
something<00:04:01.620> in<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:01.980> instructions<00:04:02.520> that<00:04:02.580> say

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
something in the instructions that say

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.410 
something in the instructions that say
hey<00:04:03.590> reuse<00:04:04.590> this<00:04:04.860> bolt<00:04:05.190> or<00:04:05.460> this<00:04:05.700> bolt<00:04:05.940> must<00:04:06.150> be

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
hey reuse this bolt or this bolt must be

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.600 
hey reuse this bolt or this bolt must be
saved<00:04:07.050> and<00:04:07.260> put<00:04:07.620> on<00:04:07.740> later<00:04:08.010> you<00:04:08.370> know<00:04:08.460> those

putting<00:04:19.500> on<00:04:19.590> these<00:04:19.770> front<00:04:20.010> strings<00:04:20.310> which<00:04:20.489> are

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
putting on these front strings which are

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.150 
putting on these front strings which are
the<00:04:20.760> longer<00:04:21.239> ones<00:04:21.450> and<00:04:21.690> I'll<00:04:22.320> be<00:04:22.470> unboxing<00:04:22.979> all

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
but awesome okay so I've got the poly

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.130 
but awesome okay so I've got the poly
oscillator<00:04:31.160> on<00:04:31.370> here<00:04:31.820> which<00:04:32.660> was<00:04:32.870> really<00:04:33.020> a

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
oscillator on here which was really a

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.660 
oscillator on here which was really a
bitch<00:04:33.380> to<00:04:33.590> get<00:04:33.680> it<00:04:33.800> over<00:04:33.950> that<00:04:34.040> edge<00:04:34.250> but<00:04:34.520> now

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
bitch to get it over that edge but now

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.640 
bitch to get it over that edge but now
we're<00:04:34.790> going<00:04:34.880> to<00:04:34.970> put<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.240> spring<00:04:35.540> on<00:04:35.690> I<00:04:35.990> can

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
we're going to put the spring on I can

got to put my clip down here you can see
where<00:06:08.050> the<00:06:08.880> spring<00:06:09.880> goes<00:06:10.150> into<00:06:10.390> that<00:06:10.510> little

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
where the spring goes into that little
