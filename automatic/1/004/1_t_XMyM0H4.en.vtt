driving with it but uh when I first
started<00:05:58.990> driving<00:05:59.110> golf<00:05:59.500> I<00:05:59.800> was<00:05:59.980> very

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.190 
started driving golf I was very

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.610 
started driving golf I was very
uncomfortable<00:06:00.580> so<00:06:01.270> I<00:06:01.300> always<00:06:01.690> use<00:06:01.900> the<00:06:02.320> stick

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
uncomfortable so I always use the stick

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:09.070 
uncomfortable so I always use the stick
but<00:06:03.220> on<00:06:03.340> the<00:06:03.430> turn<00:06:03.670> like<00:06:03.940> this

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:19.460 

I<00:06:09.189> use<00:06:10.189> it<00:06:10.449> put<00:06:11.449> a<00:06:11.509> u-turn

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:24.500 

we're<00:06:19.980> off<00:06:20.160> and<00:06:20.930> again<00:06:21.930> you<00:06:22.560> got<00:06:22.800> pool<00:06:23.510> about

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
we're off and again you got pool about

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.240 
we're off and again you got pool about
to<00:06:24.690> pick<00:06:24.900> up<00:06:25.050> a<00:06:25.140> little<00:06:25.350> speed<00:06:25.500> right<00:06:25.950> here

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
to pick up a little speed right here

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.770 
to pick up a little speed right here
cool<00:06:27.530> there<00:06:28.530> we<00:06:28.650> go

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
cool there we go

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:35.360 
cool there we go
slow<00:06:30.780> down<00:06:31.020> it's<00:06:31.290> just<00:06:31.350> a<00:06:31.590> break<00:06:33.950> now<00:06:34.950> for<00:06:35.190> me<00:06:35.340> I

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
slow down it's just a break now for me I

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.420 
slow down it's just a break now for me I
think<00:06:35.610> the<00:06:36.060> foot<00:06:36.330> is<00:06:36.990> stronger<00:06:37.710> than<00:06:38.040> the<00:06:38.190> hand

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
think the foot is stronger than the hand

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.240 
think the foot is stronger than the hand
well<00:06:38.760> I<00:06:38.790> know<00:06:38.970> it<00:06:39.240> is<00:06:39.420> but<00:06:40.290> I<00:06:40.590> believe<00:06:41.100> the

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.250 
well I know it is but I believe the

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.150 
well I know it is but I believe the
hands<00:06:41.550> are<00:06:41.760> quicker<00:06:42.030> than<00:06:42.150> the<00:06:42.420> foot<00:06:42.690> so<00:06:43.530> you

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 
hands are quicker than the foot so you

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.740 
hands are quicker than the foot so you
know<00:06:44.310> you<00:06:44.370> practice<00:06:44.970> you'll<00:06:45.180> get<00:06:45.420> some<00:06:45.570> good

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
know you practice you'll get some good

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.590 
know you practice you'll get some good
reaction<00:06:46.320> time<00:06:46.550> and<00:06:47.550> Here<00:06:47.730> I<00:06:47.760> am<00:06:47.880> back<00:06:48.330> in<00:06:48.510> the

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:48.600 
reaction time and Here I am back in the

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:54.110 
reaction time and Here I am back in the
driveway<00:06:49.700> I'm<00:06:50.700> going<00:06:50.910> to<00:06:51.030> push<00:06:52.020> it<00:06:52.050> down<00:06:53.120> put

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
driveway I'm going to push it down put

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.260 
driveway I'm going to push it down put
it<00:06:54.240> in<00:06:54.360> park
