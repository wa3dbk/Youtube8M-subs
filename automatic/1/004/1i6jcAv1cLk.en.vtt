comparing it here to the mix to the 11
inch<00:03:28.489> version<00:03:28.880> just<00:03:29.180> so<00:03:29.239> you<00:03:29.329> can<00:03:29.420> see<00:03:29.569> the

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
inch version just so you can see the

the mix 2 is larger at 11.6 a bigger
tablet<00:03:39.170> there<00:03:39.350> I<00:03:39.560> want<00:03:39.920> to<00:03:40.010> show<00:03:40.130> you<00:03:40.190> the

tablet there I want to show you the
thickness<00:03:40.790> here<00:03:40.940> so<00:03:41.120> if<00:03:41.180> we<00:03:41.209> could<00:03:41.389> be<00:03:41.480> a

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
thickness here so if we could be a

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.900 
thickness here so if we could be a
better<00:03:41.720> idea<00:03:41.900> again<00:03:42.650> on<00:03:42.859> the<00:03:43.010> left<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:43.579> yoga

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
mix 2 so as you can see it is thicker

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.020 
mix 2 so as you can see it is thicker
but<00:03:48.799> not<00:03:48.920> a<00:03:48.950> great<00:03:49.160> deal<00:03:49.280> thicker<00:03:49.730> than<00:03:49.940> the

yoga tablet now back to that hinge which
we<00:03:51.859> are<00:03:51.950> clearly<00:03:52.400> obsessed<00:03:52.609> with<00:03:53.030> showing<00:03:53.930> it

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
we are clearly obsessed with showing it

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:55.960 
we are clearly obsessed with showing it
somewhat<00:03:54.440> in<00:03:54.530> slow<00:03:54.709> motion<00:03:54.920> here<00:03:55.250> as<00:03:55.400> you<00:03:55.639> open

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
somewhat in slow motion here as you open

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.849 
somewhat in slow motion here as you open
it<00:03:56.060> up<00:03:56.150> from<00:03:56.359> a<00:03:56.450> side<00:03:56.660> angle<00:03:56.690> it<00:03:57.349> just<00:03:57.650> slides

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
it up from a side angle it just slides

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.740 
it up from a side angle it just slides
right<00:03:58.130> into<00:03:58.370> place<00:03:58.670> there's<00:03:59.299> nothing<00:03:59.630> to

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
right into place there's nothing to

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.690 
right into place there's nothing to
click<00:04:00.019> in<00:04:00.170> nothing<00:04:00.560> to<00:04:00.709> attach<00:04:01.040> and<00:04:01.340> that's

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
click in nothing to attach and that's

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.460 
click in nothing to attach and that's
almost<00:04:02.000> magical<00:04:02.540> and<00:04:02.720> that<00:04:02.780> functional

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
almost magical and that functional

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.170 
almost magical and that functional
difference<00:04:03.920> really<00:04:04.400> takes<00:04:04.700> us<00:04:04.819> from<00:04:04.880> a<00:04:05.030> kind

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
difference really takes us from a kind

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.030 
difference really takes us from a kind
of<00:04:05.239> technical<00:04:05.660> marble<00:04:06.109> to<00:04:06.319> a<00:04:06.349> real<00:04:06.530> functional

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
of technical marble to a real functional

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.309 
of technical marble to a real functional
marble<00:04:07.430> you<00:04:08.120> tilted<00:04:08.450> about<00:04:08.630> 10<00:04:08.840> degrees<00:04:08.930> here

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
marble you tilted about 10 degrees here

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:10.870 
marble you tilted about 10 degrees here
and<00:04:09.500> it<00:04:09.650> pulls<00:04:09.859> right<00:04:09.950> down<00:04:10.190> into<00:04:10.459> tablet<00:04:10.849> mode

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
and it pulls right down into tablet mode

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.309 
and it pulls right down into tablet mode
so<00:04:11.180> it's<00:04:11.299> not<00:04:11.389> like<00:04:11.569> you<00:04:11.810> don't<00:04:11.959> even<00:04:12.079> have<00:04:12.169> to

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
so it's not like you don't even have to

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.319 
so it's not like you don't even have to
hold<00:04:12.470> the<00:04:12.650> keyboard<00:04:13.040> down<00:04:13.220> click<00:04:13.910> anything<00:04:14.120> to

hold the keyboard down click anything to
detach<00:04:14.690> it<00:04:14.930> it's<00:04:15.139> just<00:04:15.260> by<00:04:15.470> what<00:04:15.739> angle<00:04:16.220> the

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
detach it it's just by what angle the

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
you can close it up as we're showing

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.360 
you can close it up as we're showing
here<00:04:20.479> the<00:04:21.049> magnet<00:04:21.380> will<00:04:21.530> pull<00:04:21.709> it<00:04:21.829> in<00:04:21.979> and<00:04:22.190> now

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
here the magnet will pull it in and now

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.860 
here the magnet will pull it in and now
it<00:04:22.520> is<00:04:22.669> covering<00:04:23.060> the<00:04:23.150> keyboard

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
it is covering the keyboard

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.689 
it is covering the keyboard
and<00:04:23.990> looks<00:04:24.139> like<00:04:24.230> a<00:04:24.320> standard<00:04:24.740> laptop<00:04:25.280> again

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
is it just slides into place clicks

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.840 
is it just slides into place clicks
right<00:04:29.750> in<00:04:30.020> nothing<00:04:30.560> to<00:04:30.740> attach<00:04:31.040> now<00:04:31.669> you've

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
right in nothing to attach now you've

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.270 
right in nothing to attach now you've
got<00:04:32.060> it<00:04:32.090> into<00:04:32.389> your<00:04:32.540> laptop<00:04:33.139> mode<00:04:33.590> we're

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
got it into your laptop mode we're

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.400 
got it into your laptop mode we're
holding<00:04:34.610> it<00:04:34.729> up<00:04:34.880> just<00:04:35.330> by<00:04:35.449> the<00:04:35.510> tablet<00:04:35.990> portion

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
holding it up just by the tablet portion

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.050 
holding it up just by the tablet portion
here<00:04:36.650> picking<00:04:36.949> it<00:04:37.190> up<00:04:37.280> we're<00:04:37.550> not<00:04:37.580> holding<00:04:37.910> the

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
here picking it up we're not holding the

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.580 
here picking it up we're not holding the
keyboard<00:04:38.419> at<00:04:38.540> all<00:04:38.630> that<00:04:39.169> thing<00:04:39.320> is<00:04:39.440> not

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
keyboard at all that thing is not

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.200 
keyboard at all that thing is not
falling<00:04:40.040> off<00:04:40.190> so<00:04:40.400> that<00:04:40.430> shows<00:04:40.790> the<00:04:40.940> power<00:04:41.090> of

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
falling off so that shows the power of

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.430 
falling off so that shows the power of
the<00:04:41.360> magnets<00:04:41.750> here<00:04:41.960> which<00:04:42.169> we<00:04:42.320> are<00:04:42.350> very

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
the magnets here which we are very

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.650 
the magnets here which we are very
impressed<00:04:42.740> with<00:04:43.250> and<00:04:44.120> we're<00:04:44.270> going<00:04:44.389> to<00:04:44.449> close

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
impressed with and we're going to close

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.540 
impressed with and we're going to close
it<00:04:44.810> up<00:04:44.870> here<00:04:44.930> and<00:04:45.169> show<00:04:45.350> again<00:04:45.680> now<00:04:46.190> this<00:04:46.370> can

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
it up here and show again now this can

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:47.890 
it up here and show again now this can
come<00:04:46.760> right<00:04:46.910> off<00:04:46.940> at<00:04:47.210> about<00:04:47.300> 10<00:04:47.630> degree<00:04:47.870> angle

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
come right off at about 10 degree angle

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.930 
come right off at about 10 degree angle
now<00:04:48.830> we're<00:04:48.979> looking<00:04:49.070> at<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.400> hinge<00:04:49.639> here<00:04:49.820> so<00:04:49.910> I

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
now we're looking at the hinge here so I

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.159 
now we're looking at the hinge here so I
want<00:04:50.090> to<00:04:50.120> show<00:04:50.240> you<00:04:50.300> one<00:04:50.600> other<00:04:50.810> little

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
want to show you one other little

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:52.780 
want to show you one other little
experiment<00:04:51.680> we<00:04:51.770> did<00:04:51.800> and<00:04:52.100> again<00:04:52.250> this<00:04:52.430> has<00:04:52.760> to

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
experiment we did and again this has to

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.640 
experiment we did and again this has to
go<00:04:52.970> to<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.150> functionality<00:04:53.630> of<00:04:53.870> it<00:04:54.080> one

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
go to the functionality of it one

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.350 
go to the functionality of it one
concern<00:04:54.979> we<00:04:55.160> have<00:04:55.340> was<00:04:55.460> that<00:04:55.610> was<00:04:55.940> this<00:04:56.090> going

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
concern we have was that was this going

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.000 
concern we have was that was this going
to<00:04:56.479> slip<00:04:56.690> off<00:04:56.840> there's<00:04:57.169> nothing<00:04:57.500> holding<00:04:57.710> the

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
to slip off there's nothing holding the

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.310 
to slip off there's nothing holding the
tablet<00:04:58.400> part<00:04:58.729> on<00:04:58.850> is<00:04:59.360> your<00:04:59.570> large<00:04:59.840> 11<00:05:00.139> inch

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
tablet part on is your large 11 inch

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.260 
tablet part on is your large 11 inch
tablet<00:05:00.680> going<00:05:00.830> to<00:05:00.919> slip<00:05:01.160> off<00:05:01.340> we're<00:05:01.940> holding

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
tablet going to slip off we're holding

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.330 
tablet going to slip off we're holding
it<00:05:02.360> here<00:05:02.510> just<00:05:02.960> by<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.139> hinge<00:05:03.470> upside<00:05:04.100> down

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
it here just by the hinge upside down

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.430 
it here just by the hinge upside down
and<00:05:04.610> this<00:05:05.000> is<00:05:05.060> showing<00:05:05.479> it's<00:05:05.690> not<00:05:05.870> coming<00:05:06.169> off

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
and this is showing it's not coming off

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.320 
and this is showing it's not coming off
and<00:05:06.680> again<00:05:06.979> this<00:05:07.250> is<00:05:07.430> not<00:05:07.550> attached<00:05:07.910> in<00:05:08.120> any

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
and again this is not attached in any

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.090 
and again this is not attached in any
way<00:05:08.510> except<00:05:08.840> that<00:05:08.870> magnet<00:05:09.410> but<00:05:09.800> it's<00:05:09.950> not

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
way except that magnet but it's not

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.950 
way except that magnet but it's not
sliding<00:05:10.490> off<00:05:10.790> at<00:05:10.970> all<00:05:11.090> so<00:05:11.479> that's<00:05:11.630> a<00:05:11.750> very

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
sliding off at all so that's a very

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.450 
sliding off at all so that's a very
impressive<00:05:12.290> from<00:05:12.680> a<00:05:12.740> functional<00:05:13.220> standpoint

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
impressive from a functional standpoint

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.360 
impressive from a functional standpoint
on<00:05:13.910> the<00:05:14.090> mix<00:05:14.270> -<00:05:14.570> all<00:05:15.410> right<00:05:15.800> I'll<00:05:15.979> be<00:05:16.070> the<00:05:16.160> first

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
on the mix - all right I'll be the first

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.830 
on the mix - all right I'll be the first
to<00:05:16.490> admit<00:05:16.550> this<00:05:16.760> has<00:05:16.880> been<00:05:17.030> a<00:05:17.060> strange<00:05:17.180> review

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
to admit this has been a strange review

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.440 
to admit this has been a strange review
for<00:05:18.050> the<00:05:18.110> mix<00:05:18.289> -<00:05:18.500> we<00:05:19.010> focus<00:05:19.400> solely<00:05:19.639> on<00:05:19.820> the

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
for the mix - we focus solely on the

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.930 
for the mix - we focus solely on the
functionality<00:05:21.169> of<00:05:21.200> the<00:05:21.530> hinge<00:05:21.830> the<00:05:22.430> keyboard

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
functionality of the hinge the keyboard

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.430 
functionality of the hinge the keyboard
the<00:05:23.270> tablet<00:05:23.690> the<00:05:23.810> different<00:05:24.110> modes<00:05:24.229> but

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
the tablet the different modes but

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.140 
the tablet the different modes but
didn't<00:05:24.740> talk<00:05:24.889> at<00:05:25.070> all<00:05:25.130> about<00:05:25.190> the<00:05:25.460> drivers<00:05:25.970> and

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
didn't talk at all about the drivers and

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.850 
didn't talk at all about the drivers and
how<00:05:26.270> the<00:05:26.330> computer<00:05:26.750> performs<00:05:27.229> there's<00:05:27.800> a

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
how the computer performs there's a

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.320 
how the computer performs there's a
reason<00:05:28.250> for<00:05:28.340> that<00:05:28.460> this<00:05:28.639> is<00:05:28.700> a<00:05:28.850> pre-production

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
reason for that this is a pre-production

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.629 
reason for that this is a pre-production
model<00:05:29.900> final<00:05:30.560> drivers<00:05:30.919> won't<00:05:31.039> be<00:05:31.220> out<00:05:31.340> closer

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
model final drivers won't be out closer

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:33.219 
model final drivers won't be out closer
to<00:05:31.850> April<00:05:32.180> so<00:05:32.330> we<00:05:32.419> didn't<00:05:32.630> feel<00:05:32.780> it<00:05:32.870> was<00:05:32.990> fair

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
to April so we didn't feel it was fair

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:34.930 
to April so we didn't feel it was fair
to<00:05:33.410> really<00:05:33.590> go<00:05:33.710> into<00:05:33.889> the<00:05:34.160> functionality<00:05:34.910> of

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
to really go into the functionality of

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.090 
to really go into the functionality of
the<00:05:35.060> whole<00:05:35.210> computer<00:05:35.720> until<00:05:36.410> we<00:05:36.500> had<00:05:36.680> a<00:05:36.889> full

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
the whole computer until we had a full

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.710 
the whole computer until we had a full
release<00:05:37.400> version<00:05:37.850> so<00:05:38.060> we're<00:05:38.419> just<00:05:38.539> going<00:05:38.660> to

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
release version so we're just going to

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.029 
release version so we're just going to
show<00:05:38.810> you<00:05:38.870> some<00:05:39.110> of<00:05:39.139> the<00:05:39.229> specs<00:05:39.500> here<00:05:39.590> and<00:05:39.889> of

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
show you some of the specs here and of

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:41.469 
show you some of the specs here and of
course<00:05:40.070> we'll<00:05:40.490> be<00:05:40.520> back<00:05:40.789> in<00:05:40.820> April<00:05:41.300> when<00:05:41.450> the

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
course we'll be back in April when the

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:43.180 
course we'll be back in April when the
units<00:05:41.840> out<00:05:41.990> and<00:05:42.260> we<00:05:42.349> can<00:05:42.500> test<00:05:42.740> it<00:05:42.979> out<00:05:43.130> with

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
units out and we can test it out with

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.370 
units out and we can test it out with
all<00:05:43.820> the<00:05:43.940> finalized<00:05:44.599> drivers<00:05:45.020> in<00:05:45.110> there<00:05:45.229> but

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
all the finalized drivers in there but

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.589 
all the finalized drivers in there but
as<00:05:45.470> we<00:05:45.620> said<00:05:45.770> windows<00:05:46.220> 81<00:05:46.760> get<00:05:47.240> about<00:05:47.360> eight

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:47.599 
as we said windows 81 get about eight

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:49.089 
as we said windows 81 get about eight
hours<00:05:47.750> of<00:05:48.020> battery<00:05:48.260> life<00:05:48.320> have<00:05:48.710> not<00:05:48.860> had<00:05:49.070> a
