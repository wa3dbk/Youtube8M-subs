00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:34.170
 we are going to start with the 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.520
 former self and pulse percent so all 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.730

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:09.770
 half the distance it is roughly the 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.770
 does not reach quickly 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.340
 I think about yes and eight out of eight 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.070

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:30.240

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.220
 passages there so we just go whole 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:42.570
 little in the growing 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.570

00:01:44.620 --> 00:02:15.880

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:33.760
 work and action yes but not too much 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:36.180
 because they just knew if they were still going 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.180
