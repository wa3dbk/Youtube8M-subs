00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.490
 Oppan Kim Jong style. 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.490
 Kim Jong style. 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.740
 I'm Kim Jong-un, and I'm not here to entertain you! 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.240
 No, not Kim Jong-il ... I'm sorry for the confusion. 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.480
 Everyone says South Korea makes the best K-pop. 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.490
 But do you know who can do even better? 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.490
 Do you know? 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.240
 I'll let you guess: 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.490
 It is a country whose number-one export is nuclear testing. 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.240
 The national pastime of the people is to be stifled. 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.740
 Did you guess North Korea? Congratulations, because you are the best! 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.740
 You passed the test. 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.490
 And I am the leader; the great successor. 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.240
 Who would have thought? (I!) 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.990
 I should have known. (Yay!) 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.740
 I would put up for election, but who would be the opponent? 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.990
 One of you? 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.490
 Nope! 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.740
 How about you? 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.240
 Nope! 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.990
 Because just like Thor, god of thunder, I was chosen by my father ... 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.490
 K-pop in the Kim Jong style. 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.740
 Kim Jong style. 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.740
 Marching, marching, marching, marching ... 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.240
 Marching in the Kim Jong style. 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.990
 Let's relax a bit ... 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:23.740
 BACK TO WORK! 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.490
 Hey ... 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.240
 Take a look at our navy. 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.490
 Fire! Fire! Shoots Fire! Fire! 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.990
 Flatten party party. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.990
 And... 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.490
 ... nobody is lazy. 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.100
 job 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.600
 Work work 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.000
 Work, work, sleep 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.900
 Work, work, sleep, then work 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.990
 Work, work, sleep, then work, torture! 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.490
 I think you thought the Kim Jong era was almost over. 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.990
 But just like "Friends" and "Scrubs", the whole thing is just a repetition. [Modified] 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.490
 Because I am just like my father and his father Kim Il-sung. 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.240
 Except that they also call me Kim Jong Fun, Number One. 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.740
 I have awesome hair. 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.240
 My dad gave it to me because I'm his horny heritage. 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.740
 You should come to North Korea, because we have great air. 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.490
 Actually, it's the only thing there is to eat, because the food is scarce. 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.490
 Check in with Foursquare *. [* = location-based, social network] 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.490
 I am like the Beatles: 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.990
 I make people cry and scream ... 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.990
 Do you see what I mean? 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.490
 I go swimming, 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.490
 ... I rip up women. 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.490
 Undress yourself! 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.240
 OK! 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.740
 Suck on my toes! 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.740
 Who I? 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.740
 I am Kim Jong-un and I will never be deposed ... 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.490
 Goose dancing. 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.240
 Be sure to smile! 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.740
 Throw them on the pile! 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.740
 Without trial. 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.490
 Kim-Jong style. 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.240

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.740
