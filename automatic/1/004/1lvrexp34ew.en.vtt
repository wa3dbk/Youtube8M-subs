00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.769
 who speaks once more to help bringing 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.400
 one more video for you guys be all 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.140
 Much more welcome to my channel. 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.179
 the guys, how can you guys keep up? 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.969
 bringing another video of gta5 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.340
 very epic here where there is one 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.770
 supposed ice has a supposed diversion of 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.809
 albert einstein who is here in this 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.700
 wall but also this one has this 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.280
 rainbow that would say albert 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.770
 einstein of the ghetto and beyond all he 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.450
 It can be gay, some people do not have it. 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.210
 No problem in being gay to those who do not 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.579
 You know Albert Einstein was a physicist. 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.379
 German theorist 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.050
 the United States that developed the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.050
 theory of general relativity one of the two 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.480
 pillars of modern physics alongside the 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.790
 quantum physics although better known 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.000
 by its equivalence form of mass and 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.790
 energy that is equal to mc 2 that was 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.080
 called the most famous equation of the 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:20.580
 world was awarded the Nobel Prize for 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.939
 1921 of the services rendered to the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.810
 theoretical physics and specifically by its 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.000
 discovery of the law of photoelectric effect 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.520
 the photoelectric effect was fundamental in 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.799
 establishment of the quantum theory 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.799
 everybody knows he was a dude 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.509
 very mode focuses that simply type 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.369
 so it was really a reference 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.640
 albert einstein more than deserved 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.229
 because gt is an open world game it is 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.540
 a game where he reports several 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.890
 things do not say that can be here a 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.380
 easter egg but simply a 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.630
 reference albert einstein because 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.329
 would be much more than certain to do 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.490
 that with the guy who then helped 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.259
 and that it was one of the geniuses of 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.450
 all time one of the greatest geniuses of 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.340
 all the time there a very expensive guy 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.280
 smart a very smart person 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.959
 so I could not help but bring 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.870
 for you and others already 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.239
 they found out if this 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.760
 I want it here before almost everyone 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.040
 see you more like it was friday I did not 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.569
 I could record for the simple fact that the 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.220
 I'm working, I'm going to show you the 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:27.860
 location there of our supposed easter 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.349
 egg or simply a reference to the 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.299
 our genius albert einstein alright guys 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.610
 so I could not bring it to you 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.379
 for the simple fact that it was 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.940
 working but then you like your 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.079
