00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
engine problem I have with this one here

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.540 
engine problem I have with this one here
is<00:00:10.800> that<00:00:11.010> I'll<00:00:11.730> give<00:00:11.910> you<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.059> shot

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.470 

cranks<00:00:17.550> but<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:17.940> don't<00:00:18.119> start<00:00:20.270> right

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
cranks but it don't start right

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.630 
cranks but it don't start right
cranks<00:00:21.930> but<00:00:22.080> don't<00:00:22.230> start<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:23.220> have<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.369> check

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
cranks but don't start you have to check

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.929 
cranks but don't start you have to check
and<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:23.880> find<00:00:24.240> out<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.720> has<00:00:24.840> no<00:00:25.080> Spock<00:00:25.939> and

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
and I find out that it has no Spock and

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.490 
and I find out that it has no Spock and
this<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.510> something<00:00:27.840> that's<00:00:27.900> really<00:00:28.260> crazy

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
this is something that's really crazy

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.400 
this is something that's really crazy
I've<00:00:28.769> never<00:00:28.980> seen<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.429> before<00:00:29.810> but<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:31.230> just

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
I've never seen this before but I just

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.049 
I've never seen this before but I just
want<00:00:31.590> enlighten<00:00:32.070> if<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.250> couple<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.579> people<00:00:32.640> on

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
want enlighten if a couple of people on

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.630 
want enlighten if a couple of people on
what's<00:00:33.899> going<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:34.230> with<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.469> one<00:00:34.620> here<00:00:34.860> it

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
what's going on with this one here it

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.760 
what's going on with this one here it
has<00:00:35.760> no<00:00:35.969> squawk<00:00:36.329> first<00:00:36.719> thing<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:36.960> assume<00:00:37.559> is

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
has no squawk first thing you assume is

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.580 
has no squawk first thing you assume is
that<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:38.100> not<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.270> crankshaft<00:00:40.200> sensor

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
that it's not the the crankshaft sensor

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.319 
that it's not the the crankshaft sensor
is<00:00:40.890> not<00:00:41.010> showing<00:00:41.280> rotation<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.030> engine

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
is not showing rotation in the engine

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.080 
is not showing rotation in the engine
and<00:00:42.450> therefore<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:43.290> not<00:00:43.559> allowing<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.090> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
and therefore is not allowing the the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.840 
and therefore is not allowing the the
engine<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.899> fire<00:00:46.140> up<00:00:46.410> after<00:00:47.399> putting<00:00:47.700> on

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
engine to it to fire up after putting on

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.610 
engine to it to fire up after putting on
the<00:00:47.910> computer<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.450> scan<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.320> comes<00:00:49.440> up

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
the computer I scan it and it comes up

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.729 
the computer I scan it and it comes up
with<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.969> engine<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.840> showing<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.530> it's

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
with the the engine is showing that it's

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:01.630 
with the the engine is showing that it's
spinning<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.670> let<00:00:53.820> me<00:00:53.910> show<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:56.570> what<00:00:57.570> we<00:00:57.690> got

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.840 

okay

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.490 

the<00:01:05.850> engine<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.210> showing<00:01:06.570> RPMs<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.350> see

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
the engine is showing RPMs you can see

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.870 
the engine is showing RPMs you can see
the<00:01:07.619> engine<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:08.070> spinning<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.580> we<00:01:08.670> know<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
the engine is spinning so we know the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.789 
the engine is spinning so we know the
crankshaft<00:01:09.420> sensor<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.900> picking<00:01:10.080> up<00:01:10.409> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
crankshaft sensor is picking up the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.710 
crankshaft sensor is picking up the
signal<00:01:11.430> from<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.060> from<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.960> sensor<00:01:15.830> now<00:01:16.830> I

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
signal from the from the sensor now I

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.910 
signal from the from the sensor now I
did<00:01:18.720> what<00:01:18.900> they<00:01:18.990> call<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.259> wiggle<00:01:19.530> test<00:01:19.770> on

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
did what they call the wiggle test on

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.859 
did what they call the wiggle test on
here<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.280> guys<00:01:20.759> know<00:01:21.060> about<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.720> go

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
here you guys know about this you go

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.510 
here you guys know about this you go
around<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.350> wiggle<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.710> wires<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.100> try<00:01:23.340> this

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
around you wiggle of wires and try this

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.280 
around you wiggle of wires and try this
you<00:01:23.820> know<00:01:23.939> find<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.330> any<00:01:24.479> why<00:01:24.659> isn't<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.049> broken

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
you know find it any why isn't it broken

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.859 
you know find it any why isn't it broken
or<00:01:25.470> whatever<00:01:25.790> and<00:01:26.790> then<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.299> car<00:01:27.479> would<00:01:27.630> start

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
or whatever and then the car would start

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.929 
or whatever and then the car would start
up<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.290> would<00:01:28.380> run<00:01:28.530> perfectly<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.369> then

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
up and it would run perfectly and then

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.179 
up and it would run perfectly and then
after<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.659> minute<00:01:31.079> or<00:01:31.320> two<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.470> drop<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.950> into

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
after a minute or two you drop it into

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.960 
after a minute or two you drop it into
into<00:01:32.579> gear<00:01:32.909> and

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970

and<00:01:47.460> I'll<00:01:47.610> spot<00:01:47.910> up<00:01:48.150> and<00:01:48.600> you'll<00:01:48.990> drop<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.350> into

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
and I'll spot up and you'll drop it into

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.200 
and I'll spot up and you'll drop it into
gear<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.980> it<00:01:50.070> dies<00:01:50.250> right<00:01:50.520> out<00:01:50.760> and<00:01:50.970> then<00:01:51.090> it

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
gear and it dies right out and then it

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.210 
gear and it dies right out and then it
won't<00:01:51.330> start<00:01:51.660> again<00:01:53.210> okay<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:55.010> you<00:01:56.010> know<00:01:56.100> we

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
won't start again okay so you know we

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.250 
won't start again okay so you know we
have<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:57.000> RPMs<00:01:57.510> the<00:01:57.690> spinning<00:01:58.050> and<00:01:58.170> this

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
have the the RPMs the spinning and this

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.220 
have the the RPMs the spinning and this
is<00:01:58.350> what<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.740> find<00:01:58.950> really<00:01:59.220> kind<00:01:59.580> of<00:01:59.640> strange

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
is what I find really kind of strange

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.630 
is what I find really kind of strange
and<00:02:01.230> maybe<00:02:01.470> somebody<00:02:02.010> has<00:02:02.160> run<00:02:02.340> into<00:02:02.550> this

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
and maybe somebody has run into this

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.520 
and maybe somebody has run into this
before<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:03.360> have<00:02:03.720> not<00:02:05.180> we<00:02:06.180> have<00:02:06.360> we<00:02:07.200> show<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
before I have not we have we show the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.830 
before I have not we have we show the
RPMs<00:02:07.950> we<00:02:08.250> see<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.550> engine<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.940> spinning<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
RPMs we see the engine is spinning the

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.420 
RPMs we see the engine is spinning the
only<00:02:10.020> thing<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.229> saw<00:02:10.470> which<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.800> little<00:02:11.280> bit

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
only thing I saw which is a little bit

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.450 
only thing I saw which is a little bit
out<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.760> ordinary<00:02:13.070> was<00:02:14.810> this<00:02:16.460> engine

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
out of the ordinary was this engine

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.030 
out of the ordinary was this engine
coolant<00:02:17.790> temperature<00:02:18.270> is<00:02:18.900> shown<00:02:18.960> 14<00:02:19.680> degrees

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.720 
coolant temperature is shown 14 degrees
had<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.760> voltage<00:02:21.209> on<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.350> sensor<00:02:23.070> is<00:02:23.220> four

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
had a voltage on the sensor is four

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.560 
had a voltage on the sensor is four
point<00:02:23.970> one<00:02:24.180> eight<00:02:24.209> volts<00:02:25.370> that<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.610> obviously

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
point one eight volts that is obviously

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.050 
point one eight volts that is obviously
very<00:02:27.840> low<00:02:28.110> today<00:02:28.470> as<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.670> thinks<00:02:29.670> today<00:02:29.790> it's

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
very low today as a thinks today it's

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.820 
very low today as a thinks today it's
probably<00:02:30.300> about<00:02:30.360> 70<00:02:30.840> degrees<00:02:30.930> outside<00:02:31.350> so<00:02:31.560> we

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
probably about 70 degrees outside so we

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.930 
probably about 70 degrees outside so we
should<00:02:32.040> be<00:02:32.070> reading<00:02:32.490> at<00:02:33.060> least<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.510> outside

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
should be reading at least the outside

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.920 
should be reading at least the outside
temperature<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.090> I've<00:02:36.150> never<00:02:36.390> run<00:02:36.570> into<00:02:36.750> this

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
temperature and I've never run into this

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.670 
temperature and I've never run into this
before<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.130> coolant<00:02:38.670> sensor<00:02:38.850> can<00:02:39.780> keep<00:02:40.560> a

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
before that a coolant sensor can keep a

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.880 
before that a coolant sensor can keep a
vehicle<00:02:41.130> from<00:02:41.280> from<00:02:41.880> running<00:02:42.650> but<00:02:43.650> you're<00:02:43.800> not

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
vehicle from from running but you're not

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.980 
vehicle from from running but you're not
gonna<00:02:44.070> believe<00:02:44.280> this<00:02:44.610> let<00:02:45.510> me<00:02:45.540> show<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:45.870> what

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
gonna believe this let me show you what

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.080 
gonna believe this let me show you what
they<00:02:46.080> did<00:02:49.430> all<00:02:50.430> right<00:02:50.580> now<00:02:50.730> we're<00:02:50.910> underneath

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
they did all right now we're underneath

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.030 
they did all right now we're underneath
the<00:02:51.269> hood<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:52.500> coolant<00:02:52.890> temperature

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
the hood and the coolant temperature

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.270 
the hood and the coolant temperature
sensor<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.880> down<00:02:54.120> right<00:02:55.019> up<00:02:55.170> in<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.739> side<00:02:55.950> over

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
sensor is down right up in the side over

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.400 
sensor is down right up in the side over
here<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.730> obviously<00:02:57.540> you<00:02:57.989> don't<00:02:58.019> want<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.350> be

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
here and obviously you don't want to be

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.540 
here and obviously you don't want to be
doing<00:02:58.680> this<00:02:58.800> when<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.160> engine<00:02:59.400> is<00:02:59.519> running

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
doing this when the engine is running

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.340 
doing this when the engine is running
because<00:02:59.940> you<00:03:00.120> have<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.360> fan<00:03:00.630> belt<00:03:00.810> right<00:03:01.080> here

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
because you have a fan belt right here

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.630 
because you have a fan belt right here
it'll<00:03:01.530> definitely<00:03:01.739> cause<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.580> a<00:03:02.610> problem

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
it'll definitely cause you a problem

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.140 
it'll definitely cause you a problem
with<00:03:03.060> your<00:03:03.150> hands<00:03:03.480> so<00:03:04.130> let<00:03:05.130> me<00:03:05.220> just<00:03:05.430> grab<00:03:06.000> that

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
with your hands so let me just grab that

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.550 
with your hands so let me just grab that
new<00:03:06.330> sensor<00:03:06.780> I'm<00:03:06.930> going<00:03:07.080> to<00:03:07.140> take<00:03:07.320> that<00:03:07.500> out

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
new sensor I'm going to take that out

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.520 
new sensor I'm going to take that out
and<00:03:08.060> we'll<00:03:09.060> see<00:03:09.209> how<00:03:09.330> it<00:03:09.510> goes<00:03:11.900> okay<00:03:12.900> this<00:03:13.350> is

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
and we'll see how it goes okay this is

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.979 
and we'll see how it goes okay this is
the<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:14.130> old<00:03:14.310> sensor<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:15.330> they<00:03:15.420> took<00:03:15.630> out<00:03:15.840> of

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
the the old sensor that they took out of

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.990 
the the old sensor that they took out of
there<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:16.290> basically<00:03:17.010> what<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.519> do<00:03:17.670> is<00:03:17.700> this

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
there and basically what you do is this

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.160 
there and basically what you do is this
sensor<00:03:18.390> system<00:03:18.870> show<00:03:19.080> you<00:03:19.140> instead

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
sensor system show you instead

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.770 
sensor system show you instead
that's<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.290> new<00:03:22.410> sensor<00:03:23.060> right<00:03:24.060> down<00:03:24.330> in<00:03:24.510> here

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
that's the new sensor right down in here

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.560 
that's the new sensor right down in here
and<00:03:25.310> basically<00:03:26.310> what<00:03:26.550> you<00:03:26.700> do<00:03:26.880> is<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.180> sensor

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
and basically what you do is the sensor

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.390 
and basically what you do is the sensor
sits<00:03:27.810> in<00:03:27.959> there<00:03:28.080> like<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.440> you<00:03:28.739> rotate<00:03:29.220> it

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
sits in there like that you rotate it

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.130 
sits in there like that you rotate it
this<00:03:29.760> way<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.239> you<00:03:30.300> pull<00:03:31.200> it<00:03:31.230> straight<00:03:31.680> out<00:03:31.940> so

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
this way and you pull it straight out so

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.170 
this way and you pull it straight out so
plug<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.290> sensor<00:03:34.650> on<00:03:34.830> and<00:03:36.350> we're<00:03:37.350> gonna<00:03:37.470> see

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
plug the sensor on and we're gonna see

00:03:38.180 --> 00:04:05.680 
plug the sensor on and we're gonna see
how<00:03:39.180> everything<00:03:39.980> everything<00:03:40.980> works

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.800 

okay<00:04:06.690> one<00:04:07.140> thing<00:04:07.170> I<00:04:07.500> I<00:04:08.180> see<00:04:09.180> already<00:04:09.450> is<00:04:09.780> that

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
okay one thing I I see already is that

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.310 
okay one thing I I see already is that
the<00:04:11.210> the<00:04:12.210> engine<00:04:12.540> temperature<00:04:12.690> is<00:04:13.050> reading

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
the the engine temperature is reading

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.729 
the the engine temperature is reading
192<00:04:14.220> and<00:04:14.430> then<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:15.960> voltage<00:04:16.290> is<00:04:16.560> down

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
192 and then the the the voltage is down

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:26.090 
192 and then the the the voltage is down
to<00:04:16.920> 0.65<00:04:18.230> let's<00:04:19.230> see<00:04:19.470> how<00:04:19.650> would<00:04:24.980> let's<00:04:25.980> see

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
to 0.65 let's see how would let's see

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.680 
to 0.65 let's see how would let's see
what<00:04:26.250> happens

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
what happens

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:34.800 
what happens
[Applause]

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:41.469 

now<00:04:39.460> anybody<00:04:40.460> who<00:04:40.669> gonna<00:04:40.819> like<00:04:41.060> me<00:04:41.240> on<00:04:41.360> this

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
now anybody who gonna like me on this

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:42.790 
now anybody who gonna like me on this
thing<00:04:41.690> here<00:04:41.900> I'm<00:04:41.990> a<00:04:42.050> little<00:04:42.289> bit<00:04:42.409> confused

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
thing here I'm a little bit confused

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.119 
thing here I'm a little bit confused
highway<00:04:43.400> engine<00:04:44.150> temperature<00:04:44.750> sensor<00:04:45.379> can

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:46.129 
highway engine temperature sensor can

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:47.559 
highway engine temperature sensor can
keep<00:04:46.310> the<00:04:46.460> engine<00:04:46.819> from<00:04:47.000> running<00:04:47.360> you<00:04:47.449> know

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:47.569 
keep the engine from running you know

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:48.879 
keep the engine from running you know
after<00:04:47.840> I'm<00:04:48.050> thinking<00:04:48.349> about<00:04:48.470> it<00:04:48.740> it's

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
after I'm thinking about it it's

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.070 
after I'm thinking about it it's
possible<00:04:49.370> maybe<00:04:49.490> it<00:04:49.789> disables<00:04:50.509> the<00:04:50.599> computer

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
possible maybe it disables the computer

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.290 
possible maybe it disables the computer
to<00:04:51.620> keep<00:04:51.770> the<00:04:51.949> engine<00:04:52.340> from<00:04:52.370> from<00:04:52.879> overheating

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
to keep the engine from from overheating

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.119 
to keep the engine from from overheating
in<00:04:53.629> that<00:04:53.840> and<00:04:54.050> causing<00:04:54.949> a<00:04:55.039> problem<00:04:55.490> but<00:04:57.129> I'm

00:04:58.119 --> 00:04:58.129 
in that and causing a problem but I'm

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:00.369 
in that and causing a problem but I'm
not<00:04:58.280> really<00:04:58.490> too<00:04:58.789> sure<00:04:59.090> exactly<00:04:59.300> why<00:04:59.870> so<00:05:00.259> we're

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:00.379 
not really too sure exactly why so we're

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:01.450 
not really too sure exactly why so we're
just<00:05:00.500> gonna<00:05:00.620> let<00:05:00.770> it<00:05:00.830> run<00:05:01.009> a<00:05:01.039> little<00:05:01.099> bit<00:05:01.370> and

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
just gonna let it run a little bit and

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.770 
just gonna let it run a little bit and
we're<00:05:01.550> gonna<00:05:01.639> make<00:05:01.819> sure<00:05:01.970> everything<00:05:02.270> is<00:05:02.389> is

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
we're gonna make sure everything is is

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.529 
we're gonna make sure everything is is
okay<00:05:03.550> let<00:05:04.550> me<00:05:04.610> just<00:05:04.639> get<00:05:04.909> the<00:05:05.000> computer<00:05:05.389> back

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
okay let me just get the computer back

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.869 
okay let me just get the computer back
on<00:05:05.780> we'll<00:05:06.250> see<00:05:07.250> what's<00:05:07.430> happening<00:05:07.759> inside

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:07.879 
on we'll see what's happening inside

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:23.180 
on we'll see what's happening inside
there

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:49.660 

just<00:05:23.760> get<00:05:23.940> back<00:05:24.180> into<00:05:24.420> it

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.670 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:56.500 

oh<00:05:49.840> yeah<00:05:50.840> okay<00:05:52.390> the<00:05:54.370> DTC<00:05:55.370> or<00:05:55.550> the<00:05:55.970> the<00:05:56.300> codes

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510 
oh yeah okay the DTC or the the codes

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.120 
oh yeah okay the DTC or the the codes
are<00:05:56.690> in<00:05:56.780> a<00:05:56.840> computer<00:05:57.260> obviously<00:05:57.380> or<00:05:57.800> because<00:05:58.070> I

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
are in a computer obviously or because I

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.520 
are in a computer obviously or because I
had<00:05:58.280> the<00:05:58.600> coolant<00:05:59.600> temperature<00:05:59.690> discont<00:06:00.380> a

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
had the coolant temperature discont a

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.170 
had the coolant temperature discont a
coolant<00:06:00.920> temperature<00:06:01.280> sensor<00:06:01.310> disconnected

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
coolant temperature sensor disconnected

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:08.950 
coolant temperature sensor disconnected
before<00:06:06.730> but<00:06:07.730> the<00:06:07.850> temperature<00:06:08.300> sensor<00:06:08.630> now<00:06:08.780> is

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
before but the temperature sensor now is

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.070 
before but the temperature sensor now is
in<00:06:09.050> a<00:06:09.140> normal<00:06:09.500> range<00:06:09.680> 192<00:06:10.670> and<00:06:11.060> the<00:06:11.630> voltage<00:06:11.960> is

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
in a normal range 192 and the voltage is

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.850 
in a normal range 192 and the voltage is
correct<00:06:12.440> so<00:06:13.360> not<00:06:14.360> sure<00:06:14.570> exactly<00:06:14.900> why<00:06:15.290> but<00:06:15.320> they

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
correct so not sure exactly why but they

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.910 
correct so not sure exactly why but they
just<00:06:16.040> figured<00:06:16.280> you<00:06:16.370> guys<00:06:16.490> might<00:06:16.610> want<00:06:16.970> to<00:06:17.060> see

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:17.920 
just figured you guys might want to see

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.650 
just figured you guys might want to see
if<00:06:18.920> you've<00:06:19.370> run<00:06:19.910> into<00:06:19.970> this<00:06:20.180> problem<00:06:20.540> before

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.660 
if you've run into this problem before

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.350 
if you've run into this problem before

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
drop me a line let me know it's kind of

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.790 
drop me a line let me know it's kind of
strange<00:06:23.570> I've<00:06:23.750> never<00:06:23.930> seen<00:06:24.140> it<00:06:24.230> before<00:06:24.380> where

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
strange I've never seen it before where

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
strange I've never seen it before where
a<00:06:25.090> bad<00:06:26.710> temperature<00:06:27.710> sensor<00:06:28.100> would<00:06:28.430> cause<00:06:28.610> the

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820 
a bad temperature sensor would cause the

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.360 
a bad temperature sensor would cause the
car<00:06:29.000> not<00:06:29.240> to<00:06:29.420> run<00:06:29.860> drop<00:06:30.860> me<00:06:30.950> a<00:06:30.980> line<00:06:31.160> let<00:06:31.340> me

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
car not to run drop me a line let me

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.440 
car not to run drop me a line let me
know<00:06:31.490> if<00:06:31.550> anybody<00:06:31.790> else<00:06:31.850> has<00:06:32.030> run<00:06:32.150> into<00:06:32.300> this

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:32.450 
know if anybody else has run into this

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.810

out<00:06:37.430> because<00:06:37.610> this<00:06:37.760> drove<00:06:38.060> me<00:06:38.210> crazy<00:06:38.360> trying

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
out because this drove me crazy trying

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.660 
out because this drove me crazy trying
to<00:06:38.870> figure<00:06:39.050> out<00:06:39.260> what<00:06:39.380> this<00:06:39.500> was<00:06:39.740> alright

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:40.670 
to figure out what this was alright

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.340 
to figure out what this was alright
thanks<00:06:40.970> again<00:06:41.030> for<00:06:41.300> watching<00:06:41.360> see<00:06:42.140> you<00:06:42.200> on<00:06:42.260> the

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:42.350 
thanks again for watching see you on the

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.450 
thanks again for watching see you on the
next<00:06:42.530> one<00:06:44.470> it's<00:06:45.470> the<00:06:45.560> old<00:06:45.740> sensor<00:06:46.130> I<00:06:46.160> got<00:06:46.370> the

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
next one it's the old sensor I got the

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.950 
next one it's the old sensor I got the
car<00:06:46.640> running<00:06:46.790> now<00:06:47.030> so<00:06:47.210> sorry<00:06:47.450> about<00:06:47.570> the<00:06:47.810> noise

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 
car running now so sorry about the noise

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.020 
car running now so sorry about the noise
it's<00:06:48.950> just<00:06:49.160> hard<00:06:49.400> for<00:06:49.460> me<00:06:49.610> to<00:06:49.670> believe<00:06:49.880> that

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030 
it's just hard for me to believe that

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.680 
it's just hard for me to believe that
this<00:06:50.570> sensor<00:06:51.380> would<00:06:51.890> cause<00:06:52.160> the<00:06:52.370> car<00:06:52.610> not<00:06:53.360> to

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:53.690 
this sensor would cause the car not to

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:58.360 
this sensor would cause the car not to
run<00:06:54.010> and<00:06:55.010> not<00:06:55.490> the<00:06:55.700> nothing<00:06:57.010> idle<00:06:58.010> or<00:06:58.130> anything

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.370 
run and not the nothing idle or anything

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.640 
run and not the nothing idle or anything
not<00:06:58.640> even<00:06:58.700> to<00:06:58.910> crank<00:06:59.210> over<00:06:59.600> it<00:06:59.750> and<00:07:00.260> the<00:07:00.410> way<00:07:00.530> it

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:00.650 
not even to crank over it and the way it

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.170 
not even to crank over it and the way it
started<00:07:00.980> is<00:07:01.130> that<00:07:01.280> the<00:07:01.370> vehicle<00:07:01.520> would<00:07:01.850> start

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:02.180 
started is that the vehicle would start

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.480 
started is that the vehicle would start
up<00:07:02.360> and<00:07:02.600> it<00:07:02.660> will<00:07:02.780> run<00:07:03.050> and<00:07:03.320> you<00:07:03.890> drop<00:07:04.130> it<00:07:04.160> into

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490 
up and it will run and you drop it into

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.490 
up and it will run and you drop it into
drive<00:07:04.760> and<00:07:05.030> it<00:07:05.120> would<00:07:05.240> die<00:07:05.420> out<00:07:05.450> you<00:07:06.050> crank<00:07:06.380> it

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:06.500 
drive and it would die out you crank it

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.030 
drive and it would die out you crank it
over<00:07:06.650> try<00:07:07.040> to<00:07:07.100> crank<00:07:07.430> it<00:07:07.580> you<00:07:07.700> have<00:07:07.850> no<00:07:08.030> spark

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:09.040 
over try to crank it you have no spark

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.100 
over try to crank it you have no spark
but<00:07:10.040> yet<00:07:10.190> your<00:07:10.460> sense<00:07:10.670> rotation<00:07:11.330> it's<00:07:11.930> just

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:12.110 
but yet your sense rotation it's just

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.680 
but yet your sense rotation it's just
hard<00:07:12.500> to<00:07:12.590> believe<00:07:12.740> that<00:07:13.220> a<00:07:13.520> kinetic<00:07:14.000> coolant

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.690 
hard to believe that a kinetic coolant

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.870 
hard to believe that a kinetic coolant
sensor<00:07:14.840> would<00:07:15.740> cause<00:07:16.010> this<00:07:16.220> to<00:07:16.280> happen<00:07:16.430> with

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880 
sensor would cause this to happen with

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.320 
sensor would cause this to happen with
an<00:07:16.970> engine

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:17.330 
an engine

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.390 
an engine
you<00:07:18.289> know<00:07:18.409> there's<00:07:18.530> a<00:07:18.590> saying<00:07:18.800> they<00:07:19.009> have<00:07:19.189> that

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.400 
you know there's a saying they have that

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.240 
you know there's a saying they have that
you<00:07:19.520> could<00:07:19.639> be<00:07:19.789> as<00:07:20.030> old<00:07:20.360> as<00:07:20.509> a<00:07:20.539> cow<00:07:20.810> when<00:07:21.139> you

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:21.250 
you could be as old as a cow when you

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.010 
you could be as old as a cow when you
and<00:07:22.250> you'll<00:07:22.669> learn<00:07:22.819> things<00:07:23.120> new<00:07:23.539> every<00:07:23.870> day

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:24.020 
and you'll learn things new every day

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.270 
and you'll learn things new every day
this<00:07:24.259> is<00:07:24.409> a<00:07:24.439> new<00:07:24.620> one<00:07:24.770> to<00:07:24.830> me

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.280 
this is a new one to me

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.230 
this is a new one to me
so<00:07:26.860> obviously<00:07:27.860> it's<00:07:28.099> if<00:07:28.460> that's<00:07:28.699> definitely

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:29.240 
so obviously it's if that's definitely

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.249 
so obviously it's if that's definitely
the<00:07:29.330> problem<00:07:29.689> is<00:07:29.780> that<00:07:29.870> I<00:07:29.900> have<00:07:30.050> this<00:07:30.110> thing

00:07:30.249 --> 00:07:30.259 
the problem is that I have this thing

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:32.830 
the problem is that I have this thing
running<00:07:30.439> for<00:07:30.740> a<00:07:30.800> good<00:07:31.009> half<00:07:31.759> hour<00:07:32.000> now<00:07:32.210> shut<00:07:32.750> it

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:32.840 
running for a good half hour now shut it

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.869 
running for a good half hour now shut it
off<00:07:32.990> start<00:07:33.379> it<00:07:33.500> up<00:07:33.620> drop<00:07:33.949> it<00:07:34.099> in<00:07:34.219> gear<00:07:34.400> drive<00:07:34.759> it

00:07:34.869 --> 00:07:34.879 
off start it up drop it in gear drive it

have a scanner you can see what the
actual<00:07:47.750> engine<00:07:48.259> temperature<00:07:48.710> is<00:07:48.860> check<00:07:49.550> the

00:07:49.689 --> 00:07:49.699 
actual engine temperature is check the

actual engine temperature is check the
temperature<00:07:50.120> and<00:07:50.270> say<00:07:51.009> strange<00:07:52.009> to<00:07:52.190> me<00:07:52.340> but<00:07:52.610> if
