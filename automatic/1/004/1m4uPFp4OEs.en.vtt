00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:01.569
 so now we will hold a small 

00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:04.569
 herbalists supervised analogue sat down 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.790
 samsung galaxy mini 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.659
 back clip 2 28 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:12.679
 aha barid records 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.679
 it is clearly visible that in general shelin more 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.960
 the weight is about the same sweet 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:23.769
 it turned out there will be no families 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:26.909
 easier 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:29.749
 where it is 4 inches 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:31.429
 smoke multitouch 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.429
 works 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.270
 used sharpens eyewitnesses 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.170
 which the 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.020
 preinstalled but it turns out 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.020
 held seed 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.630
 that is, the turn is basically 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.090
 the same 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.360
 except screen resolution 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.900
 standard panels what about the firmware 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.900
 equally 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.990
 completed points nadi his poets 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:08.110
 of memory 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.750
 in principle of which is available 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.910
 users are not only a little less 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.620
 but specifically 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.620
 we can't call it 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.010
 so to me then this is the sun of the Orleks shelf 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.850
 so let's see 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.290
 this version 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.890
 android 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.210
 that is, he asks 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.450
 dollars to 1 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.450
 red rover item is not locked 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.820
 let's see what is on it 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.770
 here it is 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.590
 now orgy mov 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.970
 acceptance by demolition is the most to us 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.570
 home button mechanical 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.120
 and with the touch button 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.359
 with the words nec peak knock back 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:09.849
 so on top 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.639
 so arkady 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:14.339
 she crackling so arcade 

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:16.019
 diverge 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.379
 micro connector and beaten 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.459
 there are three and five year old 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:21.729
 connector 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:22.999
 behind 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:24.809
 that eight megapixel 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:28.069
 camera 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.599
 the device is understandably very similar to the hall 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.719
 accent almost identical copy 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.699
 with the exception of 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:38.889
 now enjoy another displays 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:42.309
 and uses usa less memory that is 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:43.859
 analog siege 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.859
 standard memory 16 gigabytes 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:50.109
 camera buttons like us 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.369
 we didn't see 

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:55.379
 I am not observed 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.750
 as far as i see hot swap cards 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:00.679
 there is no memory here either 

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:01.719
 eg 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.389
 bottles of seed 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:06.539
 to change in a powerful way 

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:09.339
 so in the milk in the cloud can still be 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:10.669
 to replace 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:12.029
 tim cook 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:14.969
 here they are such fence mackay 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:17.409
 in this response, the court ward five 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.409
 standard interface more precisely st 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.449
 RAM 512 MB 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:25.859
 I have to add 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.859
 processor 1 2 1 

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:33.559
 and that's basically 

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:36.729
 all standard and charms of android 2 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:37.379
 barely 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.059
 with the possibility of subsequent 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:42.039
 update yes next version 

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:44.059
 Between the fact that the shepherd viewing before the trial
