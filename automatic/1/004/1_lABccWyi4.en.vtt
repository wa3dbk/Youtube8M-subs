00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Good day, dear viewers and 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.390
 channel subscribers with you fighting ammonia and 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.860
 in this video we will check the store 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.070
 steam and just want to say that he is very 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.759
 suspicious 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.180
 and I think sushi people are bred here 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:22.939
 on the headstock why and because everything 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:26.189
 looks very sad in reviews 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:30.510
 last review was four months ago 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.180
 and also on the videos where they show how 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.500
 buy in this store here here 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.100
 It shows that the support answers me 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.690
 there is now you can calculate 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.510
 so guys it seems to me that here 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.670
 all very sad end but 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.340
 let's see basically aspen by 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.129
 random key and so let's 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.010
 buy but look while you find 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.329
 you need those goods you will not lose much 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.370
 everything costs everything looks very ugly 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:06.570
 not on my own permission and this is very me 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.700
 like it so let's get the keys 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.040
 steam and buy a couple of these and there are many 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.680
 keys for 50 rubles there are also gifta but 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.430
 it seems to me generally sad and everything will be 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.040
 crit discount 81 percent micro went into 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.350
 Two months ago, it was the first time the same 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.689
 the discount still remained that is 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.630
 too suspicious let's 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:31.170
 buy and what to feel it 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.290
 draw results 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.040
 how are you they are strictly they will be a group 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.350
 in contact with 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.689
 if the role is not to increase 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.090
 timing this time want the group 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.270
 there will be results that buy pairs 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.659
 let's keys so ok 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.200
 1 book captured and that's not from that too 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.049
 like that random key and not 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.640
 written the name of the game itself is very 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.509
 suspiciously so let's activate 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.899
 the incentive because there is no other way and 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.690
 if it is a free product then 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.680
 no which 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:11.530
 so you live deluxe seems ordinary to me 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:15.130
 lamps because it falls mostly 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:19.170
 garbage in games that are righteous in heaps 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:24.390
 for 50 rubles than sit for us given 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:28.560
 thousand thirteenth year some kind of flash drive and 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.560
 everything is very sad therefore 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:38.590
 ok the first key is equal to put it mildly if 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:42.870
 talk so let's move on 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:47.140
 once the bill we will buy our hands another key 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.000
 okay i don't know activate it or 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.050
 no, because I want some 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.950
 draw too but polin let's check 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:59.590
 honey I just wonder I want to make 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:04.270
 fest check on the value of these keys 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:11.340
 it seems to me that there is no 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:16.090
 rubbish 150 rubles some kind of platformer 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:19.060
 it is not clear what quality tea 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:27.459
 sad so let's probably buy them 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:29.170
 now the key which costs 12 w 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.110
 I am wondering what might fall there 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.459
 all the same 12 years old but this is a penny completely 19 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.900
 slightly wrong or 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.769
 but 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:43.900
 12 1920 we will buy two such and two keys 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:48.220
 such let's see hockey so it 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:51.370
 the key is 14 rubles although the food is also 13 a 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.159
 costs 14 and a half strange but 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.019
 let's activate 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:59.409
 let's activate i wonder so 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:01.540
 close close eat there will be 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.150
 free and all the garden and the store will be 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:08.260
 I understand you already have this product 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:12.040
 and what a game and the same thing for hitting something 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:17.440
 there is not selling this era in those in 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:19.209
 keys okay i don't mind well let's buy 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.250
 one more such key because well 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.090
 interesting all the same interesting very 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:27.520
 expensive tribal games 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:33.460
 seriously seriously very expensive games for 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:40.210
 that churches so like another key like 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:44.199
 it's a long long let's come on come on you 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:47.320
 already have this product the same game 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:49.680
 This game has fallen out for the second time and 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:53.880
 here is this game an hour the second key fell out 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:58.449
 great i like it guys so what 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.880
 principle it does not matter here seems to be 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.830
 same thing you file 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.720
 Well, let's attach at least one key 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.490
 if there is the same game then all 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.940
 look at understandable just piling on 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:14.440
 on two games and that's very cool let's 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.229
 look so good some sleep gold 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:21.419
 ring 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:25.960
 if this game was handed out for free so 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:34.250
 blah blah blah not confirmed e-mail 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:37.610
 so all in the prohibition of games and blah blah blah stop 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:41.360
 it activated or not go here i 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.750
 went where it should be blah blah she 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.130
 already 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:51.010
 and the key is sent here, it's Che and go 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:54.290
 another holy hemorrhoids and so now 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:59.600
 key but the question of ruin so that 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:06:05.900
 play this game we have ported and garbage 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:11.630
 us ios and android devices i am such 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:14.510
 played paint on the phone trash 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:18.800
 you this rubbish store is just shitty 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:22.400
 because he sells these accounts 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:25.520
 but these keys are worth a penny and 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.610
 and not at once literally run 10 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:33.110
 minutes if you look key vybesh 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:35.120
 it is necessary and that's why guys I say something 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.760
 do not buy in this store just well 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.980
 he can see what he is so himself 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.850
 Here in appearance it can be understood that 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.820
 all this stuff 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:46.070
 we are so there are a few people left them 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.410
 Iâ€™m also playing out the same conditions 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.870
 Like this video 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:54.590
 I do not know who these games will need all 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:57.380
 anyway why not all the same freebie 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:07:01.010
 let us have one person that's about 2 or 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:03.890
 3 keys for 3 so guys if you 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:07.340
 like this video do something 

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:09.260
 whatever you see fit 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.560
 like subscribe to the channel look 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:14.990
 Other issues will prove but still well, or they 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.650
 other projects on my channels with you 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.680
 say goodbye 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:21.880
 results in the group are already up to the new 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.880
 meetings and good luck
