00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:35.460
 Russian gun tribes

 engineer and buying these weapons for a hundred 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:47.070
 times 5 thousand credits or two hundred 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.910
 ninety nine pounds maximum 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.830
 damage 25 minimum 10 together my 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.590
 standard stores fifty five 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:58.980
 ammunition rate of fire wipe 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.430
 minute possesses low range and 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.309
 high firing accuracy rechargeable 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.600
 in five seconds 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.479
 a large capacity store is 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.090
 distinctive feature of pp-19 and 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.109
 makes him the best submachine gun he's in 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.719
 the game by the number of rounds in the store 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:21.659
 agree very well what p90 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:24.329
 clip stock dropped to two so 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.009
 economy ammo high 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:28.859
 rate of fire and store capacity 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.950
 allows you to shoot a lot 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:34.380
 longer and successfully works on suppression 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.069
 creating spontaneity flawlessly 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.250
 suitable for playing on close cards 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:42.890
 compared with n90 senselessly 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.700
 gave in Karelian, they are similar but still 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:50.360
 Russian grandfather will win a high 19 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.180
 a lot of advantages I repeat that he has 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.610
 comparative large store high 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.310
 rate of fire is a good indicator of 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.790
 accuracy of shooting at near and medium 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.650
 distances and complete independence from 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:14.450
 demons meaning he can play 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:16.250
 naked in both speak and cons of the first 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.480
 not accurate shooting 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.350
 in quick fire mode 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.660
 second deafening sound of a shot 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:31.580
 3 too much ammunition 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:34.850
 medium and long range and finally 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:41.120
 the most serious minus is long 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:45.080
 reloading open mechanical sight 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.230
 taken from ax 74u but alas on medium and 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.430
 long range shooting uncomfortable 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.459
 I recommend to put a collimator sight 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.820
 red dot is the most optimal but without and grief 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.480
 his bare all soft point emo and pressure 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.380
