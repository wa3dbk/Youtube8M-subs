we're<00:01:07.300> actually<00:01:07.450> installing<00:01:08.020> these<00:01:08.800> these

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
we're actually installing these these

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.550 
we're actually installing these these
galaxy<00:01:12.120> geforce<00:01:13.120> GT<00:01:13.750> six<00:01:14.320> tens<00:01:14.940> now<00:01:15.940> these

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
galaxy geforce GT six tens now these

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.290 
galaxy geforce GT six tens now these
actually<00:01:17.560> have<00:01:17.890> two<00:01:18.220> ports<00:01:18.520> on<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.820> back<00:01:19.000> and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
actually have two ports on the back and

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.540 
actually have two ports on the back and
then<00:01:19.390> it<00:01:19.540> has<00:01:19.750> two<00:01:20.290> splitters<00:01:20.770> that<00:01:20.920> come<00:01:21.370> with

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
then it has two splitters that come with

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.420 
then it has two splitters that come with
it<00:01:21.580> yeah<00:01:22.570> this<00:01:23.200> is<00:01:23.350> what<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:23.650> splitter<00:01:24.190> looks

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
it yeah this is what the splitter looks

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.390 
it yeah this is what the splitter looks
like<00:01:24.640> has<00:01:25.510> a<00:01:25.570> proprietary<00:01:26.320> plug<00:01:26.950> on<00:01:27.100> the<00:01:27.250> end

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
like has a proprietary plug on the end

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.400 
like has a proprietary plug on the end
and<00:01:27.720> then<00:01:28.720> it<00:01:28.750> goes<00:01:29.050> into<00:01:29.320> two<00:01:30.310> DV<00:01:30.700> eyes<00:01:31.410> so

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
and then it goes into two DV eyes so

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.080 
and then it goes into two DV eyes so
they<00:01:32.650> are<00:01:32.770> number<00:01:33.130> one<00:01:33.400> and<00:01:33.550> two

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
they are number one and two

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.650 
they are number one and two
so<00:01:34.930> with<00:01:35.800> these<00:01:35.980> plugs<00:01:36.370> you<00:01:37.090> know<00:01:37.180> obviously

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
so with these plugs you know obviously

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.630 
so with these plugs you know obviously
there's<00:01:37.870> two<00:01:38.140> in<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.440> package<00:01:38.830> so<00:01:39.040> we<00:01:39.160> can<00:01:39.340> we

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
there's two in the package so we can we

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.990 
there's two in the package so we can we
can<00:01:39.790> run<00:01:39.940> four<00:01:40.480> monitors<00:01:40.990> quad<00:01:41.350> monitors<00:01:42.000> now

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
can run four monitors quad monitors now

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.570 
can run four monitors quad monitors now
the<00:01:43.600> little<00:01:44.110> catch<00:01:44.410> that<00:01:44.650> we<00:01:44.770> found<00:01:45.040> out<00:01:45.190> about

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
the little catch that we found out about

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.320 
the little catch that we found out about
these<00:01:46.000> particular<00:01:46.780> cards<00:01:47.350> is<00:01:47.560> that<00:01:48.250> they<00:01:49.000> need

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
these particular cards is that they need

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.140 
these particular cards is that they need
to<00:01:49.600> be<00:01:49.720> on<00:01:49.870> DVI<00:01:50.200> monitors<00:01:50.740> if<00:01:50.980> you<00:01:51.790> use<00:01:52.000> an

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
to be on DVI monitors if you use an

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.290 
to be on DVI monitors if you use an
adapter<00:01:52.690> to<00:01:53.260> go<00:01:53.409> to<00:01:53.470> VGA<00:01:54.040> which<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:56.350> a<00:01:57.210> DVI<00:01:58.210> to

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
adapter to go to VGA which is a DVI to

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.250 
adapter to go to VGA which is a DVI to
VGA<00:01:59.290> adapter<00:01:59.380> for<00:02:00.130> a<00:02:00.190> regular<00:02:00.490> older<00:02:01.060> monitor

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
VGA adapter for a regular older monitor

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.770 
VGA adapter for a regular older monitor
it<00:02:02.260> will<00:02:02.320> actually<00:02:02.620> not<00:02:02.979> work<00:02:03.370> the<00:02:04.120> card<00:02:04.570> does

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
it will actually not work the card does

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.680 
it will actually not work the card does
not<00:02:04.960> support<00:02:05.380> them<00:02:05.590> at<00:02:05.800> all<00:02:06.100> so<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.210> only<00:02:07.390> way

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
not support them at all so the only way

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.899 
not support them at all so the only way
you'll<00:02:07.870> get<00:02:08.080> any<00:02:08.289> video<00:02:08.590> is<00:02:09.009> actually<00:02:09.550> having

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:09.909 
you'll get any video is actually having

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:14.039 
you'll get any video is actually having
a<00:02:10.090> true<00:02:10.959> TV<00:02:11.230> I<00:02:11.879> so<00:02:12.879> but<00:02:13.569> you<00:02:13.780> know<00:02:13.840> with<00:02:13.959> that

a true TV I so but you know with that

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.349 
a true TV I so but you know with that
said<00:02:14.349> it's<00:02:14.530> it's<00:02:14.859> really<00:02:15.280> it's<00:02:15.609> a<00:02:15.909> good<00:02:16.060> card

to<00:02:22.150> be<00:02:22.240> okay<00:02:22.710> they<00:02:23.710> do<00:02:23.770> have<00:02:24.780> thousand<00:02:25.780> 24

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
to be okay they do have thousand 24

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.330 
to be okay they do have thousand 24
megabyte<00:02:26.560> or<00:02:26.590> a<00:02:26.770> gigabyte<00:02:27.430> of<00:02:27.640> ddr3<00:02:28.240> RAM<00:02:29.340> on

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
megabyte or a gigabyte of ddr3 RAM on

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.830 
megabyte or a gigabyte of ddr3 RAM on
them<00:02:31.320> they<00:02:32.320> do<00:02:32.380> have<00:02:32.770> DirectX<00:02:33.400> 11<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.150> physics

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
them they do have DirectX 11 and physics

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.260 
them they do have DirectX 11 and physics
so<00:02:35.709> these<00:02:35.920> are<00:02:36.100> you<00:02:36.400> know<00:02:36.430> they're<00:02:36.760> pretty

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
so these are you know they're pretty

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.390 
so these are you know they're pretty
good<00:02:37.630> graphics<00:02:38.380> cards<00:02:38.800> they're<00:02:39.220> not

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
good graphics cards they're not

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.340 
good graphics cards they're not
certainly<00:02:40.240> not<00:02:40.390> top<00:02:40.630> of<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:40.810> line<00:02:40.870> but

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
certainly not top of the line but

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.080 
certainly not top of the line but
they're<00:02:41.580> not<00:02:42.580> nearly<00:02:42.790> bottom<00:02:43.300> line<00:02:43.600> either<00:02:45.090> so

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
they're not nearly bottom line either so

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.090 
they're not nearly bottom line either so
as<00:02:46.480> far<00:02:46.690> as<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.990> actual<00:02:47.080> card<00:02:49.800> this<00:02:50.800> is<00:02:50.860> the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
as far as the actual card this is the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.729 
as far as the actual card this is the
actual<00:02:51.400> card<00:02:51.730> does<00:02:52.209> have<00:02:52.360> a<00:02:52.390> large<00:02:53.230> heatsink

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
actual card does have a large heatsink

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.030 
actual card does have a large heatsink
and<00:02:53.830> fan<00:02:53.950> on<00:02:54.370> it<00:02:54.520> you<00:02:55.390> can<00:02:55.540> see<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.870> dual<00:02:56.650> plugs

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
and fan on it you can see the dual plugs

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.199 
and fan on it you can see the dual plugs
no<00:02:57.550> proprietary<00:02:57.910> plugs<00:02:58.950> is<00:02:59.950> coated<00:03:00.459> in<00:03:00.880> black

basic users that want to have multiple

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.080 
basic users that want to have multiple
monitors<00:03:16.480> it's<00:03:16.630> a<00:03:16.720> really<00:03:17.020> good<00:03:17.170> option<00:03:17.610> so<00:03:18.610> it

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
monitors it's a really good option so it

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.039 
monitors it's a really good option so it
does<00:03:19.270> go<00:03:19.420> into<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.440> PCI<00:03:20.799> slot<00:03:22.049> believe

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
does go into the the PCI slot believe

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.920 
does go into the the PCI slot believe
it's<00:03:23.200> a<00:03:23.380> 24<00:03:24.190> pin<00:03:27.299> but<00:03:28.299> yeah<00:03:28.450> this<00:03:28.660> is<00:03:28.840> the

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
it's a 24 pin but yeah this is the

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.180 
it's a 24 pin but yeah this is the
inside<00:03:29.260> of<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:30.250> 6300<00:03:31.060> workstation<00:03:32.190> so

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
inside of the the 6300 workstation so

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.039 
inside of the the 6300 workstation so
the<00:03:33.370> support<00:03:34.000> that<00:03:34.150> ends<00:03:34.390> up<00:03:34.450> going<00:03:34.630> in<00:03:34.900> is

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
the support that ends up going in is

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.560 
the support that ends up going in is
actually<00:03:35.230> a<00:03:35.650> black<00:03:36.310> one<00:03:36.580> right<00:03:37.090> here<00:03:37.299> has<00:03:37.540> a

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
actually a black one right here has a

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.620 
actually a black one right here has a
clip<00:03:38.230> on<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:38.530> end<00:03:38.560> of<00:03:38.860> it<00:03:38.980> which<00:03:39.670> is<00:03:39.850> a<00:03:40.120> little

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
clip on the end of it which is a little

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.530 
clip on the end of it which is a little
hard<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:40.900> see<00:03:41.140> but<00:03:41.410> there<00:03:42.250> we<00:03:42.430> go<00:03:42.610> so<00:03:43.269> this<00:03:43.480> is

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
hard to see but there we go so this is

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.569 
hard to see but there we go so this is
this<00:03:44.260> is<00:03:44.320> the<00:03:44.500> actual<00:03:44.650> slot<00:03:45.040> that<00:03:45.220> goes<00:03:45.250> in

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
this is the actual slot that goes in

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.259 
this is the actual slot that goes in
this<00:03:45.700> is<00:03:45.760> a<00:03:46.110> regular<00:03:47.110> you<00:03:47.560> know<00:03:47.620> PCI<00:03:48.130> slot<00:03:49.030> and

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
this is a regular you know PCI slot and

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.520 
this is a regular you know PCI slot and
then<00:03:49.390> have<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.230> two<00:03:50.380> PCI<00:03:50.829> ease<00:03:51.100> there<00:03:52.530> so

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
then have the two PCI ease there so

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.860 
then have the two PCI ease there so
these<00:03:53.799> are<00:03:53.980> pretty<00:03:54.670> pretty<00:03:55.090> basic<00:03:55.299> machines

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
these are pretty pretty basic machines

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.610 
these are pretty pretty basic machines
got<00:03:56.170> a<00:03:56.230> 500<00:03:56.709> gigabyte<00:03:56.890> hard<00:03:57.250> drive<00:03:57.570> also<00:03:58.620> have

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620

he D Drive pretty basic I mean nothing
I'm<00:04:09.310> crazy<00:04:09.610> about<00:04:09.790> them<00:04:10.180> so<00:04:11.170> we'll<00:04:11.440> quickly<00:04:11.590> go

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
I'm crazy about them so we'll quickly go

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.250 
I'm crazy about them so we'll quickly go
over<00:04:12.010> the<00:04:12.400> actual<00:04:13.060> install<00:04:13.510> of<00:04:13.600> the<00:04:13.630> card<00:04:13.930> here

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
over the actual install of the card here

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.050 
over the actual install of the card here
it's<00:04:14.410> pretty<00:04:15.130> simple<00:04:15.880> pretty

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
it's pretty simple pretty

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.330 
it's pretty simple pretty
straightforward<00:04:16.209> but<00:04:17.079> you<00:04:17.620> know<00:04:17.709> for<00:04:18.040> some

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
straightforward but you know for some

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.500 
straightforward but you know for some
people<00:04:18.370> that<00:04:18.729> might<00:04:18.850> not<00:04:19.000> have<00:04:19.150> seen<00:04:19.359> this

people that might not have seen this

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.170 
people that might not have seen this
this<00:04:19.720> might<00:04:19.959> be<00:04:20.320> pretty<00:04:20.560> helpful<00:04:20.910> so<00:04:21.910> on<00:04:22.060> this

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
this might be pretty helpful so on this

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.120 
this might be pretty helpful so on this
particular<00:04:22.360> computer<00:04:23.200> is<00:04:23.350> a<00:04:23.380> little<00:04:23.800> latch

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
particular computer is a little latch

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.790 
particular computer is a little latch
here<00:04:24.460> to<00:04:24.729> open<00:04:25.390> up<00:04:25.720> to<00:04:25.870> be<00:04:25.990> able<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.200> take<00:04:26.650> one

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
here to open up to be able to take one

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.290 
here to open up to be able to take one
of<00:04:26.830> these<00:04:26.950> punch<00:04:27.250> outs

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
of these punch outs

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.589 
of these punch outs
out<00:04:28.949> so<00:04:29.949> you<00:04:30.039> just<00:04:30.400> lift<00:04:30.879> it<00:04:31.000> out<00:04:31.180> once<00:04:31.449> it's

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:31.599 
out so you just lift it out once it's

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:33.950 
out so you just lift it out once it's
unlocked

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.839 

you<00:04:34.960> take<00:04:35.409> the<00:04:35.590> cord<00:04:37.500> very<00:04:38.500> gingerly<00:04:38.949> put<00:04:39.759> it

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
you take the cord very gingerly put it

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:44.550 
you take the cord very gingerly put it
in<00:04:39.970> place<00:04:41.970> and<00:04:42.970> it<00:04:43.360> just<00:04:43.389> you<00:04:44.050> know<00:04:44.080> it'll<00:04:44.440> end

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
in place and it just you know it'll end

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.749 
in place and it just you know it'll end
up<00:04:44.650> fitting<00:04:45.150> right<00:04:46.150> into<00:04:46.449> the<00:04:46.569> card<00:04:46.810> slot<00:04:47.020> so

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
up fitting right into the card slot so

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.159 
up fitting right into the card slot so
it'll<00:04:48.759> it'll<00:04:49.120> actually<00:04:49.300> lock<00:04:49.659> in<00:04:49.870> there<00:04:50.050> and

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
it'll it'll actually lock in there and

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:51.600 
it'll it'll actually lock in there and
you<00:04:50.259> would<00:04:50.379> have<00:04:50.500> to<00:04:50.650> pull<00:04:51.220> the<00:04:51.370> little<00:04:51.520> lever

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
you would have to pull the little lever

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.760 
you would have to pull the little lever
to<00:04:52.479> to<00:04:53.169> get<00:04:53.349> it<00:04:53.440> out<00:04:53.729> but<00:04:54.729> that's<00:04:55.500> that's<00:04:56.500> the

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
to to get it out but that's that's the

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.029 
to to get it out but that's that's the
graphic<00:04:57.159> card<00:04:58.139> fans<00:04:59.139> attached<00:04:59.530> it<00:04:59.740> gets<00:04:59.889> its

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 
graphic card fans attached it gets its

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:04.129 
graphic card fans attached it gets its
power<00:05:00.220> from<00:05:00.340> the<00:05:00.580> card<00:05:01.389> itself<00:05:02.430> so<00:05:03.430> and<00:05:03.610> then

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
power from the card itself so and then

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.260 
power from the card itself so and then
can<00:05:05.139> turn<00:05:05.349> this<00:05:05.530> and<00:05:05.590> look<00:05:05.830> out<00:05:05.979> back<00:05:06.250> and<00:05:06.520> you

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
can turn this and look out back and you

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.760 
can turn this and look out back and you
see<00:05:07.479> that<00:05:07.690> the<00:05:08.849> this<00:05:09.849> lock<00:05:10.180> is<00:05:10.419> still<00:05:10.539> open<00:05:10.840> so

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
see that the this lock is still open so

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.399 
see that the this lock is still open so
just<00:05:11.800> flip<00:05:12.729> that<00:05:12.940> up<00:05:13.150> lock<00:05:13.599> it<00:05:13.780> in<00:05:13.870> place<00:05:13.990> and

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:14.409 
just flip that up lock it in place and

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:18.899 
just flip that up lock it in place and
then<00:05:15.340> you<00:05:15.460> have<00:05:15.610> the<00:05:15.819> tool<00:05:17.370> splay<00:05:18.370> ports<00:05:18.729> there

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:18.909 
then you have the tool splay ports there

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:21.089 
then you have the tool splay ports there
to<00:05:19.180> connect<00:05:19.719> in<00:05:19.870> these<00:05:20.020> splitters<00:05:20.349> that<00:05:20.710> take

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
to connect in these splitters that take

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:25.200 
to connect in these splitters that take
it<00:05:21.219> into<00:05:21.490> -<00:05:21.969> -<00:05:22.740> so<00:05:23.740> that's<00:05:23.949> that's<00:05:24.819> pretty<00:05:25.000> much

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
it into - - so that's that's pretty much

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.029 
it into - - so that's that's pretty much
it<00:05:25.419> other<00:05:25.690> than<00:05:25.870> and<00:05:26.020> it's<00:05:26.259> got<00:05:26.440> the<00:05:26.590> regular

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 
it other than and it's got the regular

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.689 
it other than and it's got the regular
i/o<00:05:27.340> board<00:05:27.789> nothing<00:05:28.180> nothing<00:05:29.110> really<00:05:29.229> crazy

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 
i/o board nothing nothing really crazy

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.730 
i/o board nothing nothing really crazy
but<00:05:30.699> with<00:05:30.940> that<00:05:31.120> with<00:05:31.780> that<00:05:31.930> card<00:05:32.259> in<00:05:32.440> it<00:05:32.469> will

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
but with that with that card in it will

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.129 
but with that with that card in it will
actually<00:05:32.889> bypass<00:05:33.849> the<00:05:34.150> the<00:05:34.630> own<00:05:34.810> board

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
actually bypass the the own board

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.249 
actually bypass the the own board
graphics<00:05:35.380> and<00:05:35.919> will<00:05:36.580> you<00:05:37.389> know<00:05:37.479> let<00:05:37.840> that<00:05:38.020> not

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:38.259 
graphics and will you know let that not

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:40.439 
graphics and will you know let that not
have<00:05:38.500> to<00:05:38.680> work<00:05:38.860> while<00:05:39.190> the<00:05:39.610> card<00:05:39.849> is<00:05:40.029> running

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
have to work while the card is running

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:42.180 
have to work while the card is running
long<00:05:40.930> as<00:05:41.110> there's<00:05:41.229> not<00:05:41.380> a<00:05:41.409> monitor<00:05:41.889> attached

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
long as there's not a monitor attached

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.950 
long as there's not a monitor attached
the<00:05:42.460> onboard<00:05:42.880> port<00:05:44.430> so<00:05:45.430> um<00:05:45.699> that's<00:05:46.419> pretty

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
the onboard port so um that's pretty

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.350 
the onboard port so um that's pretty
much<00:05:47.110> it<00:05:47.380> just<00:05:47.849> wanted<00:05:48.849> to<00:05:48.909> go<00:05:49.060> over<00:05:49.270> the

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
much it just wanted to go over the

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.070 
much it just wanted to go over the
install<00:05:49.690> and<00:05:49.840> again<00:05:50.289> it's<00:05:50.500> the<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:52.360> GeForce

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
install and again it's the the GeForce

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.670 
install and again it's the the GeForce
GT<00:05:53.469> 610<00:05:54.069> but<00:05:54.969> uh<00:05:55.000> remember<00:05:55.870> that<00:05:56.050> if<00:05:56.169> you<00:05:56.349> if

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
GT 610 but uh remember that if you if

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.950 
GT 610 but uh remember that if you if
you<00:05:56.860> are<00:05:56.979> running<00:05:57.159> older<00:05:57.580> VGA<00:05:58.240> monitors<00:05:58.779> that

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
you are running older VGA monitors that

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.080 
you are running older VGA monitors that
you<00:05:59.020> definitely<00:05:59.529> won't<00:06:00.219> be<00:06:00.370> able<00:06:00.460> to<00:06:00.699> use<00:06:00.879> the

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
you definitely won't be able to use the

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.709 
you definitely won't be able to use the
card

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:01.719 
card

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:04.589 
card
there's<00:06:02.080> not<00:06:02.259> even<00:06:02.319> a<00:06:02.680> way<00:06:03.129> to<00:06:03.159> bypass<00:06:03.490> that<00:06:04.060> so

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:04.599 
there's not even a way to bypass that so

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:09.360 
there's not even a way to bypass that so
yeah<00:06:07.050> car<00:06:08.050> it's<00:06:08.169> pretty<00:06:08.259> specialized<00:06:09.099> for

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
yeah car it's pretty specialized for

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.969 
yeah car it's pretty specialized for
newer<00:06:09.520> monitors<00:06:10.029> which<00:06:10.419> is<00:06:10.750> a<00:06:10.810> good<00:06:11.020> thing<00:06:11.050> so

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
newer monitors which is a good thing so

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:14.730 
newer monitors which is a good thing so
