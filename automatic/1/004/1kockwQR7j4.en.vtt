 gloss they're scratching or hard 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.649
 make see a massive foundation which 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.809
 must withstand all mechanical 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.030

 window sill can serve up to 70 years 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:21.200
 accordingly very moisture and 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.950
 wear resistant does not contain bad substances 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.130
 particular 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:30.159

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.159
 load temperature up to 75 grams 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.350
 what colors are offered 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.679
 Naturally there is a standard doing more 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.929
 as we understand it is in the version 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:44.000
 glossy option matte and most 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.340
 company colors are offered in option 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.440
 glossy and matt depending on 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.899
 wishes here we see on 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.710
 quite a large number of such 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.840
 shades let's call them marbles and not 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:02.179
 accurate, respectively, but here it is again white 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.130
 glossy he just about felt like 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:09.770
 glory shines on 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:12.459
 high gloss marble high gloss marble 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.459
 glossy 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.970
 and accordingly further so much 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:24.390
 glossy line of such different shades 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.980
 it finishes on and color is palermo and 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.320
 further there is some no wood compartment 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.620
 and you need to understand that the tree is 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.660
 the name may well coincide snobbery 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.250
 hymns world is plastic and it was not a nation 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.900
 lamination plastic that's needed 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.720
 understand that different manufacturers 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.590
 make out the structure a little differently 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.080
 wood is what it is applied to 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.750
 plastic in the window part of the entire label 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.300
 production renolit 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.800
 which is called for example there before the golden 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.630
 or mahogany but it has its own structure 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.880
 another special applies here 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.570
 the film that is used specifically for 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.980
 color sill they 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.900
 quite close to the lamination colors 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.820
 plastics arch but in structure all the same 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.800
 respond therefore to achieve 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.430
 one hundred percent match 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:23.580
 sill and nero light colors 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.300
 the chairs have a pretty beautiful color 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.040
 tags are popular now and from 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.350
 its main order or not 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.270
 sill he also enjoys great 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.280
 success other colors as we talked 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.580
 option either 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.200
 glossy either with this same to me here 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.810
 glossy ticker ended went 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.670
 further matt 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.700
 the ruler is what I mentioned oak 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.650
 golden very much like all three poured 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.540
 worn and not at 100 percent therefore 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.120
 expect one hundred percent from wine 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.340
 thoughts 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.310
 natural oak is also a popular mahogany 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.920
 and the second shade of the mahogany which 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.560
 called a little differently could 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.470
 frosted excellent wenge frosted not 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.959
 shiny just looks great not 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.200
 very popular and it is clear that massive 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:17.419
 much more on with a stand than 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:23.360
 glossy pop music companies are proud 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:25.889
 the fact that their glossy material is more 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.930
 wear resistant than standard 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.259
 material matt sills and 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.539
 standard mats are four times more 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:35.969
 it ended the line imitating 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:38.550
 the tree goes further with us designer 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:41.909
 color solutions are very original 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.069
 colors we understand that the market 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:46.020
 changed the standard is done it already 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:49.879
 not satisfied want something new 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:52.889

 and they are so fresh lungs and which 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.210
 not even straining the orange light 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:10.349
 strain ie if he is in the house of Christ 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.129

 every matte color is the same 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:32.699
 glossy option remember that glossy 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.279

 matt but glossy from 

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:40.469
 cree companies are more durable 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.750

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:52.589
