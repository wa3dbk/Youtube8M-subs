00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
performance we do not play like that

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.810 
performance we do not play like that
normally<00:00:34.590> right<00:00:34.770> now<00:00:34.920> like<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.370> don't<00:00:35.520> know<00:00:35.579> why

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
normally right now like I don't know why

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.299

but<00:00:36.059> like<00:00:36.090> we<00:00:36.329> just<00:00:36.480> choked<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.930> land<00:00:37.140> which<00:00:38.129> is

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
but like we just choked in land which is

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.369 
but like we just choked in land which is
a<00:00:38.550> recurring<00:00:38.969> trend<00:00:39.270> with<00:00:39.390> CLG<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:39.899> guess<00:00:40.140> and

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
a recurring trend with CLG I guess and

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.319 
a recurring trend with CLG I guess and
like<00:00:40.920> when<00:00:41.100> we<00:00:41.190> choked<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.820> get<00:00:41.940> on<00:00:42.030> tilt

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
like when we choked and you get on tilt

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.090 
like when we choked and you get on tilt
and<00:00:42.540> like<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.140> pressures<00:00:43.500> on<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:43.980> know

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
and like the pressures on and you know

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.500 
and like the pressures on and you know
you're<00:00:44.309> going<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.520> lose<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.820> game<00:00:45.030> then<00:00:45.300> you

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
you're going to lose this game then you

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.729 
you're going to lose this game then you
just<00:00:45.930> kind<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.110> revert<00:00:46.289> back<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.469> your<00:00:46.620> old

tendencies<00:00:47.340> which<00:00:48.090> it's<00:00:48.539> just<00:00:48.930> hard<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.289> break

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
tendencies which it's just hard to break

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.950 
tendencies which it's just hard to break
like<00:00:49.920> really<00:00:50.399> old<00:00:50.579> 23<00:00:51.180> year<00:00:51.300> old<00:00:51.420> habits<00:00:51.780> and

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
like really old 23 year old habits and

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.840 
like really old 23 year old habits and
that's<00:00:52.860> like<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.190> seal<00:00:53.340> do<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.520> have<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.760> so

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
that's like the seal do you have it so

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.029 
that's like the seal do you have it so
we<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.660> just<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:55.020> throw<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.680> game<00:00:55.800> and

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
we have to just like throw the game and

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.939 
we have to just like throw the game and
just<00:00:56.219> do<00:00:56.520> really<00:00:56.760> dumb<00:00:56.789> stuff<00:00:57.210> but<00:00:57.930> honestly<00:00:58.859> I

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
just do really dumb stuff but honestly I

00:00:58.949 --> 00:00:59.900 
just do really dumb stuff but honestly I
thought<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.190> played<00:00:59.219> really<00:00:59.430> well<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.730> first

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
thought we played really well the first

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.369 
thought we played really well the first
game<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.270> people<00:01:00.600> just<00:01:00.780> made<00:01:00.960> mistakes<00:01:01.260> like

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
game and people just made mistakes like

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.080 
game and people just made mistakes like
here<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.710> there<00:01:01.859> but<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.640> thought<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.910> first

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
here and there but I thought the first

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.520 
here and there but I thought the first
game<00:01:03.239> was<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.539> most<00:01:03.719> entertaining<00:01:03.870> match<00:01:04.290> of

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
game was the most entertaining match of

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.100 
game was the most entertaining match of
the<00:01:04.739> entire<00:01:05.040> life<00:01:05.339> day<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.850> then<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.780> second

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
the entire life day and then the second

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.950 
the entire life day and then the second
game<00:01:07.229> because<00:01:07.700> like<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.970> don't<00:01:09.390> know<00:01:09.510> just<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
game because like I don't know just the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.060 
game because like I don't know just the
first<00:01:10.170> game<00:01:10.350> when<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.680> lose<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:10.920> just

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
first game when you lose it just

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.620 
first game when you lose it just
snowballs<00:01:11.700> into<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.060> second<00:01:12.330> game<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.540> you

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
snowballs into the second game and you

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.820 
snowballs into the second game and you
can't<00:01:12.810> think<00:01:12.869> straight<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.500> just<00:01:13.680> make

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
can't think straight and you just make

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.200 
can't think straight and you just make
like<00:01:13.979> really<00:01:14.280> horrible<00:01:14.640> decisions<00:01:15.030> and

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
like really horrible decisions and

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.350 
like really horrible decisions and
that's<00:01:15.960> just<00:01:16.350> what<00:01:16.590> happened<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:17.460> honestly<00:01:18.060> I

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
that's just what happened we honestly I

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.840 
that's just what happened we honestly I
was<00:01:18.659> not<00:01:18.869> expecting<00:01:19.140> Jerry<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.950> Korea<00:01:20.640> tend

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
was not expecting Jerry and Korea tend

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.039 
was not expecting Jerry and Korea tend
to<00:01:20.909> be<00:01:21.000> as<00:01:21.180> good<00:01:21.330> as<00:01:21.390> they<00:01:21.570> were<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.900> don't

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.530 
will be a kind of a lane matchup that we
really<00:02:31.160> have<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.310> watch<00:02:31.550> I<00:02:31.700> think<00:02:31.970> that<00:02:32.090> BOGO

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
really have to watch I think that BOGO

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.510 
really have to watch I think that BOGO
very<00:02:32.780> much<00:02:32.990> in<00:02:33.140> favor<00:02:33.290> of<00:02:33.590> one<00:02:33.680> team<00:02:34.280> or<00:02:34.490> the

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
very much in favor of one team or the

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.090 
very much in favor of one team or the
other<00:02:34.760> I<00:02:35.060> bought<00:02:35.600> line<00:02:35.750> for<00:02:35.900> sure<00:02:36.020> um<00:02:36.230> when<00:02:37.070> I

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
other I bought line for sure um when I

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.250 
other I bought line for sure um when I
like<00:02:37.610> scrim<00:02:37.910> against<00:02:38.240> Xena<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.020> blood

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
like scrim against Xena and blood

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.040 
like scrim against Xena and blood
they're<00:02:40.100> good<00:02:40.340> but<00:02:40.910> I<00:02:41.180> think<00:02:41.420> ganja<00:02:42.020> and

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
they're good but I think ganja and

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.690 
they're good but I think ganja and
Edward<00:02:42.530> should<00:02:42.709> have<00:02:42.860> like<00:02:43.010> no<00:02:43.130> problem<00:02:43.400> just

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
Edward should have like no problem just

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.900 
Edward should have like no problem just
beating<00:02:43.970> them<00:02:44.120> straight<00:02:44.420> up<00:02:44.450> in<00:02:44.660> Lane<00:02:45.459> man<00:02:46.459> ah

interested<00:02:49.190> in<00:02:49.250> I<00:02:49.459> think<00:02:49.700> is<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:49.940> jungle

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270

interested in I think is the jungle
matchup<00:02:50.630> so<00:02:51.170> when<00:02:51.860> I<00:02:51.890> think<00:02:52.190> back<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.700> how<00:02:53.000> much

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
season three it was him doing a lot of

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.630 
season three it was him doing a lot of
studying<00:02:57.080> of<00:02:57.230> other<00:02:57.380> junglers<00:02:57.680> and<00:02:58.100> adapting

their styles and and then kind of

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.410 
their styles and and then kind of

okay okay so i don't know like it's it's
hard<00:03:34.010> to<00:03:34.100> say<00:03:34.250> because<00:03:34.370> even<00:03:34.910> though<00:03:34.970> diamonds

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
hard to say because even though diamonds

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.640 
hard to say because even though diamonds
always<00:03:35.450> been<00:03:35.570> an<00:03:35.690> innovator<00:03:35.900> Smithy's<00:03:36.410> alt

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
always been an innovator Smithy's alt

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.410 
always been an innovator Smithy's alt
like<00:03:36.829> been<00:03:37.130> improving<00:03:37.820> and<00:03:37.910> such<00:03:38.209> like<00:03:38.239> a

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
like been improving and such like a

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.210 
like been improving and such like a
steady<00:03:38.870> rate<00:03:39.110> like<00:03:39.290> since<00:03:39.530> he<00:03:39.650> started<00:03:39.890> he's

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
steady rate like since he started he's

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.830 
steady rate like since he started he's
just<00:03:40.579> he<00:03:40.820> was<00:03:40.910> terrible<00:03:41.420> at<00:03:41.600> the<00:03:41.690> very

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
just he was terrible at the very

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.330 
just he was terrible at the very
beginning<00:03:41.959> and<00:03:42.320> then<00:03:42.440> he<00:03:42.650> ended<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.070> split

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
beginning and then he ended the split

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.710 
beginning and then he ended the split
like<00:03:43.489> being<00:03:43.700> one<00:03:43.820> of<00:03:43.850> the<00:03:43.940> best<00:03:43.970> jon<00:03:44.239> was<00:03:44.329> in<00:03:44.450> na

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
like being one of the best jon was in na

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.180 
like being one of the best jon was in na
and<00:03:44.930> you<00:03:45.230> don't<00:03:45.320> know<00:03:45.470> like<00:03:45.650> where<00:03:45.860> he<00:03:46.010> ended

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
and you don't know like where he ended

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.009 
and you don't know like where he ended
up<00:03:46.310> now<00:03:46.519> so<00:03:47.030> i<00:03:47.060> think<00:03:47.180> it<00:03:47.329> just<00:03:47.390> depends<00:03:47.750> on<00:03:47.870> how

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
up now so i think it just depends on how

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.590 
up now so i think it just depends on how
much<00:03:48.140> work<00:03:48.320> smith<00:03:48.590> he<00:03:48.680> put<00:03:48.860> in<00:03:48.980> cuz<00:03:49.459> he's<00:03:50.209> all

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
much work smith he put in cuz he's all

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.000 
much work smith he put in cuz he's all
he's<00:03:50.810> not<00:03:50.959> really<00:03:51.110> been<00:03:51.290> an<00:03:51.410> innovator<00:03:51.620> so<00:03:51.920> if

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
he's not really been an innovator so if

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.410 
he's not really been an innovator so if
these<00:03:52.100> just<00:03:52.340> always<00:03:52.459> been<00:03:52.610> like<00:03:52.730> really<00:03:53.030> good

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
these just always been like really good

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.699 
these just always been like really good
like<00:03:53.810> it<00:03:53.959> doesn't<00:03:54.110> really<00:03:54.350> you<00:03:54.500> don't<00:03:54.620> really

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
like it doesn't really you don't really

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:55.840 
like it doesn't really you don't really
need<00:03:54.860> to<00:03:54.980> innovate<00:03:55.070> when<00:03:55.430> you're<00:03:55.549> just<00:03:55.730> that

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850
