00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.059
 hello today, back to the old 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.639
 good topic of sound and as you can see 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.910
 I do not like this mental set 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.970
 let's say this is strata single besides 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.350
 here are 9 strings and the sixth string which 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.699
 042 i'm looking for i have let drop and let's 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.810
 see if something is possible with this 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.090
 normal get 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.010
 for starters, I would like to point out that 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.810
 key problem of all beginners 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.809
 guitarists well and again not only 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.309
 and their regret of continuing this overkill 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.309
 loading by a mediator that is admissible 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.520
 It turns out such an effect as if 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:48.719
 grandmother lives bread, we need a sound 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.160
 we need to focus on the sound with 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.239
 as sharply as I am that is for 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.370
 this we can psychologically 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.379
 imagine that we have a country like 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.940
 would be scalding hot we can't alone 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.489
 hundreds and can only play both 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.290
 sides as sharply as possible while again 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.030
 does this eternal theme of relaxation 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.549
 what is the situation here see that is 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.510
 relaxation she is like to eat but she is 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.860
 after the strike that is, we have collected a hand and 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.340
 now the hand is resting the same back 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.490
 were playing 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.000
 resting essentially in the hand such as current 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.439
 passes 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.439
 which allows us to rest 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.610
 Many amateurs believe that 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.650
 when let's say we play like this 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.060
 break the strings and so on really 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.100
 there is no business 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.080
 well at least these strings are not torn 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.760
 last for eight or nine years that is 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.650
 where can it tear on benzo to ash 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.200
 there are such things batyr cars 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.310
 rubbed something else but never from 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.170
 I don't have the sound of it 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.740
 the last view of the camera would take place 8 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.200
 before, of course, also played under stuck 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.170
 but now there is no problem therefore 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.090
 also not broke them strings so 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.100
 look the most important work out 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.259
 accuracy because exactly the accuracy of the hand 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.490
 adds us not to get stuck because 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.110
 if we introduce anyone again 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.410
 a beginner who let's say is playing more 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.390
 less like that at that pace 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.580
 trying to accelerate what is happening all 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.680
 That's because the hand immediately panic 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.690
 loses the sensation of the string and begins to 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.350
 bite there a person more 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.510
 experienced this country feeling for years 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.130
 developed so we are there on thin 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.120
 the pick is quite thick by the way 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.370
 114 and as you can see nothing will be anywhere 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.070
 not stuck and even more so the country 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.600
 breaks so look work out 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.489
 all very carefully as usual 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.230
 slow and try to obey less 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.180
 This amateurs who talk about 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.090
 that you need to play metal 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.370
 put the strings there don't know 1472 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.230
 standard build necessarily hellish 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.060
 humbucker necessarily rubella and stuff 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.430
 it's all nonsense all metal is always 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.500
 is in the hands well and let's say so soul 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.500
 good luck everyone and bye
