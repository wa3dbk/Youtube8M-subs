in<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:12.480> segment<00:00:12.630> we're<00:00:12.870> going<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.080> talk

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
in this segment we're going to talk

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.950 
in this segment we're going to talk
about<00:00:13.230> wood<00:00:13.620> blocks<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.250> temple<00:00:14.580> blocks<00:00:14.960> when

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
about wood blocks and temple blocks when

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.420 
about wood blocks and temple blocks when
selecting<00:00:16.410> wood<00:00:16.560> blocks<00:00:16.800> it's<00:00:17.010> important<00:00:17.340> to

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
selecting wood blocks it's important to

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.130 
selecting wood blocks it's important to
remember<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:17.760> although<00:00:18.090> synthetic<00:00:18.930> or

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
remember that although synthetic or

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.590 
remember that although synthetic or
plastic<00:00:19.710> blocks<00:00:20.010> are<00:00:20.279> available<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:21.210> maybe

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
plastic blocks are available and maybe

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.840 
plastic blocks are available and maybe
slightly<00:00:21.810> more<00:00:22.080> durable<00:00:22.740> they're<00:00:23.279> not<00:00:23.550> really

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
slightly more durable they're not really

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.790 
slightly more durable they're not really
a<00:00:23.970> suitable<00:00:24.359> substitute<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:25.140> sound<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.619> is

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
a suitable substitute the sound is is

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.800 
a suitable substitute the sound is is
not<00:00:26.189> quite<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.640> same<00:00:26.820> quality<00:00:27.359> as<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.480> true

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
not quite the same quality as a true

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.689 
not quite the same quality as a true
wood<00:00:28.080> block<00:00:28.380> you're<00:00:29.130> probably<00:00:29.340> going<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.609> want

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
wood block you're probably going to want

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.099 
wood block you're probably going to want
to<00:00:29.820> have<00:00:29.910> several<00:00:30.179> different<00:00:30.330> sizes<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.960> wood

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
to have several different sizes of wood

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.260 
to have several different sizes of wood
block<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.250> can<00:00:32.399> have<00:00:32.610> different

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
block so that you can have different

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.569 
block so that you can have different
sound<00:00:33.570> choices<00:00:33.870> available<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.680> also<00:00:35.250> because

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
sound choices available and also because

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.100 
sound choices available and also because
certain<00:00:35.910> music<00:00:36.180> will<00:00:36.300> call<00:00:36.510> for<00:00:36.780> more<00:00:36.960> than

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
certain music will call for more than

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.440 
certain music will call for more than
one<00:00:37.260> size<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.680> wood<00:00:37.860> block<00:00:38.100> it's<00:00:39.059> important<00:00:39.390> to

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
one size of wood block it's important to

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.810 
one size of wood block it's important to
remember<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.739> temple<00:00:41.190> block<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.579> not<00:00:41.790> a

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
remember that a temple block is not a

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.700 
remember that a temple block is not a
suitable<00:00:42.210> substitute<00:00:42.660> for<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> wood<00:00:43.590> block

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
suitable substitute for a wood block

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:54.049 
suitable substitute for a wood block
they're<00:00:44.370> not<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.760> same<00:00:44.969> instrument<00:00:52.610> all<00:00:53.610> wood

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
they're not the same instrument all wood

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.700 
they're not the same instrument all wood
blocks<00:00:54.270> have<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> slit<00:00:54.870> which<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.559> what

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
blocks have a slit which is what

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.619 
blocks have a slit which is what
produces<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.579> characteristic<00:00:57.180> resonant

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
produces the characteristic resonant

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.970 
produces the characteristic resonant
sound<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> instrument<00:01:00.620> you<00:01:01.620> always<00:01:01.829> want

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
sound of the instrument you always want

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.319 
sound of the instrument you always want
to<00:01:02.010> make<00:01:02.070> sure<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.550> slit<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.879> facing<00:01:03.210> out

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
to make sure that the slit is facing out

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.090 
to make sure that the slit is facing out
towards<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.989> audience<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.619> conductor

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
towards the audience and the conductor

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.370 
towards the audience and the conductor
all<00:01:05.760> wood<00:01:06.030> blocks<00:01:06.210> also<00:01:06.450> have<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.750> sweet<00:01:07.140> spot

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
all wood blocks also have a sweet spot

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.690 
all wood blocks also have a sweet spot
just<00:01:07.710> like<00:01:07.770> all<00:01:08.100> other<00:01:08.430> percussion

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
just like all other percussion

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.270 
just like all other percussion
instruments<00:01:09.049> that's<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.200> spot<00:01:10.439> where<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:11.130> want

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
instruments that's a spot where you want

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.260 
instruments that's a spot where you want
to<00:01:11.369> strike<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.760> instrument<00:01:12.090> where<00:01:12.180> you're

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
to strike the instrument where you're

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.820 
to strike the instrument where you're
going<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.450> get<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> best<00:01:12.869> sound<00:01:13.140> out<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.710> on

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
going to get the best sound out of it on

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.560 
going to get the best sound out of it on
most<00:01:14.700> wood<00:01:14.909> blocks<00:01:15.119> it's<00:01:15.299> going<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.479> be

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
most wood blocks it's going to be

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.810 
most wood blocks it's going to be
towards<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.020> center<00:01:16.350> obviously<00:01:16.530> over<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
towards the center obviously over the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.999 
towards the center obviously over the
resonating<00:01:18.330> slit<00:01:18.750> not<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.619> side<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
resonating slit not on this side of the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.090 
resonating slit not on this side of the
instrument<00:01:23.930> if<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.170> play<00:01:25.320> too<00:01:25.590> close<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
instrument if you play too close to the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.910 
instrument if you play too close to the
edge<00:01:26.280> or<00:01:26.759> too<00:01:27.150> close<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> back<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
edge or too close to the back of the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.740 
edge or too close to the back of the
instrument<00:01:29.189> then<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.759> get<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> dead<00:01:30.540> sound

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
instrument then you get a dead sound

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.149 
instrument then you get a dead sound
that<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:30.990> probably<00:01:31.259> don't<00:01:31.530> want<00:01:35.689> now<00:01:37.159> ideally

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
that you probably don't want now ideally

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.920 
that you probably don't want now ideally
you<00:01:38.460> want<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.700> hold<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.299> wood<00:01:39.450> block<00:01:39.689> while

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
you want to hold the wood block while

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.450 
you want to hold the wood block while
you're<00:01:40.079> playing<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:40.740> like<00:01:41.159> I've<00:01:41.280> been

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
you're playing it just like I've been

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.910 
you're playing it just like I've been
doing<00:01:41.720> this<00:01:42.720> way<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.409> sound<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.710> going<00:01:43.829> to

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
doing this way the sound is going to

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.620 
doing this way the sound is going to
project<00:01:44.040> over<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.790> band<00:01:45.030> or<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.270> orchestra

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
project over the band or the orchestra

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.760 
project over the band or the orchestra
that<00:01:45.659> you're<00:01:45.930> playing<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:48.049> but<00:01:49.049> if<00:01:49.590> you're

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
that you're playing with but if you're

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.950 
that you're playing with but if you're
playing<00:01:49.950> music<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.369> requires<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.090> play

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
playing music that requires you to play

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.539 
playing music that requires you to play
on<00:01:52.079> more<00:01:52.320> than<00:01:52.409> one<00:01:52.619> wood<00:01:52.799> block<00:01:53.009> or<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.430> play

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
on more than one wood block or to play

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.010 
on more than one wood block or to play
something<00:01:53.880> that's<00:01:54.030> too<00:01:54.240> fast<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.720> play<00:01:54.869> with

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
something that's too fast to play with

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.929 
something that's too fast to play with
one<00:01:55.200> mallet<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:56.040> can<00:01:56.189> set<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.549> wood<00:01:56.700> blocks

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
one mallet you can set the wood blocks

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.270 
one mallet you can set the wood blocks
on<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.240> table<00:01:57.840> just<00:01:58.530> make<00:01:58.710> sure<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.070> table

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
on a table just make sure that the table

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.940 
on a table just make sure that the table
has<00:01:59.729> some<00:01:59.909> sort<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.119> towel<00:02:00.450> or<00:02:00.899> padding<00:02:01.710> so

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
has some sort of towel or padding so

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.609 
has some sort of towel or padding so
that<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.219> eliminate<00:02:02.729> any<00:02:02.909> extraneous<00:02:03.270> sound

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.229 

when<00:02:07.189> selecting<00:02:07.549> mounts<00:02:07.880> for<00:02:07.969> your<00:02:08.090> wood

blocks generally go for something that's
either<00:02:10.670> a<00:02:10.789> poly<00:02:11.180> or<00:02:11.510> rubber<00:02:11.810> certainly

something that's softer than the wood
itself<00:02:14.269> otherwise<00:02:14.750> it's<00:02:15.260> likely<00:02:15.590> that<00:02:15.709> you're

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
the m1 32 works great on this block but

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.100 
the m1 32 works great on this block but
occasionally<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.510> may<00:02:32.660> need<00:02:32.780> something

that's a little bit more of a special

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.660 
that's a little bit more of a special
sound<00:02:35.330> something<00:02:35.750> that's<00:02:35.870> really<00:02:36.110> piercing

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670

the<00:02:37.670> m1<00:02:37.940> 40<00:02:38.209> gets<00:02:38.360> a<00:02:38.420> good<00:02:38.540> sound<00:02:38.810> on<00:02:38.870> this

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.449 
the m1 40 gets a good sound on this
block<00:02:39.260> but<00:02:39.500> you<00:02:39.590> have<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.739> be<00:02:39.829> very<00:02:39.980> careful

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
block but you have to be very careful

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.789 
block but you have to be very careful
that<00:02:40.489> you<00:02:40.670> don't<00:02:40.819> play<00:02:40.970> too<00:02:41.450> loud<00:02:41.530> in<00:02:42.530> fact<00:02:42.709> you

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
that you don't play too loud in fact you

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.949 
that you don't play too loud in fact you
don't<00:02:42.890> really<00:02:43.069> need<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.400> because<00:02:43.970> this<00:02:44.540> mounts

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
don't really need to because this mounts

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.990 
don't really need to because this mounts
hard<00:02:45.170> enough<00:02:45.440> that<00:02:45.739> you<00:02:46.130> get<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.280> loud<00:02:46.579> sound

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
hard enough that you get a loud sound

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.240 
hard enough that you get a loud sound
without<00:02:47.450> playing<00:02:47.900> very<00:02:48.110> hard<00:02:48.290> at<00:02:48.380> all<00:02:51.250> temple

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
without playing very hard at all temple

without playing very hard at all temple
blocks<00:02:52.459> like<00:02:52.819> wood<00:02:53.060> blocks<00:02:53.360> also<00:02:53.989> have<00:02:54.079> a

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
blocks like wood blocks also have a

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.410 
blocks like wood blocks also have a
sweet<00:02:54.440> spot<00:02:54.709> when<00:02:54.980> they<00:02:55.069> sound<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.400> best

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.369 

again<00:02:59.420> it's<00:02:59.599> going<00:02:59.720> to<00:02:59.780> be<00:02:59.840> in<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.079> center<00:03:00.349> of

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
again it's going to be in the center of

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.319 
again it's going to be in the center of
the<00:03:00.470> instrument<00:03:00.890> over<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.579> slit<00:03:01.849> so<00:03:02.120> you<00:03:02.209> get

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
the instrument over the slit so you get

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:08.979 
the instrument over the slit so you get
that<00:03:02.420> nice<00:03:02.660> resonant<00:03:03.260> sound<00:03:07.420> also<00:03:08.420> like<00:03:08.780> wood

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
that nice resonant sound also like wood
