00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.819
 another tutorial video of me we are 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.859
 here in the end at a whole 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.330
 special tutorial and I'll show you 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.880
 here what it is you see here 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.980
 Convoy and a turquoise colored 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.580
 marine head and that are special 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.710
 convoys also call themselves royal 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.980
 there are convoys at the same time 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.750
 white whales and there are also social 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.939
 do and all of them have something in common 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.619
 because they are in the end so that here 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.390
 who can share with your friends 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.769
 after they have discovered and that they 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.270
 then for a certain time on the 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.890
 map will be displayed for you and yours 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.290
 friends and of course a bit 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.969
 you should not be annoying 1000 friends in 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.219
 uplay have to look now that 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.440
 she somehow gets and that you 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.000
 know where they are and that was for me 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.010
 very difficult because that needs in the 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.850
 end the 100% of the game 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.770
 complete 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.440
 both the driver and as I said 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.610
 the ships and they do yes and around you 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.710
 bring the petty to facilitate 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.090
 this video here show you how 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.140
 I did that and I think so 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.640
 that's the best way to do that 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.500
 yes as I said I have the little marie 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.850
 nicole had had the royal roy 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.830
 for that you have to find 3 as well 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.600
 whales and chests yes there is one here 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.580
 I'll show you the map here 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.040
 there you can end up on it 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.409
 there are all sorts of sports 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.960
 marked by the different things 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.220
 I post link down below if you 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.420
 interested, look at him 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.189
 Just go and then you can 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.530
 look for yourself where what is your end 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.810
 then you have to search 141 and then 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.220
 see if you Europe finds so 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.710
 a little time-consuming work is on 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.479
 every case is possible at the same time 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.520
 it still this forum here and this before 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.670
 are always relatively current so right 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.780
 with the pcb are relatively good match 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.600
 Positions posted for example hereof 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.280
 from the whale and so and the cologne look 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.450
 yes, how long can it be done and when? 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.610
 it is and there you can be in 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.619
 end effect gradually yes here this 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.240
 to acquire all these things 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.710
 I hope you help a little bit 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.600
 It really is not quite the same 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.610
 trivial to make me the things 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.380
 forum in any case helped a lot and 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.060
 Here you look like I mean social 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.710
 then found is relatively close 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.630
 answer it to actually find 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.799
