00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
multiplayer because we designed the game

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.450 
multiplayer because we designed the game
multiplayer<00:00:04.170> first<00:00:04.859> from<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.670> beginning<00:00:05.759> and

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
multiplayer so any mission we designed a

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.570 
multiplayer so any mission we designed a
multiplayer<00:00:16.170> game<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.650> then<00:00:17.100> we<00:00:17.220> said<00:00:17.430> that

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
though those look like actually for the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.840 
though those look like actually for the
for<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.740> multiplayer<00:01:56.189> games<00:01:56.490> we've<00:01:56.700> also

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
for the multiplayer games we've also

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.880 
for the multiplayer games we've also
taken<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.570> model<00:01:57.930> that's<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.170> bit<00:01:58.290> inspired<00:01:58.500> by

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
taken a model that's a bit inspired by

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.910 
taken a model that's a bit inspired by
sports<00:01:59.399> games<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.270> if<00:02:00.780> you've<00:02:01.020> got<00:02:01.290> six

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
sports games so if you've got six

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.789 
sports games so if you've got six
players<00:02:02.159> on<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.430> side<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:03.299> can<00:02:03.450> have<00:02:03.659> 600<00:02:04.530> units

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
players on a side you can have 600 units

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.069 
players on a side you can have 600 units
600<00:02:05.369> soldiers<00:02:05.549> but<00:02:06.090> they're<00:02:06.210> organized<00:02:06.659> into

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
600 soldiers but they're organized into

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.680 
600 soldiers but they're organized into
their<00:02:07.259> platoons<00:02:07.860> companies<00:02:08.550> etc<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.209> then<00:02:09.569> we

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
their platoons companies etc and then we

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.450 
their platoons companies etc and then we
split<00:02:09.929> control<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.709> the

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
split control of the

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.030 
split control of the
me<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:12.090> if<00:02:12.300> there's<00:02:12.540> 18<00:02:12.960> platoons<00:02:13.410> we've<00:02:13.770> got

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
me so if there's 18 platoons we've got

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.500 
me so if there's 18 platoons we've got
you<00:02:14.250> know<00:02:14.370> we<00:02:14.490> could<00:02:14.580> have<00:02:14.640> three<00:02:15.000> each<00:02:15.180> for

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
you know we could have three each for

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.950 
you know we could have three each for
example<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:17.160> then<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.460> other<00:02:17.490> thing<00:02:17.960> which

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
example and then the other thing which

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.020 
example and then the other thing which
we<00:02:19.110> do<00:02:19.260> with<00:02:19.410> that<00:02:19.530> another<00:02:20.370> key<00:02:20.580> feature<00:02:20.790> of

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
we do with that another key feature of

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.840 
we do with that another key feature of
the<00:02:21.150> multiplayer<00:02:21.630> is<00:02:21.960> your<00:02:22.890> your<00:02:23.400> army<00:02:23.730> which

you take online every battle they

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.550 
you take online every battle they
survive<00:02:25.860> every<00:02:26.610> unit<00:02:27.330> gets<00:02:27.810> experience

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
survive every unit gets experience
