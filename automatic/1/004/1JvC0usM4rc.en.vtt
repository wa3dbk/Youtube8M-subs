did<00:02:30.010> again<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:31.040> was<00:02:31.310> keeping<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.670> 9th<00:02:32.030> in<00:02:32.299> mind

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
did again I was keeping the 9th in mind

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:37.210 
did again I was keeping the 9th in mind
as<00:02:33.380> a<00:02:33.440> focal<00:02:34.100> point<00:02:34.519> I<00:02:34.900> tried<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:36.079> build<00:02:36.380> a<00:02:36.680> solo

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
as a focal point I tried to build a solo

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.539 
as a focal point I tried to build a solo
starting<00:02:38.090> slowly<00:02:39.160> starting<00:02:40.160> with<00:02:40.280> a<00:02:40.310> nice

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
starting slowly starting with a nice

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.420 
starting slowly starting with a nice
melodic<00:02:41.150> idea<00:02:42.430> using<00:02:43.430> question<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.239> answer

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
melodic idea using question and answer

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:53.129 
melodic idea using question and answer
in<00:02:46.540> putted<00:02:47.540> some<00:02:47.810> arpeggios<00:02:50.290> minor<00:02:51.290> arpeggio

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
in putted some arpeggios minor arpeggio

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.360 
in putted some arpeggios minor arpeggio
taking<00:02:54.139> that<00:02:54.260> arpeggio<00:02:54.650> and<00:02:55.010> making<00:02:55.310> a

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
taking that arpeggio and making a

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:04.119 
taking that arpeggio and making a
pattern<00:02:55.880> out<00:02:56.030> of<00:02:56.209> it

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.160 

you<00:03:05.129> can<00:03:05.340> reference<00:03:05.549> your<00:03:05.879> notation<00:03:06.599> for<00:03:06.959> some

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
you can reference your notation for some

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.800 
you can reference your notation for some
of<00:03:07.349> these<00:03:07.470> cool<00:03:07.830> little<00:03:08.099> minor<00:03:08.730> 9<00:03:09.530> riffs

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
of these cool little minor 9 riffs

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.649 
of these cool little minor 9 riffs
trying<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:12.959> add<00:03:13.049> some<00:03:13.260> speed<00:03:13.920> into<00:03:14.549> it<00:03:14.730> very

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
trying to add some speed into it very

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.930 
trying to add some speed into it very
little<00:03:15.959> speed<00:03:16.530> because<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.250> track<00:03:17.519> is<00:03:17.549> very

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
little speed because the track is very

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.270 
little speed because the track is very
busy<00:03:18.209> it's<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.780> little<00:03:19.019> bit<00:03:19.170> of<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.409> faster<00:03:20.069> tempo

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
busy it's a little bit of a faster tempo

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.180 
busy it's a little bit of a faster tempo
so<00:03:20.819> you<00:03:20.879> don't<00:03:21.239> necessarily<00:03:21.450> need<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.590> go<00:03:23.129> too

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
so you don't necessarily need to go too

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.940 
so you don't necessarily need to go too
crazy<00:03:23.549> but<00:03:24.480> every<00:03:24.780> once<00:03:24.959> in<00:03:25.110> a<00:03:25.200> while<00:03:25.379> we<00:03:25.650> try

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
crazy but every once in a while we try

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.770 
crazy but every once in a while we try
that<00:03:26.129> a<00:03:26.190> little<00:03:26.310> tremolo

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.440 

as<00:03:33.560> a<00:03:33.590> little<00:03:33.950> spice<00:03:34.280> a<00:03:34.310> little<00:03:34.640> excitement<00:03:35.209> to

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
as a little spice a little excitement to

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.010 
as a little spice a little excitement to
a<00:03:35.569> solo<00:03:36.069> also<00:03:37.069> in<00:03:37.459> putting<00:03:37.790> a<00:03:37.880> little<00:03:38.180> kind<00:03:38.959> of

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
a solo also in putting a little kind of

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.800 
a solo also in putting a little kind of
bluesy<00:03:39.580> kind<00:03:40.580> of<00:03:40.730> feel<00:03:41.060> which<00:03:41.300> we'll<00:03:41.660> discuss

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
bluesy kind of feel which we'll discuss

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.900 
bluesy kind of feel which we'll discuss
a<00:03:42.110> little<00:03:42.470> later<00:03:42.650> in<00:03:42.830> another<00:03:42.950> segment<00:03:43.400> adding

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
a little later in another segment adding

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.680 
a little later in another segment adding
the<00:03:44.000> blues<00:03:44.270> to<00:03:45.250> minor<00:03:46.250> scales<00:03:46.880> but<00:03:47.300> you<00:03:47.450> can

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
the blues to minor scales but you can

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.949 
the blues to minor scales but you can
use<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.170> blue<00:03:49.209> over<00:03:50.209> a<00:03:50.239> minor<00:03:50.480> chord<00:03:50.750> because

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
use the blue over a minor chord because

00:03:50.959 --> 00:04:02.160 
use the blue over a minor chord because
it's<00:03:51.319> in<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:51.560> notes<00:03:51.800> of<00:03:52.100> the<00:03:52.130> Dorian<00:03:52.610> scale

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:11.500 

great<00:04:03.170> way<00:04:03.319> to<00:04:03.380> spice<00:04:03.709> up<00:04:03.770> a<00:04:04.069> solo<00:04:10.209> again<00:04:11.209> with

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
great way to spice up a solo again with

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.370 
great way to spice up a solo again with
keeping<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.019> ninth<00:04:12.230> as<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:12.769> focal<00:04:13.160> point
