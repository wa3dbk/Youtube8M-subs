created their own network and we want to
absolutely<00:01:30.689> poor<00:01:31.649> fuel<00:01:31.920> on<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.280> fire<00:01:32.520> we

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
absolutely poor fuel on that fire we

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.550 
absolutely poor fuel on that fire we
think<00:01:32.909> it's<00:01:32.999> the<00:01:33.090> coolest<00:01:33.240> thing<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:34.380> lot

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
think it's the coolest thing and a lot

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.620 
think it's the coolest thing and a lot
of<00:01:34.590> big<00:01:34.889> companies<00:01:35.009> don't<00:01:35.399> get<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.759> so

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
of big companies don't get that so

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.510 
of big companies don't get that so
that's<00:01:36.810> what<00:01:36.959> the<00:01:37.049> tour<00:01:37.289> is<00:01:37.380> all<00:01:37.499> about<00:01:37.770> it's

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
that's what the tour is all about it's

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.039 
that's what the tour is all about it's
kind<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.759> going<00:01:38.939> back<00:01:39.179> to<00:01:39.359> our<00:01:39.389> roots<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.810> kind

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
kind of going back to our roots and kind

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.349 
kind of going back to our roots and kind
of<00:01:40.109> paying<00:01:40.499> our<00:01:40.740> respect<00:01:41.219> to<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.999> the<00:01:42.119> fan

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:42.359 
of paying our respect to the to the fan

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:43.849 
of paying our respect to the to the fan
base<00:01:42.539> that<00:01:42.600> kind<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.139> kept<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.439> brand<00:01:43.619> alive

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:43.859 
base that kind of kept the brand alive

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:44.899 
base that kind of kept the brand alive
when<00:01:44.069> we<00:01:44.189> were<00:01:44.249> going<00:01:44.399> through<00:01:44.490> our<00:01:44.609> tough

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
when we were going through our tough

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.149 
when we were going through our tough
times<00:01:45.179> and<00:01:45.329> really<00:01:46.200> we're<00:01:46.709> going<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.889> take<00:01:47.009> all

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
times and really we're going to take all

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.709 
times and really we're going to take all
that<00:01:47.280> feedback<00:01:47.520> hopefully<00:01:48.090> will<00:01:48.359> be<00:01:48.389> bumping

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
that feedback hopefully will be bumping

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:50.059 
that feedback hopefully will be bumping
into<00:01:48.810> owners<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.380> we'll<00:01:49.499> hear<00:01:49.709> what<00:01:49.950> they

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
into owners and we'll hear what they

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:51.379 
into owners and we'll hear what they
like<00:01:50.219> and<00:01:50.249> don't<00:01:50.429> like<00:01:50.609> about<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.999> cars<00:01:51.209> and

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:51.389 
like and don't like about the cars and

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:52.340 
like and don't like about the cars and
we'll<00:01:51.479> just<00:01:51.659> keep<00:01:51.840> trying<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.109> make<00:01:52.229> them

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
we'll just keep trying to make them

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.959 
we'll just keep trying to make them
better<00:01:52.499> and<00:01:52.829> we<00:01:52.950> really<00:01:53.249> learned<00:01:53.429> a<00:01:53.549> lot<00:01:53.729> and

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:53.969 
better and we really learned a lot and

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:55.429 
better and we really learned a lot and
really<00:01:54.090> perfected<00:01:54.719> it<00:01:54.779> and<00:01:54.899> kept<00:01:55.049> tweaking

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
really perfected it and kept tweaking

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.319 
really perfected it and kept tweaking
and<00:01:55.529> tweaking<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.490> it's<00:01:56.639> benefited<00:01:57.240> from

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
and tweaking it so it's benefited from

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.330 
and tweaking it so it's benefited from
the<00:01:57.479> evolution<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.139> the<00:01:58.740> engineering<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.279> to

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
the evolution of the engineering so to

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.580 
the evolution of the engineering so to
speak<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.819> we<00:02:00.240> get<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.569> we<00:02:00.600> live<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.170> have<00:02:01.529> an

many<00:02:47.099> many<00:02:47.250> SRT<00:02:47.760> owners<00:02:47.969> even<00:02:48.090> better<00:02:48.389> drivers

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
many many SRT owners even better drivers

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.660 
many many SRT owners even better drivers
and<00:02:49.019> they<00:02:49.680> so<00:02:50.129> far<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.370> don't<00:02:50.489> know<00:02:50.549> these

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
and they so far you don't know these

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:51.830 
and they so far you don't know these
cars<00:02:50.909> too<00:02:51.060> well<00:02:51.209> but<00:02:51.329> you're<00:02:51.450> going<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.599> spend

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
cars too well but you're going to spend

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.020 
cars too well but you're going to spend
a<00:02:51.989> whole<00:02:52.170> lot<00:02:52.230> of<00:02:52.500> time<00:02:52.709> in<00:02:52.889> them<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.790> think

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
a whole lot of time in them and I think

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.250
