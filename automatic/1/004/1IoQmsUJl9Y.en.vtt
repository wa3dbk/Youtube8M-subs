00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.499 
kill him at the entrance you want to go
ahead<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.140> go<00:01:43.200> up<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.560> ramp<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.180> just<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
ahead and go up the ramp and just to the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.530 
ahead and go up the ramp and just to the
doorway<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.439> fight<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.920> next<00:01:47.100> adviser<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.970> he

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
doorway to fight the next adviser and he

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.330 
doorway to fight the next adviser and he
walks<00:01:48.810> normal<00:01:49.290> speed

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
walks normal speed

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.270 
walks normal speed
and<00:01:53.289> here<00:01:54.289> he<00:01:54.409> is<00:01:54.439> right<00:01:54.649> here<00:01:54.710> this<00:01:55.159> guy

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
and here he is right here this guy

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.990 
and here he is right here this guy
periodically<00:01:56.119> fears<00:01:56.659> you<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:57.759> that's<00:01:58.759> about

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
periodically fears you and that's about

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.389 
periodically fears you and that's about
it<00:01:59.210> so<00:01:59.420> both<00:01:59.930> the<00:02:00.140> first<00:02:00.470> two<00:02:00.829> advisors<00:02:01.250> are

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
it so both the first two advisors are

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.660 
it so both the first two advisors are
pretty<00:02:01.610> simplistic<00:02:01.970> and<00:02:03.100> just<00:02:04.100> defeat<00:02:04.460> him

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
pretty simplistic and just defeat him

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.010 
pretty simplistic and just defeat him
and<00:02:04.850> there's<00:02:05.000> a<00:02:05.090> fear<00:02:05.390> right<00:02:05.570> there<00:02:05.600> and<00:02:05.960> I

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
and there's a fear right there and I

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.259 
and there's a fear right there and I
speeded<00:02:06.380> it<00:02:06.409> up<00:02:06.530> to<00:02:06.890> continue<00:02:07.250> on<00:02:07.399> now<00:02:08.000> he's

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
speeded it up to continue on now he's

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.749 
speeded it up to continue on now he's
dead<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:09.080> next<00:02:09.319> advisor<00:02:09.709> is<00:02:10.099> the<00:02:10.580> most

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
dead the next advisor is the most

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.089 
dead the next advisor is the most
annoying<00:02:11.120> advisor<00:02:11.630> in<00:02:12.019> my<00:02:12.349> opinion<00:02:12.800> because<00:02:13.069> I

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
annoying advisor in my opinion because I

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.220 
annoying advisor in my opinion because I
always<00:02:13.580> had<00:02:13.760> trouble<00:02:13.970> at<00:02:14.239> this<00:02:14.330> advisor<00:02:14.660> like

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
always had trouble at this advisor like

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.900 
always had trouble at this advisor like
in<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.440> past<00:02:15.620> we<00:02:15.800> tried<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:16.040> form<00:02:16.250> this<00:02:16.430> like

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
in the past we tried to form this like

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.490 
in the past we tried to form this like
she<00:02:17.239> was<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.480> one<00:02:17.660> that<00:02:17.840> made<00:02:18.050> it<00:02:18.110> impossible

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
she was the one that made it impossible

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.920 
she was the one that made it impossible
or<00:02:19.099> difficult<00:02:19.160> for<00:02:19.940> me<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.120> even<00:02:20.269> attempt<00:02:20.720> this

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
or difficult for me to even attempt this

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.259 
or difficult for me to even attempt this
she's<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:21.860> caster<00:02:22.459> and<00:02:22.670> she'll<00:02:22.880> cast<00:02:23.060> a

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
she's a caster and she'll cast a

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.330 
she's a caster and she'll cast a
fireball<00:02:23.420> on<00:02:23.810> you<00:02:24.049> which<00:02:24.260> is<00:02:24.440> like<00:02:24.470> well<00:02:25.040> she

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
fireball on you which is like well she

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.920 
fireball on you which is like well she
cast<00:02:25.549> IRA<00:02:25.790> balls<00:02:26.000> but<00:02:26.239> she'll<00:02:26.390> cast<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:26.690> spell

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930

on<00:02:26.959> you<00:02:27.080> that<00:02:27.230> stuns<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:27.709> for<00:02:27.920> a<00:02:27.950> very<00:02:28.040> long

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
on you that stuns you for a very long

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.880 
on you that stuns you for a very long
time<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:29.180> think<00:02:29.510> it's<00:02:29.750> like<00:02:29.870> eight<00:02:30.110> seconds<00:02:30.769> or

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
time I think it's like eight seconds or

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.949 
time I think it's like eight seconds or
something<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.430> she<00:02:31.849> also<00:02:32.060> did<00:02:32.360> closed<00:02:32.720> here

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
something and she also did closed here

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.509 
something and she also did closed here
she<00:02:33.080> does<00:02:33.230> an<00:02:33.319> arcane<00:02:33.620> explosion<00:02:33.709> that<00:02:34.310> knocks

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519

depth specifically for her because I

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.100 
depth specifically for her because I

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
very long the last advisor the fourth

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.020 
very long the last advisor the fourth
one<00:02:51.260> is<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.560> engineer<00:02:51.950> advisor<00:02:52.220> you'll<00:02:52.819> put<00:02:53.000> a

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
one is the engineer advisor you'll put a

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.000 
one is the engineer advisor you'll put a
debuff<00:02:53.420> on<00:02:53.569> you<00:02:53.780> that<00:02:53.959> lasts<00:02:54.349> for<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:54.560> minute

and periodically stun you for three

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.870 
and periodically stun you for three
seconds<00:02:57.290> it's<00:02:57.590> really<00:02:57.980> annoying<00:02:58.250> but<00:02:58.609> again

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
seconds it's really annoying but again

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.849 
seconds it's really annoying but again
not<00:02:59.030> as<00:02:59.150> bad<00:02:59.329> as<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.660> caster<00:03:00.290> that<00:03:00.470> stuns<00:03:00.799> you

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
not as bad as the caster that stuns you

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:02.710 
not as bad as the caster that stuns you
for<00:03:01.040> like<00:03:01.160> eight<00:03:01.280> seconds<00:03:01.730> what<00:03:02.329> you<00:03:02.359> do<00:03:02.600> with

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
for like eight seconds what you do with

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.569 
for like eight seconds what you do with
them<00:03:02.870> is<00:03:03.079> you<00:03:03.170> take<00:03:03.380> them<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.769> the<00:03:03.890> entrance<00:03:04.400> of

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
them is you take them to the entrance of

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:05.890 
them is you take them to the entrance of
the<00:03:04.700> princes<00:03:05.090> room<00:03:05.299> which<00:03:05.450> will<00:03:05.600> be<00:03:05.690> locked

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
the princes room which will be locked

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.110 
the princes room which will be locked
and<00:03:06.200> you<00:03:06.769> wanted<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.130> beat<00:03:07.340> him<00:03:07.519> here<00:03:07.940> and

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
and you wanted to beat him here and

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.780 
and you wanted to beat him here and
he'll<00:03:09.079> be<00:03:09.109> dead<00:03:09.410> and<00:03:09.650> you'll<00:03:09.859> basically<00:03:10.250> laid

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
he'll be dead and you'll basically laid

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.960 
he'll be dead and you'll basically laid
out<00:03:10.940> all<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.239> biters<00:03:12.100> so<00:03:13.100> it's<00:03:13.400> easier<00:03:13.910> to

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
out all the biters so it's easier to

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.360 
out all the biters so it's easier to
fight<00:03:14.750> them<00:03:14.959> all<00:03:15.109> so<00:03:15.470> you<00:03:15.560> have<00:03:15.650> those<00:03:15.769> periods

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
fight them all so you have those periods

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.300 
fight them all so you have those periods
in<00:03:16.459> between<00:03:17.620> some<00:03:18.620> people<00:03:18.859> can<00:03:18.980> probably<00:03:19.069> take

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
in between some people can probably take

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.360 
in between some people can probably take
them<00:03:19.459> all<00:03:19.579> in<00:03:19.730> at<00:03:19.850> once<00:03:20.060> but<00:03:20.769> I've<00:03:21.769> never<00:03:22.160> been

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
them all in at once but I've never been

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.520 
them all in at once but I've never been
really<00:03:22.639> good<00:03:22.819> at<00:03:22.970> that<00:03:23.090> so<00:03:23.359> I<00:03:23.569> try<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:23.930> do<00:03:24.380> it<00:03:24.440> as

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
really good at that so I try to do it as

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.910 
really good at that so I try to do it as
safe<00:03:24.680> as<00:03:24.769> possible<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:25.639> next<00:03:25.910> stage<00:03:26.329> is<00:03:26.920> the

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
safe as possible the next stage is the

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.069 
safe as possible the next stage is the
weapons<00:03:28.489> stage<00:03:28.790> and<00:03:29.090> you<00:03:29.209> basically<00:03:29.420> just<00:03:29.660> AoE

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
weapons stage and you basically just AoE

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.129 
weapons stage and you basically just AoE
all<00:03:30.350> the<00:03:30.440> weapons<00:03:30.709> down<00:03:30.889> really<00:03:31.100> quick<00:03:31.959> if<00:03:32.959> you

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
all the weapons down really quick if you

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:34.720 
all the weapons down really quick if you
do<00:03:33.290> take<00:03:33.530> too<00:03:33.709> long<00:03:33.889> and<00:03:33.950> automatic<00:03:34.519> that<00:03:34.609> goes

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
do take too long and automatic that goes

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.270 
do take too long and automatic that goes
into<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.000> next<00:03:35.209> phase<00:03:35.420> I<00:03:35.660> believe<00:03:36.190> once<00:03:37.190> you

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
into the next phase I believe once you

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.890 
into the next phase I believe once you
defeat<00:03:37.579> the<00:03:37.730> weapons<00:03:38.060> you<00:03:38.569> don't<00:03:38.750> have<00:03:38.840> to

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
defeat the weapons you don't have to

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.720 
defeat the weapons you don't have to
pick<00:03:39.049> up<00:03:39.079> the<00:03:39.319> weapons<00:03:40.190> that<00:03:40.250> they<00:03:40.400> drop<00:03:40.579> or

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
pick up the weapons that they drop or

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.190 
pick up the weapons that they drop or
anything<00:03:40.880> because<00:03:41.239> they<00:03:41.329> were<00:03:41.630> special<00:03:42.109> and

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
anything because they were special and

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.259 
anything because they were special and
used<00:03:42.470> in<00:03:42.620> the<00:03:42.709> past<00:03:42.980> but<00:03:43.310> you<00:03:43.910> don't<00:03:44.090> want<00:03:44.209> to

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
used in the past but you don't want to

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.620 
used in the past but you don't want to
give<00:03:44.389> up<00:03:44.480> your<00:03:44.630> powerful<00:03:45.010> 90<00:03:46.010> level<00:03:46.280> weapons

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
give up your powerful 90 level weapons

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.750 
give up your powerful 90 level weapons
the<00:03:47.720> benefit<00:03:48.020> that<00:03:48.050> they<00:03:48.260> give<00:03:48.440> so<00:03:49.070> just<00:03:49.250> leave

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
the benefit that they give so just leave

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.020 
the benefit that they give so just leave
them<00:03:49.880> alone<00:03:49.910> and<00:03:50.590> this<00:03:51.590> days<00:03:51.890> all<00:03:52.340> the

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
them alone and this days all the

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.850 
them alone and this days all the
advisers<00:03:53.420> are<00:03:53.600> resurrected<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:54.470> since<00:03:54.710> they

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
advisers are resurrected and since they

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.370 
advisers are resurrected and since they
are<00:03:54.890> split<00:03:55.340> up<00:03:55.490> now<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:56.660> other<00:03:56.810> advisers<00:03:57.260> will

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
are split up now the other advisers will

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.780 
are split up now the other advisers will
take<00:03:57.560> a<00:03:57.680> while<00:03:57.830> to<00:03:57.860> get<00:03:58.130> to<00:03:58.160> you<00:03:58.370> so<00:03:58.610> it<00:03:58.670> gives

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
take a while to get to you so it gives

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.240 
take a while to get to you so it gives
you<00:03:58.880> time<00:03:59.030> to<00:03:59.090> kill<00:03:59.450> the<00:03:59.750> first<00:03:59.930> one<00:04:00.130> then<00:04:01.130> you

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
you time to kill the first one then you

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.920 
you time to kill the first one then you
can<00:04:01.400> maybe<00:04:01.760> kill<00:04:02.030> the<00:04:02.120> second<00:04:02.540> one<00:04:02.690> if<00:04:02.840> you

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
can maybe kill the second one if you

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.200 
can maybe kill the second one if you
don't<00:04:03.080> get<00:04:03.140> that<00:04:03.440> stun<00:04:03.800> to<00:04:04.070> often<00:04:04.490> and<00:04:05.180> that

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210 
don't get that stun to often and that

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.650 
don't get that stun to often and that
debuff<00:04:05.720> and<00:04:06.700> the<00:04:07.700> reason<00:04:07.970> I<00:04:08.030> put<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.270> cast<00:04:08.480> at

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
debuff and the reason I put the cast at

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.910 
debuff and the reason I put the cast at
the<00:04:08.720> very<00:04:08.900> beginning<00:04:09.260> with<00:04:09.350> the<00:04:09.440> slow<00:04:09.680> guys

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
the very beginning with the slow guys

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.770 
the very beginning with the slow guys
cuz<00:04:10.220> I<00:04:10.250> don't<00:04:10.430> like<00:04:10.610> deal<00:04:10.910> with<00:04:11.090> her<00:04:11.330> until

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
cuz I don't like deal with her until

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.430 
cuz I don't like deal with her until
almost<00:04:12.140> lasts<00:04:12.650> and<00:04:13.010> she's<00:04:13.160> already<00:04:13.310> there<00:04:13.580> now

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
almost lasts and she's already there now

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.500 
almost lasts and she's already there now
but<00:04:15.440> since<00:04:15.650> what<00:04:15.890> advisors<00:04:16.340> down<00:04:16.880> at<00:04:17.090> least<00:04:17.239> it

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
but since what advisors down at least it

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.500 
but since what advisors down at least it
reduces<00:04:18.140> the<00:04:18.830> damage<00:04:19.100> I'm<00:04:19.400> getting<00:04:19.670> hit<00:04:20.330> by

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
reduces the damage I'm getting hit by

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.540 
reduces the damage I'm getting hit by
because<00:04:21.020> all<00:04:21.320> these<00:04:21.590> stuns<00:04:21.950> basically

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
because all these stuns basically

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.070 
because all these stuns basically
immobilizes<00:04:23.360> me<00:04:25.210> right<00:04:26.210> here<00:04:26.360> I<00:04:26.390> tried<00:04:26.660> to<00:04:26.840> use

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
immobilizes me right here I tried to use

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.500 
immobilizes me right here I tried to use
touch<00:04:27.500> of<00:04:27.680> death<00:04:28.220> on<00:04:28.430> her<00:04:28.730> to<00:04:29.000> get<00:04:29.150> rid<00:04:29.300> of<00:04:29.330> her

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
touch of death on her to get rid of her

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.170 
touch of death on her to get rid of her
as<00:04:29.630> quickly<00:04:29.810> as<00:04:30.050> possible<00:04:30.080> and<00:04:30.970> she<00:04:31.970> attempted

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
as quickly as possible and she attempted

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.420 
as quickly as possible and she attempted
to<00:04:32.360> use<00:04:32.510> arcane<00:04:32.810> explosion<00:04:32.930> to<00:04:33.380> knock<00:04:33.560> me<00:04:33.710> back

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.730 

see<00:04:39.419> it's<00:04:39.509> very<00:04:39.630> difficult<00:04:40.199> especially<00:04:40.290> with

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
see it's very difficult especially with

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.400 
see it's very difficult especially with
all<00:04:40.860> these<00:04:40.979> like<00:04:41.250> fears<00:04:41.699> and<00:04:42.120> stuns<00:04:42.509> and<00:04:42.900> knock

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
all these like fears and stuns and knock

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.159 
all these like fears and stuns and knock
backs<00:04:43.910> really<00:04:44.910> bothersome<00:04:45.389> it's<00:04:45.780> funny<00:04:46.020> how

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
backs really bothersome it's funny how

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.650 
backs really bothersome it's funny how
you<00:04:46.229> can<00:04:46.380> be<00:04:46.470> level<00:04:46.740> 90<00:04:47.160> and<00:04:47.400> old<00:04:48.060> mechanics

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
you can be level 90 and old mechanics

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.050 
you can be level 90 and old mechanics
can<00:04:49.350> still<00:04:49.680> completely<00:04:50.100> disable<00:04:50.669> you<00:04:50.820> and<00:04:51.000> you

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
can still completely disable you and you

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.520 
can still completely disable you and you
die<00:04:52.880> she's<00:04:53.880> down<00:04:54.150> you<00:04:54.479> kill<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:54.840> next<00:04:55.020> guy<00:04:55.229> and

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
die she's down you kill the next guy and

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.620 
die she's down you kill the next guy and
the<00:04:55.949> last<00:04:56.220> one<00:04:56.550> takes<00:04:56.880> well<00:04:57.060> to<00:04:57.090> walk<00:04:57.330> -<00:04:57.539> I

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
the last one takes well to walk - I

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.360 
the last one takes well to walk - I
think<00:04:57.750> we<00:04:57.930> killed<00:04:58.139> him<00:04:58.259> excellent<00:04:58.710> yeah<00:04:59.039> that

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
think we killed him excellent yeah that

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.969 
think we killed him excellent yeah that
was<00:04:59.460> the<00:04:59.550> last<00:04:59.729> guy<00:05:00.259> then<00:05:01.259> the<00:05:01.350> prince<00:05:01.620> comes

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
was the last guy then the prince comes

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.180 
was the last guy then the prince comes
to<00:05:02.250> you<00:05:02.400> and<00:05:02.699> he<00:05:03.479> just<00:05:03.840> fireballs<00:05:04.590> you<00:05:04.800> he<00:05:04.979> does

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
to you and he just fireballs you he does

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.120 
to you and he just fireballs you he does
pyroblast<00:05:05.729> like<00:05:06.479> twice<00:05:07.289> I<00:05:07.530> think<00:05:07.560> like<00:05:07.889> one

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
pyroblast like twice I think like one

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.610 
pyroblast like twice I think like one
time<00:05:08.340> and<00:05:08.520> does<00:05:08.639> it<00:05:08.669> again<00:05:08.940> randomly<00:05:09.620> that's

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
time and does it again randomly that's

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.439 
time and does it again randomly that's
not<00:05:10.860> a<00:05:10.889> big<00:05:11.070> deal<00:05:11.100> at<00:05:11.460> level<00:05:11.699> 90<00:05:12.060> for<00:05:12.240> the<00:05:12.300> most

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
not a big deal at level 90 for the most

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:14.689 
not a big deal at level 90 for the most
part<00:05:12.720> I<00:05:12.930> don't<00:05:13.050> think<00:05:13.380> he<00:05:13.979> also<00:05:14.130> summons

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 
part I don't think he also summons

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:16.400 
part I don't think he also summons
little<00:05:14.910> phoenix<00:05:15.300> eggs<00:05:15.600> you<00:05:15.990> can<00:05:16.110> kill<00:05:16.320> the

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
little phoenix eggs you can kill the

just get away from him to be safe and I

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.760 
just get away from him to be safe and I

and then once he's done with that I come
back<00:06:51.550> when<00:06:52.550> you're<00:06:52.700> in<00:06:52.760> the<00:06:52.850> air<00:06:52.970> anyway<00:06:53.240> -<00:06:53.390> he

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:53.660 
back when you're in the air anyway - he

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.090 
back when you're in the air anyway - he

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:55.100 
has a shield that protects him so you

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.440 
has a shield that protects him so you
might<00:06:55.250> as<00:06:55.310> well<00:06:55.400> just<00:06:55.550> go<00:06:55.790> back<00:06:56.000> and<00:06:56.240> wait<00:06:56.420> for

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:56.450 
might as well just go back and wait for

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.480 
might as well just go back and wait for
that<00:06:56.720> that<00:06:57.110> base<00:06:57.320> to<00:06:57.350> be<00:06:57.590> over<00:06:57.890> and<00:06:58.130> then<00:06:58.340> once

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:58.490 
that that base to be over and then once

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:07.220 
part really I think in my opinion is

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.320 
part really I think in my opinion is
dealing<00:07:07.640> with<00:07:07.730> the<00:07:07.910> advisors<00:07:08.360> sometimes<00:07:08.810> and

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:10.330 
dealing with the advisors sometimes and

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.770 
dealing with the advisors sometimes and
then<00:07:11.330> I<00:07:11.420> get<00:07:11.540> to<00:07:11.660> loot<00:07:11.930> my<00:07:12.260> prize

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:21.290 
definitely worth it because that Phoenix

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.110 
definitely worth it because that Phoenix
