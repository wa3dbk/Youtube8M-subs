00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.929
 the man who went final in between camp 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.330
 rotterdam rotterdammers names set one 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.860
 ahead through oliver polkamp 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.790
 doubled after more than ten minutes of playing 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.790
 to score bass campbell 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.330
 shortly thereafter the philips makes mullebrouck 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.460
 the connection goal but before 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.930
 timmo kranstauber provided a rest 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.439
 use penalty corner for the three in 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.439
 rest position 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.780
 what a rest it was again 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.160
 kranstauber who just managed to find it 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.899
 your trouser pants and constantine junker 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:46.200
 splendor camp to thrill back in the 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:48.239
 kranstauber competition with its 3rd goal 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.510
 rotterdammers go again 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.510
 again 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.640
 Jonker again provides the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.450
 hit but again 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.620
 kranstauber 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.620
 large the margin and two 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.390
 in the final phase of deep even Rotterdam 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.390
 from my team through victory 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.799
 hubo but rotterdam itself the new room 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:18.659
 can 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.460
 yes this is great fun we have it 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.960
 Season say sin internationals on 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.689
 we have tackled the normal way 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.130
 it trained a little every week and 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.390
 as a nice thing to dive with their range 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.970
 complete 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.289
 this match was a breeze 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.909
 no a far from was seven minutes before 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.979
 time it makes a big difference to me 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.270
 maybe ten minutes but that was it 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.250
 ultimately Kloos Cambuur also has 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.240
 eyes that also light from the ether 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.340
 another win 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.810
 so this was no easy task 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.270
 this law so that the skin pulled why 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.610
 you guys are over well i think so 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.560
 it ended up being a 5 to 5 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.179
 situation without keepers 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.610
 just slightly better would have pierce just 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:56.159
 slightly stronger because it has 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.840
 made a difference but what bus do what 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.569
 The best thing about this competition was true 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.500
 looks back with most satisfied feeling 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.880
 to is very simple that is ultimately 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.770
 just throw it in , just 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.810
 just first place and the result 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.610
 that is that everything saves everything but well 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.319
 I also think if your team is side by side 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.930
 explains that rotterdam has more quality 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.310
 has more room internationals I think 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.410
 that today we certainly have a chance 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.359
 had to win and have on crucial 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.400
 traffic get against each other 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:21.989
 there are opportunities not made see penalty corners 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.090
 made Rotterdam but rightly so 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.590
 champions to I congratulate taste and 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.819
 jewels wetg a bit behind fact 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.260
 approached it also went one 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.340
 you kind of bet on yourself 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.230
 venture 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.389
 yes i think i'll be a long time after that 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.950
 had the margin of two goals against and 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.959
 then I had said at crucial moments 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.000
 gets a card against than the last 5 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.380
 minutes another period that it us 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.850
 could fight back 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.220
 mate played with 3 against pain of that 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.350
 you will not save so unfortunately 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.000
 how looked back at your own game oh yes 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.019
 fine i actually had 0 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.730
 expectations of today 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.290
 that is very simple because camp 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.450
 qualifies with a very good team and 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.069
 it was about them today and today 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.750
 well played it was more of going on 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.549
 two empty spots on the couch free the them 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.349
 asked if Sander wanted the wine and I 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.670
 do yes i like that i would have one 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.670
 very nice game so I happy gram
