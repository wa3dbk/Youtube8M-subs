okay<00:00:00.719> hi<00:00:01.050> everybody<00:00:01.620> today<00:00:02.100> we're<00:00:02.399> gonna<00:00:02.490> be

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
okay hi everybody today we're gonna be

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.670 
okay hi everybody today we're gonna be
doing<00:00:02.970> an<00:00:03.090> experiment<00:00:03.540> on<00:00:03.840> exothermic

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
doing an experiment on exothermic

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.130 
doing an experiment on exothermic
reactions<00:00:05.310> by<00:00:05.910> lighting<00:00:06.299> this<00:00:06.420> dollar<00:00:06.779> bill

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
reactions by lighting this dollar bill

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.400 
reactions by lighting this dollar bill
on<00:00:07.170> fire<00:00:07.680> so<00:00:08.370> before<00:00:09.210> we<00:00:09.360> even<00:00:09.389> start<00:00:10.110> just

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
on fire so before we even start just

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.110 
on fire so before we even start just
make<00:00:10.650> sure<00:00:10.889> if<00:00:11.070> you<00:00:11.190> ever<00:00:11.219> do<00:00:11.580> this<00:00:11.610> experiment

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
make sure if you ever do this experiment

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.079 
make sure if you ever do this experiment
there's<00:00:12.750> adult<00:00:13.019> supervision<00:00:13.620> around<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.849> fear

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
there's adult supervision around a fear

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.019 
there's adult supervision around a fear
child<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.990> even<00:00:16.619> if<00:00:16.740> you're<00:00:16.859> doing<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.400> just

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
child and even if you're doing it just

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.640 
child and even if you're doing it just
make<00:00:18.210> sure<00:00:18.390> there's<00:00:18.600> someone<00:00:18.990> with<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.500> do

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
make sure there's someone with you to do

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.230 
make sure there's someone with you to do
it<00:00:19.740> because<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:20.279> can't<00:00:20.550> really<00:00:20.820> do<00:00:21.090> this

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
it because you can't really do this

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.570 
it because you can't really do this
experiment<00:00:21.900> on<00:00:22.050> your<00:00:22.199> own<00:00:22.410> you're<00:00:23.250> gonna<00:00:23.369> need

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
experiment on your own you're gonna need

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.710 
experiment on your own you're gonna need
someone<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.910> help<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.180> light<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.510> dollar

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
someone to help you light the dollar

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.950 
someone to help you light the dollar
bill<00:00:25.019> on<00:00:25.050> fire<00:00:25.380> so<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:27.119> lesson<00:00:27.330> basically

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
bill on fire so this lesson basically

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.560 
bill on fire so this lesson basically
deals<00:00:28.260> with<00:00:28.439> chemical<00:00:29.220> reactions<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.970> energy

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
deals with chemical reactions and energy

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.830 
deals with chemical reactions and energy
and<00:00:31.130> when<00:00:32.130> most<00:00:32.340> people<00:00:32.460> think<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:33.239> energy

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
and when most people think of energy

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.200 
and when most people think of energy
they<00:00:34.020> think<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.530> batteries<00:00:35.520> being<00:00:35.790> powered<00:00:36.180> by

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
they think of batteries being powered by

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.660 
they think of batteries being powered by
energy<00:00:36.930> but<00:00:37.649> energy<00:00:38.100> can<00:00:38.250> also<00:00:38.430> be

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
energy but energy can also be

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.569 
energy but energy can also be
transferred<00:00:39.090> as<00:00:39.510> light<00:00:39.840> as<00:00:40.110> he<00:00:40.170> as<00:00:40.890> sound

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
transferred as light as he as sound

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.319 
transferred as light as he as sound
waves<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.920> the<00:00:43.920> most<00:00:44.100> common<00:00:44.670> example<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:45.270> a

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
waves and the most common example is a

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.400 
waves and the most common example is a
car<00:00:45.719> being<00:00:45.960> powered<00:00:46.350> by<00:00:46.379> energy<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:48.410> it's

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
car being powered by energy and it's

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.229 
car being powered by energy and it's
powered<00:00:49.770> by<00:00:49.800> energy<00:00:50.280> through<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> gasoline

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
powered by energy through the gasoline

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.110 
powered by energy through the gasoline
that's<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:53.010> gasoline<00:00:53.460> takes<00:00:53.969> the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
that's in it and the gasoline takes the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.180 
that's in it and the gasoline takes the
energy<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.750> transfers<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.440> heat<00:00:55.469> outwards

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
energy and transfers the heat outwards

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.549 
energy and transfers the heat outwards
that's<00:00:56.789> why<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.180> engine<00:00:57.629> if<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.109> ever<00:00:58.289> feel

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
that's why the engine if you ever feel

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.680 
that's why the engine if you ever feel
it<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.890> very<00:00:58.920> very<00:00:59.520> hot<00:00:59.789> but<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.180> doubt<00:01:00.239> you<00:01:00.510> want

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
it is very very hot but I doubt you want

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.680 
it is very very hot but I doubt you want
to<00:01:00.750> feel<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.050> engine<00:01:02.210> okay<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.270> what<00:01:03.539> we're

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
to feel the engine okay so what we're

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.030 
to feel the engine okay so what we're
gonna<00:01:03.750> be<00:01:03.930> doing<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.290> showing<00:01:04.320> how<00:01:04.799> this

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
gonna be doing is showing how this

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.700 
gonna be doing is showing how this
dollar<00:01:05.339> bill<00:01:05.510> transfers<00:01:06.510> heat<00:01:06.810> outwards<00:01:07.409> and

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
dollar bill transfers heat outwards and

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.030 
dollar bill transfers heat outwards and
when<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:08.610> light<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.000> fire<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.720> won't<00:01:10.080> cause

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
when we light it on fire it won't cause

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.429 
when we light it on fire it won't cause
the<00:01:11.400> dollar<00:01:11.610> bill<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.030> burn<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.840> will<00:01:13.020> just<00:01:13.260> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
the dollar bill to burn it will just the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.320 
the dollar bill to burn it will just the
heat<00:01:13.650> won<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.250> flames<00:01:14.520> will<00:01:14.760> go<00:01:14.880> outwards

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
heat won and the flames will go outwards

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.710 
heat won and the flames will go outwards
so<00:01:16.080> what<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.439> need<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:17.130> 50<00:01:18.090> milliliters<00:01:18.689> of

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
so what you need is 50 milliliters of

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.620 
so what you need is 50 milliliters of
water<00:01:19.400> which<00:01:20.400> I'm<00:01:20.610> going<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.790> pour<00:01:21.030> into<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.390> tin

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
water which I'm going to pour into a tin

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.300 
water which I'm going to pour into a tin
foil<00:01:21.930> pen<00:01:23.479> 50<00:01:24.479> milliliters<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.560> rubbing

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
foil pen 50 milliliters of rubbing

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.710 
foil pen 50 milliliters of rubbing
alcohol<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:28.130> a<00:01:29.130> pinch<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.670> salt<00:01:30.950> and<00:01:32.600> then<00:01:33.600> you

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
alcohol and a pinch of salt and then you

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.350 
alcohol and a pinch of salt and then you
take<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.200> dollar<00:01:34.439> bail<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:36.530> you<00:01:37.939> soak<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:38.970> in

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
take the dollar bail and you soak it in

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.359 
take the dollar bail and you soak it in
the<00:01:40.130> mixture<00:01:41.130> before<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:42.090> set<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.570> fire

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
the mixture before you set it on fire

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.520 
the mixture before you set it on fire
you<00:01:44.369> see<00:01:44.610> I'm<00:01:44.700> getting<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.060> really<00:01:45.450> wet<00:01:45.659> and

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.270 

then

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.210 

you<00:01:53.280> drip<00:01:53.900> you<00:01:54.900> drip<00:01:55.140> off<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.500> excess<00:01:55.890> water

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
you drip you drip off the excess water

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.190 
you drip you drip off the excess water
and<00:01:56.400> alcohol<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.950> you<00:01:58.950> move<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.460> alcohol

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
and alcohol and you move the alcohol

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.149 
and alcohol and you move the alcohol
mixture<00:02:01.200> far<00:02:01.680> away<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.860> it<00:02:04.860> doesn't

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
mixture far away so that you it doesn't

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.219 
mixture far away so that you it doesn't
cause<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.790> fire<00:02:06.119> because<00:02:06.690> that<00:02:06.840> can<00:02:07.020> cause<00:02:07.050> a

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
cause a fire because that can cause a

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.560 
cause a fire because that can cause a
fire<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.920> hold<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.759> with<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.060> tongs<00:02:09.300> and

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
fire and you hold it with the tongs and

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.240 
fire and you hold it with the tongs and
first<00:02:09.840> we're<00:02:10.020> gonna<00:02:10.110> do<00:02:10.350> the<00:02:10.530> experiment<00:02:11.130> with

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
first we're gonna do the experiment with

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.100 
first we're gonna do the experiment with
the<00:02:11.370> lights<00:02:11.610> off<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:12.060> show<00:02:12.240> what<00:02:12.480> happens<00:02:12.900> when

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
the lights off to show what happens when

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.110 
the lights off to show what happens when
it's<00:02:13.230> lit<00:02:13.470> on<00:02:13.590> fire<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:14.190> then<00:02:14.610> we'll<00:02:14.760> show<00:02:14.970> it

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
it's lit on fire and then we'll show it

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:30.030 
it's lit on fire and then we'll show it
with<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.360> lights<00:02:15.570> on<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.290> here<00:02:16.470> we<00:02:16.560> go

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.880 

if<00:02:30.489> you<00:02:30.730> notice<00:02:31.120> what<00:02:31.420> happened<00:02:31.840> is<00:02:32.019> the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
if you notice what happened is the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.679 
if you notice what happened is the
dollar<00:02:33.159> bill<00:02:33.430> didn't<00:02:33.790> burn<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.329> the<00:02:34.510> heat

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:34.689 
dollar bill didn't burn and the heat

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:38.220 
dollar bill didn't burn and the heat
transferred<00:02:35.319> out<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:36.760> so<00:02:37.720> it<00:02:37.840> caused<00:02:38.079> the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
transferred out and so it caused the

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.429 
transferred out and so it caused the
dollar<00:02:38.439> bill<00:02:38.650> not<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:39.189> burn<00:02:39.400> at<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:40.569> now

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:41.439 
dollar bill not to burn at the and now

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:42.660 
dollar bill not to burn at the and now
we're<00:02:41.590> gonna<00:02:41.680> try<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.040> with<00:02:42.129> the<00:02:42.220> lights<00:02:42.430> on

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
we're gonna try it with the lights on

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.039 
we're gonna try it with the lights on
just<00:02:42.909> in<00:02:43.060> case<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:43.360> couldn't<00:02:43.540> really<00:02:43.720> see<00:02:43.810> it

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
just in case you couldn't really see it

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.420 
just in case you couldn't really see it
with<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.230> lights<00:02:44.439> off<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:44.920> we're<00:02:45.069> gonna<00:02:45.159> dip

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
with the lights off and we're gonna dip

00:02:45.430 --> 00:03:03.640 
with the lights off and we're gonna dip
it<00:02:45.549> again<00:02:45.670> in<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.120> solution<00:02:51.090> drip<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:52.269> off

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.080 

okay<00:03:04.650> so<00:03:04.709> now<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.069> can<00:03:05.310> see<00:03:05.549> that<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.879> dollar

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
okay so now you can see that the dollar

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.809 
okay so now you can see that the dollar
bill<00:03:06.390> is<00:03:06.510> still<00:03:06.780> intact<00:03:07.139> because<00:03:07.889> the<00:03:08.249> energy

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
bill is still intact because the energy

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.610 
bill is still intact because the energy
created<00:03:09.120> from<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.659> heat<00:03:09.870> went<00:03:10.079> out<00:03:10.170> words

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
created from the heat went out words

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.530 
created from the heat went out words
instead<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.159> in<00:03:11.430> words<00:03:11.760> because<00:03:12.120> if<00:03:12.239> it<00:03:12.359> went

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
instead of in words because if it went

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.879 
instead of in words because if it went
in<00:03:12.659> words<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.079> dollar<00:03:13.290> bill<00:03:13.590> would<00:03:13.799> have

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
in words the dollar bill would have

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.399 
in words the dollar bill would have
burned<00:03:14.249> and<00:03:14.609> because<00:03:15.420> it<00:03:15.540> went<00:03:15.689> out<00:03:15.870> words<00:03:16.139> the

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
burned and because it went out words the

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.860 
burned and because it went out words the
dollar<00:03:16.590> bill<00:03:16.859> stayed<00:03:17.129> intact<00:03:17.599> okay<00:03:18.599> I<00:03:18.629> hope

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
dollar bill stayed intact okay I hope

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.170 
dollar bill stayed intact okay I hope
everybody<00:03:19.500> enjoyed<00:03:19.829> the<00:03:20.069> experiment<00:03:20.730> thank

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
everybody enjoyed the experiment thank

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.500 
everybody enjoyed the experiment thank
you<00:03:21.359> for<00:03:21.599> your<00:03:21.689> time<00:03:21.900> bye
