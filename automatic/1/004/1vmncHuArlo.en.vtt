can change what text with the prestress
is<00:01:35.119> this<00:01:36.119> example<00:01:36.450> here<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.840> bigger<00:01:37.140> card<00:01:37.380> is

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
is this example here the bigger card is

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.210 
is this example here the bigger card is
shown<00:01:37.890> with<00:01:38.250> numbers<00:01:38.579> initially<00:01:39.060> in

sequential order

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.219 
sequential order
but<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.270> real<00:01:42.390> bin<00:01:42.540> cards<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:42.990> numbers

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
but in the real bin cards the numbers

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.139 
but in the real bin cards the numbers
log<00:01:43.409> be<00:01:43.619> shuffled<00:01:43.979> about<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.460> random<00:01:44.790> expect

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
log be shuffled about and random expect

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.090 
log be shuffled about and random expect
that<00:01:45.299> every<00:01:45.570> bingo<00:01:45.840> card<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.170> different<00:01:47.060> but<00:01:48.060> I

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
that every bingo card is different but I

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.080 
that every bingo card is different but I
will<00:01:50.100> now<00:01:50.250> show<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:50.939> also

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
will now show you that you can also

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.730 
will now show you that you can also

collateral squared I can say let's use a

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.200 
collateral squared I can say let's use a
checkerboard<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.259> use<00:02:01.380> two<00:02:01.590> colors<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.340> can

and I can take the heavy economic that
may<00:02:09.420> be<00:02:09.479> like<00:02:09.780> blue<00:02:10.170> just<00:02:10.560> for<00:02:10.740> an<00:02:10.800> example

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
may be like blue just for an example

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.340 
may be like blue just for an example
you'll<00:02:11.490> see<00:02:11.660> that's<00:02:12.660> what<00:02:12.870> this<00:02:12.990> example

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
you'll see that's what this example

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.780 
you'll see that's what this example
would<00:02:13.590> now<00:02:13.740> look<00:02:13.890> like<00:02:13.950> with<00:02:14.280> these<00:02:14.430> colors

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
would now look like with these colors
