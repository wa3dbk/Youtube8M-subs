everybody about it about ball security
in<00:01:43.290> general<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.829> we're<00:01:44.549> going<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.729> fix<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:44.939> and

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.969 
in general and we're going to fix it and
i<00:01:45.390> think<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:46.049> was<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.380> was<00:01:46.470> right<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.740> have

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
i think it was it was right to have

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.170 
i think it was it was right to have
those<00:01:47.130> mistakes<00:01:47.520> early<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:47.970> season

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
those mistakes early in the season

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.700 
those mistakes early in the season
because<00:01:48.930> i<00:01:49.170> think<00:01:49.229> we're<00:01:49.439> just<00:01:49.530> going<00:01:49.649> to

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
because i think we're just going to

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.740 
because i think we're just going to
learn<00:01:49.829> from<00:01:50.040> them<00:01:50.250> and

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
learn from them and

was it was a guy who was fast got

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.979 
was it was a guy who was fast got
capable<00:02:58.370> making<00:02:58.640> plays<00:02:58.850> and<00:02:59.120> doing<00:02:59.750> some<00:02:59.870> good

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
capable making plays and doing some good

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.070 
capable making plays and doing some good
things<00:03:00.049> for<00:03:00.500> us<00:03:00.620> but<00:03:01.870> unfortunately<00:03:02.870> he'll<00:03:02.989> be

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
things for us but unfortunately he'll be

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.420 
things for us but unfortunately he'll be
out<00:03:03.200> we<00:03:03.410> don't<00:03:03.500> know<00:03:03.650> for<00:03:03.769> how<00:03:03.830> long<00:03:03.950> but<00:03:04.130> he
