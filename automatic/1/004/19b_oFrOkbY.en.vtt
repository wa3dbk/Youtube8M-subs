the slick of the wrist and it just pops
out<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.600> really<00:02:04.170> like<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.560> one-handed<00:02:05.040> design

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
out I really like that one-handed design

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.169 
out I really like that one-handed design
then<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.390> can<00:02:06.570> actually<00:02:06.750> close<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.940> with<00:02:08.940> one

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
then you can actually close it with one

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.370 
then you can actually close it with one
hand<00:02:09.209> as<00:02:09.569> well<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:11.039> little<00:02:11.610> notch<00:02:12.540> is<00:02:12.840> hard

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
hand as well the little notch is hard

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.990 
hand as well the little notch is hard
is<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.470> little<00:02:13.710> bit<00:02:13.830> more<00:02:14.130> difficult<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.760> get<00:02:14.970> a

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
is a little bit more difficult to get a

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.600 
is a little bit more difficult to get a
hold<00:02:15.270> of<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:16.080> can<00:02:16.350> grab<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.710> if<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.130> if<00:02:17.310> you

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
hold of you can grab it if you if you

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.400 
hold of you can grab it if you if you
really<00:02:17.940> get<00:02:18.060> your<00:02:18.210> finger<00:02:18.270> up<00:02:18.690> under<00:02:19.020> it<00:02:19.110> the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
really get your finger up under it the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.320 
really get your finger up under it the
flippers<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.040> way<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.190> really<00:02:20.700> like<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:21.030> open

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
flippers the way I really like to open

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.640

this<00:02:21.450> knife<00:02:21.660> in<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.960> first<00:02:22.140> place

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
this knife in the first place

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.800 
this knife in the first place
the<00:02:23.370> reason<00:02:23.700> why<00:02:23.820> it's<00:02:24.000> so<00:02:24.180> light<00:02:24.450> especially

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
the reason why it's so light especially

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.190 
the reason why it's so light especially
with<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.320> size<00:02:25.530> blade<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:25.920> has<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.040> nice<00:02:26.580> large

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
with this size blade it has a nice large

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.870 
with this size blade it has a nice large
spear<00:02:28.200> point<00:02:28.440> blade<00:02:29.060> it's<00:02:30.060> 3<00:02:30.600> and<00:02:30.780> 1/8<00:02:31.080> inch

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
spear point blade it's 3 and 1/8 inch

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.940 
spear point blade it's 3 and 1/8 inch
but<00:02:32.880> there's<00:02:33.030> no<00:02:33.180> liner<00:02:33.650> there<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.830> liner

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
but there's no liner there is a liner

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.910 
but there's no liner there is a liner
lock<00:02:35.520> here<00:02:36.030> but<00:02:36.900> then<00:02:37.080> it's<00:02:37.230> just<00:02:37.350> the<00:02:37.530> g10

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
lock here but then it's just the g10

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.160 
lock here but then it's just the g10
scale<00:02:38.250> so<00:02:38.520> it<00:02:38.670> really<00:02:39.090> makes<00:02:39.450> this<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.870> very

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
scale so it really makes this a very

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.920 
scale so it really makes this a very
lightweight<00:02:40.530> knife<00:02:41.040> but<00:02:41.910> once<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.390> hold<00:02:42.660> it

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
lightweight knife but once you hold it

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.680 
lightweight knife but once you hold it
it<00:02:43.110> just<00:02:43.680> feels<00:02:44.190> like<00:02:44.580> quality<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.270> mean<00:02:45.480> it

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
it just feels like quality I mean it

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.540 
it just feels like quality I mean it
doesn't<00:02:46.110> feel<00:02:46.260> cheap<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.860> it's<00:02:47.670> really<00:02:48.570> tight

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
doesn't feel cheap and it's really tight

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.100 
doesn't feel cheap and it's really tight
even<00:02:50.550> with<00:02:50.790> this<00:02:50.940> kind<00:02:51.240> of<00:02:51.330> system<00:02:51.750> if<00:02:51.930> you

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
even with this kind of system if you

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.610 
even with this kind of system if you
look<00:02:52.380> at<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.920> blade<00:02:53.190> there<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.060> no<00:02:54.660> play<00:02:55.260> in

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
look at the blade there is no play in

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.760 
look at the blade there is no play in

that blade whatsoever even forward and
backwards<00:02:59.250> of<00:03:00.060> course<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.450> scales<00:03:00.780> are<00:03:01.110> very

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
backwards of course the scales are very

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.710 
backwards of course the scales are very
nice<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:03.000> don't<00:03:03.060> know<00:03:03.240> if<00:03:03.300> you<00:03:03.390> can<00:03:03.510> really

really<00:04:12.000> like<00:04:12.090> to<00:04:12.270> have<00:04:12.510> a<00:04:12.540> black<00:04:12.959> clip<00:04:13.350> here

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
really like to have a black clip here

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:19.190 
really like to have a black clip here
but<00:04:14.550> I<00:04:14.580> really<00:04:14.940> like<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:16.580> stone<00:04:18.200> the

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
but I really like the stone the

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.920 
but I really like the stone the
stonewashed<00:04:19.709> finish<00:04:19.920> of<00:04:20.549> this<00:04:21.270> knife<00:04:21.570> and

stonewashed finish of this knife and

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.380 
stonewashed finish of this knife and
really<00:04:22.590> this<00:04:22.740> clip<00:04:23.070> blends<00:04:23.760> in<00:04:24.000> very<00:04:24.030> well

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
really this clip blends in very well

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.950 
really this clip blends in very well
with<00:04:25.200> the<00:04:25.350> blade<00:04:25.620> it<00:04:25.860> matches<00:04:26.310> very

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
with the blade it matches very

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.190 
with the blade it matches very
just<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:28.080> very<00:04:28.350> nice<00:04:28.560> contrast<00:04:28.980> and<00:04:29.750> as<00:04:30.750> you<00:04:31.050> can

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
just a very nice contrast and as you can

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.930 
just a very nice contrast and as you can
see<00:04:31.260> that<00:04:31.680> blade<00:04:32.010> it's<00:04:32.370> a<00:04:32.490> nice<00:04:33.200> broad<00:04:34.200> blade

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940
