00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.439 
I compare them to you know the major
brands<00:00:52.559> such<00:00:52.710> as<00:00:52.800> always<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:53.969> decided<00:00:54.270> to

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
brands such as always so I decided to

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.029 
brands such as always so I decided to
buy<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.500> just<00:00:55.530> what<00:00:55.770> they<00:00:55.890> look

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
buy this and this is just what they look

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.970 
buy this and this is just what they look
like<00:00:57.050> it's<00:00:58.050> really<00:00:58.199> cool<00:00:58.469> packaging<00:00:58.620> these

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
like it's really cool packaging these

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.770 
like it's really cool packaging these
were<00:00:59.390> 99p<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.420> think<00:01:04.760> so<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.299> what<00:01:06.600> they

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
were 99p I think so this is what they

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.840 
were 99p I think so this is what they
look<00:01:06.990> like<00:01:07.020> inside<00:01:09.500> and<00:01:10.500> then<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.729> what

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
look like inside and then this is what

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.520 
look like inside and then this is what
one<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.150> pads<00:01:12.360> looks<00:01:12.570> like<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.110> a

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
one of the pads looks like it is in a

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.120 
one of the pads looks like it is in a
town<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.130> yellow<00:01:14.700> packaging<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.830> doesn't

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
town of yellow packaging and it doesn't

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.770 
town of yellow packaging and it doesn't
have<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.490> tab<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.880> here<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.299> on<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> old

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780

body<00:01:19.020> foam<00:01:19.290> products<00:01:19.650> where<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:19.950> can<00:01:20.130> peel<00:01:20.280> it

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
body foam products where you can peel it

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.330 
body foam products where you can peel it
off<00:01:20.460> afterwards<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:25.560> opening<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.220> was

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
off afterwards the opening on that was

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.690 
off afterwards the opening on that was
really<00:01:26.640> quiet<00:01:27.110> which<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.140> good<00:01:28.520> and<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.640> is

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
really quiet which is good and this is

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.950 
really quiet which is good and this is
what<00:01:30.000> they<00:01:30.090> like<00:01:30.299> they're<00:01:30.479> not<00:01:30.570> very<00:01:30.750> long

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
what they like they're not very long

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.969 
what they like they're not very long
with<00:01:31.110> their<00:01:31.229> colleges<00:01:31.560> like<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.740> know<00:01:31.860> your

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
with their colleges like you know your

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.560 
with their colleges like you know your
ordinary<00:01:32.220> size<00:01:32.460> which<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:32.850> good<00:01:33.000> but<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.509> like

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
ordinary size which is good but I like

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.020 
ordinary size which is good but I like
the<00:01:33.930> back<00:01:34.110> on<00:01:34.710> these<00:01:34.829> because<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.400> if<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.850> can

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
the back on these because it if you can

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.179 
the back on these because it if you can
see<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.270> kind<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.450> falls<00:01:36.869> out<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.500> obviously

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
see it kind of falls out and obviously

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.469 
see it kind of falls out and obviously
you're<00:01:38.520> more<00:01:38.640> likely<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.970> look<00:01:39.119> at<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.329> back

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
you're more likely to look at the back

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.060 
you're more likely to look at the back
so<00:01:39.659> you've<00:01:39.780> got<00:01:39.900> more<00:01:39.990> protection<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.920> does

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
so you've got more protection it does

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.530 
so you've got more protection it does
have<00:01:41.250> wings<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.030> what<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.360> looks

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540

softness<00:03:49.830> you<00:03:50.250> think<00:03:50.430> I'm<00:03:50.489> notice<00:03:50.790> they're

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
softness you think I'm notice they're

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.490 
softness you think I'm notice they're
not<00:03:51.000> very<00:03:51.269> thick<00:03:51.570> which<00:03:51.900> could<00:03:52.170> be<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:52.320> good

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
not very thick which could be a good

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.440 
not very thick which could be a good
thing<00:03:52.560> because<00:03:52.920> I<00:03:53.100> find<00:03:53.400> always<00:03:53.640> night<00:03:54.239> has

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
thing because I find always night has

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.740 
thing because I find always night has
quite<00:03:54.720> thick<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.549> so<00:03:56.549> maybe<00:03:56.700> this<00:03:57.120> will<00:03:57.570> be<00:03:57.720> a

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
quite thick and so maybe this will be a

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.020 
quite thick and so maybe this will be a
lot<00:03:58.049> thinner<00:03:58.230> but<00:03:58.440> still<00:03:58.680> just<00:03:58.830> as<00:03:59.280> absorbent

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
lot thinner but still just as absorbent

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.150 
lot thinner but still just as absorbent
so<00:04:00.239> they<00:04:00.330> might<00:04:00.480> be<00:04:00.600> even<00:04:00.750> better<00:04:00.989> so<00:04:01.980> yeah

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
so they might be even better so yeah

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.190 
so they might be even better so yeah
this<00:04:02.370> is<00:04:02.430> just<00:04:02.670> what<00:04:02.760> they<00:04:02.880> look<00:04:03.030> like<00:04:03.200> from

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
this is just what they look like from

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.930 
this is just what they look like from

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
these are super long and so it's like

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.650 
these are super long and so it's like
the<00:04:34.950> back<00:04:35.130> on<00:04:35.340> this<00:04:35.430> one<00:04:35.610> is<00:04:35.760> big<00:04:35.970> because<00:04:36.510> you

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
the back on this one is big because you

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.180 
the back on this one is big because you
can<00:04:36.780> see<00:04:36.960> to<00:04:37.110> prevent<00:04:37.410> against<00:04:37.650> leaks<00:04:37.890> Kasasa

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
can see to prevent against leaks Kasasa

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.750 
can see to prevent against leaks Kasasa
you<00:04:38.460> like<00:04:38.670> down<00:04:39.270> mejor<00:04:39.750> nd<00:04:40.200> in<00:04:40.440> bed<00:04:40.680> so<00:04:41.610> you're

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
you like down mejor nd in bed so you're

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.040 
you like down mejor nd in bed so you're
more<00:04:41.880> likely<00:04:41.940> to<00:04:42.210> leak<00:04:42.450> out<00:04:42.600> of<00:04:42.780> the<00:04:42.870> back

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
more likely to leak out of the back

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.770 
more likely to leak out of the back
