crazy<00:03:24.650> because<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:25.880> interiors<00:03:26.420> of<00:03:26.450> these<00:03:26.750> are

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
crazy because the interiors of these are

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.500 
crazy because the interiors of these are

your purse about your code is the top
versus<00:05:40.380> so<00:05:42.840> this<00:05:43.840> we<00:05:44.020> can<00:05:44.140> turn<00:05:44.289> the<00:05:44.380> top

sources<00:05:44.890> I<00:05:45.010> don't<00:05:45.160> know<00:05:45.250> ah<00:05:46.440> got<00:05:47.440> some<00:05:47.620> extra

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
sources I don't know ah got some extra

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.130 
sources I don't know ah got some extra
thrust<00:05:48.669> that<00:05:48.940> we<00:05:49.000> can<00:05:49.180> turn<00:05:49.360> on/off<00:05:49.570> if<00:05:49.960> we

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
thrust that we can turn on/off if we

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.860 
thrust that we can turn on/off if we
need<00:05:50.350> them<00:05:50.560> that's<00:05:50.919> pretty<00:05:51.130> cool<00:05:51.600> this<00:05:52.600> thing

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
need them that's pretty cool this thing

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.409 
need them that's pretty cool this thing
as<00:05:53.169> I<00:05:53.320> said<00:05:53.530> it's<00:05:54.130> pretty<00:05:54.310> dumb<00:05:54.669> I<00:05:54.940> think<00:05:55.330> it's

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
as I said it's pretty dumb I think it's

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.150 
as I said it's pretty dumb I think it's
like<00:05:55.510> six<00:05:55.780> seconds<00:05:56.169> to<00:05:56.229> at<00:05:56.410> sixty<00:05:56.770> sorry

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
like six seconds to at sixty sorry

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.159 
like six seconds to at sixty sorry
on<00:05:57.700> three<00:05:58.090> but<00:05:58.419> it<00:05:58.510> slows<00:05:58.690> down<00:05:58.720> pretty

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
on three but it slows down pretty

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:01.529 
on three but it slows down pretty
rapidly<00:06:00.039> as<00:06:00.490> well<00:06:00.669> I<00:06:00.910> mean<00:06:01.060> it's<00:06:01.180> just<00:06:01.240> got<00:06:01.510> a

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:01.539 
rapidly as well I mean it's just got a

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:03.330 
rapidly as well I mean it's just got a
general<00:06:01.930> overall<00:06:02.500> good<00:06:02.650> control<00:06:03.039> on<00:06:03.070> it<00:06:03.220> I

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
general overall good control on it I

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.279 
general overall good control on it I
mean<00:06:03.520> those<00:06:04.330> winglets<00:06:04.750> I'm<00:06:04.900> guessing

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.289 
mean those winglets I'm guessing

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:08.610 
mean those winglets I'm guessing
probably<00:06:05.380> contain<00:06:05.830> a<00:06:05.860> lot<00:06:06.130> of<00:06:06.160> the--<00:06:07.620> parts

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
probably contain a lot of the-- parts

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.740 
probably contain a lot of the-- parts
you<00:06:09.039> know<00:06:09.190> to<00:06:09.250> like<00:06:09.640> to<00:06:09.850> control<00:06:10.210> it<00:06:10.419> and<00:06:10.510> stuff

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
you know to like to control it and stuff

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.420 
you know to like to control it and stuff
if<00:06:10.990> we<00:06:11.020> go<00:06:11.229> for<00:06:11.530> what's<00:06:11.770> this<00:06:11.919> for

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
if we go for what's this for

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.640 
if we go for what's this for
it's<00:06:12.789> the<00:06:13.360> landing<00:06:13.780> count<00:06:14.050> in<00:06:14.200> our<00:06:14.260> case<00:06:14.530> we

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
it's the landing count in our case we

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.950 
it's the landing count in our case we
got<00:06:14.770> a<00:06:14.800> camera<00:06:15.160> so<00:06:15.850> let's<00:06:16.060> just<00:06:16.270> look<00:06:16.419> allows

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
got a camera so let's just look allows

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.230 
got a camera so let's just look allows
us<00:06:17.140> to<00:06:17.289> land<00:06:17.530> it<00:06:17.770> properly<00:06:18.130> and<00:06:18.340> whatnot<00:06:18.760> it's

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
us to land it properly and whatnot it's

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.920 
us to land it properly and whatnot it's
pretty<00:06:19.479> cool

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
pretty cool

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.930 
pretty cool
and<00:06:20.110> of<00:06:20.860> course<00:06:21.070> the<00:06:21.250> turrets<00:06:21.610> we<00:06:21.700> could<00:06:21.850> turn

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
and of course the turrets we could turn

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.640 
and of course the turrets we could turn
on<00:06:22.210> and<00:06:22.450> off

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
on and off

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.650 
on and off
I<00:06:23.680> believe<00:06:24.370> there<00:06:24.550> are<00:06:24.669> controlled<00:06:25.300> they

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
I believe there are controlled they

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.320 
I believe there are controlled they
should<00:06:26.620> stop<00:06:26.860> spinning<00:06:27.190> on<00:06:27.340> their<00:06:27.460> own<00:06:27.580> maybe

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
should stop spinning on their own maybe

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.300 
should stop spinning on their own maybe
maybe<00:06:28.960> maybe<00:06:30.479> probably<00:06:31.479> not<00:06:31.690> I<00:06:32.020> don't<00:06:32.169> know<00:06:32.350> so

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
maybe maybe probably not I don't know so

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.340 
maybe maybe probably not I don't know so
I<00:06:33.610> said<00:06:33.910> I<00:06:34.150> was<00:06:34.300> back<00:06:34.449> off<00:06:34.720> and<00:06:35.020> then<00:06:35.139> we<00:06:35.229> got

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.350 
I said I was back off and then we got

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.409 
I said I was back off and then we got
the<00:06:35.440> sensors<00:06:35.949> for<00:06:36.340> these<00:06:36.550> sentences<00:06:37.000> for<00:06:37.180> so

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:37.419 
the sensors for these sentences for so

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:38.969 
the sensors for these sentences for so
weak<00:06:37.509> it<00:06:37.630> allows<00:06:37.840> for<00:06:38.199> the<00:06:38.289> doors<00:06:38.530> that<00:06:38.770> we<00:06:38.860> can

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:38.979 
weak it allows for the doors that we can

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:43.260 
weak it allows for the doors that we can
turn<00:06:39.160> a<00:06:39.190> month<00:06:39.460> I'm<00:06:40.419> hoping<00:06:40.750> so<00:06:41.729> just<00:06:42.729> a<00:06:42.820> sensor

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
turn a month I'm hoping so just a sensor

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.909 
turn a month I'm hoping so just a sensor
so<00:06:43.509> I<00:06:43.539> guess<00:06:43.810> inch<00:06:44.050> by<00:06:44.199> all<00:06:44.380> the<00:06:44.500> sensors<00:06:44.889> you

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:44.919 
so I guess inch by all the sensors you

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:46.439 
so I guess inch by all the sensors you
can<00:06:45.009> just<00:06:45.250> turn<00:06:45.370> them<00:06:45.550> off<00:06:45.669> just<00:06:45.910> in<00:06:46.060> case<00:06:46.240> it's

00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:46.449 
can just turn them off just in case it's

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:47.870 
can just turn them off just in case it's
getting<00:06:46.660> a<00:06:46.720> little<00:06:46.870> bit<00:06:47.169> out<00:06:47.350> of<00:06:47.380> hand

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 
getting a little bit out of hand

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.260 
getting a little bit out of hand
nigga<00:06:48.880> seven<00:06:49.410> which<00:06:50.410> turns<00:06:51.250> the<00:06:51.580> beacon<00:06:52.060> on

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270 
nigga seven which turns the beacon on

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:57.779 
nigga seven which turns the beacon on
and<00:06:52.449> off<00:06:53.220> which<00:06:54.220> is<00:06:55.919> seven<00:06:56.919> yep<00:06:57.370> there<00:06:57.610> you<00:06:57.639> go

and off which is seven yep there you go

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:00.420 
and off which is seven yep there you go
so<00:06:58.000> that's<00:06:58.060> a<00:06:58.300> little<00:06:58.570> beacon<00:06:59.130> now<00:07:00.130> this<00:07:00.280> is

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:00.430 
so that's a little beacon now this is

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.360 
so that's a little beacon now this is
the<00:07:00.550> little<00:07:00.729> beacon<00:07:00.940> and<00:07:01.389> then<00:07:01.690> we've<00:07:01.840> got<00:07:02.020> the

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.370 
the little beacon and then we've got the

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.040 
the little beacon and then we've got the
B<00:07:03.370> Class<00:07:03.430> which<00:07:03.880> is<00:07:04.030> more<00:07:04.360> like<00:07:04.510> a<00:07:04.630> distress

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.050 
B Class which is more like a distress

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 
noticed I did turn off those sensors and

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:19.740 
noticed I did turn off those sensors and
they've<00:07:18.729> all<00:07:18.849> gone<00:07:18.970> off<00:07:19.120> now<00:07:19.300> which<00:07:19.449> is<00:07:19.599> good
