00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.229 
notice is like I definitely a lot more
comfortable<00:00:58.289> with<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.489> opposing<00:00:59.940> it's

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
comfortable with the opposing it's

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.430 
comfortable with the opposing it's
something<00:01:00.449> I've<00:01:00.660> really<00:01:00.809> been<00:01:00.960> practicing

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
this entire time so I got a lot more

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.179 
this entire time so I got a lot more
poise<00:01:06.200> in<00:01:07.200> each<00:01:07.409> pose<00:01:09.890> also<00:01:10.890> had<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> lot<00:01:11.159> of

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
poise in each pose also had a lot of

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.300 
poise in each pose also had a lot of
practice<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.909> figuring<00:01:12.659> out<00:01:12.659> which<00:01:13.310> things

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
practice and figuring out which things

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.100 
practice and figuring out which things
look<00:01:14.700> better<00:01:14.909> than<00:01:15.119> dude<00:01:15.450> little<00:01:15.750> things<00:01:15.960> here

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
shot but kind of get the gist of it just

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.700 
shot but kind of get the gist of it just
for<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.070> most<00:01:39.310> part<00:01:40.320> there's<00:01:41.320> hands<00:01:41.530> on<00:01:41.620> the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
for the most part there's hands on the

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.440 
for the most part there's hands on the
