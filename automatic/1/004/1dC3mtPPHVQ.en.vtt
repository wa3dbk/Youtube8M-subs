00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
the skin down there is really really

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.620 
the skin down there is really really
sensitive<00:03:27.250> so<00:03:28.239> what<00:03:28.750> I<00:03:28.780> use<00:03:29.320> is<00:03:29.680> this

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
and it's just a pH balance with which is

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.699 
and it's just a pH balance with which is
really<00:03:45.790> good<00:03:45.970> it's<00:03:46.299> a<00:03:46.420> cleansing<00:03:46.720> wash<00:03:47.350> and

really good it's a cleansing wash and

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.280 
really good it's a cleansing wash and
it's<00:03:48.130> good<00:03:48.459> for<00:03:48.489> when<00:03:49.090> you've<00:03:49.239> just<00:03:49.269> shaped<00:03:49.989> or

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
it's good for when you've just shaped or

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.280 
it's good for when you've just shaped or
I<00:03:50.500> use<00:03:50.829> this<00:03:51.010> to<00:03:51.790> shape<00:03:52.090> as<00:03:52.329> well<00:03:52.510> and<00:03:52.930> it

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
I use this to shape as well and it

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.289 
I use this to shape as well and it
cleans<00:03:53.650> out<00:03:53.890> and<00:03:54.220> it's<00:03:54.370> good<00:03:54.640> but<00:03:54.790> it's<00:03:54.970> for

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
cleans out and it's good but it's for

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.100 
cleans out and it's good but it's for
sensitive<00:03:55.750> skin<00:03:56.079> so<00:03:56.680> your<00:03:57.310> skin<00:03:57.900> doesn't<00:03:58.900> get

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
sensitive skin so your skin doesn't get

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.900 
sensitive skin so your skin doesn't get
irritated<00:03:59.680> and<00:03:59.980> that's<00:04:00.250> what<00:04:00.459> creates<00:04:00.790> the

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
irritated and that's what creates the

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.520 
irritated and that's what creates the
pumps<00:04:01.360> normally<00:04:01.780> is<00:04:01.900> when<00:04:02.049> you<00:04:02.140> use<00:04:02.320> like<00:04:02.500> a

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
pumps normally is when you use like a

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.490 
pumps normally is when you use like a
really<00:04:02.829> rough<00:04:03.040> soap<00:04:03.280> or<00:04:03.609> some<00:04:04.359> use<00:04:04.630> like<00:04:04.870> acne

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
really rough soap or some use like acne

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.650 
really rough soap or some use like acne
wash<00:04:05.709> to<00:04:06.100> like<00:04:06.280> because<00:04:06.730> of<00:04:06.760> the<00:04:07.090> bumps<00:04:07.480> but

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
wash to like because of the bumps but

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.810 
wash to like because of the bumps but
that's<00:04:07.870> just<00:04:08.049> irritating<00:04:08.739> it<00:04:08.859> even<00:04:09.640> more

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
that's just irritating it even more

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.810 
that's just irritating it even more
because<00:04:10.030> it's<00:04:10.900> such<00:04:11.560> a<00:04:11.590> delicate<00:04:11.950> area<00:04:12.430> that

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.730 
moisturizes it and even though it's a
face<00:06:06.540> mask<00:06:06.780> in<00:06:07.110> the<00:06:07.230> beginning<00:06:07.530> I<00:06:07.590> was<00:06:07.710> like

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
face mask in the beginning I was like

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.580 
face mask in the beginning I was like
can<00:06:07.980> I<00:06:08.040> use<00:06:08.190> a<00:06:08.220> mask<00:06:08.640> for<00:06:09.060> that<00:06:09.210> but<00:06:10.020> apparently

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
can I use a mask for that but apparently

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.560 
can I use a mask for that but apparently
you<00:06:11.040> can<00:06:11.220> because<00:06:11.520> this<00:06:11.730> works<00:06:12.060> and<00:06:12.360> this<00:06:12.510> is

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
you can because this works and this is

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.290 
you can because this works and this is
good<00:06:12.960> and<00:06:13.170> it<00:06:13.830> has<00:06:13.950> made<00:06:14.340> everything<00:06:14.850> every

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
good and it has made everything every

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.210 
good and it has made everything every
redness<00:06:15.660> every<00:06:15.840> bumps<00:06:16.170> everything<00:06:16.620> go<00:06:16.980> away

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 
redness every bumps everything go away

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.950 
redness every bumps everything go away
so<00:06:17.640> this<00:06:17.940> is<00:06:18.000> a<00:06:18.150> really<00:06:18.600> really<00:06:18.720> good

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
so this is a really really good

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.010 
so this is a really really good
candidate<00:06:19.410> for<00:06:19.440> that<00:06:20.090> you<00:06:21.090> can<00:06:21.240> use<00:06:21.480> like

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
candidate for that you can use like

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.130 
candidate for that you can use like
regularly<00:06:22.590> moisturizing<00:06:23.280> cream<00:06:23.550> as<00:06:23.730> well
