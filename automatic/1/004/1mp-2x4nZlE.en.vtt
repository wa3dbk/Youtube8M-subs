I<00:03:08.440> think<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:08.830> musical<00:03:09.220> box<00:03:09.430> that<00:03:09.670> you<00:03:09.760> get<00:03:09.940> in

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
I think the musical box that you get in

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.340 
I think the musical box that you get in
a<00:03:10.240> random<00:03:10.810> weapons<00:03:11.140> and<00:03:12.480> after<00:03:13.480> each<00:03:13.720> little

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
a random weapons and after each little

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.610 
a random weapons and after each little
song<00:03:15.160> thing<00:03:15.459> you<00:03:16.150> get<00:03:16.330> a<00:03:16.360> Morse<00:03:16.720> code<00:03:17.110> which<00:03:17.410> I

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
song thing you get a Morse code which I

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.900 
song thing you get a Morse code which I
still<00:03:17.860> have<00:03:17.980> yet<00:03:18.130> to<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.370> code<00:03:18.550> it's<00:03:18.700> pretty

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
still have yet to the code it's pretty

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.449 
still have yet to the code it's pretty
tough<00:03:19.090> I<00:03:19.420> don't<00:03:19.720> know<00:03:19.810> why<00:03:19.959> I<00:03:19.990> just<00:03:20.140> can't

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
tough I don't know why I just can't

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.710 
tough I don't know why I just can't
listen<00:03:21.459> in<00:03:21.640> to<00:03:21.790> it<00:03:22.000> I<00:03:22.090> don't<00:03:22.240> know<00:03:22.330> I<00:03:22.360> just<00:03:22.420> need

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
to get someone fluent with Morse code

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.380 
to get someone fluent with Morse code
and<00:03:25.410> that's<00:03:26.410> pretty<00:03:26.590> much<00:03:26.709> it<00:03:27.150> that's<00:03:28.150> all<00:03:28.330> I

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
and that's pretty much it that's all I

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.270 
and that's pretty much it that's all I
