00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
okay so this is a quick demo of my new

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.059 
okay so this is a quick demo of my new
focuser<00:00:06.620> eventually<00:00:07.620> I'm<00:00:07.710> going<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.890> buy<00:00:08.040> a

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
focuser eventually I'm going to buy a

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.430 
focuser eventually I'm going to buy a
better<00:00:08.280> telescope<00:00:08.880> when<00:00:09.809> I<00:00:09.840> have<00:00:10.050> money<00:00:10.259> to

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
better telescope when I have money to

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.970 
better telescope when I have money to
invest<00:00:10.559> on<00:00:10.920> it<00:00:11.070> but<00:00:11.820> this<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.360> what<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:12.990> they

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
invest on it but this is what it is they

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.440 
invest on it but this is what it is they
are<00:00:14.250> two<00:00:14.730> servo<00:00:15.179> motors<00:00:16.430> one<00:00:17.430> here<00:00:18.090> as<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.420> can

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
are two servo motors one here as you can

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.110 
are two servo motors one here as you can
see<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.650> has<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.860> little<00:00:20.100> gears<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.730> got<00:00:20.910> them

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:21.120 
see it it has a little gears I got them

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.360 
see it it has a little gears I got them
from<00:00:21.450> a<00:00:21.720> broken<00:00:22.590> laser<00:00:23.520> printer<00:00:24.030> cartridge

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:25.370 
from a broken laser printer cartridge

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.720 
from a broken laser printer cartridge
and<00:00:26.370> here<00:00:27.120> it's<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.630> little<00:00:27.780> enclosure<00:00:28.770> project

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
and here it's a little enclosure project

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.140 
and here it's a little enclosure project
enclosure<00:00:30.120> box<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.870> got<00:00:31.410> from<00:00:31.770> RadioShack<00:00:32.640> and

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.150 
enclosure box I got from RadioShack and

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.560 
enclosure box I got from RadioShack and
inside<00:00:33.870> there's<00:00:34.410> another<00:00:34.770> servo<00:00:35.250> both<00:00:36.240> of

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
inside there's another servo both of

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.910 
inside there's another servo both of
them<00:00:36.840> do<00:00:37.170> not<00:00:37.320> have<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.920> electronics<00:00:38.820> inside

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
them do not have the electronics inside

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.050 
them do not have the electronics inside
it's<00:00:40.920> just<00:00:41.190> direct<00:00:41.820> wired<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:43.070> I<00:00:44.070> came<00:00:44.880> up<00:00:45.030> with

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.060 
it's just direct wired I I came up with

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.740 
it's just direct wired I I came up with
this<00:00:45.420> by<00:00:45.930> accident<00:00:46.530> actually<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:47.420> ruined<00:00:48.420> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
this by accident actually I ruined the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.510 
this by accident actually I ruined the
server<00:00:49.020> wall<00:00:49.380> was<00:00:49.530> trying<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.890> do<00:00:50.070> it

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
server wall was trying to do it

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.090 
server wall was trying to do it
I<00:00:50.550> have<00:00:51.300> no<00:00:51.540> electronic<00:00:52.470> skills<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:55.100> what

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
I have no electronic skills and what

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.360 
I have no electronic skills and what
happened<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.960> I<00:00:57.960> was<00:00:58.440> playing<00:00:58.800> with<00:00:58.950> the<00:00:59.070> servo

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
happened is I was playing with the servo

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.430 
happened is I was playing with the servo
the<00:00:59.730> wires<00:00:59.970> was<00:01:00.329> just<00:01:00.570> hanging<00:01:00.899> around<00:01:00.960> and

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
the wires was just hanging around and

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.030 
the wires was just hanging around and
they<00:01:01.560> were<00:01:01.680> touching<00:01:01.950> each<00:01:02.190> other<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.899> when<00:01:03.899> I

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
they were touching each other and when I

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.560 
they were touching each other and when I
moved<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.190> wheel<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.729> servo<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.180> saw<00:01:06.540> a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
moved the wheel on the servo I saw a

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.250 
moved the wheel on the servo I saw a
little<00:01:06.810> sparks<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.580> was<00:01:08.970> intrigued<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.600> you

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
little sparks so I was intrigued and you

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.240 
little sparks so I was intrigued and you
know<00:01:10.380> long<00:01:11.190> story<00:01:11.220> short<00:01:12.710> that's<00:01:13.710> what<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.100> is

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
know long story short that's what it is

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.950 
know long story short that's what it is
so<00:01:14.690> I<00:01:15.690> got<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.470> wire<00:01:16.770> from<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.310> broken<00:01:18.180> adapter

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
so I got this wire from a broken adapter

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.789 
so I got this wire from a broken adapter
that<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:22.010> goes<00:01:23.010> right<00:01:23.250> here<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:24.620> this<00:01:25.620> is

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
that I have goes right here and this is

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:34.580 
that I have goes right here and this is
how<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.040> works

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.170 

it's<00:01:35.590> pretty<00:01:35.979> accurate<00:01:36.399> too<00:01:36.610> because<00:01:37.060> they

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
it's pretty accurate too because they

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.719 
it's pretty accurate too because they
got<00:01:37.360> dunno<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.930> gear<00:01:38.140> ratio<00:01:38.590> helps<00:01:39.159> a<00:01:39.369> lot<00:01:39.520> of

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
got dunno the gear ratio helps a lot of

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.609 
got dunno the gear ratio helps a lot of
course<00:01:40.000> but<00:01:40.689> you<00:01:40.780> don't<00:01:40.960> have<00:01:41.079> to<00:01:41.229> move<00:01:41.409> the

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
course but you don't have to move the

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.679 
course but you don't have to move the
wheel<00:01:41.860> fast<00:01:42.220> to<00:01:42.700> move<00:01:43.180> this<00:01:43.390> one<00:01:43.570> here<00:01:44.159> as<00:01:45.689> you

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
wheel fast to move this one here as you

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:53.810 
wheel fast to move this one here as you
can<00:01:46.869> see<00:01:47.049> it<00:01:48.840> lets<00:01:49.840> put<00:01:49.990> its<00:01:50.140> move<00:01:50.580> um<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.750> if

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
can see it lets put its move um and if

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.880 
can see it lets put its move um and if
people<00:01:54.820> are<00:01:54.909> interested<00:01:55.030> I'll<00:01:55.630> put<00:01:55.960> a<00:01:55.990> create

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
people are interested I'll put a create

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.100 
people are interested I'll put a create
a<00:01:56.920> tutorial<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.729> explain<00:01:58.119> how<00:01:58.299> you<00:01:58.360> do<00:01:58.539> how<00:01:59.079> you

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
a tutorial to explain how you do how you

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.710 
a tutorial to explain how you do how you
do<00:01:59.350> it<00:01:59.470> but<00:02:00.009> it's<00:02:00.189> it's<00:02:00.549> cheap<00:02:00.880> very<00:02:01.329> very

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
do it but it's it's cheap very very

do it but it's it's cheap very very
cheap<00:02:01.990> then<00:02:02.740> very<00:02:03.250> easy<00:02:03.640> to<00:02:03.880> make<00:02:04.060> and<00:02:04.420> that's

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
cheap then very easy to make and that's

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.360 
cheap then very easy to make and that's
pretty<00:02:04.990> much<00:02:05.200> it<00:02:05.470> so<00:02:06.600> there<00:02:07.600> you<00:02:07.659> go<00:02:07.860> that's<00:02:08.860> my
