kids<00:01:58.350> like<00:01:58.770> when<00:01:58.950> they're<00:01:59.070> trying<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.280> figure

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
kids like when they're trying to figure

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.789 
kids like when they're trying to figure
it<00:01:59.610> out<00:01:59.790> they<00:02:00.119> really<00:02:00.299> like<00:02:00.630> put<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> lot<00:02:01.649> of

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
it out they really like put a lot of

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.340 
it out they really like put a lot of
effort<00:02:02.159> into<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.759> like<00:02:02.939> goes<00:02:03.570> three<00:02:04.110> feet

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
effort into it it like goes three feet

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.780 
effort into it it like goes three feet
away<00:02:04.469> from<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.130> just<00:02:05.310> want<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.520> keep<00:02:05.670> it

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
away from you you just want to keep it

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.100 
away from you you just want to keep it
under<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.149> with<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.509> front<00:02:06.750> foot<00:02:06.930> you

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
under you with the front foot you

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.960 
under you with the front foot you
literally<00:02:07.469> just<00:02:07.710> kick<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.039> out<00:02:08.160> straight<00:02:08.789> and

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
literally just kick it out straight and

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.940 
literally just kick it out straight and
you<00:02:09.030> just<00:02:09.179> leave<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.869> out<00:02:10.110> there<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
you just leave it out there and the

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.920 
you just leave it out there and the
pressure<00:02:11.250> between<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.790> two<00:02:12.150> areas

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
pressure between the two areas

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.209 
pressure between the two areas
are<00:02:13.109> going<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.290> like<00:02:13.469> play<00:02:13.709> on<00:02:13.890> each<00:02:14.010> other

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:14.219 
are going to like play on each other

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:16.699 
are going to like play on each other
it's<00:02:14.819> basically<00:02:15.450> just<00:02:15.569> physics<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:16.439> it<00:02:16.530> does

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
it's basically just physics that it does

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.740 
it's basically just physics that it does
the<00:02:16.859> flip<00:02:17.099> like<00:02:17.310> that

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.360 

so<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:23.840> want<00:02:23.990> to<00:02:24.080> set<00:02:24.290> your<00:02:24.440> front<00:02:24.830> foot<00:02:25.130> in

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
so you want to set your front foot in

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.520 
so you want to set your front foot in
kind<00:02:25.670> of<00:02:25.850> like<00:02:26.000> a<00:02:26.030> kickflip<00:02:26.570> position<00:02:26.630> you're

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
kind of like a kickflip position you're

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.740 
kind of like a kickflip position you're
going<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.710> pop<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.190> hard<00:02:28.430> you<00:02:29.120> want<00:02:29.270> to<00:02:29.390> pop<00:02:29.570> it

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
going to pop it hard you want to pop it

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.890 
going to pop it hard you want to pop it
hard<00:02:29.990> because<00:02:30.140> you<00:02:30.290> want<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:30.500> flick<00:02:30.710> it<00:02:30.860> fast

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
hard because you want to flick it fast

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.360 
hard because you want to flick it fast
it's<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:33.080> little<00:02:33.410> tricky<00:02:33.800> to<00:02:33.830> get<00:02:34.010> your<00:02:34.190> weight

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
it's a little tricky to get your weight

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.460 
it's a little tricky to get your weight
on<00:02:34.580> both<00:02:34.610> sides<00:02:35.270> of<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.540> board<00:02:35.840> but<00:02:36.140> luckily

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
on both sides of the board but luckily

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.980 
on both sides of the board but luckily
for<00:02:36.830> you<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.460> back<00:02:37.790> foot<00:02:38.150> is<00:02:38.360> kind<00:02:38.600> of<00:02:38.720> on<00:02:38.870> the

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
for you the back foot is kind of on the

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.750 
for you the back foot is kind of on the
back<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.470> maybe<00:02:39.710> you<00:02:39.980> can<00:02:40.100> even<00:02:40.130> get<00:02:40.520> it<00:02:40.640> in

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
back and maybe you can even get it in

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.430 
back and maybe you can even get it in
the<00:02:40.880> pocket<00:02:41.330> on<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.540> opposite<00:02:41.930> side<00:02:42.170> a<00:02:42.200> little

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
the pocket on the opposite side a little

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.800 
the pocket on the opposite side a little
bit<00:02:42.590> when<00:02:43.160> I<00:02:43.190> snap<00:02:43.670> it<00:02:43.700> I'm<00:02:44.000> going<00:02:44.150> to<00:02:44.210> scoop<00:02:44.660> it

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
bit when I snap it I'm going to scoop it

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.170 
bit when I snap it I'm going to scoop it
and<00:02:44.990> kick<00:02:45.200> back<00:02:45.440> with<00:02:45.830> my<00:02:45.980> back<00:02:46.160> foot<00:02:46.190> my<00:02:46.850> front

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
and kick back with my back foot my front

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.430 
and kick back with my back foot my front
foot<00:02:47.270> is<00:02:47.540> pretty<00:02:47.750> much<00:02:47.959> you're<00:02:48.110> going<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.260> do<00:02:48.410> a

foot is pretty much you're going to do a

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.250 
foot is pretty much you're going to do a
nice<00:02:48.680> little<00:02:48.950> light<00:02:49.310> flick<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.810> back<00:02:50.990> was

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
nice little light flick and the back was

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.620 
nice little light flick and the back was
pretty<00:02:51.350> much<00:02:51.590> doing<00:02:51.770> all<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.100> work<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:53.510> can

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
you're not gonna stop it you're gonna

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.180 
you're not gonna stop it you're gonna
catch<00:02:58.760> it<00:02:59.020> guide<00:03:00.020> it<00:03:00.230> let<00:03:00.440> it<00:03:00.470> keep<00:03:00.680> moving<00:03:01.100> the

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
catch it guide it let it keep moving the

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.000 
catch it guide it let it keep moving the
way<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:01.340> was<00:03:01.550> to<00:03:01.730> go<00:03:01.910> land<00:03:02.840> you<00:03:03.560> need<00:03:03.739> to<00:03:03.830> bend

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
way it was to go land you need to bend

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.160 
way it was to go land you need to bend
your<00:03:04.130> knees<00:03:04.340> every<00:03:04.910> joint<00:03:05.120> has<00:03:05.330> its<00:03:05.540> purpose

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
your knees every joint has its purpose

your knees every joint has its purpose
your<00:03:06.830> knees<00:03:07.010> are<00:03:07.040> too<00:03:07.340> bent<00:03:07.730> so<00:03:07.940> when<00:03:08.120> you<00:03:08.300> land

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
your knees are too bent so when you land

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.960 
your knees are too bent so when you land
bend<00:03:09.050> your<00:03:09.230> knees<00:03:09.610> hopefully<00:03:10.610> you<00:03:10.700> can<00:03:10.820> get

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
bend your knees hopefully you can get

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.210 
bend your knees hopefully you can get
back<00:03:11.209> up<00:03:11.239> pop<00:03:12.050> a<00:03:12.080> couple<00:03:12.320> advil<00:03:12.620> you<00:03:13.100> know

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
probably already know how to do them

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.050 
probably already know how to do them
because<00:03:29.570> you<00:03:29.690> guys<00:03:29.810> progress<00:03:30.230> like<00:03:30.700> so<00:03:31.700> fast

these<00:03:32.300> days<00:03:32.360> it's<00:03:32.720> insane<00:03:33.140> like<00:03:33.440> when<00:03:33.710> we<00:03:33.890> were

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
these days it's insane like when we were

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.490 
these days it's insane like when we were
filming<00:03:34.370> this<00:03:34.520> there's<00:03:35.180> literally<00:03:35.510> like<00:03:35.630> 17

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
filming this there's literally like 17

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.770 
filming this there's literally like 17
clones<00:03:36.980> and<00:03:37.340> they<00:03:37.730> could<00:03:37.880> do<00:03:37.970> every<00:03:38.270> trick<00:03:38.540> I

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
clones and they could do every trick I

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.130 
clones and they could do every trick I
was<00:03:39.110> filming<00:03:39.380> this<00:03:39.560> thinking<00:03:39.980> like<00:03:40.160> dude<00:03:41.140> so
