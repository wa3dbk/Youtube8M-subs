00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.050
 hello friends and internet friends today 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.900
 let's make some lentils 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:29.189
 low in calories and we're going to use a 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.189
 coconut signature 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:45.379
 for the making of these lentils 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.739
 you have to previously soak a 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.820
 an hour and a half in the morning 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.980
 put it in the mojo the day before 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.050
 find the lentils on the summits 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.640
 a little while they are in water for the 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.430
 morning enough let's throw all and 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.850
 teeth in a whole start with the 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.850
 peppers 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.710
 carrot in pieces 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.940
 green pepper 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.380
 red pepper, garlic, peeled 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.010
 tomato 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:24.010
 half onion a little bit of laurel 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.010
 another carrot already chopped into slices 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.370
 a world of chicken without skin and a lot of ham 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.720
 a good flavor package 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.680
 we put it to cook everything 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.180
 once he has lifted the lentils 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.270
 we take advantage to remove the impurities 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.770
 with a silicone ladle from the 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:49.820
 crossing we introduce a little bit of oil 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.010
 of extra virgin olive to stew one thing 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.920
 that we have not talked about in other videos is 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.790
 The range of silicone products 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.470
 crossing since you have all kinds of 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.170
 utensils that make us easier 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.390
 food processing and has the 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.260
 advantage they hold at 425 degrees 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.800
 temperature we have everything and they are very 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.800
 easy cleaning 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.310
 We can remove the silicone and we can 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.310
 perfectly put the dishwasher 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.640
 now is the time to lower the power 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.020
 to take advantage of 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.910
 the characteristic of cast iron 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.180
 melted black we get down almost to the 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.659
 minimum cap 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.280
 and let cook a few minutes 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:40.989
 after a few minutes it's time 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.550
 to take the vegetable to a glass for 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.840
 trituration with tourism 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.840
 we take advantage to season 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.160
 with the crushed vegetables what 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.460
 we get is to bind the lentils without 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.920
 have a need to use flours and 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.850
 with that we work considerably on 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.850
 number of calories 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:13.060
 then we introduce the leg 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.060
 in cachitos 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.299
 those are delicious 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.450
 now it's time to cover the shutdown 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:29.550
 the fire totally and with the heat that 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.380
 has if it is not to cook the potato 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.380
 and they finished making the lentils
