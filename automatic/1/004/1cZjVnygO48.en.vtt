00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 My friends, I'm from castro 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.879
 in the video no longer talk about the anime that 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.160
 made a success in my childhood in my 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.510
 childhood and in addition it was a 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.700
 schools because it is 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.700
 today we are going to talk about the anime blade 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.500
 and an anime blade has a group of 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.720
 young people who have their bibles and 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.430
 of tournaments so for those who do not know it 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.080
 It's difficult, someone did not know, but let's go. 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.029
 It does not even matter that you do not know how to drink milk. 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.679
 are very similar to pedestrians 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.719
 those old movies that had code 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.730
 wood that was the time of his 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.370
 parents or their grandparents because it is the same 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.200
 thing only that the best milk had beast 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.110
 bits and technologies then when you 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.719
 long beyblade she had that one 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.850
 fair bit to around each had one and there 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.190
 characters participated in tournaments for 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.719
 Tokyo and the world, so it's very cool. 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.789
 and you had fights etc 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.800
 so I loved and besides drinking 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.480
 milk was a success in schools like me 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.190
 said at the beginning of the video because everything 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.350
 world in real life beyond design 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.910
 also had her well ladies just plain 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.769
 I did not have real cannabis but I did 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.600
 had a flashing light but it was 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.330
 very fun and also played some 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.220
 music was very cool and sometimes 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.710
 sad thing happened in schools times 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.780
 the guy playing in English who is mad at 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.369
 half of the competition was sad for who 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.640
 happen this to me has never happened and 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.170
 blade I make the reinforcements reinforced her 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.790
 with the irons understood 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.500
 there it was a little stronger and 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.270
 never broke the break even broke 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.400
 and some of my friends, but I 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.719
 I was lucky, I did not break thanks, this is it. 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.719
 I never lost an old upgrade 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.719
 i 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.410
 for you who do not remember or do not know the 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.330
 beast bits of blitz was a type to dawn 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.430
 also lady had a lot of power to make 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.650
 mystical at the time I was like the soul of the 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.890
 business and unanimous was inspired by the manga 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.440
 blade that was made from 2000 to 2004 and 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.900
 had 14 volumes already the anime debuted in 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.030
 January 2001 by tv tokyo sim only 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.520
 one year after the release of the manga and 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.460
 brazil 's blade debut was in 2002 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.230
 fox kids forever fox wanted me 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.210
 I will even make a video'm seeing here 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:14.160
 For you but I loved fox 15 was the 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.200
 best channel of all in my childhood 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.390
 then fox I think my second bread 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.060
 and favorite was the cartoon network but the 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.210
 fox kids is eternal and should return please 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.160
 fox come back with fox 15 for the love of god 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.870
 but blake's success in Brazil is due 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.570
 to the globe the world went by 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.450
 who presented the great mass of the 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.150
 young people on the globino tv because it's us 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.560
 where you walk from boy to 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.480
 four 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.640
 seasons and England midfielder and a movie 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.290
 but in Brazil it is not so much anymore 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.030
 success as before because the new 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.010
 seasons are not displayed by tv 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.870
 open tv globe no longer exists 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.000
 then unfortunately good milk is only 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.340
 currently in Brazil on tv 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.959
 closed by the former falling highlights 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.610
 photo esq says it was bought by 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.650
 Disney except one day I'll explain 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.020
 all this in a video but then good milk 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.180
 here in Brazil it is not so famous anymore 9 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.400
 a little older we watched 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.560
 Formerly and closed tv the galley 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.570
 It's still watching and netflix gives 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.060
 to watch classic beyblade do not 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.709
 new seasons in the well on netflix however 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.630
 Who likes classic bb? 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.860
 my opinion is the best, right? 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.450
 superman the needs and desires 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.760
 netflix today I was watching 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.989
 It's reminders is very good. 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.630
 and before I forget the rest of the world 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.190
 beyblade still thrives here in 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.830
 Brazil, like I said in that thing too. 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.870
 It's difficult but it's life. 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.970
 besides the anime and manga there are also 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.280
 games for game boy advance game boy 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.320
 playstation and one fired and some more 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.760
 others were made of tickets to 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.320
 these consoles and was also a success 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.480
 in almost all of them 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.790
 I used to play blade in this one me 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.080
 I remember until today he is my friend o thales 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.519
 I do not know if he watched the videos. 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.110
 Some time you do not talk anymore 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.590
 was one of my best friends in my 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.750
 childhood 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.260
 We were going to his house and he came here. 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.209
 at home 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.959
 playing English all day in the 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.760
 video game is incredible and also I 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.860
 video game also had a how it is 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.629
 he called his name stayed like him 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.909
 called oval era as soon as I go 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:07.950
 that I was playing both me and my 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.659
 blade l net friends like in real life 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.030
 even in the video game as well as in life 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:14.489
 real had the strange extends the called 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.590
 and the people playing there were incredible 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.660
 amazing loved it loved it today it does not have 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.720
 most sadly sad life lost 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.310
 blind and now let's go to the curiosities 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.139
 about blade 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.270
 did you know that the author of bd was inspired 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.310
 in akira toriyama thus the creator of 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.500
 dragon ball because it is and I think it gave a 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.780
 light touch yes interesting to the 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.550
 B series other interesting blade is 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.020
 that in the original story the vacation bits 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.300
 could not be seen all over the world 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.789
 just because he owned vacation bits or 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.680
 by their own owners then in the anime 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:45.900
 that changed and everyone could see 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.400
 fighting the beasts in action 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.050
 I found the modification interesting because 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.210
 I think it would not be legal because 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.830
 No one could see it, because it's legal to 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.419
 no ball that my neighbor is 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.940
 then maybe some 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.320
 noise here hammer is there which does not 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.870
 no idea what they are doing I think are 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.729
 breaking everything there but it's photo something else 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.500
 interesting is that the blade anime suffered 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.150
 censors here in Brazil and in the 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.180
 United States due to the violence of the 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.660
 drawing and you remember larry 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.639
 because this is not the original speech this 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.449
 it was not true but single speech 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.550
 mall 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.080
 Just like remembering certain goh thyroid 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.690
 chok for those who do not know where to shoot 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.400
 English was then modified to light 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.260
 so as not to influence children to 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.789
 like guns and t7 and look what 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.860
 interesting in the United States some 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:30.990
 Blues seasons is not displayed by the 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.330
 disney xd like here in Brazil but yes 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.320
 by nickelodeon and the cartoon network 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.550
 and now let's talk about a curiosity 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.050
 a bit bizarre 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.760
 Did you know that weiland at the beginning already 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.020
 maria revolving victory 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.990
 but then the creators realized that the 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.849
 name was crap and then named bd 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.979
 Thank God, right? Because victory. 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:49.110
 rotary whore that gave me pardon the 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:51.900
 swear words and people, but it sucks. 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.580
 Please, please, and now, to close. 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.650
 with a golden key this video was to know 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.050
 bay bay of no anime and manga were 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.849
 very different because it is interesting not to 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.560
 so this is my friends I am the 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:03.600
 castro video where it's here.
