00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.950 

the<00:01:29.040> ideal<00:01:29.340> number<00:01:29.580> of<00:01:29.820> suits<00:01:30.060> for<00:01:30.510> very<00:01:30.780> own

the ideal number of suits for very own

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.110 
the ideal number of suits for very own
in<00:01:31.080> this<00:01:31.200> industry<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.950> think<00:01:32.160> it<00:01:32.550> is<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.730> minimum

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
in this industry I think it is a minimum

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.140 
in this industry I think it is a minimum
of<00:01:33.240> six<00:01:33.510> and<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.230> think<00:01:34.470> ideally<00:01:35.010> 10<00:01:35.400> IV<00:01:35.820> unit<00:01:36.060> of

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
of six and I think ideally 10 IV unit of

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.970 
of six and I think ideally 10 IV unit of
replenishing<00:01:36.750> those<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.260> know<00:01:37.350> four<00:01:37.620> or<00:01:37.650> five

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
replenishing those you know four or five

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:43.810 
replenishing those you know four or five
of<00:01:38.010> those<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.580> think<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.240> an<00:01:39.360> annual<00:01:39.600> basis<00:01:39.960> I

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.440 

think<00:01:44.820> there<00:01:44.940> is<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> direct<00:01:45.330> correlation

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
think there is a direct correlation

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.480 
think there is a direct correlation
between<00:01:45.960> how<00:01:46.650> people<00:01:47.010> present<00:01:47.340> themselves

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
between how people present themselves

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.400 
between how people present themselves
and<00:01:48.030> how<00:01:48.150> successful<00:01:48.210> they<00:01:48.840> are<00:01:48.870> so<00:01:49.260> that's

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
and how successful they are so that's

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.440 
and how successful they are so that's
why<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.560> really<00:01:50.550> do<00:01:50.670> put<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.910> lot<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.060> time<00:01:51.300> and

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
why I really do put a lot of time and

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.360 
why I really do put a lot of time and
effort<00:01:51.540> into<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.500> suits<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.010> wear<00:01:53.190> the

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
effort into the suits that I wear the
