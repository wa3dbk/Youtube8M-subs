00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:11.480
 Hello everyone, in short, I decided to do 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.130
 a certain amount of transposition in the apartment and that's 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:19.619
 require shorter me this great 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:24.180
 closet two meters 1 dragged another 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:27.109
 make a room on the carpet 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.570
 pretty problematic because 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:35.870
 if you will drag the tone to drag with 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:41.370
 a carpet is obtained as a fold 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:44.100
 that's how to say well, in general, it is inconvenient 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.500
 drag you and parvati damage all that 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.390
 it pleases me in the corridor 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:56.610
 linoleum is also shorter and can be torn out and 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:01:00.989
 much trouble may be in general i 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:07.100
 I'm going to the garage now, I need to 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:10.500
 make the rollers to the point that will be a 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.780
 as if put on the floor they will be on 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.860
 wheels on them will be placed closet and 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.580
 already the closet will be 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:23.159
 move on these beds 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.520
 but all while turning off the food in the garage there 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.790
 already turn on will show approximately 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:35.450
 What will I do that quickly nakidal 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.450
 I want to make in general the usual stand 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.270
 This sheet chipboard here will likely 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:46.680
 emphasis on willow here emphasis and here on 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.110
 the sides and down there will be wheels 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.149
 pretty fast yet not for me 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:56.750
 I'll see maybe I'll just make the boards 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:02:00.860
 twisting on it yet 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.860
 Well, everything is included in the garage 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:15.690
 hello again i'm sorry i even 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.060
 I just didnâ€™t have time to shoot anything to me 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.720
 there was no time I needed to be very 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.440
 to work quickly because I took 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.810
 car body and I needed 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.000
 hurry seeing them take off very 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.970
 I shoot already the final result as far as 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.850
 you remember here was a cupboard now from 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:43.950
 the cabinet is here on its side here and this 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:45.380
 tackles they they on 4 wheels each that 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.550
 there is just 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:57.120
 collected romance screw and calm 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:03:01.470
 I can roll the cabinet apologize to 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:05.959
 I got the battery in general, one hand 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.959
 In short, you can safely move 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:16.040
 core labor is not the only 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.040
 Of course a little ride 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:27.530
 it is for these stand many it is not 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:31.590
 The trouble because here so can be rubber 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:34.820
 strips or so ride and will be for 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.820
 it's not important to me now 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.820
 to roll 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:45.290
 another room is such a healthy closet 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:50.060
 set this to 230 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:04.700
 This is what it looks like inside. 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.700
 if someone suddenly say that the setup 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:17.130
 okay shorter over a year to move it 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:22.310
 time is already about one in the morning my 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:26.880
 everyone is sleeping everyone on this video I finish 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.100
 so the rollers are very comfortable in terms of 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.970
 movement 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.970
 large things inside the apartment 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.210
 rather than carry for example it's all on your hands 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.680
 one is just unrealistic such a cabinet 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:45.600
 move from place to place even just 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:47.790
 it's inconvenient to move it all to whom the video 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.210
 like put like subscribe to 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.530
