00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.040

 number 10 of street drying 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.810

 I liked it a lot and I'm a fan of rafa and 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.080
 of you of what all that you do 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.010
 because it is an opportunity for all 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.010
 that we can not play in rooms 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.290
 has come within that very well a lot 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.839
 rally 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.400
 I am kike I want to thank the effort 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.350
 what have you done because I have felt 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.270
 very comfortable and I loved it and we have 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.920
 made rock and roll I'm kike and I 've 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.600
 stayed with the room and especially the 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.800
 opportunity that is given to young people such 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.750
 and how are things now that no 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.460
 they leave nobody plays a concert and a 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.440
 wonderful people good let's say 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.450
 that we are missing the battery that is not called 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.250
 Javi is gone and is that his birthday has already 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.070
 had to go congratulations on our 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.840
 part over here we're going to make a game 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.240
 ok let's play a little here 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.190
 we have some more good questions 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.950
 others more bad to one you take me one 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.630
 there will not be and open it what our 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.850
 strongest trick as a band we are very 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.310
 friends the four the friendship unites us that 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.900
 it sounds like not really the fact of 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.250
 rehearsing is a pleasure is like being with 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.410
 your friend that one afternoon rehearsed us what 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.330
 we spent super well that is not already so 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.680
 professional in plan we have to polish the 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.110
 sound if we're not going to have a good time 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.850
 and because of that the sound comes out only me 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.620
 I think that the best asset we have had 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.510
 today it has been the public because they have sounded 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.270
 more than us a lot very safe then 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.710
 is a girl in love if they offered you 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.360
 telonea with a band of the most 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.480
 known by teenagers I hope that a 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.800
 you do not like anything you would do it 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.050
 it depends on which band it is that 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.660
 first there is the music and then there is the 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.400
 business not because you have to be faithful to the 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.320
 principles is also not sold to the 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.910
 minimum to play with a group that is very 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.130
 famous but I'm going you do not like it 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.440
 our I would not feel like it does not come 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.000
 in business you are not a group either 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.830
 hopefully you consider yourself a group with 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.510
 luck we have had the luck of 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.070
 know them because we would not have had the 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.660
 opportunity this is not a player to touch 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.540
 in a room like this is no longer what 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.160
 I already have but we did not have the opportunity 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.300
 of having played in a room that comes out 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.950
 millions of songs that we love 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.930
 So that 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.610
 no other way on that side if 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.379
 we have now we are lucky but 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.940
 there is also work luck because there is no 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:51.230
 many frictions between groups I will take a 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.959
 how the music has changed 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.480
 lives make it a kind of 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.890
 habit not music this year has been the 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.989
 best experience I've had to meet them 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.450
 they say that every time I go up 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.700
 to the stage because I believe that it is good 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.410
 important and when you leave you are 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.060
 the same as always but it's a 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.430
 opportunity to be someone different 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.200
 completely good so you can follow us 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.510

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.430

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.069
 been everything with margot see you see each other 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.069
 another time 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.019
 do not 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.830
 again here in the edition of the basic 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.410
 andréis road shows with the fourth 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.300
 good cell I am David I am the singer 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.010
 of the cell part group and the truth that 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.810
 I enjoyed it very much and it was very good 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.610
 here in the silikona room very nice 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.500

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.450
 of the group and the most handsome also 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.550
 joke obviously nothing I 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.710
 enjoyed the concert today 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.480
 I hope to fill many more good I am 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.430
 Alberto if the bassist of the group but what 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.780
 today it happens very well as almost everything 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.980
 concerts and thanked the 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.620
 people who come to see us always but 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.970
 because already followed by tan the battery of 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.740
 group to grace is the people who have 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.650
 come and I hope it happened today 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.570
 we have a little each one you are going to take 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.340
 one of the questions and the one that touches the 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.590
 that lawyer touch like that group you 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.910
 like to get to place the rolling 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.730
 stones 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.310
 is to look very up this is better 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.569
 look very up to look 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.490
 moderately and stay on the road 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:35.770
 you think there is good music in your 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.159
 country in spain that yes that is good 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.659
 music 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:39.399
 I think it would take many more 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:40.719
 opportunities and that people will be placed 

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:42.459
 a little bit more with the music but I think 

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:45.429
 that yes the aic people are missing that 

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:46.629
 bet on young groups and how 

00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:48.129
 does in other countries that since 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:50.309
 little ones are betting on it 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:53.199
 they invest and in the end they become 

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:55.479
 big groups and that sanz go big 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.429
 groups like laziness but I guess that 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.779
 come other very good as we can be 

00:04:57.429 --> 00:05:00.459
 we for example missing 

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:03.520
 opportunities and when someone has 

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:06.430
 an insurance that arrives up easy there 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.050
 groups or well-known people may not 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.449
 be at the same level as others that are not 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.219
 known and that because of these 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:14.949
 opportunities can not be 

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:17.139
 famous people or people to listen to 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:20.589
 really for you that is the success 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:21.999
 that people know your songs and 

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:24.249
 you sing, yes, everything is feeling good 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:26.110
 with yourself and enjoy it our 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:27.789
 success is the one that we take how we 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.169
 we take it that we continue together and that 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:30.099
 while we enjoy that 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.379
 we will be at the highest 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:36.330
