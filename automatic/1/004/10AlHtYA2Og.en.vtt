00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.939
 hello together today i want to go back 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.039
 time a guitar presentation from the 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.090
 house in memory , our new entry 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:31.080
 in the hard &amp; heavy series but you 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.540
 here around the s &amp; t 312 in black as you like 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.160
 The guitar is very nice 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.290
 matt black lacquered I think it is 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.270
 a really cool look complete 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.450
 black toned wednesday 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.450
 we have matching the hardware in 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.309
 Graphite colors kept that high 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.070
 to the overall picture of the guitar very well 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.949
 It fits that beauty is straight 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.969
 it combines the classic sound 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.289
 So let some modern rock sound through 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.030
 the hamburger here in the 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.129
 hinterbrÃ¼hl position was installed 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.530
 Let's see how that part sounds 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.799
 and we'll listen to it first 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.900
 this wiry estado caster sound 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.900
 in the backhand position 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.159
 b 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:37.610
 very bluesy warm sound already 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.590
 playing with the poly is half 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.910
 psyched when you get all occurs 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.720
 Of course, increase even more and more 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.720
 power 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.810
 I think so too for the 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.400
 electronics that was installed speaks 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.830
 that one really differentiates here 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.660
 consult the various modes position 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.880
 then we have the example here 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.010
 middle position then already a little bit 20 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.920
 Patent value between the middle pick up 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.330
 and the hamburgern what I open 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.330
 rock chords quite well suited 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.849
 and middle hamburger itself you can then 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.630
 more gas just sounds yet 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.630
 a bit more active 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.690
 m 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.490
 What I really like about this guitar 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.170
 I like the hamburger that sounds 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.840
 beautiful and aggressive at the back 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.930
 pressure without him too much 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.300
 makes sound too wide and none 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.340
 soundbrei arises so there are the sounds 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.180
 really differentiated and still nice 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.530
 still with power 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.750
 I think that's very nice about this 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.770
 who is not on the guitar right now 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.630
 classic district stands for the us 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.030
 Of course , other companies 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.460
 offer from the second harry series from 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:27.690
 the memory for example the lp 800 or 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.970
 the bc 520 euro we will be priced 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.480
 here with this in this test wear 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.020
 only twelve models at a vp of 109 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.550
 Euro 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.950
 which of course still 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.810
 makes more interesting and I can you 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.630
 only guess goes to your dealer asks 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.710
 then test digitally and wish 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.010
 have fun until the next one 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.010
 times
