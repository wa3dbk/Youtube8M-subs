 The contents of which are premise are not exceptional themselves but it is what 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:37.409
 top court has been placed in the packaging and is striking 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.639
 it can still affect my attention 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.639

 let's see the further contents 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.880
 inside the package 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:21.719

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:26.369
 lilly 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:30.449

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:36.199
 there is this little extra packaged should be answered above to contain 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.319
 the other extras 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.499
 in which we have 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:43.899
 inside the DVD package 

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:48.229

 the original soundtrack 

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:56.699
 and therefore 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:59.819
 for all the CDs with the songs contained within the game 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.749
 and then 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:06.969
 the krier tor book which is an illustrated book 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:13.189
 with the graphics with which it is then made of diodes el 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:16.189
 of the game we remember that it is a musical game 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.090
 is that 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.559
 classic by day it follows the rhythm of those keys at the right time 

00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:27.659
 and helm simultaneously via a video that runs 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:34.619
 as a rule a lot of me made Japponese manga style or Japanese anime 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.999
 facts you see that the cutting of the cheat cake contained the bed horses 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.430
 recall 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.229
 despite being produced in Korea 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.699
 small cutor mules 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:50.830
 cartons 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.159
 Japonese then excused some others 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:58.990
 tracks that have a different cut that then typical of the series show different 

00:04:58.989 --> 00:05:01.589
 types of graphics 

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:04.589
 of livio but also of songs spacing 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.300
 three kinds more valid the dense the a 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.669
 even melodic music a well a bit of everything the whole of says max 

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:17.419
 clear thirty this liberate really very well done is the first time 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.809
 which is opened 

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:22.830
 and i do it 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.830
 for for chen scolacium's friends. i t 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.600
 put these artworks really very well taken care of this one character 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.030
 who was also contained within another would limit pisciona 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:49.129
 in the mask to be contained it has no limit of what I will present to you 

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:52.589
 taken later 

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:55.589
 in another chapter of our boxes on the way 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:59.349
 temperate malines tried the sun 125 specimens 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:05.449
 I run fast 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:08.840
 although I must say that these artworks 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:13.379
 in some cases they really deserve I am very very well made 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:19.129
 the view 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:26.889
 as you can see for each page, however, that did not point out is the title 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:29.099
 of the song e 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:32.189
 eventually it is the original of the remix and comes 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:37.789
 indicated there is the title and then it is also indicated by those who come 

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:40.029
 produced the 

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:42.919
 the video is therefore who has it 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:45.919
 the vj 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.539
 on the artist, however, behind graphics 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.550
 these are 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.270
 the traces 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.270
 here as you notice everything in Korean instead 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.610
 there are many writings 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:08.259
 and these are 

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:11.259
 even the graphics of the game 

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:13.729
 I would say that 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:18.309
 you have all the echoes and first voices were just similar technician 2 10 

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:21.249
 in fact 4 

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:26.399
 nice in video 1002 than the previous model who is identical to 1015 

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:29.399
 it simply changes color with gray wool with eggs and black 

00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:34.159
 and here shows the characteristics of 

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:38.309
 digieye various products of have followed so I also saw voters 

00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:41.309
 of paioni r 

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.320
 these are probably the artists and I try the programmers 

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:51.940
 I would say that for this video unboxing and everything we see at boys sugden 

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.120
 scolacium dots from your fideuada
