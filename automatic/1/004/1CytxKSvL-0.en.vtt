straight Taylor so once you get to that

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.900 
straight Taylor so once you get to that
point<00:00:25.930> then<00:00:26.230> it's<00:00:27.100> time<00:00:27.250> to<00:00:27.340> work<00:00:27.460> on<00:00:27.610> agree

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
point then it's time to work on agree

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.770 
point then it's time to work on agree
with<00:00:28.860> the<00:00:29.860> speed<00:00:30.160> of<00:00:30.430> the<00:00:30.610> 360<00:00:30.880> telleth<00:00:31.540> I

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:31.780 
with the speed of the 360 telleth I

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.350 
with the speed of the 360 telleth I
would<00:00:32.290> say<00:00:32.500> the<00:00:32.739> a<00:00:32.920> bit<00:00:33.160> slower<00:00:33.489> than<00:00:34.000> average

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
would say the a bit slower than average

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.590 
would say the a bit slower than average
360<00:00:35.260> because<00:00:35.980> you<00:00:36.850> have<00:00:36.940> to<00:00:37.030> go<00:00:37.149> off<00:00:37.239> the<00:00:37.390> lip

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
360 because you have to go off the lip

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.590 
360 because you have to go off the lip
and<00:00:38.820> find<00:00:39.820> your<00:00:39.969> point<00:00:40.239> where<00:00:40.420> you're<00:00:40.510> gonna

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
and find your point where you're gonna

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.500 
and find your point where you're gonna
stall<00:00:40.839> out<00:00:41.050> and<00:00:41.079> start<00:00:41.440> to<00:00:41.559> tell<00:00:41.769> it<00:00:42.510> the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
stall out and start to tell it the

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.090 
stall out and start to tell it the
starting<00:00:43.870> point<00:00:44.109> of<00:00:44.170> the<00:00:44.289> tell<00:00:44.469> it<00:00:44.589> for<00:00:44.739> me

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
starting point of the tell it for me

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.729 
starting point of the tell it for me
I<00:00:45.129> make<00:00:45.579> sure<00:00:45.609> I<00:00:45.820> go<00:00:46.059> off<00:00:46.539> the<00:00:46.839> lips<00:00:47.289> wait<00:00:47.589> just

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
I make sure I go off the lips wait just

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.040 
I make sure I go off the lips wait just
a<00:00:47.949> tad<00:00:48.309> bit<00:00:48.339> so<00:00:48.819> like<00:00:48.969> a<00:00:48.999> little<00:00:49.300> bit<00:00:49.390> before<00:00:49.690> 90

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
a tad bit so like a little bit before 90

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.470 
a tad bit so like a little bit before 90
so<00:00:50.289> that<00:00:50.530> at<00:00:51.460> that<00:00:51.519> point<00:00:51.940> you're<00:00:52.329> not<00:00:52.420> going

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
so that at that point you're not going

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.450 
so that at that point you're not going
to<00:00:52.690> kiss<00:00:52.899> the<00:00:52.929> telev<00:00:53.409> and<00:00:53.710> drag<00:00:54.010> it<00:00:54.159> off<00:00:54.249> the

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
to kiss the telev and drag it off the

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.119 
to kiss the telev and drag it off the
list<00:00:54.670> when<00:00:55.210> you<00:00:55.329> go<00:00:55.479> into<00:00:55.719> a<00:00:55.899> 360<00:00:56.440> tail<00:00:56.800> up<00:00:56.949> and

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
list when you go into a 360 tail up and

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.200 
list when you go into a 360 tail up and
you<00:00:57.219> you<00:00:57.640> start<00:00:57.879> the<00:00:57.999> telephone<00:00:58.479> too<00:00:58.809> early

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
you you start the telephone too early

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.430 
you you start the telephone too early

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
typically it's gonna drag off the lip

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.619 
typically it's gonna drag off the lip
and<00:01:02.710> depending<00:01:03.550> on<00:01:03.639> how<00:01:03.819> bad<00:01:04.089> you<00:01:04.239> do<00:01:04.360> it<00:01:04.479> it's

it but that's one thing to definitely
look<00:01:19.930> out<00:01:20.049> for<00:01:20.289> is<00:01:20.520> not<00:01:21.520> go<00:01:21.670> too<00:01:21.729> early<00:01:21.880> when<00:01:22.780> I

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
look out for is not go too early when I

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.010 
look out for is not go too early when I
was<00:01:23.020> learning<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.409> 360<00:01:24.009> with<00:01:24.539> having<00:01:25.539> a<00:01:25.780> hard

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
was learning the 360 with having a hard

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.819 
was learning the 360 with having a hard
time<00:01:26.079> of<00:01:26.799> waiting<00:01:27.610> because<00:01:28.210> I<00:01:28.240> was<00:01:28.770> thinking<00:01:29.770> I

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
time of waiting because I was thinking I

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.440 
time of waiting because I was thinking I
just<00:01:29.860> need<00:01:30.159> to<00:01:30.219> get<00:01:30.340> it<00:01:30.430> over<00:01:30.640> with<00:01:30.670> as<00:01:31.180> soon<00:01:31.240> as

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
just need to get it over with as soon as

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.749 
just need to get it over with as soon as
possible<00:01:31.539> so<00:01:31.990> I<00:01:32.439> was<00:01:32.770> kicking<00:01:33.159> the<00:01:33.340> back<00:01:33.490> power

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
possible so I was kicking the back power

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.139 
possible so I was kicking the back power
right<00:01:34.060> into<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.359> lip<00:01:34.539> all<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.780> time<00:01:35.109> and<00:01:36.149> once

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
right into the lip all the time and once

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.270 
right into the lip all the time and once
I<00:01:37.299> faded<00:01:37.630> out<00:01:37.780> I'm<00:01:38.289> sure<00:01:38.500> someone<00:01:38.890> probably

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
I faded out I'm sure someone probably

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.010 
I faded out I'm sure someone probably
helped<00:01:39.460> me<00:01:39.579> out<00:01:39.609> and<00:01:39.789> said<00:01:39.969> wait<00:01:40.539> a<00:01:40.570> little<00:01:40.810> bit

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
helped me out and said wait a little bit

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.480 
helped me out and said wait a little bit
once<00:01:41.289> they<00:01:41.409> told<00:01:41.560> me<00:01:41.710> that<00:01:41.740> then<00:01:42.159> it<00:01:42.310> was

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
once they told me that then it was

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.240 
once they told me that then it was
clicked<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:43.060> like<00:01:43.210> there<00:01:43.899> you<00:01:43.990> go<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.859> focus
