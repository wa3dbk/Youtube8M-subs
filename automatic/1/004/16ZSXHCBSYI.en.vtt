them now but I figure let's just do it
again<00:00:47.280> but<00:00:47.670> your<00:00:47.820> stoop<00:00:48.030> with<00:00:48.150> the<00:00:48.269> town<00:00:48.449> or

however<00:00:53.549> the<00:00:53.970> giant<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.479> the<00:00:54.720> most<00:00:54.900> boring<00:00:55.110> of

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500

however the giant is the most boring of
all<00:00:55.619> troops<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.129> my<00:00:56.339> humble<00:00:56.549> opinion<00:00:56.729> it

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
all troops in my humble opinion it

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:58.729 
all troops in my humble opinion it
doesn't<00:00:57.570> do<00:00:57.690> much<00:00:57.869> it<00:00:58.080> just<00:00:58.199> takes<00:00:58.470> a<00:00:58.559> beating

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
doesn't do much it just takes a beating

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.310 
doesn't do much it just takes a beating
and<00:00:59.330> it's<00:01:00.330> very<00:01:00.479> good<00:01:00.659> at<00:01:00.809> taking<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.170> beating

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
and it's very good at taking a beating

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.229 
and it's very good at taking a beating
and<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:01.890> an<00:01:01.979> essential<00:01:02.250> part<00:01:02.790> of<00:01:02.940> dark

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
so Giants are an essential part of a

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.070 
so Giants are an essential part of a
very<00:03:58.019> important<00:03:58.560> farming<00:03:58.950> strategy<00:03:59.100> which<00:03:59.549> is

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
very important farming strategy which is

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.030 
very important farming strategy which is
farming<00:04:01.080> for<00:04:01.230> darker<00:04:01.530> links<00:04:01.739> here<00:04:01.830> when<00:04:01.980> you

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
farming for darker links here when you

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.130 
farming for darker links here when you
want<00:04:02.190> to<00:04:02.250> get<00:04:02.370> right<00:04:02.580> into<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:03.150> core<00:04:03.450> so

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
want to get right into the core so

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.600 
want to get right into the core so
there's<00:04:04.890> a<00:04:04.950> public<00:04:05.310> service<00:04:05.580> announcement

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
there's a public service announcement

on<00:04:08.280> Giants<00:04:08.670> they're<00:04:08.820> not<00:04:08.940> actually<00:04:09.420> that<00:04:09.570> bad

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
on Giants they're not actually that bad

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
so if you want to get into the core

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.620

middle
jumping<00:05:54.870> back<00:05:54.990> down<00:05:56.630> Joe<00:05:57.630> I<00:05:57.810> just<00:05:57.960> used<00:05:58.199> it

jumping back down Joe I just used it

00:05:58.349 --> 00:05:59.649 
jumping back down Joe I just used it
because<00:05:58.409> I<00:05:58.590> had<00:05:58.800> it<00:05:58.979> covered

00:05:59.649 --> 00:05:59.659 
because I had it covered

because I had it covered
let's<00:06:00.659> get<00:06:00.750> those<00:06:00.900> defense<00:06:01.320> in<00:06:01.590> there<00:06:01.800> let's

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
let's get those defense in there let's

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.409 
let's get those defense in there let's
see<00:06:02.520> if<00:06:02.580> we<00:06:02.639> could<00:06:02.760> take<00:06:02.849> out<00:06:03.030> that<00:06:03.150> wall<00:06:03.270> so

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
see if we could take out that wall so

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:04.790 
see if we could take out that wall so
it's<00:06:03.570> not<00:06:03.659> actually<00:06:03.990> much<00:06:04.169> left<00:06:04.409> so<00:06:04.500> I<00:06:04.590> think<00:06:04.680> I

on<00:06:26.460> a<00:06:26.490> giant<00:06:26.760> I<00:06:27.030> used<00:06:27.449> to<00:06:27.599> use<00:06:27.720> Giants<00:06:28.020> a<00:06:28.050> lot

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:28.229 
on a giant I used to use Giants a lot

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:31.339 
on a giant I used to use Giants a lot
when<00:06:28.440> I<00:06:28.470> was<00:06:29.599> when<00:06:30.599> I<00:06:30.659> starting<00:06:31.080> out<00:06:31.229> the

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:31.349 
when I was when I starting out the

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.260 
when I was when I starting out the
problem<00:06:31.620> was<00:06:31.710> when<00:06:32.400> we<00:06:32.490> started<00:06:32.760> that<00:06:32.849> farming

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
problem was when we started that farming

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.640 
problem was when we started that farming
we<00:06:33.360> didn't<00:06:33.630> realize<00:06:33.900> that<00:06:33.930> efficiency<00:06:34.500> is

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
we didn't realize that efficiency is

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.860 
we didn't realize that efficiency is
more<00:06:34.949> important<00:06:35.370> than<00:06:35.430> the<00:06:35.550> odd<00:06:35.669> big<00:06:35.940> raid<00:06:36.240> so

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870 
more important than the odd big raid so

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.500 
more important than the odd big raid so
obviously<00:06:37.710> Giants<00:06:38.250> you're<00:06:38.520> gonna<00:06:38.639> have<00:06:39.449> a

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.510 
obviously Giants you're gonna have a

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.860 
obviously Giants you're gonna have a
better<00:06:39.659> rating<00:06:40.169> rater<00:06:40.710> for<00:06:40.889> things<00:06:41.099> but<00:06:41.870> it

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870 
better rating rater for things but it

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.600 
better rating rater for things but it
was<00:06:43.020> a<00:06:43.050> longer<00:06:43.320> bill<00:06:43.620> toast<00:06:43.889> you<00:06:44.280> know<00:06:44.340> two

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:44.610 
was a longer bill toast you know two

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.490 
was a longer bill toast you know two
minutes<00:06:44.909> see<00:06:45.210> how<00:06:45.330> they<00:06:45.479> just<00:06:45.630> appear

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 
minutes see how they just appear

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.230 
minutes see how they just appear
underneath<00:06:46.770> that<00:06:47.099> wall<00:06:47.310> there's<00:06:47.610> strange

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 
underneath that wall there's strange

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.950 
underneath that wall there's strange
graphical

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
graphical

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.430 
graphical
right<00:06:49.319> so<00:06:50.190> yeah<00:06:50.699> a<00:06:50.970> giant<00:06:51.210> judge<00:06:51.870> great<00:06:52.199> but

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
right so yeah a giant judge great but

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.779 
right so yeah a giant judge great but
the<00:06:52.530> build<00:06:52.710> time<00:06:52.919> of<00:06:53.069> two<00:06:53.220> minutes<00:06:53.250> is<00:06:53.610> too

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:53.789 
the build time of two minutes is too

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:56.749 
the build time of two minutes is too
long<00:06:53.819> as<00:06:54.120> it<00:06:54.210> takes<00:06:54.650> an<00:06:55.650> hour<00:06:55.800> 48<00:06:56.220> joints<00:06:56.639> and

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:56.759 
long as it takes an hour 48 joints and

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:58.790 
long as it takes an hour 48 joints and
camps<00:06:57.270> two<00:06:57.539> minutes<00:06:57.870> to<00:06:57.990> build<00:06:58.169> each<00:06:58.349> you<00:06:58.740> know

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 
camps two minutes to build each you know

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.700 
camps two minutes to build each you know
so<00:06:59.039> it's<00:06:59.759> adding<00:06:59.880> a<00:07:00.240> lot<00:07:00.599> more<00:07:00.630> now<00:07:01.440> we<00:07:01.500> use

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710 
so it's adding a lot more now we use

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.260 
so it's adding a lot more now we use
barbarians<00:07:02.310> as<00:07:02.430> tanks<00:07:02.759> and<00:07:02.880> it's<00:07:02.970> a<00:07:03.030> lot<00:07:03.150> more

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.270 
barbarians as tanks and it's a lot more

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.830 
barbarians as tanks and it's a lot more
efficient<00:07:03.720> phases<00:07:04.620> in<00:07:04.770> twenty<00:07:05.130> second<00:07:05.400> bill

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840 
efficient phases in twenty second bill

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.249 
efficient phases in twenty second bill
come<00:07:06.840> on<00:07:06.930> Giants<00:07:07.229> you<00:07:07.349> can<00:07:07.440> do<00:07:07.560> it<00:07:07.830> I<00:07:07.910> do<00:07:08.910> like

00:07:09.249 --> 00:07:09.259 
come on Giants you can do it I do like

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:12.379 
come on Giants you can do it I do like
it's<00:07:10.259> too<00:07:10.680> slow<00:07:10.979> like<00:07:11.729> old<00:07:11.910> men<00:07:12.120> walking

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:12.389 
it's too slow like old men walking

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:21.200 
it's too slow like old men walking
through<00:07:12.690> the<00:07:12.780> park<00:07:18.620> anyway<00:07:19.620> so<00:07:20.069> yeah<00:07:20.729> this<00:07:20.880> is

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.210 
through the park anyway so yeah this is

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.640 
through the park anyway so yeah this is
not<00:07:21.389> the<00:07:21.509> most<00:07:21.660> exciting<00:07:21.990> lonely<00:07:22.470> troop

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:22.650 
not the most exciting lonely troop

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.050 
not the most exciting lonely troop
series<00:07:22.979> don't<00:07:23.430> worry<00:07:23.550> they're<00:07:23.699> not<00:07:23.820> all<00:07:23.910> like

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.060 
series don't worry they're not all like

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.140 
series don't worry they're not all like
this<00:07:25.250> of<00:07:26.250> course<00:07:26.520> because<00:07:26.880> we're<00:07:27.030> using

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.150 
this of course because we're using

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.810 
this of course because we're using
different<00:07:27.509> troops

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:28.820 
different troops

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.510 
different troops
