00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
like why wait why didn't this work I

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.740 
like why wait why didn't this work I
must<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.159> missed<00:01:17.400> something<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.119> did<00:01:18.479> and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
must have missed something and I did and

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.390 
must have missed something and I did and
here's<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.259> correct<00:01:20.299> the<00:01:21.299> correct<00:01:22.220> answer<00:01:23.220> I

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
here's the correct the correct answer I

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.990 
here's the correct the correct answer I
guess

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
guess

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.630 
guess
so<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:24.659> snake<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.680> then<00:01:26.130> there's<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.460> one

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
so it's snake and then there's this one

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.399 
so it's snake and then there's this one
up<00:01:26.790> here<00:01:26.820> that's<00:01:27.150> missing<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.229> snake

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
up here that's missing so this snake

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.410 
up here that's missing so this snake
must<00:01:29.009> have<00:01:29.189> fallen<00:01:29.400> out<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.850> here<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.270> it's

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
must have fallen out of here so it's

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.469 
must have fallen out of here so it's
snake<00:01:30.780> snake<00:01:31.400> dolphin<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.909> correct
