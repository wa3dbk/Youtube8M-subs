00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
but I don't think it'll work you just

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.399 
but I don't think it'll work you just
kind<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.810> figure<00:01:06.960> out<00:01:07.200> for<00:01:07.380> yourself

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
kind of have to figure out for yourself

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.170 
kind of have to figure out for yourself
but<00:01:07.799> you're<00:01:07.950> after<00:01:08.070> trial<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.549> error<00:01:08.670> you'll

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
but you're after trial and error you'll

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.109 
but you're after trial and error you'll
eventually<00:01:09.420> get<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.890> point<00:01:11.100> where<00:01:11.790> it

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
eventually get it to the point where it

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.140 
eventually get it to the point where it
actually<00:01:12.570> will<00:01:13.290> turn<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.580> itself<00:01:14.880> and

Samantha will say there nuts I'm not
entirely<00:01:17.159> sure<00:01:17.310> Samantha<00:01:17.520> doesn't<00:01:17.850> always

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
entirely sure Samantha doesn't always

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.370 
entirely sure Samantha doesn't always
say<00:01:18.090> something<00:01:18.390> but<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.720> entire<00:01:19.049> thing<00:01:19.080> will

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
say something but the entire thing will

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.289 
say something but the entire thing will
go<00:01:19.680> into<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> ceiling<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.700> centerpiece<00:01:21.150> will

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
go into the ceiling the centerpiece will

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.340 
go into the ceiling the centerpiece will
come<00:01:21.450> out<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.780> you'll<00:01:21.900> know<00:01:22.110> you'll<00:01:22.290> have

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
come out and you'll know you'll have

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.859 
come out and you'll know you'll have
completed<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.610> once<00:01:24.240> again<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.479> just<00:01:24.720> keep

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
completed it so once again you just keep

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.510 
completed it so once again you just keep
playing<00:01:25.200> with<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.619> I'm<00:01:26.009> showing<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
playing with it I'm showing you the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.800 
playing with it I'm showing you the
entire<00:01:26.790> process<00:01:27.030> just<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.630> know

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
entire process just so you know

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.300 
entire process just so you know
approximately<00:01:28.500> how<00:01:28.530> long<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.890> takes<00:01:29.070> takes

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
approximately how long it takes takes

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.800 
approximately how long it takes takes
about<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.490> minute<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.850> 30<00:01:30.060> seconds<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.600> do<00:01:30.780> it

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
about a minute and 30 seconds to do it

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.230 
about a minute and 30 seconds to do it
so<00:01:31.740> not<00:01:31.920> too<00:01:32.340> long<00:01:32.490> but<00:01:32.700> right<00:01:32.850> there<00:01:33.000> as<00:01:33.119> you

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
so not too long but right there as you

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.850 
so not too long but right there as you
can<00:01:33.390> see<00:01:33.540> we<00:01:33.689> got<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.930> final<00:01:34.200> step<00:01:34.350> into<00:01:34.590> place

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
can see we got the final step into place

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.340 
can see we got the final step into place
and<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:36.000> three<00:01:36.270> they<00:01:36.479> all<00:01:36.630> rotating<00:01:37.020> that

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
and the three they all rotating that

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.840 
and the three they all rotating that
pops<00:01:37.650> out<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.070> know<00:01:38.189> you've<00:01:38.340> gotten<00:01:38.610> step

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
pops out and you know you've gotten step

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.060 
pops out and you know you've gotten step
one<00:01:39.060> complete<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.290> order<00:01:40.380> for<00:01:40.500> step<00:01:40.740> two

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
one complete so in order for step two

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.550 
one complete so in order for step two
it's<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.520> little<00:01:42.060> bit<00:01:42.240> step<00:01:43.170> choose<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> little

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
it's a little bit step choose a little

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.080 
it's a little bit step choose a little
bit<00:01:43.680> more<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.250> trying<00:01:44.700> thing<00:01:44.850> because

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
bit more of a trying thing because

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.660 
bit more of a trying thing because
you're<00:01:46.049> not<00:01:46.170> entirely<00:01:46.439> sure<00:01:46.590> if<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.280> hit<00:01:47.490> them

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
you're not entirely sure if you hit them

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.069 
you're not entirely sure if you hit them
it's<00:01:47.850> kind<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.119> like<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.299> how<00:01:48.810> would<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:48.990> know

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
it's kind of like a how would you know

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.929 
it's kind of like a how would you know
to<00:01:49.229> do<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:49.619> type<00:01:49.829> deal<00:01:50.070> it's<00:01:50.280> it's<00:01:50.729> really

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
to do this type deal it's it's really

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.370 
to do this type deal it's it's really
really<00:01:51.299> weird<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.630> we<00:01:51.750> had<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.960> try<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.140> ton<00:01:52.350> of

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
really weird and we had to try a ton of

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.420 
really weird and we had to try a ton of
different<00:01:52.530> things<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.860> figure<00:01:53.009> out<00:01:53.159> but

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
different things to figure out but

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.740 
different things to figure out but
anyways<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.119> what<00:01:54.210> you're<00:01:54.329> gonna<00:01:54.390> want<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.630> do

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
top of where we were in the wind tunnel

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.639 
top of where we were in the wind tunnel
area<00:01:57.930> but<00:01:58.110> you're<00:01:58.200> gonna<00:01:58.290> want<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.530> go<00:01:58.590> to

my friend shoots one right there there's

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.479 
my friend shoots one right there there's
one<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.619> second<00:02:07.920> one<00:02:07.950> I'm<00:02:08.129> going<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.310> show<00:02:08.429> you

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
one the second one I'm going to show you

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.040 
one the second one I'm going to show you
the<00:02:08.640> path<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.209> guys<00:02:09.360> can<00:02:09.479> follow<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.869> case

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
the path so you guys can follow in case

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.630 
the path so you guys can follow in case
you<00:02:10.140> don't<00:02:10.289> know<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.500> map<00:02:10.649> very<00:02:10.890> well<00:02:11.069> but<00:02:11.520> the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
you don't know the map very well but the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.620 
you don't know the map very well but the
second<00:02:12.000> one<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.120> essentially<00:02:12.989> right

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
second one is essentially right

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.540 
second one is essentially right
behind<00:02:14.020> a<00:02:14.200> pack<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.440> punch<00:02:14.740> over<00:02:15.010> by<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.160> church

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
behind a pack a punch over by the church

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.700 
behind a pack a punch over by the church
in<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.450> graveyard<00:02:16.870> now<00:02:17.170> this<00:02:17.290> one<00:02:17.440> isn't<00:02:17.620> that

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
in the graveyard now this one isn't that

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.420 
in the graveyard now this one isn't that
difficult<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.280> find<00:02:18.610> either<00:02:18.880> but<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:21.310> know

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
difficult to find either but you know

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.980 
difficult to find either but you know
I'm<00:02:22.150> just<00:02:22.180> gonna<00:02:22.390> show<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.690> entire<00:02:22.810> area

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
I'm just gonna show you the entire area

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.780 
I'm just gonna show you the entire area
like<00:02:23.740> how<00:02:23.890> we<00:02:23.950> got<00:02:24.190> there<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.430> stuff<00:02:24.610> so<00:02:24.700> you

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
like how we got there and stuff so you

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.770 
like how we got there and stuff so you
guys<00:02:24.880> can<00:02:25.030> tell<00:02:25.180> but<00:02:25.210> this<00:02:25.450> one<00:02:25.570> is<00:02:25.660> definitely

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
guys can tell but this one is definitely

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.450 
guys can tell but this one is definitely
the<00:02:26.080> hardest<00:02:26.200> one<00:02:26.500> because<00:02:27.070> it<00:02:27.190> doesn't

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
the hardest one because it doesn't

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.060 
the hardest one because it doesn't
always<00:02:27.670> activate<00:02:28.570> when<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:28.900> shoot<00:02:29.140> it<00:02:29.260> so<00:02:29.500> my

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
always activate when you shoot it so my

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.370 
always activate when you shoot it so my
friend<00:02:30.310> jump<00:02:30.550> shoot<00:02:30.700> sit<00:02:30.880> right<00:02:31.030> here<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.420> it

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
friend jump shoot sit right here and it

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.200 
friend jump shoot sit right here and it
doesn't<00:02:32.800> actually<00:02:32.980> activate<00:02:33.880> it<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:34.060> don't

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
doesn't actually activate it you don't

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.400 
doesn't actually activate it you don't
really<00:02:34.390> know<00:02:34.600> when<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.900> activate<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:35.260> we
