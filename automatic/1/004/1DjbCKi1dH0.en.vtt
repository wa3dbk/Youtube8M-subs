why<00:05:43.430> I<00:05:43.460> would<00:05:43.760> encourage<00:05:44.300> people<00:05:44.539> to<00:05:44.720> be<00:05:45.340> short

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
about where they stand I think we'll

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.560 
about where they stand I think we'll
talk<00:05:48.530> about<00:05:48.650> the<00:05:48.889> signs<00:05:49.130> next<00:05:49.430> time<00:05:49.700> but<00:05:49.970> make

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
talk about the signs next time but make

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.460 
talk about the signs next time but make
sure<00:05:50.599> that<00:05:51.349> you<00:05:51.979> are<00:05:52.220> absolutely<00:05:53.090> aware<00:05:53.570> that

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
sure that you are absolutely aware that

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.379 
sure that you are absolutely aware that
there<00:05:55.160> is<00:05:55.190> a<00:05:55.310> lot<00:05:55.550> of<00:05:55.639> meaning<00:05:55.910> attached<00:05:56.180> to

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
there is a lot of meaning attached to

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.600 
there is a lot of meaning attached to
saying<00:05:56.599> that<00:05:56.840> and<00:05:57.050> so<00:05:57.979> think<00:05:58.250> about<00:05:58.340> it

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
saying that and so think about it

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.240 
saying that and so think about it
carefully<00:05:58.880> and<00:05:59.870> do<00:06:00.169> it<00:06:00.320> later<00:06:00.620> rather<00:06:01.099> than

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
carefully and do it later rather than

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.939 
carefully and do it later rather than
earlier<00:06:01.460> on<00:06:02.020> because<00:06:03.020> if<00:06:03.410> someone<00:06:03.680> doesn't

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:03.949 
earlier on because if someone doesn't

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:04.930 
earlier on because if someone doesn't
have<00:06:03.979> those<00:06:04.160> same<00:06:04.400> feelings

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940
