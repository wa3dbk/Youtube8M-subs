00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.730
 these two shirts look identical in 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.039
 actually I don't know this and a shirt 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.960
 entirely made this machine and one 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.970
 santillo shirt processing times 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.070
 of these two shirts are staggering 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.519
 to make a shirt machine I am 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.800
 it takes only seven minutes to make one 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.749
 shirt entirely hand cut that 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.790
 is replied by hand well needed 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:34.930
 two and a half hours of work 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.320
 specialized craftsman 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.270
 what makes a santillo shirt special 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.000
 We separate the tissue cut a 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.730
 a neck is connected to the English side 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.269
 hand cut and 3 hand rivets 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.829
 in the armhole that the most critical part 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.989
 of the shirt 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.899
 the button attached by hand with seam 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.679
 called lily and the fly though 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.679
 attacked mom 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.010
 we have designed five shirt models 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.040
 think for the contemporary gentleman 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.560
 in fabrics ranging from denim to cotton 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.680
 cashmere with pure mother buttons 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.100
 for the Australian this is the same as in 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.580
 cashmere is taking care of the base 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.119
 of the cut entirely made by hand 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.920
 this is the behind every shirt of the 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:27.590
 collection will follow this process 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.570
 processing or cutting entirely 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.869
 the newspaper this is the difference between 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.830
 the package is the tailoring or the 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.830
 charm of imperfection 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.640
 this is the basis we believe 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.910
 fundamental in the construction of the 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.979
 shirt or the armhole 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.560
 entirely by hand with the 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.590
 our exclusive point a boat yes 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.810
 differentiates from the machine data point 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.140
 because it is a dry spot while this is 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.890
 a point that allows greater 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.280
 cushioning is greater 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.229
 elasticity has fallen on the shoulder and in the 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.750
 around missing every our button is 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.239
 attached to the hand with which we care officer 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.930
 Lily differs from the button 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:16.120
 attached to machine for value e 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:20.020
 resistance for this reason a button 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.550
 sewn by us it will never fall this 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.040
 capsule collection is called slow 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.890
 tailoring and born from the need to unite 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.350
 the convenience of ready in Italy with the 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.860
 charm of the handmade is thought of as 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.810
 a response a young response 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.709
 to the excess of products that do not last 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.230
 more than one season 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.200
 therefore we propose to rediscover 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.980
 to man the pleasure of owning a garment 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.980
 For all life 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.800
 I decided to launch 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.300
 this project with wow crisis why 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.310
 we share a passion for 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.050
 excellence and for the handmade in 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.420
 italy with this collection we have 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.569
 decided to combine my concept of 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.520
 masculine elegance with competence 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.870
 fifty-year workshop 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.220
 shirt craft and three 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.020
 generations slow tailoring wants to make 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.060
 the entirely handmade product 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.739
