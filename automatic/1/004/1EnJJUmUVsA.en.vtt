00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 no no 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.910
 or not 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.600
 hello hello limit accompanies you in the 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.850
 presentation of our new 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.310
 construction that as we had already 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.310
 advanced continues with the theme of the 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.700
 one piece series is about the trilero 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.470
 bark 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.750
 that for those who do not know it or not 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.059
 know what I'm talking about 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.770
 ceases to be an island within a ship 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.620
 imagine you so you can do a 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:45.190
 little more the idea a huge ship 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.570
 enormously large in which in one of 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.050
 its laterals there is a gate 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.500
 that, so to speak , eat others 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.830
 ships and gives them access to an island that 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.739
 there is inside it's worth then I'm going 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.620
 to teach a little bit what we have 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.659
 up to the moment in fact 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.329
 Y 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.090
 what will be the starting point 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:13.210
 a series of videos that we are going to go 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.149
 going up where you are going to see the 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.090
 development of this project is good 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:21.819
 let's start with the visit that 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.099
 weigh here at the bottom of wood it would be 

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:26.619
 the hull of the ship the hull of the ship 

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:29.349
 with its gate that would swallow a 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:33.250
 boat you could not imagine and the boat would arrive 

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:35.530
 so far this is the wall that makes 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:40.030
 of containment to the island 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.850
 and we would go down a little bit to see 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.590
 the island not the island we have thus planet 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.390
 because then it will be more comfortable for 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.200
 work on it throw first ones 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.159
 rows of cubes and from here 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.290
 well to be able to lift what has been 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:00.380
 the rest of the project not good 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.080
 over here there are for those who do not know 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.800
 nothing of all this because it is as if it were 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.300
 a graveyard with zombies and so everything very 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.160
 because the owner of the island good 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.330
 Well, it's a doctor who is a bit of the 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.440
 lost head and asks for more 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.660
 Let's see 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.710
 we keep going up this would be the mansion 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.040
 of said doctor 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.880
 and what you see here in the center is the 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.720
 mast 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.300
 that holds the boat is worth what there is 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.390
 here 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:39.140
 Of course, this is much higher 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.080
 which has candle and so on then good 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.560
 for the moment this as I say is the 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.310
 point 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.220
 and nothing we expect you to do to us 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.160
 comments suggestions 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.349
 if you have information about details that 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.010
 they may have to have this 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:04.090
 project because we will be super happy 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:09.390
 of reading and you can not pass that 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:12.430
 information so to do it the most 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.079
 the most beautiful possible not and the image 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.060
 that fits more to what we had 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.680
 we thought because right now 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.250
 inside we are going to invent a 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.930
 little how are the rooms and others 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.719
 because this inside is a labyrinth 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.989
 on the outside we have the odd 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:31.329
 problem because the construction has 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.739
 parts that are diagonally and by 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.870
 limitations that we have in the game 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.909
 there are things that we can not carry 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.099
 out and good 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:42.239
 these are I am teaching you a little bit 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:45.430
 the things that are already done and raised 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.800
 and this is a nice place to say goodbye 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.910
 the video 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.910
 so, as I say, we are waiting for you 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.630
 comments and information suggestions 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.800
 about the project 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.480
 and you are interested and you like it 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.930
 continue watching subscribe to the channel 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.770
 because we will upload more videos about 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.530
 the development of this project 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:15.090
 and without winding me up I say goodbye with a 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.090
 saludito and until the next video
