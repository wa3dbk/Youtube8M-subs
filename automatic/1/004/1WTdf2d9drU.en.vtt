00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
literally this second minecraft realms

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.570 
literally this second minecraft realms
has<00:00:09.900> been<00:00:10.050> released<00:00:10.260> in<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.410> UK<00:00:10.650> so<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.460> think

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
has been released in the UK so I think

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.209

at the moment realms only available in
three<00:00:14.370> countries<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:14.910> think<00:00:14.940> Sweden<00:00:15.570> was<00:00:15.690> the

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
three countries I think Sweden was the

evade evade available in the future but
for<00:01:34.590> now<00:01:34.740> obviously<00:01:35.250> here<00:01:35.729> anyway<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.180> realms

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
for now obviously here anyway so realms

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.289 
for now obviously here anyway so realms
if<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:37.680> read<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.220> web<00:01:38.430> page<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:39.030> chose

if you just read the web page you chose

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.140 
if you just read the web page you chose
you<00:01:40.009> it's<00:01:41.009> literally<00:01:41.490> easy<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.909> use<00:01:42.030> you'd

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
you it's literally easy to use you'd

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.200 
you it's literally easy to use you'd
have<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.390> mess<00:01:42.540> about<00:01:42.659> with<00:01:43.159> ports<00:01:44.159> or<00:01:44.369> making

have to mess about with ports or making

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.940 
have to mess about with ports or making
your<00:01:45.329> own<00:01:45.360> stuff<00:01:45.840> like<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.320> says<00:01:46.500> anyway

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
your own stuff like that it says anyway

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.010 
your own stuff like that it says anyway
but<00:01:47.939> anyway<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.329> once<00:01:48.479> you've<00:01:48.570> done<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.750> you've

gone through the process of buying
anything

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
anything

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
you can either I think you click on it

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.760 
you can either I think you click on it
you<00:01:52.920> either<00:01:53.100> get<00:01:53.750> to<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:55.200> you've<00:01:55.409> got<00:01:55.560> two

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
you either get to that you've got two

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.039 
you either get to that you've got two
ways<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.280> doing<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.579> can<00:01:56.729> hear<00:01:56.820> by

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
ways of doing it you can hear by

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.280

30-60-90

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.120 
30-60-90
like<00:01:58.890> day<00:02:00.350> subscription<00:02:01.350> should<00:02:01.649> we<00:02:01.710> say<00:02:01.890> and

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
like day subscription should we say and

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.160 
like day subscription should we say and
that<00:02:02.520> pays<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> pound<00:02:03.689> per<00:02:03.840> month<00:02:04.049> for

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
that pays like the a pound per month for

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.899 
that pays like the a pound per month for
that<00:02:04.350> or<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.979> could<00:02:05.130> do<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.280> for<00:02:05.520> 30<00:02:05.759> days

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
that or you could do it for 30 days

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.150 
that or you could do it for 30 days
reoccurring<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.170> think<00:02:07.380> that's<00:02:07.530> 20%<00:02:08.039> off

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
reoccurring and I think that's 20% off

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.609 
reoccurring and I think that's 20% off
at<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.580> moment<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.959> obviously<00:02:10.259> as<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.590> can

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619

to<00:02:19.080> create<00:02:19.350> realms<00:02:19.830> now<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.670> really<00:02:21.090> quickly

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
to create realms now I really quickly

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.090 
to create realms now I really quickly
just<00:02:21.960> before<00:02:22.200> starting<00:02:22.440> this<00:02:22.500> video<00:02:22.770> like

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
just before starting this video like

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.350 
just before starting this video like
messed<00:02:23.340> around<00:02:23.460> with<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:24.270> obviously

messed around with it and obviously
crate<00:02:24.960> realm<00:02:25.200> I'm<00:02:25.470> guessing<00:02:25.800> this<00:02:25.860> is<00:02:25.920> kind<00:02:26.220> of

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
crate realm I'm guessing this is kind of

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.370 
crate realm I'm guessing this is kind of
like<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.610> way<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.330> putting<00:02:27.570> in<00:02:27.660> your<00:02:27.900> name<00:02:28.170> I

you're doing that I'll see you can click
to<00:02:39.210> create<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.750> realm<00:02:40.080> click<00:02:40.920> right<00:02:41.130> there<00:02:41.160> and

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
to create a realm click right there and

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.860 
to create a realm click right there and
then<00:02:41.670> you've<00:02:41.760> got<00:02:41.880> select<00:02:42.180> template<00:02:42.600> and<00:02:42.810> at

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
then you've got select template and at

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.960 
then you've got select template and at
the<00:02:42.990> moment<00:02:43.140> there's<00:02:43.530> only<00:02:43.560> two<00:02:43.860> templates<00:02:44.310> so

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
the moment there's only two templates so

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.280 
the moment there's only two templates so
there's<00:02:45.120> Hera<00:02:45.330> brains<00:02:45.540> return<00:02:45.900> at<00:02:46.080> suburban

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
there's Hera brains return at suburban

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.260 
there's Hera brains return at suburban
caves<00:02:46.740> now<00:02:47.310> I'm<00:02:47.460> guessing<00:02:47.730> these<00:02:47.940> realm

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
caves now I'm guessing these realm

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.070 
caves now I'm guessing these realm
templates<00:02:48.750> are<00:02:48.960> the<00:02:49.800> Reaver<00:02:49.980> kind<00:02:50.460> of<00:02:50.580> like

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
templates are the Reaver kind of like

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.270 
templates are the Reaver kind of like
off<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.230> top<00:02:52.380> my<00:02:52.500> head<00:02:52.530> it's<00:02:52.860> either<00:02:53.070> going<00:02:53.220> to

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
off the top my head it's either going to

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.310 
off the top my head it's either going to
be<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.400> specific<00:02:53.820> map<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.210> you<00:02:54.270> can<00:02:54.300> play<00:02:54.570> or

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
be a specific map that you can play or

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.430 
be a specific map that you can play or
it's<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.400> certain<00:02:56.640> way<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:57.300> generation<00:02:58.230> I

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
it's a certain way of a generation I

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.560 
it's a certain way of a generation I
don't<00:02:58.710> know<00:02:59.100> but<00:02:59.880> I<00:02:59.910> mean<00:03:00.060> we'll<00:03:00.300> get<00:03:00.420> for
