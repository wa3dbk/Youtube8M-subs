hello<00:00:04.050> ah<00:00:06.080> this<00:00:07.080> map<00:00:07.350> I'm<00:00:08.340> sure<00:00:08.639> you<00:00:08.790> all<00:00:09.000> know

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
hello ah this map I'm sure you all know

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.690 
hello ah this map I'm sure you all know
that<00:00:09.540> if<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:10.080> world<00:00:10.320> gets<00:00:10.799> two<00:00:11.160> degrees

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
that if the world gets two degrees

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.379 
that if the world gets two degrees
hotter<00:00:12.360> than<00:00:12.809> it<00:00:12.990> was<00:00:13.200> in<00:00:13.519> 1800<00:00:14.519> which<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.240> the

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
hotter than it was in 1800 which is the

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.150 
hotter than it was in 1800 which is the
time<00:00:15.660> around<00:00:15.990> that<00:00:16.320> Industrial<00:00:17.009> Revolution

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
time around that Industrial Revolution

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.180 
time around that Industrial Revolution
started<00:00:18.060> if<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.900> gets<00:00:19.109> two<00:00:19.410> degrees<00:00:19.859> hotter

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.190 
started if it gets two degrees hotter

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.939 
started if it gets two degrees hotter
than<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.640> was<00:00:20.820> in<00:00:21.000> 1800<00:00:21.779> we're<00:00:21.990> nearly<00:00:22.260> there

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
than it was in 1800 we're nearly there

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.920 
than it was in 1800 we're nearly there
some<00:00:23.369> people<00:00:23.730> think<00:00:23.880> we've<00:00:24.119> passed<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.720> and

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
some people think we've passed it and

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.120 
some people think we've passed it and
it's<00:00:25.080> too<00:00:25.350> late

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
it's too late

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.220 
it's too late
but<00:00:26.910> then<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:28.080> earth<00:00:28.550> goes<00:00:29.550> even<00:00:30.330> hotter<00:00:30.689> you

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
but then the earth goes even hotter you

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.650 
but then the earth goes even hotter you
cannot<00:00:31.650> stop<00:00:32.010> it<00:00:32.040> going<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.730> five<00:00:32.970> degrees

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
cannot stop it going to five degrees

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.650 
cannot stop it going to five degrees
because<00:00:34.620> everything<00:00:35.219> kicks<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.880> all<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
because everything kicks in all the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.139 
because everything kicks in all the
methane<00:00:37.170> gets<00:00:37.440> activated<00:00:38.190> all<00:00:38.700> these<00:00:38.880> things

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
methane gets activated all these things

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.660 
methane gets activated all these things
you<00:00:39.270> can't<00:00:39.570> stop<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.940> the<00:00:41.940> world<00:00:42.180> will

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
you can't stop it and the world will

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.380 
you can't stop it and the world will
reach<00:00:44.670> its<00:00:44.940> equilibrium<00:00:46.550> five<00:00:47.550> degrees<00:00:48.059> and

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
reach its equilibrium five degrees and

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.459 
reach its equilibrium five degrees and
it<00:00:48.480> will<00:00:48.660> stop<00:00:49.309> around<00:00:50.309> then<00:00:50.760> all<00:00:51.690> that's<00:00:52.140> read

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
it will stop around then all that's read

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.720 
it will stop around then all that's read
is<00:00:53.149> uninhabitable<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:55.010> this<00:00:56.010> can<00:00:56.309> happen

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
is uninhabitable and this can happen

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.590 
is uninhabitable and this can happen
within<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.180> generation<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:59.270> got<00:01:00.270> really

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
within a generation and I got really

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.500 
within a generation and I got really
scared<00:01:00.840> about<00:01:01.739> six<00:01:02.219> years<00:01:02.550> ago<00:01:02.789> when<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
scared about six years ago when the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.680 
scared about six years ago when the
famous<00:01:03.780> scientist<00:01:04.770> James<00:01:05.670> Lovelock<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.539> an

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
famous scientist James Lovelock in an

famous scientist James Lovelock in an
interview<00:01:07.470> he<00:01:07.740> said<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.040> by<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.490> end<00:01:08.790> of

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
interview he said that by the end of

interview he said that by the end of
this<00:01:09.210> century<00:01:09.560> his<00:01:10.560> guess<00:01:10.890> was<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.640> there

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
this century his guess was that there

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.190 
this century his guess was that there
would<00:01:11.880> only<00:01:11.939> be<00:01:12.360> 1<00:01:12.990> billion<00:01:13.380> people<00:01:13.890> left<00:01:15.200> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
would only be 1 billion people left the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.219 
would only be 1 billion people left the
earth<00:01:16.369> will<00:01:17.369> survive<00:01:17.509> in<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:19.380> poor<00:01:19.920> state

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
earth will survive in this poor state

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.620 
earth will survive in this poor state
but<00:01:22.229> there<00:01:23.130> will<00:01:23.220> be<00:01:23.280> mass<00:01:23.610> extinction<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
but there will be mass extinction of the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.190 
but there will be mass extinction of the
human<00:01:24.810> race<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:26.600> it<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.840> happen<00:01:28.170> very

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
human race and it can happen very

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.090 
human race and it can happen very
quickly

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
quickly

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.670 
quickly
we<00:01:29.549> might<00:01:29.759> not<00:01:29.970> be<00:01:30.030> able<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.479> prevent<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.200> even

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
we might not be able to prevent it even

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.960 
we might not be able to prevent it even
at<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:31.979> time<00:01:32.150> but<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.920> am<00:01:34.920> one<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.729> people

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:43.499 
if you know this basic thing you can
work<00:04:41.020> out<00:04:41.349> everything<00:04:41.979> you<00:04:42.639> can<00:04:42.879> understand

the<00:04:43.689> austerity<00:04:44.289> for<00:04:44.800> example<00:04:45.370> in<00:04:45.490> England<00:04:46.090> is

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
the austerity for example in England is

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.040 
the austerity for example in England is
just<00:04:46.719> a<00:04:47.409> trick<00:04:48.009> to<00:04:48.340> help<00:04:48.969> this<00:04:49.330> thing<00:04:49.389> the<00:04:49.840> long

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
just a trick to help this thing the long

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.529 
just a trick to help this thing the long
and<00:04:50.500> disguise<00:04:51.159> it<00:04:51.460> a<00:04:51.490> bit<00:04:51.789> so<00:04:52.000> they<00:04:52.120> don't<00:04:52.360> have

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539 
and disguise it a bit so they don't have

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:55.200 
and disguise it a bit so they don't have
to<00:04:52.719> print<00:04:52.930> money<00:04:53.379> too<00:04:53.740> much<00:04:54.069> and<00:04:54.400> they<00:04:54.729> can<00:04:54.909> you

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
to print money too much and they can you

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.939 
to print money too much and they can you
know<00:04:55.240> it's<00:04:55.599> just<00:04:55.870> all<00:04:56.139> part<00:04:56.169> of<00:04:56.620> it<00:04:56.740> it's

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:04.689 
what can we do I thought if I've got a

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:07.439 
what can we do I thought if I've got a
minute<00:05:05.020> left<00:05:05.139> I<00:05:05.529> could<00:05:05.830> just<00:05:06.550> explain<00:05:07.120> the

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.449 
minute left I could just explain the

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.890 
minute left I could just explain the
Gaia<00:05:07.689> theory<00:05:08.229> to<00:05:08.710> you<00:05:08.979> the<00:05:09.879> Gaia<00:05:10.089> theory<00:05:10.479> is

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
Gaia theory to you the Gaia theory is

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.519 
Gaia theory to you the Gaia theory is
the<00:05:11.469> theory<00:05:12.009> of<00:05:12.189> this<00:05:12.430> man<00:05:12.699> James<00:05:13.029> Lovelock

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:13.529 
the theory of this man James Lovelock

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:18.869 
the theory of this man James Lovelock
Gaia<00:05:14.529> is<00:05:14.889> the<00:05:15.689> first<00:05:16.689> name<00:05:17.050> they<00:05:17.439> gave<00:05:17.680> to<00:05:17.879> the

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:18.879 
Gaia is the first name they gave to the

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:20.640 
Gaia is the first name they gave to the
mother<00:05:19.120> earth<00:05:19.419> in<00:05:19.930> Greece

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
mother earth in Greece

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.279 
mother earth in Greece
her<00:05:20.919> name<00:05:21.129> was<00:05:21.430> Gaia<00:05:21.759> that's<00:05:22.629> why<00:05:22.839> he<00:05:22.990> called

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
her name was Gaia that's why he called

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.740 
her name was Gaia that's why he called
his<00:05:23.469> theory<00:05:23.710> that<00:05:23.889> because<00:05:24.250> his<00:05:25.120> theory<00:05:25.449> is

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
his theory that because his theory is

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.499 
his theory that because his theory is
that<00:05:25.779> the<00:05:26.500> earth<00:05:26.710> behaves<00:05:27.250> as<00:05:27.699> if<00:05:27.879> it's<00:05:28.060> alive

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:28.509 
that the earth behaves as if it's alive

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:31.439 
that the earth behaves as if it's alive
maybe<00:05:29.319> it<00:05:29.529> is<00:05:29.740> alive<00:05:30.099> maybe<00:05:30.520> the<00:05:30.759> stones<00:05:31.089> are

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
maybe it is alive maybe the stones are

maybe it is alive maybe the stones are
alive<00:05:31.810> you<00:05:32.229> know<00:05:32.589> we<00:05:32.860> don't<00:05:33.069> know<00:05:33.399> I<00:05:33.430> think

alive you know we don't know I think
they<00:05:34.060> probably<00:05:34.300> are<00:05:34.750> cosmic<00:05:35.349> forces<00:05:35.800> and
