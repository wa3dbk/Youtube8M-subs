00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:14.940
 good morning today we will need 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:17.900
 a little more time because 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.529
 mid week need to carefully 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.529
 this is skin 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.410
 oh oh cops 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:30.189
 let's start with the usual cleansing 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.189
 take our mesh 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.760
 then you already know what money is 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.879
 try to guide the brushes 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.640
 bottom-up movement should be a little 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.590
 when raising I go to not 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.130
 stretch and down 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.130
 most 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.250
 or 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.530
 but 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.550
 focus on this area and 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.550
 skin neck 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.070
 about her 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.020
 to me 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.020
 thin 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.880
 and 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.050
 but 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.500
 and 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.760
 everything led 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.760
 after all 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.100
 today we will do general cleaning 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.500
 on the surface of the skin of the face and neck 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.280
 I need this tool with 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.210
 abrasive particles and crabber 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.000
 which will make your skin more smooth 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.390
 scrub it on face and make 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.600
 several massaging movements 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:12.160
 every buzzer he clicked out of his chin and 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.160
 a little face outline 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.360
 faces 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.700
 and 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.930
 skoda 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.290
 skin may redden slightly and this 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.290
 fine 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.810
 Yes 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.950
 Now I propose to apply moisturizing 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.800
 gel mask 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.990
 this mask very quickly absorbed your 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:47.670
 skin and fill it with vlad 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:50.160
 to its very foundation after this procedure 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.910
 your skin becomes perfectly smooth and 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.910
 moisturizing 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.540
 today we also exfoliate the dead 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.420
 skin particles on the lips and 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:27.250
 slightly over the edge anubis to 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.250
 make perfectly smooth and well maintained 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.240
 houses 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.920
 mask works both as fear and as 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.920
 care products 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.930
 can now be applied to the caretaker press 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.389
 and first we take the regenerating 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:20.310
 whey that helps to recover 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:23.380
 skin after an intense island behind 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.389
 emulsion sun factor from 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.460
 herbal extracts then the plant will 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:30.210
 take care of your skin 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.210
 very deep 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.180
 eye cream will wake your eyes if 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.639
 you will apply it with a tip 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.720
 special metal that cools 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.720
 your skin at the time of application 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.930
 koch lip balm completes care 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.930
 lips 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:00.009

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:00.009
