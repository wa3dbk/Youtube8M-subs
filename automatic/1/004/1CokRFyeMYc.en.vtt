00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:07.850
 [Music] 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.539
 we just saw the operation of what 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.610
 which is the direct motor we cut 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.390
 current and now what we are going to do 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:39.410
 is to start putting protections and 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.690
 always from the simplest to go 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.650
 complicating what is the circuit every 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.120
 a little more time 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.850
 I have the current I have above 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.280
 protected there is no problem well 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.860
 I show you what are protectors of 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.970
 engines 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.790
 in itself that also in case there is a 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.880
 overheating or short circuit 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.980
 they are going to cut this can only be 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.520
 again it will put back in 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.070
 operation if it is given directly 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:12.460
 to what is the march button protects 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.490
 the engine against over intensities and 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.450
 about short circuits there are many 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.330
 models that this is one for up to 63 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:28.030
 amps this is for small engines 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:31.000
 from 1 to 6 amps and this one from 2.5 to four 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.390
 this for example the most complete because 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.090
 besides the cut has a contact 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.450
 closed and another open closed and open 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.490
 This means that if we jumps 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.770
 anything the engine we are going to have the 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.060
 possibility of putting a pilot with a 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.549
 light bulb 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:53.020
 neon where will you indicate that that 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:55.030
 engine has jumped to a siren or what 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.880
 We want what it is about 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.590
 use this auxiliary contact so that 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:05.969
 tell us that the engine is 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:10.920
 no functioning well let's connect 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:13.410
 what is one of them always with the 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.629
 lanes we have it quite simple of 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.050
 do and we put what are the 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:20.080
 bridges 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.800
 to the part d 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.800
 above 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:34.000
 of what is the motor protector 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.000
 and connected to the output of what is 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:42.180
 of the thermal power 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:46.500
 it's quite simple to do and it's very 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.690
 effective because it protects 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.990
 very well in the engine the problem that 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.110
 we have is that we have to rearm what 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.110
 If there is a problem 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.110
 electric 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.069
 and it is already 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:13.150
 with one of the cables 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.150
 and another one too 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:26.180
 this is to say a food 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.849
 direct motor because we're not 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.489
 making any maneuver the only thing 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:35.090
 mohsÃ©n interposes what is a 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:37.790
 feeding a protector 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.410
 so that the engine in case it is 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.410
 stay in two phases 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:50.549
 by a short circuit or by something similar 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:53.130
 of the engine not knowing and that's the advantage 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:57.270
 what has 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:04:01.230
 the power to go putting the different 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:03.470
 elements with which we are in 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.470
 the market 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.280
 they are usually used as I said 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.130
 before for turbines fans 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.180
 extractor 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.180
 and you can put 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:25.510
 near the turbine or in the pictures 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.510
 simply by actuating what is 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.200
 depending 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:35.630
 of the system so in this case by 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.750
 example by expelling this other well 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:42.210
 however, this is turning the button 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.790
 to one side or the other good you 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.720
 we give current 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:50.320
 and we also give to what is the 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.320
 protective 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:58.809
 we must be perfectly that we have 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:58.809
 regulated at a high intensity 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.240
 the engine works perfectly 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.070
 and now what we are going to do 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.520
 It is regular care that is the 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.620
 intensity 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.389
 because it has here the possibility of 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.389
 We are not going to lower it regularly 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:33.680
 that is what happens 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:36.009
 when the sheets are heated well 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:42.230
 metal or the system you have here 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:44.680
 then the intensity that happens 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.500
 to what it holds in those plates 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.460
 they heat up and that regulation makes 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.570
 skip the system now even if we want 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:57.160
 start it until it is not 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:59.800
 cool we can not but if we increase it 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:04.620
 what is the intensity 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.620
 you may already start what it is 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.689
 And power 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:13.940
 and enter again in operation then 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:16.420
 this is the protector 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:19.380
 we work again 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:21.620
 first a short circuit very well then 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:25.330
 is 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.330
 it's another, more test 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.070
 it's with a motor protector 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:46.449
 and this appliance or electrical component is 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:52.750
 similar what happens that this one works 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:55.479
 about what is the maneuver of the box 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:58.870
 or the contactors that are going to do 

00:06:55.479 --> 00:07:02.240
 operate what is the system engine 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:06.289
 it is also the same has some plates 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:08.720
 it is heated with a coil dilate by 

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:12.440
 the passage of excess current or by 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:14.090
 Short and open contacts 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.139
 or closed depending on who we want 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:19.550
 use 

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:22.229
 it causes the maneuver to disconnect 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.860
 between this one and this one because the difference is 

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:28.199
 that we can rearm it and this 

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:31.590
 possibly we would have to give the 

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:33.969
 marcha paro that is the one that made a whole 

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:36.719
 the system of him 

00:07:33.969 --> 00:07:41.710
 of the circuit for the engine to work 

00:07:36.719 --> 00:07:43.960
 very good because this is another video 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.380
 I hope you serve and thank you very much 

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.380
 until next time 

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:54.579
