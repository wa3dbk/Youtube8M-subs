impact on the figures it's actually

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:03.670 
impact on the figures it's actually
melting<00:01:01.219> onto<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:01.760> man<00:01:02.260> see<00:01:03.260> if<00:01:03.350> I<00:01:03.440> can<00:01:03.559> get

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
melting onto the man see if I can get

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.480 
melting onto the man see if I can get
that<00:01:03.769> focused<00:01:05.320> but<00:01:06.320> it's<00:01:06.470> actually<00:01:06.770> melting

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
that focused but it's actually melting

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.050 
that focused but it's actually melting
onto<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:08.240> man<00:01:08.420> and<00:01:08.690> that<00:01:09.470> the<00:01:09.649> design<00:01:10.460> on<00:01:10.759> the

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
onto the man and that the design on the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.270 
onto the man and that the design on the
man<00:01:11.240> who's<00:01:11.509> coming<00:01:11.750> off<00:01:11.960> on<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.289> client<00:01:12.590> see

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
man who's coming off on the client see

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.090 
man who's coming off on the client see
if<00:01:13.369> I<00:01:13.429> can<00:01:13.550> find<00:01:13.700> a<00:01:13.759> baked<00:01:13.880> clay<00:01:14.890> found<00:01:15.890> a<00:01:15.979> bit

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
if I can find a baked clay found a bit

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.830 
if I can find a baked clay found a bit
earlier<00:01:16.490> and<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:16.940> whole<00:01:17.119> design<00:01:17.479> had<00:01:17.690> just

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
earlier and the whole design had just

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.930 
earlier and the whole design had just
come<00:01:18.080> off<00:01:18.110> on<00:01:18.409> it<00:01:18.560> it's<00:01:19.250> ridiculous

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
come off on it it's ridiculous

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.940 
come off on it it's ridiculous
I<00:01:19.970> think<00:01:20.300> that's<00:01:20.569> yeah<00:01:21.110> that's<00:01:21.140> a<00:01:21.409> part<00:01:21.590> of<00:01:21.649> it

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
I think that's yeah that's a part of it

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.249 
I think that's yeah that's a part of it
there<00:01:22.520> you<00:01:22.670> can<00:01:22.729> see<00:01:22.940> it's<00:01:23.060> just<00:01:23.090> come<00:01:23.360> off<00:01:23.509> so

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
there you can see it's just come off so

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.139 
there you can see it's just come off so
it's<00:01:24.380> getting<00:01:24.560> pretty<00:01:24.649> hot<00:01:24.860> in<00:01:24.979> here<00:01:25.130> but<00:01:25.310> I'll

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
it's getting pretty hot in here but I'll

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.410 
it's getting pretty hot in here but I'll
just<00:01:26.210> give<00:01:26.600> you<00:01:26.659> a<00:01:26.750> quick<00:01:27.069> look<00:01:28.069> at<00:01:28.520> one<00:01:29.270> of<00:01:29.360> the

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
just give you a quick look at one of the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.570 
just give you a quick look at one of the
parts<00:01:29.750> I've<00:01:29.929> been<00:01:30.080> working<00:01:30.380> on<00:01:30.440> if<00:01:31.280> I<00:01:31.399> could

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
parts I've been working on if I could

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:39.309 
parts I've been working on if I could
get<00:01:31.819> the<00:01:32.000> camera<00:01:32.360> steady<00:01:33.100> but<00:01:34.100> yeah<00:01:38.289> that<00:01:39.289> is

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
get the camera steady but yeah that is

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:42.130 
get the camera steady but yeah that is
terrible<00:01:39.830> is<00:01:40.009> so<00:01:40.369> laggy<00:01:40.670> I<00:01:41.000> have<00:01:41.929> some

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
terrible is so laggy I have some

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.949 
terrible is so laggy I have some
problems<00:01:42.530> with<00:01:42.590> my<00:01:42.799> computer<00:01:43.310> at<00:01:43.429> the<00:01:43.520> moment

00:01:43.949 --> 00:01:43.959 
problems with my computer at the moment

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:46.660 
problems with my computer at the moment
it's<00:01:44.959> being<00:01:45.229> ridiculously<00:01:45.950> laggy<00:01:46.250> as<00:01:46.459> you<00:01:46.550> can

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
it's being ridiculously laggy as you can

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.510 
it's being ridiculously laggy as you can
see<00:01:46.819> look<00:01:46.970> at<00:01:47.060> what<00:01:47.690> is<00:01:47.750> that<00:01:47.929> I<00:01:48.429> think<00:01:49.429> it's

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
see look at what is that I think it's

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.070 
see look at what is that I think it's
cuz<00:01:49.610> I<00:01:49.700> got<00:01:49.849> so<00:01:50.000> many<00:01:50.090> things<00:01:50.420> open<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:50.899> going

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
cuz I got so many things open and going

00:01:51.080 --> 00:02:03.340 
cuz I got so many things open and going
on<00:01:51.550> that's<00:01:52.550> a<00:01:52.610> bit<00:01:52.729> better

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.340 

so<00:02:04.220> that's<00:02:04.610> another<00:02:04.790> bit<00:02:05.000> I'll<00:02:05.720> spit<00:02:06.020> you<00:02:06.110> just

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
so that's another bit I'll spit you just

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.650 
so that's another bit I'll spit you just
saw<00:02:06.530> in<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.890> time-lapse<00:02:07.250> so<00:02:07.700> we're<00:02:08.450> going<00:02:08.570> to

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660
