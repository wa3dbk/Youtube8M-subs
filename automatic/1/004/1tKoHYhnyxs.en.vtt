00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.900 

and<00:05:03.530> then<00:05:03.620> you<00:05:03.710> can<00:05:03.860> repeat<00:05:04.340> that<00:05:04.550> one<00:05:04.760> more

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
and then you can repeat that one more

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:14.419 
and then you can repeat that one more
time<00:05:04.940> by<00:05:05.270> pressing<00:05:05.480> the<00:05:05.720> trigger

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:14.429 

00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:17.070 

really<00:05:15.429> cool<00:05:15.610> and<00:05:16.029> though<00:05:16.479> you<00:05:16.569> can<00:05:16.719> still<00:05:16.839> do

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
really cool and though you can still do

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.499 
really cool and though you can still do
the<00:05:17.199> shrink<00:05:17.439> and<00:05:17.589> Mauro<00:05:17.800> and<00:05:18.149> enroll<00:05:19.149> Mario

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:19.509 
the shrink and Mauro and enroll Mario

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:28.019 
the shrink and Mauro and enroll Mario
sounds<00:05:19.899> by<00:05:20.050> spinning<00:05:26.309> so<00:05:27.309> that<00:05:27.429> the<00:05:27.550> bonus<00:05:27.759> I

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:28.029 
sounds by spinning so that the bonus I

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:30.419 
sounds by spinning so that the bonus I
guess<00:05:28.209> um<00:05:28.659> I<00:05:29.289> really<00:05:29.830> really<00:05:30.069> like<00:05:30.249> this

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:30.429 
guess um I really really like this

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:32.879 
guess um I really really like this
combined<00:05:30.819> mode<00:05:31.029> despite<00:05:31.479> the<00:05:31.629> fact<00:05:31.899> that<00:05:32.050> the

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
combined mode despite the fact that the

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.179 
combined mode despite the fact that the
in<00:05:33.039> Romero<00:05:33.459> is<00:05:33.669> really<00:05:34.089> really<00:05:34.270> large

00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:35.189 
in Romero is really really large

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:37.230 
in Romero is really really large
compared<00:05:36.189> to<00:05:36.279> everything<00:05:36.459> else<00:05:36.759> because<00:05:37.149> the

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
compared to everything else because the

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.769 
compared to everything else because the
Romero's<00:05:37.779> actual<00:05:38.229> scale<00:05:38.709> ish<00:05:39.159> and<00:05:39.779> everything

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:40.779 
Romero's actual scale ish and everything

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:41.669 
Romero's actual scale ish and everything
else<00:05:40.929> is<00:05:41.080> really<00:05:41.229> tiny

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:41.679 
else is really tiny

00:05:41.679 --> 00:05:43.919 
else is really tiny
so<00:05:42.219> the<00:05:42.369> nurimaru<00:05:42.759> looks<00:05:42.999> a<00:05:43.089> bit<00:05:43.119> off<00:05:43.360> but<00:05:43.749> it's

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:43.929 
so the nurimaru looks a bit off but it's

00:05:43.929 --> 00:05:45.779 
so the nurimaru looks a bit off but it's
so<00:05:44.080> really<00:05:44.379> cool<00:05:44.529> adds<00:05:44.800> a<00:05:44.889> lot<00:05:45.069> of<00:05:45.279> heft<00:05:45.520> in

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 
so really cool adds a lot of heft in

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:47.459 
so really cool adds a lot of heft in
fact<00:05:46.029> it's<00:05:46.209> kind<00:05:46.419> of<00:05:46.479> difficult<00:05:46.659> to<00:05:46.869> hold<00:05:47.229> with

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:47.469 
fact it's kind of difficult to hold with

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:51.839 
fact it's kind of difficult to hold with
one<00:05:47.499> hand<00:05:47.680> but<00:05:48.580> um<00:05:49.499> it's<00:05:50.499> still<00:05:50.649> doable<00:05:51.129> plenty

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 
one hand but um it's still doable plenty

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:54.029 
one hand but um it's still doable plenty
I<00:05:51.879> mean<00:05:52.119> I'm<00:05:52.209> doing<00:05:52.539> it<00:05:52.629> just<00:05:52.749> fine<00:05:52.990> but<00:05:53.169> it<00:05:53.889> is

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
I mean I'm doing it just fine but it is

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:55.859 
I mean I'm doing it just fine but it is
really<00:05:54.399> heavy<00:05:54.610> but<00:05:55.029> it<00:05:55.300> looks<00:05:55.479> really<00:05:55.719> nice

00:05:55.859 --> 00:05:55.869 
really heavy but it looks really nice

00:05:55.869 --> 00:05:57.929 
really heavy but it looks really nice
stuff<00:05:56.110> horns<00:05:56.589> go<00:05:56.800> down<00:05:57.009> straight<00:05:57.459> when<00:05:57.699> you

00:05:57.929 --> 00:05:57.939 
stuff horns go down straight when you

00:05:57.939 --> 00:05:59.040 
stuff horns go down straight when you
put<00:05:58.119> the<00:05:58.180> shank<00:05:58.419> of<00:05:58.479> Mario<00:05:58.719> and<00:05:58.869> there's<00:05:58.990> a

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
put the shank of Mario and there's a

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:04.220 
put the shank of Mario and there's a
buck<00:05:59.259> button<00:05:59.979> in<00:06:00.129> there

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.230 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.950 

[Applause]

and<00:06:09.960> that<00:06:10.169> activates<00:06:10.889> that<00:06:11.009> noise<00:06:11.430> so<00:06:11.850> Alison

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
and that activates that noise so Alison

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.689 
and that activates that noise so Alison
