00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 today creative enchiladas we are going to 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.899
 teach decorating your notebooks with 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.690
 jeans yes with old jeans that no longer 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.090
 use or that are stained first 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.759
 We need your powers to line and 1 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.760
 james can be up to the child who 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.800
 you want let's cut first one 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.869
 bag of the bags that are in the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.970
 back then you will see more 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.150
 forward as we also use the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.250
 bags in front is very good 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.070
 now place your notebook on top of 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.579
 a denim or part fabric 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.260
 of the trousers places it in such a way that 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.079
 Turn the notebook over so that it is 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.450
 all wrapped in denim has to 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.550
 be your measure a little bit too much for 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.379
 that you can stick it in the back 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.660
 of the notebook as when the forms 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.760
 normally with paper we are going to do 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.500
 exactly the same nothing more than 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.020
 they want from hitting him with diurex or with 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.840
 We are going to paste it with glue 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.030
 white the typical school and we're going to 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.879
 cut inward the part from where 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.040
 is the spiral this is because it is not going 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.830
 to be able to bend over the spiral 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.290
 since we have cut it we lined it 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.360
 as if you were a notebook and in the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.420
 edges place a little bit of silicone 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.180
 but paste everything with white glue and 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.920
 on the banks with silicone and let's go 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.770
 to do exactly the same thing from the other 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.330
 side just remember to leave it a little 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.340
 because your notebook has to 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.020
 open and close perfectly 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.270
 that's the way it is and when it's not going to be 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.850
 a little loose good here is the bag 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.560
 right that we cut and we're going to cut 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.319
 also the part of up to the bottom of the 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.289
 pants just this strip is going to 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:43.030
 serve to place our pens 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:46.479
 You can also get a closing for 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.700
 example to stick a ribbon the idea 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.009
 is that you use your imagination and the forums 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.100
 as you want here we are going to see several 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.140
 Well, we put the strip on one side and 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.299
 the other is to say that you do not 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.479
 stick to the notebook so that 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.899
 we can put your lenses your pens and 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.759
 up your cell phone on the return 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.160
 let's do another nothing more by cutting the 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.560
 front of the notebook we are going to 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.920
 wear an equal denim trousers 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.750
 just the one that we just cut we're going to 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.599
 cut the measure from the top of your 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.019
 notebook and then we will open it from 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.610
 this way so you have a fabric 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.069
 remember to cut the leftovers so that 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.170
 You can wrap it very well like when 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.239
 out after you are you which when 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.690
 the cloth shapes we are going to put 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.390
 pretty white glue 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.190
 and silicon where the seam is 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.800
 perfect in which it looks as if 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.250
 the pants were finished this is 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.990
 is going to hit where the spiral is and good 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.570
 in the back of sam's it hits you 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.090
 exactly the same with silicone or with a 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.370
 I resist white now for the front 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.100
 let's put our bag that is the 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.350
 back bag of the jean and also you 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.590
 we can put a lace like a ribbon 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.810
 let's paste white complemented the 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.330
 joke is to decorate them that you do not 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.460
 incredible, very, very much 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.590
 design is going to look amazing at 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.010
 ribbon attached also by the part of 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.810
 back and the bag with white glue 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.940
 now right down here it occurred to me 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.170
 do with a little bit of james that I 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:25.230
 There is a flower with a strip of sticking and 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.540
 folding veil is going to continue 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.390
 crumpling the part that is going to be sticking 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.060
 around the silicon dots that 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.860
 you are putting on the cover 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.650
 I do not know if you explain but good 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.569
 joke will go wrinkling and in the center 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.730
 so it does not look all wrinkled is 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.860
 I happened to put a button on him but you 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.620
 you can put whatever you want that 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.470
 bag here and why we make it a 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.269
 patch with any fabric that you like or 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.489
 bit you have out there we go to 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.970
 make a square this is going to simulate a 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.739
 park we paste it with white glue 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.489
 perfectly well this when drying sticks 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:04.620
 perfect and now with a black down 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:07.140
 let's put two lines on each side 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.650
 this is going to simulate the seams of your 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.660
 part looks very funny we are going to do 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.450
 the same as the above with a bit 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.630
 We are going to stick it a little bit 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:23.120
 loose not just so you can go around 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:25.820
 put your pens or even your lenses 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.040
 now with another piece of fabric too 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.440
 or also denim is that you want 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.160
 let's make a heart so it doubles 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.900
 half and cut a heart this heart 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.240
 we can stick it where you want to me 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.449
 it occurs to me that it mediated out of the bag 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.030
 so I'm going to put it a little bit and 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:47.360
 I'm still going to do a little bit more 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.310
 design you can paint tiny dots 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.590
 or even your name with acrylic paint 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.220
 the acrylic paint is not removed from the 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.990
 clothing 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.850
 and you remember that I told you we could 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.750
 use the front part of the 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.210
 jeans 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.310
 well, it cuts exactly what you 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.220
 notebook is to say the front 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.800
 You are going to cut it very well leaving the bag 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.990
 so you can use the bag and 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.270
 put there whatever you want places 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.380
 enough white glue and glue 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.540
 remember that it has to be left over 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.000
 a cut so you can paste it 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:22.000
 back you can make some hearts of 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.520
 another shade of jeans and put a button or 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.870
 You can put what you 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:31.570
 you want to draw buttons whatever you want 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.420
 They are really incredible look in 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:36.280
 their originals and also serve a lot 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.370
 because the bags help you place 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:42.340
 there the cell phone the hearing aids pens 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.200
