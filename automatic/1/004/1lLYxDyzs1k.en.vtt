this<00:00:01.410> is<00:00:01.589> the<00:00:01.770> review<00:00:02.070> of<00:00:02.129> the<00:00:02.250> Hoover

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
this is the review of the Hoover

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.510 
this is the review of the Hoover
visiontek<00:00:03.449> washing<00:00:04.380> machine<00:00:04.740> it's<00:00:05.279> got<00:00:05.460> a

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
visiontek washing machine it's got a

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.720 
visiontek washing machine it's got a
maximum<00:00:05.730> load<00:00:06.180> of<00:00:06.390> 7<00:00:06.720> kilos<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.950> 1,400

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
maximum load of 7 kilos and the 1,400

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.419 
maximum load of 7 kilos and the 1,400
spin<00:00:09.000> speed<00:00:09.590> the<00:00:10.590> very<00:00:10.920> first<00:00:11.190> thing<00:00:11.400> we

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
spin speed the very first thing we

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.190 
spin speed the very first thing we
noticed<00:00:11.940> about<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.300> washing<00:00:12.599> machine<00:00:12.900> was

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
noticed about the washing machine was

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.570 
noticed about the washing machine was
the<00:00:13.500> height<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.420> the<00:00:15.420> size<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.109> door

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
the height and the size of the door

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.220 
the height and the size of the door
which<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:17.789> think<00:00:17.970> makes<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.390> really<00:00:18.690> easy<00:00:19.020> for

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
which we think makes it really easy for

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.630 
which we think makes it really easy for
loading<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:19.830> unloading<00:00:19.859> your<00:00:20.430> washing

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
loading and unloading your washing

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.980 
loading and unloading your washing
machine<00:00:22.910> then<00:00:23.910> we<00:00:23.970> look<00:00:24.150> at<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.330> top<00:00:24.539> area

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
machine then we look at the top area

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.320 
machine then we look at the top area
here<00:00:25.070> you'll<00:00:26.070> notice<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.519> digital<00:00:27.000> display

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
here you'll notice the digital display

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.859 
here you'll notice the digital display
which<00:00:27.840> shows<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.830> spin<00:00:29.490> speed<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.269> cycle

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
which shows the spin speed of the cycle

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.659 
which shows the spin speed of the cycle
neuron<00:00:31.170> but<00:00:31.439> also<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.980> number<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.489> minutes

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
neuron but also the number of minutes

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.120 
neuron but also the number of minutes
remaining<00:00:33.059> on<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.390> program<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.350> that's

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
remaining on the program and that's

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.190 
remaining on the program and that's
really<00:00:35.550> useful<00:00:36.120> if<00:00:36.360> you're<00:00:36.750> thinking<00:00:37.170> you

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
really useful if you're thinking you

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.780 
really useful if you're thinking you
need<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.620> go<00:00:37.770> out<00:00:37.980> but<00:00:38.219> you're<00:00:38.340> not<00:00:38.460> sure

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
need to go out but you're not sure

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.880 
need to go out but you're not sure
whether<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.180> should<00:00:39.809> hang<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.500> hang<00:00:40.739> out

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
whether you should hang on and hang out

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.200 
whether you should hang on and hang out
the<00:00:41.010> washing<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.059> great

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
the washing this is this is great

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.760 
the washing this is this is great
because<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.719> says<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.170> know<00:00:43.290> you've<00:00:43.440> got<00:00:43.530> five

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
because it says you know you've got five

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.260 
because it says you know you've got five
minutes<00:00:43.920> left<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.399> should<00:00:44.460> hang<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:47.120> then<00:00:48.120> we

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
minutes left you should hang on then we

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.959 
minutes left you should hang on then we
can<00:00:48.300> see<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.960> delayed<00:00:49.379> start<00:00:49.860> program<00:00:50.610> here

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
can see the delayed start program here

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.439 
can see the delayed start program here
the<00:00:51.899> cold<00:00:52.350> wash<00:00:52.680> button<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.879> sensitive

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
the cold wash button and the sensitive

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.090 
the cold wash button and the sensitive
care<00:00:54.750> button<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.350> then<00:00:55.440> we've<00:00:55.559> got<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.860> dial

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
care button and then we've got the dial

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.549 
care button and then we've got the dial
for<00:00:56.340> selecting<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.120> program<00:00:57.660> which<00:00:58.410> is

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
for selecting the program which is

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.520 
for selecting the program which is
really<00:00:58.710> easy<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.280> understand<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.910> have<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.120> say

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
really easy to understand I have to say

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.349 
really easy to understand I have to say
and<00:01:01.530> then<00:01:01.739> you've<00:01:01.920> got<00:01:02.070> various<00:01:02.699> programs

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
and then you've got various programs

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.800 
and then you've got various programs
your<00:01:04.019> hot<00:01:04.199> wash<00:01:04.530> 60<00:01:05.400> degrees<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.180> just<00:01:06.600> wanted

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
your hot wash 60 degrees I just wanted

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.480 
your hot wash 60 degrees I just wanted
to<00:01:06.930> point<00:01:07.080> out<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.530> one<00:01:07.830> here<00:01:07.860> called<00:01:08.130> a

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
to point out this one here called a

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.899 
to point out this one here called a
daily<00:01:08.939> wash<00:01:09.830> that's<00:01:10.830> really<00:01:11.369> good<00:01:11.549> if<00:01:11.729> your

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
daily wash that's really good if your

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.600 
daily wash that's really good if your
clothes<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.420> heavily<00:01:12.869> soiled<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:14.220> they<00:01:14.430> just

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
clothes on heavily soiled and they just

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.170 
clothes on heavily soiled and they just
need<00:01:14.790> freshening<00:01:15.299> up<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.780> really<00:01:17.180> quick

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
need freshening up it's a really quick

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.679 
need freshening up it's a really quick
program<00:01:18.990> which<00:01:19.610> uses<00:01:20.610> less<00:01:20.790> electricity<00:01:20.820> so

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
program which uses less electricity so

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.340 
program which uses less electricity so
that's<00:01:21.840> really<00:01:22.080> good<00:01:23.930> then<00:01:24.930> we<00:01:25.020> move<00:01:25.170> on<00:01:25.320> to

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
that's really good then we move on to

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.070 
that's really good then we move on to
the<00:01:25.560> draw<00:01:25.770> which<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.630> probably

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
the draw which is here this is probably

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.230 
the draw which is here this is probably
the<00:01:28.259> only<00:01:28.350> negative<00:01:29.009> thing<00:01:29.040> we've<00:01:29.490> found<00:01:29.520> it's

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
the only negative thing we've found it's

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.600 
the only negative thing we've found it's
very<00:01:30.390> small<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.350> pulls<00:01:31.619> out<00:01:31.860> only<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> short

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
very small it pulls out only a short

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.420 
very small it pulls out only a short
distance<00:01:32.820> as<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.329> can<00:01:33.630> see<00:01:34.100> which<00:01:35.100> makes

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
distance as you can see which makes

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.090 
distance as you can see which makes
putting<00:01:35.850> your<00:01:36.210> washing<00:01:36.479> powder<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.439> fabric

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
putting your washing powder and fabric

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.160 
putting your washing powder and fabric
softener<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.820> quite<00:01:39.360> difficult<00:01:39.659> we've<00:01:40.020> had<00:01:40.140> a

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
softener in quite difficult we've had a

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.200 
softener in quite difficult we've had a
few<00:01:40.380> spillages<00:01:40.860> but<00:01:41.159> we<00:01:41.340> will<00:01:41.549> get<00:01:41.759> used<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.119> it

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
few spillages but we will get used to it

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.530 
few spillages but we will get used to it
I<00:01:42.710> just<00:01:43.710> wanted<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.040> point<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.310> out<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.640> you

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.899 

ok<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.780> washing<00:01:49.229> machine<00:01:49.590> has<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:50.250> sensor

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
ok this washing machine has a sensor

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.760 
ok this washing machine has a sensor
which<00:01:51.509> measures<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:52.110> weight<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.649> your

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
which measures the weight of your

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.730 
which measures the weight of your
washing<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.720> calculates<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:55.049> washing<00:01:55.530> time

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
washing and calculates the washing time

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.950 
washing and calculates the washing time
accordingly<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.640> reduces<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.329> according<00:01:57.810> to

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
accordingly and reduces it according to

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.330 
accordingly and reduces it according to
the<00:01:58.110> weight<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.680> washing<00:01:59.040> which<00:01:59.159> is

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
the weight of the washing which is

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.219 
the weight of the washing which is
really<00:01:59.640> good<00:01:59.820> because<00:01:59.939> that's<00:02:00.240> going<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.079> mean

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
really good because that's going to mean

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.700 
really good because that's going to mean

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
that it's more economical one of the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.289 
that it's more economical one of the
greatest<00:02:05.159> things<00:02:05.399> we<00:02:05.579> found<00:02:05.790> about<00:02:06.090> this

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
greatest things we found about this

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.010 
greatest things we found about this
washing<00:02:06.780> machine<00:02:07.079> is<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.500> the

washing machine is that the

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.890 
washing machine is that the
chin<00:02:08.230> comes<00:02:08.530> out<00:02:08.770> really<00:02:09.490> clean<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.270> smells

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:10.900

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.900 
chin comes out really clean and smells
lovely<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:12.520> it<00:02:13.030> is<00:02:13.240> so<00:02:13.540> dry<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.350> it<00:02:15.190> reduces

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
good the other thing we've noticed is it

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.110 
good the other thing we've noticed is it
is<00:02:28.810> very<00:02:28.990> quiet<00:02:29.410> on<00:02:29.980> all<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.250> programs<00:02:30.820> and<00:02:33.120> it

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
is very quiet on all the programs and it

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.750 
is very quiet on all the programs and it
actually<00:02:34.480> is<00:02:34.990> quite<00:02:35.260> small<00:02:35.830> in<00:02:36.040> depth<00:02:36.370> which

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
actually is quite small in depth which

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.820 
actually is quite small in depth which
means<00:02:37.030> if<00:02:37.180> you're<00:02:37.300> limited<00:02:37.750> on<00:02:37.900> space<00:02:38.140> and

means if you're limited on space and

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.000 
means if you're limited on space and
that's<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:39.100> really<00:02:39.370> good<00:02:39.490> feature<00:02:39.730> as<00:02:40.060> well
