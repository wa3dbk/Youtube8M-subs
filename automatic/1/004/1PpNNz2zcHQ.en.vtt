00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.509
 you want to know what reason led me to open 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.250
 this good channel there were several 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:08.619
 obviously but one of the most 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.839
 important, no doubt it was about 

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:14.289
 the impatience between October and November 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:17.140
 of 2011 came the continuations of two 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:19.330
 from my favorite sagas elder scrolls in 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.700
 concrete scanning and of course bad 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.890
 dolphin you will have noticed that since this 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.890
 video is up on my channel the list 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.990
 it's mine and it's more than likely not 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.600
 match one hundred percent with yours 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.539
 I assume since most of you are little men 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.940
 and you can hold it perfectly but 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:38.559
 for those who are not the most sensitive 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.260
 we have arranged a telephone to the 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:46.649
 existence 112 emergencies with which to 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.649
 lois it's coming that there was an ambulance 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.970
 you division in the trailers has promised 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.650
 bring something very interesting a kind 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.650
 of combination between shooter in third 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.720
 person and open world without games in 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.229
 servers and so on what would be typical 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.670
 of the massive multiplayer online rpg to 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.560
 I personally is an idea that 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.720
 some reason does not appeal to me too much but 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.520
 With all sincerity I tell you that I can 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.500
 understand perfectly who 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.740
 I would place this game in the post 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.740
 number 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.840
 between the saga of cells are counted 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.940
 some of those that I consider better 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.310
 games of all times and like 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.410
 I loved a lot of other people in 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.020
 concrete the darker tone and maybe 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.270
 adult of zelda twilight princess and me 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.210
 would like to continue on this path is 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.030
 true that I do not have a wii for the 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.850
 next release of a cell but my 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.490
 theory is the following the game is going to be 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.540
 so good that it will also come out on pc and 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.540
 on xbox 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.210
 title fall is a game that has robots 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.210
 giants 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.620
 it is true that although we have noticed 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.480
 enough effort on the part of dais 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.820
 improve your next title in the saga 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.100
 battlefield the paper change that 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.140
 interested in film 4 maybe it's going to be 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.320
 too subtle but it is also true 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.850
 that when the game you take is the 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.030
 unquestionably more advanced within 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.770
 her pussy genre that you can complain 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.660
 personally I can not wait to 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.270
 return to make an authentic patrol of 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.690
 Russians and start distributing lead in 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.690
 battlefield 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.420
 this is an idea so requested that 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.980
 even independent fans for their 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.630
 own account and risk 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.360
 they try to carry it out to be able to 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.870
 nintendo have experience who 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.870
 you have to kill 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.450
 hard life 1 was for many players 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:03.549
 an authentic revolution for me was the 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.140
 step of missions shooting games 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.750
 loose that did not have much 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.940
 connecting each other to a unique adventure and 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.010
 continued that I put you squarely in the 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.319
 atmosphere and with a history that 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.870
 it was hard enough to forget 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.910
 jal light 2 of course did not disappoint and 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.650
 Well, it's famous, it's not necessary 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.870
 I put it here highlight 3 is one of the 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.620
 most anticipated games for all 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.620
 pc players 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.129
 it is very difficult to try to explain by 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.290
 what dark souls is so special to someone 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.750
 I have not played it but almost in a way 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.579
 of summary is the emotion of every moment 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.340
 always go carefully watching everything 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.110
 the fear that you will suddenly be invaded by 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.269
 cross the corners even with some 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.920
 fear those fights against final bosses 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.019
 that are not only great and have a lot 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.030
 postureo but you really are 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.099
 playing life to every attack they throw 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.349
 and when you have defeated them you know that you have 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.180
 been about to die as in two or 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.400
 three times I do a little cheating 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.049
 even because this game does not belong to 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.450
 the new generation actually comes out in 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.370
 xbox 360 and playstation3 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.170
 but I think we 're all in agreement 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.730
 that it's just as good as the 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.329
 first we can not give you a song 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.329
 in the teeth 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:22.939
 metal gear solid ' why can I say 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:24.710
 that you do not know all is one of the 

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:27.020
 most beloved sagas of all time 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.909
 I could not play it by the way until 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.740
 a few years ago emula is in 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:33.379
 pirate plan because I did not have at the time 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.210
 playstation one and the truth is that I do not 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:38.090
 I could believe that a game like that would have 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.520
 existed in 1998 is completely 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.889
 ridiculous goal day sun and 5 promises a lot 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.779
 open world you can see the trailer that 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.300
 it's totally awesome and it shows 

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:49.789
 much of the gameplay and finally nothing of 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.560
 the sagas where it gets more emotion and 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.860
 more ambitious within all this 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.860
 mundillo 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.469
 elder scrolls or fallout the truth is that 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:03.120
 it does not matter to me every time a 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:05.039
 new bethesda game I'm staying 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.590
 locked in my room for a 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:09.389
 period not less than three weeks until 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.180
 that my eyes bleed and during the 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:14.520
 next months the thing continues to start 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.860
 a new adventure starting a game 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.199
 from the beginning all this I just 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:24.979
 say includes the next elder title 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:24.979
 online scrolls is going to be that no 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:36.020
 it's quite interesting that the post 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.569
 number 1 does not occupy the game of the least 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:42.499
 we know only one thing in fact is 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:46.369
 developed by such friends dais 

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:48.819
 together with star wars if I am also 

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:48.819
 direct 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:54.259
 and ladies and gentlemen up to here the show 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.780
 for today I hope as always that they have 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:58.850
 enjoyed remember that your right as 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.100
 citizens of youtube the stop by 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.990
 example a like or even a 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.720
 comment in the section below 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.060
 many people died in the past and 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.070
 they fought in conflicts and wars to 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.919
 that today we have this kind of 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:16.370
 rights and I do not know not to exercise them maybe 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:18.889
 suppose a certain lack of respect but 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.280
 Well there each with its own 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:21.280
 consciousness
