00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 hello everyone in this video we are going to 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.660
 learn to make a paper star 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.429
 of five points like this that I have here 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:12.120
 what do we need we need a folio 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.849
 square out good and all first 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.550
 What we do is fold the folio 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:22.779
 Half is worth 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:25.840
 so we doubled it down here doublet 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:28.989
 well up here in the middle and we mark 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.989
 well the fold and now what are we going to 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:34.300
 to do is to mark two diagonals is worth a 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.100
 around here and another one around here how are we going 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.340
 do this very easy 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:42.410
 first of all we make this fold 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.920
 so let's double it well 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.649
 you see that this double 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.600
 and now we do the same thing but the other way around 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:57.289
 voucher from the bottom up 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:00.930
 we do so we mark well and unfold 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:03.629
 It's worth because I do this because I'm interested 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.519
 this point the point of intersection of 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.080
 these two diagonals and because I 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.110
 interesting because I'm going to carry this 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.560
 corner is from here to the central point 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.290
 It seems a bit weird but let's do it 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.480
 corner the center point 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.450
 where is the central point you are here 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.550
 point of intersection forgiveness and we double 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.120
 all right 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.800
 ok we have taken the corner this 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.890
 here to the point of intersection of the two 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.640
 diagonal and now let's do this 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:38.909
 double from here so it's worth 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.859
 let's do it like that and we mark well 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.450
 and now to finish this figure is 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:45.800
 very simple what we are going to do is 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.780
 bring this part of here here 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.760
 I 'm worth it when I start talking like 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.530
 I have this diagonal marked the folio 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.600
 wants to bend like that but we're not going to 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.670
 leave because the folio does not have to 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.010
 say how we have to bend things 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.500
 it is we who decide and 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.440
 let's double it 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.010
 so it's true until they match 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.790
 these two parts we bend well 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:13.400
 and I still should have something like it 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.620
 I repeat we simply carry this part 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.129
 here 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.040
 so perfect and now the only thing that remains 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:24.379
 is to divide in half the figure is worth 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.280
 here by this line we do so the 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.190
 we divide in half 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.530
 ok you see how it is going 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.010
 we doubled well 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.830
 and it's ok, I've just 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.209
 divided in half does not have anything good 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.940
 Well now what we have to do is 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.830
 use scissors 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.870
 I do not like to use scissors when 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.160
 I make paper figures I do not like because 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.050
 because I think it 's like doing 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.120
 trap because at last you do if you use 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.310
 a pair of scissors you can get the figure 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.950
 you want you will not cut you're doing 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.210
 your things to me that I do not like but 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.120
 let's make an exception with this 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.250
 figure because it's just a cut and good 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.980
 let's make an exception as we take 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.530
 the figure to make the good cut 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.870
 we put the tip here down and as 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:16.040
 you see we have two parts this one 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:18.590
 and this is the smooth part 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.750
 and in this part we have these forms 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.269
 Well, we take it like that for this part 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.460
 and we are going to make a cut more or less 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.390
 here 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:30.160
 is approximate according to how we do it 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.790
 we will get a star with the tips 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.870
 more or less long more or less wide 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.349
 for example 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.640
 and here we have this and here we have this 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.890
 other 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.650
 depending on where we make the cut we will obtain 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.180
 something like the blue that I like more or 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.290
 something like the yellow that I do not 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.760
 like because it looks like an insect then 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.630
 taking the folio so let's make a 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:00.180
 Approximate cut I like to do it 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.950
 more or less around here until here 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.280
 as I say this is approximate either 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.770
 nothing happens and we cut 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.350
 and that's it, it does not help at all 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:14.209
 ok and we have our star here 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.209
 what we have to do is unfold the 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.579
 and we already have a perfect star you see 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.100
 not with its five points is a star 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.720
 very very well done let's see another 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.910
 good example now we can give you a 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.530
 little bit of form is worth to be more 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.670
 pretty, well, we can put it like this 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.310
 parts 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.690
 put this like this and mark it better 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.720
 so there is a star for example 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.400
 how is it here that is pretty good 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.260
 a star like that then we can put it 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.330
 so it stays and it's very good we're going to do 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.160
 another cut more where I have here a piece 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.390
 of paper for example here I have other 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.009
 ready let's make a cut 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.199
 different so you can see what happens 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:53.150
 we put the tip down and we take 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.520
 the figure thus for this part not for the 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:59.689
 smooth but for this and we will make a 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:03.679
 cut because I do not know for example 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:05.179
 I know a little more a narrow 

00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:07.099
 a close of these that I do not like 

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:09.979
 for example we cut from here below and 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:12.529
 we cut up here up to see what 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:14.719
 happens for example now let's get 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:17.569
 a horrible horrible star because it is 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:19.539
 a very narrow star and I do not know not me 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:22.069
 like for example this way I do not like 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:24.769
 I was also deformed because I did not 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:26.509
 must cut very well and this is left 

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:29.479
 quite longer and that's it if I do not 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:32.059
 I like this star I do not like it and a 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:35.300
 thing else here I have another one I'm going to 

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:37.969
 be left without folios in the house tip for 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.499
 down this part forward we are going to 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:42.379
 make another cut more but now a cut 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:46.180
 well done a little bit higher then 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:49.960
 here and up to here 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.520
 well for example and now before 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.289
 unfold the figure we can make another 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.680
 cut more and then we get a 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:58.810
 little star inside is also worth it to me 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.810
 I like this a lot as we have to 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.500
 cut to get this because we take the 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:08.380
 figure 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:12.020
 how is it in this position, so it's not worth 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:15.200
 well and we make a cut here for this 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.510
 end a cut parallel to this line and 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.580
 a very small cut ok let's see 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.860
 if I get it right 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.270
 it has to be a cut 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:28.680
 here 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:32.090
 and very tiny for example something like that and 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.420
 we cut and now when unfolding the figure 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.380
 we should have 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:40.530
 to see if I worked out if a starlet 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.870
 within the star itself you see that 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.210
 it looks pretty good, because I do not expect anything 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:48.210
 you liked the figure that you encourage 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:51.360
 to do it and you already tell me how 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:53.840
 it remains a greeting to all see you in 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.840
 another video
