he uses his computer to ship things that

are invisible to our eyes and makes them

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.030 
are invisible to our eyes and makes them
visible<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.900> what<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.409> do<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.799> take

visible so what I have to do is take

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.300 
visible so what I have to do is take
this<00:01:17.490> data<00:01:17.820> which<00:01:18.150> effectively<00:01:18.799> counts<00:01:19.799> as<00:01:19.950> as

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
what we have to do this take these these

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
our artists conceptions are exactly what

these<00:02:25.980> things<00:02:26.010> look<00:02:26.280> like<00:02:26.400> because<00:02:26.970> literally

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
these things look like because literally

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.140 
these things look like because literally
we<00:02:27.930> don't<00:02:28.110> know<00:02:28.290> but<00:02:28.920> what<00:02:29.069> we<00:02:29.190> can<00:02:29.489> do<00:02:29.700> is<00:02:29.910> get

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
we don't know but what we can do is get
