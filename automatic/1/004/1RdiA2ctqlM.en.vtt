 then go some subaru forester 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.920
 the first generation was born in 1997 and 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.320
 then what happened 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.850
 and this success a lot of things are 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.220
 15 years passed the first generation 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.480
 become the second the third and then they are 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.820
 just arrived the one we present 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.989
 today that the fourth generation 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.690
 an evolution of the car it has 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:53.020
 brought the forest air to become by 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.629
 station wagon is raised have its own suv 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.090
 not by chance now you want by size 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:01.230
 wiper philosophy especially constructive 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.230
 the car has changed considerably 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.970
 neo of design as it has changed 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.290
 the aesthetics are completely different though 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.210
 it's not that we've been upset 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.220
 completely what is the image of 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.130
 forrest now the car has a footprint 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.970
 very massive and very full-bodied 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.670
 new optical groups in two months 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.439
 we like to say the heart two years in the 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.539
 two souls are all represented by 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.789
 this long aesthetic if we want more 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:36.700
 classic and a lot much more 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.649
 aggressive much more sporting than diani 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.750
 we get these position lights a 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.190
 forms if you have no particular in the 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.200
 channel frame for which 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.690
 immediately but hills to the eye that 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.690
 has among the corresponding brands on mara 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.100
 also the interior even inside everything 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.799
 what you see at your fingertips yes 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.810
 it hides to use that style 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.789
 classic now say the goalkeeper a lot 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.710
 clean a series of commands in the 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.899
 central plank and above all to 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.780
 dying are quietly making people understand 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:11.030
 what can be the effectiveness that can 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.230
 give the user of various functions that yes 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.480
 can find the interior of the car 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.080
 of the new multimedia system on 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.959
 multifunction system that of course 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.810
 from a series of information to the user 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.670
 there are many system interfaces 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.640
 multifunction and we ca n't 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.250
 quietly edit with with the 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.049
 fullback on the steering wheel here it is 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.049
 let's move on to the various information 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.569
 a substantial amount of work has been done 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.329
 inside the car 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.920
 you have come accessibility but for that 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:47.129
 regarding the versatility of the 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.620
 upright car has been advanced e 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:52.409
 well three centimeters high visibility 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.540
 not only frontal but also side not 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:57.030
 have succeeded from the distance region between 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.190
 front seats piccinini power sta 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.650
 increasing of incentive hordes in addition to 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.569
 that has also been changed tel 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.849
 in the back it was 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.980
 optimized in height and more means 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.420
 and comfort is also assured for the 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.459
 people who are sultan part 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.170
 positions also on the trunk are 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.290
 changes have been made in the sense 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:37.709
 that the capacity has been increased 50 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:40.709
 liters passed from 450 to 500 liters below 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:44.069
 the hood beats an urgent heart because 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.590
 to the traditional 2000 gasoline aspirated e 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.889
 2000 turbodiesel with power 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.859
 respectively of 150 horses is 147 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:55.650
 horses located place now a new engine 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:58.400
 very aggressive very sporty than well 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.780
 240 horses that will satisfy 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.669
 surely the needs of the geeks 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.230
 that they want to have not only 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:08.480
 in aesthetics but also under the hood 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.480
 the power to entertain 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.900
 regarding the diesel engine 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.150
 we still remain faithful to it in return 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.160
 mechanical on the gasoline mode 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.020
 we have some news because 2000 is 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.980
 expired at a new lineartronic gearbox 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.650
 with variable traction system a 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.390
 say with the i to drive introduced for 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.880
 the first time on our tip of 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.950
 sports diamond that holds the three 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.050
 operating mode with three 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.570
 different answers from the point of view 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.820
 Motor change connection not set 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.880
 directly from are set 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.010
 directly from the gearbox side 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.970
 of the part of the gearbox handle e 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.620
 then they can be edited directly 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.200
 sharp sport is practically 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.090
 the maximum explosion as a response from 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.550
 engine part gearbox rather than 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.680
 sport or smart when 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.690
 I want to have an answer is yes 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.300
 sporty but not exaggerated and rather 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.060
 of the intelligent ready 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.190
 not normal where I want to economize 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.000
 in terms of consumption and still there 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:23.099
 written hicks modena true novelty of 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.099
 this car xv of the new system 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:28.680
 electronic linking 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:32.340
 engine transmission brakes where it naturally gives 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.830
 the possibility also to a neophyte of 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.509
 to be able to get out of power 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.060
 some way exceed any 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:40.770
 road surface adversities work up 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.360
 at a speed of 40 per hour 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.770
 after forty then it is excluded 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.770
 automatically system 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.679
 four are the conformations of 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.179
 outfitting for petrol 4 

00:05:53.679 --> 00:05:56.409
 the same are practically the same 

00:05:55.179 --> 00:05:58.449
 disney conformations 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:01.029
 we start from comfort the entry version 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:03.159
 level of the car to switch to 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:06.099
 third set trend and exclusives 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:07.719
 and the last one is the dynamic adone dynamic 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:09.459
 from an aesthetic point of view it is one 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:12.899
 very sporty conformation very much 

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:14.949
 aggressive prices from 

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:17.020
 29.990 and the version of course 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:19.330
 As for the comfort for 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:23.729
 diesel comfort to an increase of approx 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.729
 2 thousand euros therefore it passes to 31
