easier because you can just you can use
that<00:02:44.080> for<00:02:44.350> so<00:02:44.530> many<00:02:44.590> things<00:02:44.980> can<00:02:45.340> trust<00:02:45.640> it's

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
that for so many things can trust it's

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.760 
that for so many things can trust it's
usually<00:02:46.180> they<00:02:46.390> wants<00:02:46.570> to<00:02:46.630> feel<00:02:46.780> close<00:02:47.020> so<00:02:47.440> we

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
usually they wants to feel close so we

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.450 
usually they wants to feel close so we
nurse<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.340> it's<00:02:48.489> really<00:02:49.120> handy
