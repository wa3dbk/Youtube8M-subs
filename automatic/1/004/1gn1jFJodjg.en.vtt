Steve<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.619> don't<00:00:23.130> know<00:00:23.189> why<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.369> didn't<00:00:23.640> decide

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
Steve I don't know why I didn't decide

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.370 
Steve I don't know why I didn't decide
to<00:00:23.910> take<00:00:24.150> Astro<00:00:24.600> gaming<00:00:24.630> Steve<00:00:25.019> wasn't

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
to take Astro gaming Steve wasn't

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.689 
to take Astro gaming Steve wasn't
thinking<00:00:25.619> about<00:00:25.680> channel<00:00:26.130> branding<00:00:26.340> at<00:00:26.580> that

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
thinking about channel branding at that

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.750 
thinking about channel branding at that
time<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:27.090> was<00:00:27.330> aged<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.869> go<00:00:27.990> so<00:00:28.260> before<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.130> knew

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
time I was aged to go so before I knew

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.790 
time I was aged to go so before I knew
you<00:00:30.179> know<00:00:30.300> anyone<00:00:30.630> knew<00:00:30.840> who<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.050> was<00:00:31.170> or

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
you know anyone knew who I was or

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.340 
you know anyone knew who I was or
actually<00:00:32.669> cared<00:00:32.940> for<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.660> matter<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:33.989> these

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
actually cared for that matter so these

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.979 
actually cared for that matter so these
are<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.680> most<00:00:34.920> compact<00:00:35.850> combination<00:00:36.750> locks

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
are the most compact combination locks

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.440 
are the most compact combination locks
in<00:00:37.399> existence<00:00:38.600> possibly<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:40.430> mean<00:00:41.430> look<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:42.120> is

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
in existence possibly I mean look it is

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.590 
in existence possibly I mean look it is
a<00:00:42.590> that's<00:00:43.590> those<00:00:43.739> things<00:00:44.040> over<00:00:44.280> there<00:00:44.600> three

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
a that's those things over there three

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.340 
a that's those things over there three
blocks<00:00:45.989> thick<00:00:46.379> including<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.520> buttons<00:00:47.969> and

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
blocks thick including the buttons and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.380 
blocks thick including the buttons and
the<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:50.039> only<00:00:50.160> downside<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.120> can't

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
the the only downside is that you can't

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.959 
the the only downside is that you can't
just<00:00:52.170> push<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.440> few<00:00:52.710> buttons<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> back<00:00:53.670> and

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
just push a few buttons on the back and

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.270 
just push a few buttons on the back and
customize<00:00:54.600> your<00:00:54.719> combination<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.860> can

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
customize your combination you can

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.119 
customize your combination you can
create<00:00:57.090> your<00:00:57.360> own<00:00:57.420> combination<00:00:57.809> but<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.949> do

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
create your own combination but to do

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.369 
create your own combination but to do
that<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.969> need<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.300> move<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.600> pistons<00:01:01.050> around

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
that you need to move the pistons around

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.410 
that you need to move the pistons around
manually<00:01:02.390> however<00:01:03.390> these<00:01:03.719> new<00:01:04.229> designs<00:01:04.530> are

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
manually however these new designs are

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.620 
manually however these new designs are
these<00:01:06.439> work<00:01:07.439> from<00:01:07.740> both<00:01:07.979> sides<00:01:08.400> they<00:01:09.210> have<00:01:09.450> an

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
these work from both sides they have an

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.370 
these work from both sides they have an
override<00:01:10.260> control<00:01:10.860> from<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.880> inside<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
override control from the inside in the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.380 
override control from the inside in the
form<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.740> these<00:01:14.250> two<00:01:14.490> buttons<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> case<00:01:15.360> of

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
form of these two buttons in the case of

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.830 
form of these two buttons in the case of
this<00:01:15.720> one<00:01:15.990> or<00:01:16.200> some<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.250> them<00:01:17.400> just<00:01:17.430> have<00:01:18.030> one

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
this one or some of them just have one

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.160 
this one or some of them just have one
button<00:01:19.350> like<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.509> you<00:01:21.509> can<00:01:21.540> open<00:01:22.080> a

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
button like this and you can open a

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.920 
button like this and you can open a
close<00:01:22.409> your<00:01:22.650> door<00:01:22.920> from<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.790> inside<00:01:23.930> it's

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
close your door from the inside it's

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.770 
close your door from the inside it's
basically<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:26.040> master<00:01:26.820> override<00:01:27.299> control

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
basically a master override control

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.149 
basically a master override control
because<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.140> you're<00:01:28.320> already<00:01:28.530> on<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.770> inside

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
because if you're already on the inside

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.700 
because if you're already on the inside
then<00:01:29.759> it's<00:01:29.970> your<00:01:30.210> door<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.200> have<00:01:31.470> more

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
then it's your door so you have more

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.890 
then it's your door so you have more
control<00:01:31.920> from<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.670> inside<00:01:33.060> it's<00:01:33.600> very

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
control from the inside it's very

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.289 
control from the inside it's very
unlikely<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.799> someone<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.610> going<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.880> get<00:01:36.090> in

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
unlikely that someone is going to get in

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.390 
unlikely that someone is going to get in
by<00:01:36.540> random<00:01:36.960> chance<00:01:36.990> because<00:01:37.530> all<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.920> these

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
by random chance because all of these

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.109 
by random chance because all of these
designs<00:01:38.880> are<00:01:39.140> four<00:01:40.140> by<00:01:40.409> six<00:01:41.119> combination

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
designs are four by six combination

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.810 
designs are four by six combination
locks<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.409> lot<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.920> buttons<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.670> is

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
locks that is a lot of buttons that is

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.270 
locks that is a lot of buttons that is
twenty<00:01:45.299> four<00:01:45.600> buttons<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.710> did<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.070> mass

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
twenty four buttons and I did that mass

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.760 
twenty four buttons and I did that mass
on<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.579> spot<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:48.000> proud<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.540> myself<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.110> once

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
on the spot I proud of myself and once

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.870 
on the spot I proud of myself and once
the<00:01:49.979> lock<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:51.000> reset<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.619> just

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
the lock is reset like I just

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.270 
the lock is reset like I just
demonstrated<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.329> can<00:01:54.570> open<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.380> door<00:01:55.590> walk

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
demonstrated you can open the door walk

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.880 
demonstrated you can open the door walk
outside<00:01:56.549> close<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.659> door<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.350> it's<00:01:58.560> locked

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
outside close the door and it's locked

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.730 
outside close the door and it's locked
again<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.670> someone<00:02:00.299> would<00:02:00.450> have<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.869> redo<00:02:01.560> the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
again so someone would have to redo the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.039 
again so someone would have to redo the
combination<00:02:02.340> lock<00:02:02.490> now<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.090> system<00:02:03.780> i<00:02:03.869> came

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
combination lock now the system i came

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.230 
combination lock now the system i came
up<00:02:04.170> with<00:02:04.350> those<00:02:04.560> was<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.399> little<00:02:05.820> bit<00:02:05.939> awkward

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
up with those was a little bit awkward

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.719 
up with those was a little bit awkward
to<00:02:06.270> understand<00:02:06.840> these<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.129> download<00:02:08.399> the

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
to understand these you can download the

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.729 
to understand these you can download the
mcedit<00:02:09.270> schematics<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.020> description<00:02:10.649> and

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
mcedit schematics in the description and

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.430 
mcedit schematics in the description and
it's<00:02:11.160> got<00:02:11.340> signs<00:02:11.700> here<00:02:12.120> on<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.510> front<00:02:12.780> which

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
it's got signs here on the front which

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.380 
it's got signs here on the front which
just<00:02:13.560> show<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:13.950> how<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.400> open<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.000> lock<00:02:15.180> for

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
just show you how to open the lock for

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
just show you how to open the lock for
example<00:02:15.780> that's<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.740> first<00:02:17.010> button<00:02:17.310> there

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
example that's the first button there

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.980 
example that's the first button there
was<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.440> second<00:02:19.890> too<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:20.970> that<00:02:21.270> is<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.450> second

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
was a second too so that is the second

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.820 
was a second too so that is the second
button<00:02:22.200> of<00:02:22.530> there<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.070> then<00:02:24.060> three<00:02:24.630> is<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.500> 1

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
button of there and then three is that 1

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.400 
button of there and then three is that 1
and<00:02:26.900> 4<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.110> 5<00:02:28.370> respectively<00:02:29.370> behind<00:02:29.910> there<00:02:30.540> so

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
and 4 and 5 respectively behind there so

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.940 
and 4 and 5 respectively behind there so
yeah<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.130> some<00:02:32.490> of<00:02:32.610> them<00:02:32.850> have<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.780> line<00:02:34.260> exilim

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
yeah and some of them have a line exilim

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.830 
yeah and some of them have a line exilim
for<00:02:35.190> example<00:02:35.580> this<00:02:35.760> one<00:02:36.030> once<00:02:36.570> you've<00:02:36.720> done

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
for example this one once you've done

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.940 
for example this one once you've done
one<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.380> two<00:02:37.830> three<00:02:38.330> and<00:02:39.330> four<00:02:40.140> you'll<00:02:40.740> have

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
one and two three and four you'll have

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.860 
one and two three and four you'll have
to<00:02:41.130> press<00:02:41.340> for<00:02:41.700> quickly<00:02:42.120> after<00:02:42.660> pressing

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
to press for quickly after pressing

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.040 
to press for quickly after pressing
number<00:02:43.230> three<00:02:43.470> before<00:02:44.120> number<00:02:45.120> three<00:02:45.480> has

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
number three before number three has

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.620 
number three before number three has
retracted<00:02:46.770> so<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:48.030> just<00:02:48.210> makes<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.510> even

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
retracted so that just makes it even

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.920 
retracted so that just makes it even
more<00:02:48.780> difficult<00:02:48.930> to<00:02:49.760> do<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.940> combination<00:02:51.630> it

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
more difficult to do the combination it

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.920 
more difficult to do the combination it
makes<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.500> pretty<00:02:53.190> much<00:02:53.490> impossible<00:02:54.150> that

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
makes it pretty much impossible that

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.450 
makes it pretty much impossible that
someone<00:02:55.350> would<00:02:55.530> get<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.800> by<00:02:55.980> random<00:02:56.430> chance

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
someone would get it by random chance

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.940 
someone would get it by random chance
and<00:02:56.970> then<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:57.960> have<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.200> go<00:02:58.290> back<00:02:58.530> over<00:02:58.590> here

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
and then you have to go back over here

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.640 
and then you have to go back over here
25<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.610> of<00:03:00.420> course<00:03:00.690> it<00:03:00.900> is<00:03:01.080> completely

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
25 and of course it is completely

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.220 
25 and of course it is completely
survival<00:03:02.430> friendly<00:03:02.880> which<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:03.660> unlike<00:03:04.020> most

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
survival friendly which is unlike most

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.290 
survival friendly which is unlike most
of<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.500> stuff<00:03:04.710> I<00:03:04.830> do<00:03:04.890> because<00:03:05.400> generally<00:03:06.270> I

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
of the stuff I do because generally I

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.600 
of the stuff I do because generally I
find<00:03:06.390> creative<00:03:06.990> stuff<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.950> be<00:03:08.100> more<00:03:08.340> fun

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
find creative stuff to be more fun

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.070 
find creative stuff to be more fun
because<00:03:08.880> I<00:03:09.090> can<00:03:09.240> make<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.570> more<00:03:09.720> complicated

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
because I can make it more complicated

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.100 
because I can make it more complicated
but<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:11.370> could<00:03:12.060> just<00:03:12.240> couldn't<00:03:12.540> pass<00:03:12.660> up<00:03:12.870> this

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
but I could just couldn't pass up this

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.190 
but I could just couldn't pass up this
idea<00:03:13.350> I<00:03:13.650> mean<00:03:13.860> look<00:03:14.040> at<00:03:14.190> it<00:03:14.400> so<00:03:15.240> as<00:03:15.270> you<00:03:15.660> can<00:03:15.840> see

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
idea I mean look at it so as you can see

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.570 
idea I mean look at it so as you can see
I've<00:03:16.440> got<00:03:16.580> six<00:03:17.580> designs<00:03:18.260> ready<00:03:19.260> made<00:03:19.620> here<00:03:20.280> for

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
I've got six designs ready made here for

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.790 
I've got six designs ready made here for
you<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.790> download<00:03:20.940> in<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.480> description<00:03:21.800> but

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
you to download in the description but

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.580 
you to download in the description but
you<00:03:22.890> can<00:03:23.040> make<00:03:23.160> your<00:03:23.370> own<00:03:23.430> designs<00:03:24.300> as<00:03:24.510> well

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
you can make your own designs as well

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.740 
you can make your own designs as well
really<00:03:25.590> all<00:03:25.770> this<00:03:26.160> is<00:03:26.370> it's<00:03:27.120> a<00:03:27.270> series<00:03:27.630> of

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
really all this is it's a series of

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.590 
really all this is it's a series of
Pistons<00:03:28.290> that<00:03:28.470> moves<00:03:29.070> a<00:03:29.250> block<00:03:29.489> around<00:03:29.760> so<00:03:30.390> if

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
Pistons that moves a block around so if

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.770 
Pistons that moves a block around so if
I<00:03:30.750> go<00:03:30.780> back<00:03:31.020> to<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.950> first<00:03:32.250> one<00:03:32.610> where<00:03:33.360> there's

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
I go back to the first one where there's

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.590 
I go back to the first one where there's
no<00:03:34.430> there's<00:03:35.430> no<00:03:35.520> one's<00:03:35.850> where<00:03:36.030> have<00:03:36.209> to<00:03:36.360> press

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
no there's no one's where have to press

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.510 
no there's no one's where have to press
them<00:03:36.840> quickly<00:03:37.140> then<00:03:37.530> I'll<00:03:37.770> be<00:03:37.950> able<00:03:37.980> to<00:03:38.190> press

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
them quickly then I'll be able to press

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.890 
them quickly then I'll be able to press
them<00:03:38.730> one<00:03:38.910> by<00:03:39.090> one<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.450> show<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:39.720> what's

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
them one by one and show you what's

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.780 
them one by one and show you what's
going<00:03:40.050> on<00:03:40.230> behind<00:03:40.350> them<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:41.040> here<00:03:41.280> is<00:03:41.310> how

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
going on behind them so here is how

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.729 
going on behind them so here is how
you'd<00:03:42.000> go<00:03:42.209> about<00:03:42.450> actually<00:03:42.780> creating<00:03:43.470> one

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
you'd go about actually creating one

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.949 
you'd go about actually creating one
yourself<00:03:44.640> you<00:03:45.150> just<00:03:45.330> need<00:03:45.510> to<00:03:45.600> reverse

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
yourself you just need to reverse

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.890 
yourself you just need to reverse
engineer<00:03:46.519> how<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:47.580> Pistons<00:03:48.180> are<00:03:48.450> going<00:03:48.750> to

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
engineer how the Pistons are going to

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.530 
engineer how the Pistons are going to
work<00:03:49.110> with<00:03:49.620> your<00:03:49.800> brain<00:03:50.070> and<00:03:50.340> if<00:03:51.209> you've<00:03:51.390> got<00:03:51.510> a

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
work with your brain and if you've got a

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.080 
work with your brain and if you've got a
logical<00:03:52.019> mind<00:03:52.230> then<00:03:53.100> it's<00:03:53.489> not<00:03:53.730> actually<00:03:54.060> that

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
logical mind then it's not actually that

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.090 
logical mind then it's not actually that
hard<00:03:54.239> so<00:03:55.050> you<00:03:55.110> just<00:03:55.290> need<00:03:55.470> to<00:03:55.709> press<00:03:55.890> this

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
hard so you just need to press this

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.860 
hard so you just need to press this
piston<00:03:56.580> to<00:03:56.850> pull<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.209> block<00:03:57.390> into<00:03:57.660> there

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
piston to pull the block into there

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.810 
piston to pull the block into there
that's<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.620> sticky<00:03:58.800> piston<00:03:59.070> so<00:03:59.459> that<00:03:59.700> would

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
that's a sticky piston so that would

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.030 
that's a sticky piston so that would
pull<00:04:00.000> it<00:04:00.090> up<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.480> there<00:04:00.720> then<00:04:01.410> this<00:04:01.590> piston

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
pull it up to there then this piston

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.070 
pull it up to there then this piston
would<00:04:02.190> push<00:04:02.400> it<00:04:02.550> over<00:04:02.820> to<00:04:02.970> there<00:04:03.209> that<00:04:03.720> sticky

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
would push it over to there that sticky

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.410 
would push it over to there that sticky
piston<00:04:04.410> would<00:04:04.560> pull<00:04:05.220> it<00:04:05.370> into<00:04:05.610> that<00:04:05.940> position

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
piston would pull it into that position

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.479 
piston would pull it into that position
and<00:04:06.810> then<00:04:07.260> that<00:04:07.470> piston<00:04:07.860> would<00:04:08.010> push<00:04:08.190> it<00:04:08.340> down

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
and then that piston would push it down

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.490 
and then that piston would push it down
into<00:04:08.910> there<00:04:09.239> and<00:04:09.420> as<00:04:09.840> you<00:04:09.959> can<00:04:10.080> see<00:04:10.110> once

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
into there and as you can see once

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.310 
into there and as you can see once
there's<00:04:10.739> a<00:04:10.830> block<00:04:11.070> in<00:04:11.310> that<00:04:11.730> position<00:04:12.320> like

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
there's a block in that position like

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.090 
there's a block in that position like
this<00:04:13.350> for<00:04:13.830> example<00:04:14.720> that<00:04:15.720> redstone<00:04:16.530> is<00:04:16.680> not

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
this for example that redstone is not

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.250 
this for example that redstone is not
powered<00:04:17.609> anymore<00:04:18.030> so<00:04:18.570> neither<00:04:18.840> of<00:04:19.049> these

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
powered anymore so neither of these

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.259 
powered anymore so neither of these
Pistons<00:04:19.769> are<00:04:19.919> powered<00:04:20.190> and<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.880> door<00:04:21.090> will

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
Pistons are powered and the door will

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.300 
Pistons are powered and the door will
retract<00:04:21.690> and<00:04:22.020> of<00:04:22.560> course<00:04:22.800> resetting<00:04:23.490> it

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
retract and of course resetting it

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.090 
retract and of course resetting it
is<00:04:24.520> basically<00:04:25.419> let's<00:04:26.230> say<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.590> block<00:04:26.830> has

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
is basically let's say the block has

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.250 
is basically let's say the block has
been<00:04:27.160> moved<00:04:28.090> around<00:04:28.330> and<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:28.900> locks<00:04:29.080> been

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
been moved around and the locks been

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.980 
been moved around and the locks been
unlocked<00:04:29.680> what<00:04:30.250> I'd<00:04:30.340> need<00:04:30.520> to<00:04:30.550> do<00:04:30.790> is<00:04:31.060> press

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
unlocked what I'd need to do is press

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.560 
unlocked what I'd need to do is press
that<00:04:32.290> button<00:04:32.530> then<00:04:32.889> that<00:04:33.100> button<00:04:33.520> and<00:04:34.270> it

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
that button then that button and it

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:35.850 
that button then that button and it
would<00:04:34.660> pull<00:04:34.870> the<00:04:34.990> block<00:04:35.169> away<00:04:35.320> and<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:35.680> door

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
would pull the block away and the door

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.000 
would pull the block away and the door
has<00:04:36.010> shut<00:04:36.250> now<00:04:36.940> if<00:04:37.150> I<00:04:37.270> just<00:04:37.480> pull<00:04:38.410> that<00:04:38.440> pistol

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
has shut now if I just pull that pistol

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.670 
has shut now if I just pull that pistol
down<00:04:39.040> out<00:04:39.430> of<00:04:39.550> the<00:04:39.669> way<00:04:39.850> then<00:04:40.540> it's<00:04:40.840> reset<00:04:41.470> and

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
down out of the way then it's reset and

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.580 
down out of the way then it's reset and
of<00:04:42.520> course<00:04:42.790> when<00:04:43.150> you<00:04:43.330> actually<00:04:43.570> put<00:04:44.410> these

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
of course when you actually put these

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.760 
of course when you actually put these
designs<00:04:44.770> to<00:04:45.340> use<00:04:45.639> you<00:04:46.419> will<00:04:46.570> want<00:04:46.810> to<00:04:47.020> destroy

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
designs to use you will want to destroy

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.850 
designs to use you will want to destroy
this<00:04:48.370> password<00:04:48.730> wall<00:04:49.300> at<00:04:49.720> the<00:04:49.780> front<00:04:50.110> here<00:04:50.169> so

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
this password wall at the front here so

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.590 
this password wall at the front here so
you're<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.280> only<00:04:51.430> one<00:04:51.730> who<00:04:52.150> knows<00:04:52.389> the

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
you're the only one who knows the

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.530 
you're the only one who knows the
password<00:04:53.040> they<00:04:54.040> come<00:04:54.340> with<00:04:54.730> the<00:04:54.970> password

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
password they come with the password

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.080 
password they come with the password
walls<00:04:55.840> in<00:04:56.169> the<00:04:56.470> schematic<00:04:56.680> so<00:04:57.580> that<00:04:57.729> you<00:04:57.850> can

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
walls in the schematic so that you can

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.080 
walls in the schematic so that you can
memorize<00:04:58.690> the<00:04:59.200> password<00:04:59.590> yourself<00:04:59.979> but<00:05:00.940> then

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
memorize the password yourself but then

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.210 
memorize the password yourself but then
delete<00:05:01.510> the<00:05:01.720> password<00:05:02.169> wall<00:05:02.380> because<00:05:03.130> you

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
delete the password wall because you

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.950 
delete the password wall because you
don't<00:05:03.370> want<00:05:03.430> anyone<00:05:03.850> else<00:05:04.000> to<00:05:04.690> know<00:05:04.720> the

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
don't want anyone else to know the

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.710 
don't want anyone else to know the
password<00:05:05.470> that's<00:05:05.919> why<00:05:06.400> it's<00:05:06.610> a<00:05:06.790> as<00:05:07.030> a<00:05:07.090> password

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
password that's why it's a as a password

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.640 
password that's why it's a as a password
so<00:05:08.530> that's<00:05:09.370> about<00:05:09.550> it<00:05:09.960> these<00:05:10.960> are<00:05:11.320> the

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
so that's about it these are the

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.860 
so that's about it these are the
smallest<00:05:12.660> most<00:05:13.660> compact<00:05:14.490> simplest<00:05:15.870> locks

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
smallest most compact simplest locks

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.590 
smallest most compact simplest locks

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.360 
knowledge very primitive technology is
just<00:05:22.090> a<00:05:22.240> bunch<00:05:22.389> of<00:05:22.510> Pistons<00:05:22.930> but<00:05:23.500> I<00:05:23.770> think<00:05:24.250> it

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
just a bunch of Pistons but I think it

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.740 
just a bunch of Pistons but I think it
is<00:05:24.720> the<00:05:25.720> smallest<00:05:26.020> possible<00:05:26.410> kind<00:05:26.860> of
