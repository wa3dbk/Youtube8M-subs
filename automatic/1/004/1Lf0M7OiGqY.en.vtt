00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
out all the time we're seeing them like

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.920 
out all the time we're seeing them like
constantly<00:02:58.890> from<00:02:59.520> when<00:03:00.000> I<00:03:00.030> was<00:03:00.209> young<00:03:00.480> too<00:03:00.510> now

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
constantly from when I was young too now

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.930 
constantly from when I was young too now
they<00:03:01.440> were<00:03:01.560> always<00:03:01.860> made<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.280> like<00:03:02.459> in<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.880> out

they were always made it like in and out
of<00:03:03.000> style<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:03.840> I<00:03:04.050> do<00:03:04.350> think<00:03:04.890> that<00:03:04.980> eventually

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
of style so I do think that eventually

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.120 
of style so I do think that eventually
it<00:03:06.239> would<00:03:06.780> be<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:06.959> nice<00:03:07.170> thing<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.410> add<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.680> your

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
them until I started mixing them in

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.940 
them until I started mixing them in
different<00:03:21.570> combinations<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.500> making<00:03:22.830> them

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
different combinations and making them

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.310 
different combinations and making them
work<00:03:23.160> so<00:03:23.730> maybe<00:03:24.299> gradually<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:25.019> might<00:03:25.170> be<00:03:25.290> a

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
work so maybe gradually it might be a

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.190 
work so maybe gradually it might be a
nice<00:03:25.500> on<00:03:25.739> nice<00:03:26.250> piece<00:03:27.000> to<00:03:27.269> actually<00:03:27.720> add<00:03:27.840> real

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
to do the glass pearls that are like

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.080 
to do the glass pearls that are like
semi<00:05:00.930> pearls<00:05:01.320> do<00:05:01.890> them<00:05:02.070> in<00:05:02.250> neutral<00:05:02.760> colors

semi pearls do them in neutral colors

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.850 
semi pearls do them in neutral colors
because<00:05:03.360> they<00:05:03.510> look<00:05:03.720> more<00:05:03.870> real<00:05:04.110> or<00:05:04.320> blacks

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
pinks all work because real pearls

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.860 
pinks all work because real pearls
actually<00:05:11.280> come<00:05:11.460> in<00:05:11.610> those<00:05:11.730> colors<00:05:11.970> so<00:05:12.630> that

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
actually come in those colors so that

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.390

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
works and you start getting into those

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.730 
works and you start getting into those
like<00:05:14.520> hot<00:05:14.760> pink<00:05:15.120> sort<00:05:15.510> eels<00:05:15.870> or<00:05:16.170> early<00:05:16.410> bright
