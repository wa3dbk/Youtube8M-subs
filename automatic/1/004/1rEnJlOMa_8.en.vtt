00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
ground and if the prints top of it but

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.370 
ground and if the prints top of it but
you<00:02:37.310> just<00:02:37.430> want<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.640> make<00:02:37.730> sure<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:38.120> like

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
you just want to make sure that like

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.330 
you just want to make sure that like
it's<00:02:39.380> all<00:02:39.560> even

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
it's all even

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:59.290 
it's all even
so<00:02:40.940> each<00:02:41.480> board<00:02:41.870> should<00:02:42.140> approximately<00:02:58.300> then

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
so each board should approximately then

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.380 
so each board should approximately then
when<00:02:59.810> that's<00:02:59.900> all<00:03:00.110> done<00:03:00.670> find<00:03:01.670> like<00:03:01.910> all<00:03:02.180> the

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
when that's all done find like all the

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.750 
when that's all done find like all the
heavy<00:03:02.570> books<00:03:02.870> or<00:03:03.140> bricks<00:03:03.380> that<00:03:03.560> you<00:03:03.620> have<00:03:03.920> and

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
heavy books or bricks that you have and

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.780 
heavy books or bricks that you have and
place<00:03:05.720> them<00:03:05.989> around<00:03:08.650> on<00:03:09.650> all<00:03:09.709> sides<00:03:10.190> of<00:03:10.730> the

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
place them around on all sides of the

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.350 
place them around on all sides of the
board<00:03:11.320> and<00:03:12.320> then<00:03:12.530> wait<00:03:13.340> about<00:03:13.400> 12<00:03:13.760> hours<00:03:13.940> and

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
board and then wait about 12 hours and

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.800 
board and then wait about 12 hours and
then<00:03:14.510> just<00:03:14.840> dry<00:03:18.190> okay<00:03:19.190> so<00:03:19.580> the<00:03:20.390> last<00:03:20.510> thing<00:03:20.720> you

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
then just dry okay so the last thing you

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.930 
then just dry okay so the last thing you
need<00:03:20.840> to<00:03:20.959> do<00:03:21.170> is<00:03:21.440> put<00:03:21.830> on<00:03:21.950> a<00:03:21.980> coat<00:03:22.250> of<00:03:22.580> varnish

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
need to do is put on a coat of varnish

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.759 
need to do is put on a coat of varnish
that's<00:03:23.360> going<00:03:23.480> to<00:03:23.540> help<00:03:23.660> protect<00:03:23.840> the

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
that's going to help protect the

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.170 
that's going to help protect the
painting<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:25.280> make<00:03:25.370> it<00:03:25.489> last<00:03:25.580> for<00:03:25.850> long<00:03:25.940> time

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
painting and make it last for long time

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.330 
painting and make it last for long time
so<00:03:26.480> a<00:03:26.810> couple<00:03:27.260> things<00:03:27.500> you<00:03:27.560> can<00:03:27.590> do<00:03:27.799> is<00:03:28.040> just

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
so a couple things you can do is just

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.910 
so a couple things you can do is just
get<00:03:28.489> some<00:03:28.790> gloss<00:03:29.750> varnish<00:03:30.170> I<00:03:30.560> like<00:03:30.769> that

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
get some gloss varnish I like that

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.240 
get some gloss varnish I like that
better

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
better

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.280 
better
I<00:03:31.430> didn't<00:03:32.299> really<00:03:32.510> carnage<00:03:32.870> but<00:03:32.989> I<00:03:33.049> like<00:03:33.170> to

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
I didn't really carnage but I like to

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.539 
I didn't really carnage but I like to
gloss<00:03:33.500> because<00:03:33.650> it<00:03:33.860> gives<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:34.100> like<00:03:34.220> a<00:03:34.250> shiny

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
gloss because it gives it like a shiny

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.539 
gloss because it gives it like a shiny
feel<00:03:35.019> makes<00:03:36.019> it<00:03:36.140> look<00:03:36.260> wet<00:03:36.739> kind<00:03:37.250> of<00:03:37.340> like<00:03:37.430> an

feel makes it look wet kind of like an

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.910 
feel makes it look wet kind of like an

in<00:04:12.540> like<00:04:12.780> an<00:04:12.900> hour<00:04:13.019> but<00:04:13.409> to<00:04:14.099> get<00:04:14.219> it<00:04:14.310> really

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
in like an hour but to get it really

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.069 
in like an hour but to get it really
really<00:04:14.640> dry<00:04:14.879> maybe<00:04:15.359> taking<00:04:15.629> like<00:04:15.719> six<00:04:15.959> hours

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079

or<00:04:16.440> something<00:04:16.590> like<00:04:16.709> that<00:04:16.859> then<00:04:17.459> you're<00:04:17.759> ready

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
or something like that then you're ready

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.120 
or something like that then you're ready
to<00:04:18.030> hang<00:04:18.389> put<00:04:18.780> a<00:04:18.810> little<00:04:18.930> backing<00:04:19.350> on<00:04:19.470> it<00:04:19.680> I

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
to hang put a little backing on it I

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.120 
to hang put a little backing on it I
wouldn't<00:04:21.000> suggest<00:04:21.350> just<00:04:22.350> hanging<00:04:22.710> it<00:04:22.800> on<00:04:22.889> two

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
wouldn't suggest just hanging it on two

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.560 
wouldn't suggest just hanging it on two
studs<00:04:23.460> with<00:04:23.669> just<00:04:23.820> putting<00:04:23.970> some<00:04:24.270> screws<00:04:24.539> in

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
studs with just putting some screws in

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.310 
studs with just putting some screws in
the<00:04:24.810> sides<00:04:25.080> and<00:04:25.620> putting<00:04:26.580> a<00:04:26.669> wire<00:04:26.880> in<00:04:27.150> between

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
the sides and putting a wire in between

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.600 
the sides and putting a wire in between
that's<00:04:28.320> always<00:04:28.530> a<00:04:28.620> good<00:04:28.740> thing<00:04:28.800> to<00:04:29.009> do<00:04:29.130> so

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
that's always a good thing to do so

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.779 
that's always a good thing to do so
there<00:04:30.539> you<00:04:30.660> go<00:04:30.780> that's<00:04:31.020> how<00:04:31.199> you<00:04:31.259> put<00:04:31.979> a<00:04:32.190> frame

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
there you go that's how you put a frame

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:34.850 
there you go that's how you put a frame
on<00:04:33.150> a<00:04:33.210> painting<00:04:33.780> and<00:04:33.990> make<00:04:34.139> it<00:04:34.320> a<00:04:34.350> finished

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860
