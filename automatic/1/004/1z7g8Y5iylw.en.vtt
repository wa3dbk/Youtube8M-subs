00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
fast okay so let's start from scratch at

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.900 
fast okay so let's start from scratch at
our<00:00:16.289> object<00:00:16.680> level<00:00:16.830> first<00:00:17.460> this<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.789> an

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
our object level first this is an

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.970 
our object level first this is an
ambulance<00:00:18.359> engine<00:00:18.570> i<00:00:18.660> made<00:00:18.900> show<00:00:19.439> an<00:00:19.710> example

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
ambulance engine i made show an example

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.290 
ambulance engine i made show an example
of<00:00:20.160> what<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.400> looks<00:00:20.520> like<00:00:20.640> i<00:00:20.789> put<00:00:21.000> this<00:00:21.119> little

of what it looks like i put this little

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.060 
of what it looks like i put this little
neck<00:00:21.600> on<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:22.199> texture<00:00:22.650> on<00:00:22.740> there<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:22.980> these

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
neck on that texture on there in these

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.560 
neck on that texture on there in these
blocks<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.670> his<00:00:23.760> tea<00:00:23.910> pot<00:00:24.090> just<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.390> show<00:00:24.539> you

blocks and his tea pot just to show you

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.599 
blocks and his tea pot just to show you
what<00:00:24.689> ambient<00:00:25.199> occlusion<00:00:25.350> looks<00:00:25.769> like<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.519> we

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
what ambient occlusion looks like and we

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.070 
what ambient occlusion looks like and we
can<00:00:26.730> go<00:00:26.849> into<00:00:27.000> add<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.300> adjust<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.779> ambient

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
can go into add to adjust the ambient

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.810 
can go into add to adjust the ambient
occlusion<00:00:28.199> in<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.680> later<00:00:28.830> video<00:00:29.039> this<00:00:29.519> one<00:00:29.699> is

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
occlusion in a later video this one is

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.240 
occlusion in a later video this one is
just<00:00:29.849> show<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.269> how<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.480> use<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.800> let's<00:00:32.130> lay

V the vex global illumination that we

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.080 
V the vex global illumination that we
just<00:01:48.100> laid<00:01:48.250> down<00:01:49.080> okay<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:51.250> now<00:01:51.520> let's<00:01:51.790> go<00:01:52.060> to

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
just laid down okay so now let's go to

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.569 
just laid down okay so now let's go to
render<00:01:52.659> create<00:01:53.110> a<00:01:53.140> render<00:01:53.469> node<00:01:53.500> man<00:01:54.159> trip

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579

let's<00:01:57.579> go<00:01:57.729> to<00:01:57.820> our<00:01:57.880> shop

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.819 

network<00:02:01.359> make<00:02:01.960> sure<00:02:02.140> everything's<00:02:02.530> set<00:02:02.799> up

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
network make sure everything's set up

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.130 
network make sure everything's set up
I'm<00:02:03.579> going<00:02:03.729> to<00:02:03.789> take<00:02:03.909> my<00:02:04.060> global<00:02:04.359> tent<00:02:04.689> to<00:02:04.899> to

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.509 

sampling<00:02:08.140> quality<00:02:08.619> is<00:02:08.769> how<00:02:08.950> good<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:09.489> how

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
sampling quality is how good and how

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.820 
sampling quality is how good and how
well<00:02:09.970> it's<00:02:10.179> going<00:02:10.269> to<00:02:10.390> look<00:02:10.629> I'll<00:02:11.200> reduce<00:02:11.620> this

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
well it's going to look I'll reduce this

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.309 
well it's going to look I'll reduce this
to<00:02:11.890> 64<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:12.790> you'll<00:02:13.000> see<00:02:13.269> that<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.750> speed<00:02:14.200> of

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
to 64 and you'll see that the speed of

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.589 
to 64 and you'll see that the speed of
the<00:02:14.349> render<00:02:14.650> will<00:02:14.830> be<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.040> lot<00:02:15.250> better<00:02:15.480> but<00:02:16.480> it

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
the render will be a lot better but it

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.280 
the render will be a lot better but it
won't<00:02:16.720> be<00:02:16.810> as<00:02:16.980> sharp<00:02:17.980> let's<00:02:18.640> go<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.819> out<00:02:19.290> let's

look and see how we got this set up here
it's<00:03:26.370> on<00:03:26.489> repeat<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:27.150> let's<00:03:27.359> make<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.569> decal

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.500 

let's<00:03:31.230> go<00:03:31.409> to<00:03:31.500> our<00:03:31.579> out<00:03:32.579> and<00:03:32.939> let's<00:03:33.299> grab<00:03:33.480> a

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
let's go to our out and let's grab a

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.670 
let's go to our out and let's grab a
quick<00:03:33.780> render<00:03:36.079> this<00:03:37.079> is<00:03:37.260> what<00:03:37.439> it's<00:03:37.530> going<00:03:37.620> to

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
quick render this is what it's going to

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.729 
quick render this is what it's going to
look<00:03:37.769> like<00:03:37.950> before<00:03:38.400> our<00:03:38.970> displacement<00:03:39.620> as<00:03:40.620> you

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
look like before our displacement as you

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.050 
look like before our displacement as you
can<00:03:40.829> see<00:03:40.979> it's<00:03:41.129> just<00:03:41.159> a<00:03:41.310> regular<00:03:41.519> ambient

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
can see it's just a regular ambient

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.659 
can see it's just a regular ambient
occlusion<00:03:42.180> pass<00:03:42.949> so<00:03:43.949> now<00:03:44.099> that<00:03:44.250> we've<00:03:44.370> set<00:03:44.579> up

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
occlusion pass so now that we've set up

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:45.680 
occlusion pass so now that we've set up
our<00:03:44.790> displacement<00:03:45.120> let's<00:03:45.479> go<00:03:45.569> to<00:03:45.629> our

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
our displacement let's go to our

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.539 
our displacement let's go to our
material<00:03:46.109> tab<00:03:46.260> tablet<00:03:46.739> here<00:03:47.010> that's<00:03:47.190> this<00:03:47.340> one

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
material tab tablet here that's this one

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:53.910 
material tab tablet here that's this one
this<00:03:48.329> drag<00:03:48.659> and<00:03:48.840> drop<00:03:48.959> it<00:03:49.019> onto<00:03:49.319> our<00:03:49.879> grid

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.860 

now<00:03:54.490> as<00:03:54.700> you<00:03:54.819> can<00:03:54.940> see<00:03:55.140> we<00:03:56.140> have<00:03:56.349> our<00:03:56.380> apple

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
now as you can see we have our apple

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.140 
now as you can see we have our apple
right<00:03:58.870> in<00:03:59.050> the<00:03:59.170> middle<00:03:59.349> of<00:03:59.590> our<00:04:00.489> grid<00:04:00.810> okay

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
right in the middle of our grid okay

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.699 
right in the middle of our grid okay
this<00:04:04.150> is<00:04:04.390> how<00:04:04.510> you<00:04:04.599> make<00:04:04.989> an<00:04:05.260> ambient

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
this is how you make an ambient

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:11.220 
this is how you make an ambient
occlusion<00:04:05.890> pass<00:04:06.370> em<00:04:06.959> inside<00:04:08.700> Houdini<00:04:10.230> and

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
occlusion pass em inside Houdini and

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.140 
occlusion pass em inside Houdini and
it's<00:04:11.590> that<00:04:11.800> simple<00:04:12.069> you<00:04:12.580> lay<00:04:12.730> down<00:04:12.760> your<00:04:12.940> life

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
it's that simple you lay down your life

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.270 
it's that simple you lay down your life
template<00:04:13.690> you<00:04:14.170> lay<00:04:14.560> down<00:04:14.590> your<00:04:14.770> global

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
template you lay down your global

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.680 
template you lay down your global
illumination<00:04:15.489> inside<00:04:16.150> your<00:04:16.299> shop<00:04:16.450> network

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
illumination inside your shop network

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.659 
illumination inside your shop network
you<00:04:17.380> point<00:04:17.680> them<00:04:17.739> to<00:04:17.919> one<00:04:18.010> another<00:04:18.280> and<00:04:18.489> you

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
you point them to one another and you

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.400 
you point them to one another and you
have<00:04:18.820> your<00:04:18.970> ambient<00:04:19.329> occlusion<00:04:19.450> it's<00:04:20.200> that

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
have your ambient occlusion it's that

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.760 
have your ambient occlusion it's that
easy<00:04:20.560> thanks<00:04:21.250> for<00:04:21.370> watching<00:04:21.400> guys
