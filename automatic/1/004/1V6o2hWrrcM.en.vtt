assuming<00:00:32.220> a<00:00:32.840> targeting<00:00:33.840> read<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.170> write<00:00:34.320> this

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
assuming a targeting read and write this

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.080

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
shoots people in the back that's nice

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.440 
shoots people in the back that's nice
yeah<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.160> then<00:00:38.370> he<00:00:38.399> walks<00:00:38.670> up<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.850> what<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> new

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
yeah and then he walks up to what a new

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.389 
yeah and then he walks up to what a new
sister<00:00:40.020> balance<00:00:40.469> yeah<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> camera

spike<00:00:42.379> basically<00:00:43.379> we're<00:00:44.250> thinking<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.789> the

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:45.089 
spike basically we're thinking that the

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:47.660 
spike basically we're thinking that the
enemy<00:00:45.269> can<00:00:45.690> scrub<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.559> like<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.920> tack<00:00:47.219> insert

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
enemy can scrub that like a tack insert

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.599 
enemy can scrub that like a tack insert
the<00:00:48.089> modern<00:00:48.480> warfare<00:00:48.660> but<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.949> know<00:00:50.070> you

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
the modern warfare but you know you

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:51.770 
the modern warfare but you know you
better<00:00:50.789> place<00:00:51.089> it<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.269> a<00:00:51.300> room<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.749> can

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
better place it in a room and you can

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.360 
better place it in a room and you can
you<00:00:52.170> can<00:00:52.260> kind<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.440> see<00:00:52.679> what's<00:00:53.010> going<00:00:53.190> out<00:00:53.280> of

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
you can kind of see what's going out of

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.590 
you can kind of see what's going out of

right you know now you have a bomb on
wheels<00:01:12.600> right<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.350> legs<00:01:13.620> into<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> rocket

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
wheels right and this legs into a rocket

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.220 
wheels right and this legs into a rocket
a<00:01:14.580> rocket<00:01:15.090> launching<00:01:15.480> in<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.840> background

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
a rocket launching in the background

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.630 
a rocket launching in the background
this<00:01:16.380> multiplier<00:01:16.740> mapquest<00:01:17.220> out<00:01:17.370> of<00:01:17.520> nowhere

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
this multiplier mapquest out of nowhere

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.910 
this multiplier mapquest out of nowhere
we're<00:01:17.910> just<00:01:18.060> throwing<00:01:18.540> rocket<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.140> z<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.680> an

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
we're just throwing rocket so z is an

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.370 
we're just throwing rocket so z is an
objective<00:01:20.070> based<00:01:20.790> mode<00:01:21.480> of<00:01:21.690> some<00:01:21.840> kind<00:01:21.990> or<00:01:22.260> is

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
objective based mode of some kind or is

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.780 
objective based mode of some kind or is
it<00:01:22.500> just<00:01:22.650> i<00:01:22.950> mean<00:01:22.980> is<00:01:23.160> it<00:01:23.280> just<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.490> rocket

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
it just i mean is it just a rocket

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.520 
it just i mean is it just a rocket
taking<00:01:23.940> off<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.240> think<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:24.540> based<00:01:24.750> on<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
taking off I think it's based on the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.470 
taking off I think it's based on the
single-player<00:01:26.250> campaign<00:01:26.730> yeah<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.270> know<00:01:27.390> if

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
single-player campaign yeah you know if

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.210 
single-player campaign yeah you know if
I<00:01:27.600> i<00:01:27.630> think<00:01:27.960> if<00:01:28.050> i<00:01:28.170> had<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.410> guess<00:01:28.440> it<00:01:28.770> oh<00:01:28.920> it's

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
I i think if i had to guess it oh it's

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.650 
I i think if i had to guess it oh it's
gonna<00:01:29.310> work<00:01:29.490> its<00:01:29.670> way<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.090> campaign<00:01:30.450> mode

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
gonna work its way to the campaign mode

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.410 
gonna work its way to the campaign mode
then<00:01:30.840> again<00:01:31.830> this<00:01:32.010> is<00:01:32.160> the<00:01:32.190> crossbow<00:01:32.970> writing

ballistic knife is pretty awesome oh
yeah<00:01:37.890> he<00:01:38.160> shoots<00:01:38.580> it<00:01:38.790> into<00:01:38.940> this<00:01:39.150> poor<00:01:39.390> bastard
