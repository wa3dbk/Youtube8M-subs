00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
more than a little deceptive to call

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.399 
more than a little deceptive to call
this<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.049> WCW<00:01:58.979> game<00:01:59.220> when<00:01:59.729> WCW<00:02:00.170> literally<00:02:01.170> makes

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
this a WCW game when WCW literally makes

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.560 
this a WCW game when WCW literally makes
up<00:02:01.560> about<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.830> fourth<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.340> roster<00:02:02.850> now<00:02:03.450> of

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
up about a fourth of the roster now of

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.590 
up about a fourth of the roster now of
course<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:04.080> be<00:02:04.200> fair<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.220> called<00:02:05.600> WCW

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
course to be fair it is called WCW

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.889 
course to be fair it is called WCW
versus<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.560> world<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.550> fact<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.819> WCW<00:02:09.750> is

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899

just one of the game's many
organizations<00:02:12.120> kind<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.989> makes<00:02:13.170> sense<00:02:13.410> and<00:02:13.739> to

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
organizations kind of makes sense and to

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.220 
organizations kind of makes sense and to
be<00:02:14.100> honest<00:02:14.400> it's<00:02:15.060> actually<00:02:15.450> an<00:02:15.540> awesome<00:02:15.660> idea

but<00:03:05.040> again<00:03:05.250> without<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.730> actual<00:03:06.120> licensing

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
but again without the actual licensing

but again without the actual licensing
without<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.439> names

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
without the names

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.429 
without the names
it<00:03:08.280> just<00:03:08.489> feels<00:03:09.000> pointless<00:03:09.299> so<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.079> awesome

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
it just feels pointless so the awesome

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.280 
it just feels pointless so the awesome
idea<00:03:10.829> is<00:03:11.159> really<00:03:11.579> only<00:03:11.790> that<00:03:12.150> an<00:03:12.450> awesome<00:03:12.629> idea

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
idea is really only that an awesome idea

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.020 
idea is really only that an awesome idea
and<00:03:13.680> unfortunately<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.340> gameplay<00:03:14.700> isn't<00:03:14.849> a

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
and unfortunately the gameplay isn't a

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.640 
and unfortunately the gameplay isn't a
whole<00:03:15.150> lot<00:03:15.180> better<00:03:15.780> again<00:03:16.109> this<00:03:16.260> was<00:03:16.439> before

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
whole lot better again this was before

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.619 
whole lot better again this was before
the<00:03:16.980> grappling<00:03:17.430> system<00:03:17.879> that<00:03:18.060> defined

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
the grappling system that defined

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.660 
the grappling system that defined
revenge<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.739> classic<00:03:20.220> games<00:03:20.430> of<00:03:20.579> this

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
revenge and the classic games of this

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.809 
revenge and the classic games of this
era<00:03:20.879> so<00:03:21.359> as<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.510> result<00:03:22.159> WCW<00:03:23.159> versus<00:03:23.519> the<00:03:23.640> world

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
era so as a result WCW versus the world

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.819 
era so as a result WCW versus the world
feels<00:03:24.209> a<00:03:24.329> bit<00:03:24.450> clunky<00:03:24.720> everything<00:03:25.500> is<00:03:25.590> based

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
feels a bit clunky everything is based

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.309 
feels a bit clunky everything is based
on<00:03:26.040> how<00:03:26.400> long<00:03:26.459> you<00:03:26.939> hold<00:03:27.150> down<00:03:27.389> buttons<00:03:27.959> so

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
on how long you hold down buttons so

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.839 
on how long you hold down buttons so
just<00:03:28.530> tapping<00:03:28.799> a<00:03:29.040> button<00:03:29.069> does<00:03:29.489> something

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
just tapping a button does something

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.940 
just tapping a button does something
different<00:03:30.239> than<00:03:30.420> holding<00:03:31.049> it<00:03:31.200> longer<00:03:31.590> before

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
different than holding it longer before

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.129 
different than holding it longer before
you<00:03:32.010> let<00:03:32.189> go<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.879> frankly<00:03:33.239> that<00:03:33.269> it's<00:03:33.930> not<00:03:34.109> a

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
you let go and frankly that it's not a

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.319 
you let go and frankly that it's not a
terribly<00:03:34.560> accurate<00:03:34.829> or<00:03:35.280> smooth<00:03:35.760> way<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.060> play

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
terribly accurate or smooth way to play

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.659 
terribly accurate or smooth way to play
a<00:03:36.359> wrestling<00:03:36.810> game<00:03:36.989> you<00:03:37.769> know<00:03:37.889> I<00:03:38.189> always<00:03:38.370> say

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
and this games really a perfect example

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.220 
and this games really a perfect example
it<00:03:44.340> just<00:03:44.370> looks<00:03:44.819> terrible<00:03:45.329> it's<00:03:45.720> not<00:03:45.930> like<00:03:46.109> you

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
a shame that you know in game you get

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.280 
a shame that you know in game you get
awful<00:04:36.310> polygons<00:04:36.820> instead<00:04:37.420> of<00:04:37.540> cartoonish

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
awful polygons instead of cartoonish

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.020 
awful polygons instead of cartoonish
sprites<00:04:38.620> had<00:04:39.100> the<00:04:39.220> game<00:04:39.370> carried<00:04:39.670> that<00:04:39.820> look

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
sprites had the game carried that look

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.020 
sprites had the game carried that look
over<00:04:40.420> into<00:04:40.570> the<00:04:40.750> gameplay<00:04:40.990> made<00:04:41.650> it<00:04:41.800> 2d<00:04:42.160> that

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
over into the gameplay made it 2d that

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.730 
over into the gameplay made it 2d that
would<00:04:43.120> have<00:04:43.210> been<00:04:43.330> sweet<00:04:43.660> but<00:04:44.290> then<00:04:44.380> again<00:04:44.620> it

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
would have been sweet but then again it

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.840 
would have been sweet but then again it
was<00:04:45.120> 1997<00:04:46.120> and<00:04:46.270> we<00:04:46.330> were<00:04:46.480> obsessed<00:04:47.320> with

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.300 
was 1997 and we were obsessed with
polygons<00:04:48.850> brother<00:04:49.660> so<00:04:50.590> I<00:04:50.620> guess<00:04:50.860> if<00:04:51.130> you're<00:04:51.280> a

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
to put that air as classics into a

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.390 
to put that air as classics into a
better<00:04:58.330> context<00:04:59.050> this<00:04:59.680> might<00:04:59.950> be<00:05:00.100> worth<00:05:00.250> a

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400
