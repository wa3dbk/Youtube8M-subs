00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.069
 because I'm a fan father as long as I'm 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.570
 I do not like it 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.380
 and you do not know the steam version 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.690
 okay okay if you could pour 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.420
 sugar in the bowl so I'm facing 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.449
 these symbols or 8 is very simple ok on 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:29.609
 take the zest of a lemon 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:31.470
 so if possible bio 1 you continue 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.110
 put lemon I was going to savior not just 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.280
 yellow so we are master verb but 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.930
 it's easier to work yellow 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.930
 the bioplan are superb 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.110
 after that then we will add the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.110
 whole eggs 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.989
 I could mix it's not the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:57.629
 to bleach must be well 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:01.320
 mix and suddenly we will add a 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.530
 little bit of liquid cream I agree 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.530
 am going to 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.080
 add the flour 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.670
 perfect so that's important it's 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.100
 not to mix too much you just have to see 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.810
 the more the fario I see there a little a 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.640
 teaspoon street words exactly 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:28.160
 a few chemical days 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:30.770
 malignant we must see more flour 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.980
 do not get too much then seeds 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.790
 poppy do not know your perfumes 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.790
 marine is very nice ok then the 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.410
 melted butter 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.540
 I melt them at the bottom steam or 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.720
 film a minute to saint benoÃ®t and me 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.150
 the moment I'm going to squeeze a half lemon 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.120
 a lot of butter then precisely this 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.310
 who is good with the pure steam tail 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.080
 as the cakes are very mellow 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.430
 can remove some of the butter to 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.020
 review are often adds butter 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.580
 can seduce melleux so there we can 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.530
 remove some butter from its recipe 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.890
 favorite for anghert counterpart very little 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.320
 of bowl 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.420
 so we'll add the lemon juice 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.380
 so we take a little pass is for 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.410
 avoid glitches 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:19.250
 you will add me Cuban 2000 report to 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:20.770
 low point we finished there little 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.390
 individual cake molds 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.370
 first of all as it's important to 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.390
 orders yes it's a bit that's it 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.220
 important to tumble 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.750
 the cakes or so that allows to have 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.190
 a very regular thickness are 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.670
 assets but it's melted butter we did not 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.819
 not the same thickness veil did a 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.100
 work my molds are happy perfect 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.230
 so we'll fill them with the patina 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.310
 q fill them to death no to the three 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.080
 quarters ok the day I said ok so 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.770
 there my mussels are filled to the three 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.989
 quarter movies that's to avoid 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.700
 that condensation of water falls on 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.890
 solids there are so many of 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.560
 well from home perfect in cooking 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.420
 ok so we go so 100 degrees 17 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:09.239
 minutes 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:10.590
 ok so here I put them in the oven I 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.180
 will program cooking so that's 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.370
 super intuitive actually it's like a 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.470
 smartphone so here I choose a 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.269
 steam cooking 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.940
 so it is already over 100 degrees and there I 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:26.390
 will just choose 17 minutes 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.390
 ok and let's go 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:39.200
 17 evolution a super they are suffering 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.629
 it is impeccable we will find the thread 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.250
 red is huge it's going to get off 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:44.840
 easily 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.329
 the stretchable film was removed 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.939
 lets cool for five minutes and learns 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.500
 the molds it is possible that makes 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:53.900
 twenty minutes there they are in the process of 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.500
 cool the defendants can have the 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.900
 surprise 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.189
 after super perfect and that's what we're going 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.379
 to do we could leave them like that 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:08.840
 we will dig the top that shocks 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:15.409
 so we're going to launch a little hollow 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:17.180
 ok but perfect but not higher 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.579
 what are you doing 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.690
 so will put lemon curd so a 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:27.610
 lemon jam we will accentuate 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:30.590
 still the side then very good job and 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.780
 a little bit of milk bruckert for 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.070
 the big mine in the bunker of the 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:38.810
 Navarre is at posters all saints 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:41.120
 exactly that I finish from lemon curd 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.530
 hockey 3 jeans and orange juice 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.530
 yes but after it's good 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.520
 ok you lose but here we add the small 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:54.889
 France just a 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:58.850
 I do not believe you very big game long 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:01.220
 term dayori tamboise no frankly that 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.930
 is going very very good and you're not going to 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.419
 tasting we really have the side 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.290
 mellow thanks to the oven the fear but 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.290
 normally
