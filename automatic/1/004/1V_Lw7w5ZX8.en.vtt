00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.599
 the one we are good at 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.550
 new video on the oculus rift again 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.440
 again and again sad locus 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.120
 it's normal then I'm going to show you 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.730
 how to make the game compatible 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.300
 minecraft soul hocus rift with the little 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:25.050
 who d'eca2 so for this tutorial ben you 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.250
 will need the minecraft mode and you 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.769
 wait i'm showing you the video 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.750
 so to start you go on 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.910
 search engine and you typed 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.880
 mind crypto otherwise you look from a tee 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.110
 shirt if you are fat feigners 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.190

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.410
 of a caucus vr with minecraft mode 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.420
 so for me that one does not work 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.820
 because tracking does not work well 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.950
 sure you with that one I can not manage to 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.230
 make it work but you if that 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.239
 works well so much better against me this 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.809
 who walks it's a minecraft note 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.210

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.500
 1.6 1.718 so to install a handle 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.710
 of men you click on a mirror 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.060
 r flat we click is busy on 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.590
 so you're going to download it 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.500
 and that will give you 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.840
 a little minecraft just like these 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.020
 once it's done then you go 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.310
 do windows + r are you going to write for 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.530

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:58.189
 minecraft hop there he'll ask you 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.470
 a pure razer hydra sport so a review 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.670
 enough 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.650
 that may be the case strazer I do not 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.420
 do not know but it's great I do not know what 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.070
 but I do not hide them I do not 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.050

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.050
 kraft babel you can click here 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.690
 graff and where to click on ok and a fault 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.510
 who are ok at bassam unload mode and 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.000
 that's a crowd success would have start 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.320
 minecraft next 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:35.870
 then you opened your minecraft 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:38.360
 that's it if you're going to do 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.100
 edit profile once I was going to do 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.209
 a freelancer to sign in to your account 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.110
 it works for cracked versions 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.910
 you will not be the paid version and 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.920
 you're going to do just version but that 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.300
 you left sure you will 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.590
 choose the mind crif 1.8 points apart 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.140
 if you have another loggia 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.330
 version that you are or put safe profile 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.890
 and you put playes 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.989
 so my physio sleeve and acts lo 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.730
 like these it did not do any 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:12.519
 registration is good you have to 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.970
 put your worship rift in live mode 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:18.010
 of m 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:22.390
 then it's a direct mode like these 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.390
 see there and you click play 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:49.660
 that's it then after you put your rift 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:53.010
 and you have the minecraft menu on your 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.580
 play here it's nickel so do solo 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:01.980
 new world 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:04.180
 you go into your world ok is charging 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.250
 it may be that in people that does not 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.540
 does not run the crash mode because 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.990
 it's not fads still very well 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.610
 well optimized but but you have to 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.020
 to say again that it's still in 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.510
 development and that's so I'm coming 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:20.440
 in my game here I am in my game 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:23.080
 head and shifted with respect to my 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.290
 body I had hurt it all the framed 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.450
 touch it's not a sign and so has bah 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:32.550
 here you are invaded kraft with a 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:37.200
 rich oculus so that's great 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:40.020
 that's where she turned right here 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.449
 I see on a beautiful idea 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.750
 so if you have any concerns for 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:47.910
 installing anything on your 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.550
 hindsight of the script come on the site under 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.430

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.889

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.020

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.729

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.409
 bad for next videos but thm 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.479
