said<00:02:45.739> that<00:02:45.889> by<00:02:46.069> each<00:02:46.250> of<00:02:46.430> these<00:02:46.519> foundations

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
said that by each of these foundations

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.940 
said that by each of these foundations
but<00:02:47.689> as<00:02:47.780> you<00:02:47.930> can<00:02:48.049> tell<00:02:48.109> this<00:02:48.500> is<00:02:48.650> something

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
but as you can tell this is something

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.170 
but as you can tell this is something
that<00:02:48.980> I<00:02:49.129> look<00:02:49.280> for<00:02:49.310> in<00:02:49.519> a<00:02:49.579> foundation<00:02:50.090> the

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
that I look for in a foundation the

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.849 
that I look for in a foundation the
lightweight<00:02:50.689> feel<00:02:50.989> this<00:02:51.260> one<00:02:51.439> does<00:02:51.620> only

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
lightweight feel this one does only

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.339 
lightweight feel this one does only
contain<00:02:52.220> an<00:02:52.370> SPF<00:02:52.819> of<00:02:52.939> 6<00:02:53.329> so<00:02:53.810> it's<00:02:53.959> not<00:02:54.049> as<00:02:54.200> much

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
contain an SPF of 6 so it's not as much

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:55.869
