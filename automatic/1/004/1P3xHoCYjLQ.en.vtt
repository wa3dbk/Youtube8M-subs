now<00:01:09.680> I<00:01:10.010> could<00:01:10.460> really<00:01:10.730> figure<00:01:10.910> out<00:01:11.030> how<00:01:11.210> to<00:01:11.270> set

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
now I could really figure out how to set

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.200 
now I could really figure out how to set
the<00:01:11.750> cost<00:01:11.960> of<00:01:12.170> stuff<00:01:12.560> nothing<00:01:12.950> so<00:01:13.730> I<00:01:13.760> want<00:01:14.150> a

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
the cost of stuff nothing so I want a

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.080 
the cost of stuff nothing so I want a
different<00:01:14.360> now<00:01:14.630> I<00:01:15.220> I'm<00:01:16.220> gonna<00:01:16.370> pause<00:01:16.550> is<00:01:16.850> just

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090
