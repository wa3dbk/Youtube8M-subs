00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.849
 camera or phone holder in 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.950
 this case I turned it into a telephone ok 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.619
 he has the little legs so that they stretch in 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.940
 both in the 3 in the 10 in the 3 this 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.670
 little leg and good what I did then 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.830
 I buy these cases on ebay 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.780
 ok they are for my phone is depends on the 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.390
 phone that you have buy one 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.330
 Extra stick it here first before 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.989
 paste it I asked it here in the middle 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:54.309
 come down the revolution I'm here and I hit it 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.900
 with acrylic and I put there the kate 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.059
 then the plastic and the acrylic and what 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.739
 below and it will be well stuck 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.620
 once milk is well glued 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.810
 Hot silicone ok on both sides 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.670
 so they can have their phone 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.320
 here put now I can not teach 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.830
 my phone because I'm recording with him 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.470
 and well you know that this part of 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.360
 here maneuver moves maneuver 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.730
 to go up to down 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.160
 even cost can stop him 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.800
 look at this stop the phone is 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.510
 great the camera for this side would be for 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.210
 This side can be pulled down 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.430
 up and so on 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.320
 ok I hope you like this idea this 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.820
 I did yesterday it occurred to me and I did it and what 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.100
 I wanted to share with you is a 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.600
 way to make our practical 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.970
 videos at least me that used the 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.340
 good phone this is a stage but 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.640
 good girls now I'm going with the 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.340
 I also hope this will help you. 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.860
 I have several manitos this only 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.330
 this is the third fall the two and a 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.370
 that is hard that has a design that does not 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.680
 I can take it out because I do not like to be 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.050
 taking out putting and thus taking him out with the 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.970
 Deny and it does not bore me now that what 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.360
 let's do with this little hand 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.160
 this little hand here with this little knife what 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.150
 what are we going to do and I always do with my 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.580
 handyman here is something very simple ok yes 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.080
 not that girls if at any time in 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.270
 some purchases I said it was going to be the 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.040
 video excuse me because I thought that what 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.950
 I had done that I have many many 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.510
 little things in the head but good with this 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.940
 razor and be very careful because 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.350
 has edge what I'm going to do is put 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.730
 the hand here to press one or the 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.380
 as they do each crime 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.980
 then press it be very careful 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.620
 with the strength that one has to go to 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.230
 cut to hurt ok let's do it like that 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.220
 let's put the knife in this way 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:53.400
 well pressing and cutting cutting 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.040
 cutting everything up to the middle of the nail 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.500
 both sides are going to put on one side 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.450
 cut and even half and do it right 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.610
 well well cortadito be very careful 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.000
 Do not cut the sides because 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.910
 put the tip is also going to open or that 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.930
 be very careful but if for a over 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.180
 you cut them with the a creel 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.430
 they make a combination with the acrylic and 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.799
 what they're going to do that they let that be 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.840
 put together and put acrylic on it 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.900
 well and do not touch it until it's okay 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.310
 dry and it works very well because to me 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.910
 happened that ok look 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.620
 then it is already with the acrylic but what 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.810
 I was passing him using using 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.760
 using then the cut was enlarged 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.500
 hardly more when they are cut him 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.480
 put on the patch with the acrylic and the 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.239
 monomer let it dry the gel not 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.099
 Acrylic works yes and there it sticks 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.590
 well to this day it works me very 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.690
 well it has not peeled off and and it sticks 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.340
 well the acrylic then what are we going to 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.349
 do is also cut from the other end 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.220
 halfway and what are we going to do 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:04:01.730
 After that, it is already cut and 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.170
 it's perfect ok and with a chip she my 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.450
 little friend the good one that I saw the 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.920
 video then said that if the number goes 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.620
 top down the number will always go 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.410
 down ok the number goes down I have 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.480
 this kind of tip you can put if 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.880
 you have a short tip, you make your designs in 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.729
 short nails in this case this one is long 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.510
 because I asked him long to do 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:27.210
 designs in acrylic gel and good 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:30.670
 we put it here like this and enter ok 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.680
 come in to make our designs so much 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:36.480
 in now I do not know why it's hard but 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.670
 good is because it 's new then 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.620
 sometimes but something is failing but 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.249
 this must enter 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.429
 ok now yes 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:48.319
 same is not going to notice this what one 

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:51.769
 so get the pretty one because it will go 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:54.349
 painted is going to go acrylic gel and so 

00:04:51.769 --> 00:04:57.559
 because between our nail and here 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:59.779
 and another idea if they had the girl 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:03.139
 dual system that is like this one too 

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:05.659
 you can create your nails by putting it like this 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:08.479
 this nail is previously cut what 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:13.539
 we put our design on a nail 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:15.529
 short either acrylic or gel if it works or 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:18.259
 can also help us do 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:20.179
 our designs in trini and also we 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:22.610
 will facilitate for our hand 

00:05:20.179 --> 00:05:24.679
 left since it 's sometimes a little 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.719
 complicated to do our 

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:28.339
 trini for this hand so that they 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:30.979
 I recommend the dual system to do your 

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:33.559
 designs too and make them trading and 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.389
 well here another quick idea a 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:38.119
 My friend asked me if I could 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:40.519
 make a review of another gel color 

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:42.770
 mixed with enamel look friend this 

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:46.310
 is mixed with enamel 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:48.440
 this is mixed with enamel and for 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.409
 that I got a little clearer I had to 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.210
 combine the color nude and a little bit of 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:55.909
 white so that I clarify more because the 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.560
 nude color is a little bit dark and the 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:59.479
 mix of the two 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.509
 colors and then mix it with enamel 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:05.110
 but the gel sorry mix it with the gel 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:07.610
 but the gel is that it comes out with acetone 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.370
 you can use another gel that does not come with 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.919
 acetone is depends on the gel that you have 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.990
 but it also works with enamel 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:16.970
 also this but those that is of enersa and 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:21.800
 this does not come out with acetone but I mix it 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:23.810
 with a mix of gliders was a mix that 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.150
 I put several mixtures of bright colors 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:29.210
 and I wanted to combine it with Miguel and Miren 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:33.680
 how it looks beautiful and here I have it 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:36.409
 already prepared the nails this is the pink 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.770
 that is the nut core that is already cured 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:44.599
 with the lamp of 36 and this is the mix 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:48.720
 that shines very nice this the truth to 

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:51.360
 I love it and that's how it looks on your nails 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.210
 and well I hope you liked friends 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:58.110
 I made this video with a lot of love 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:59.670
 I hope you can achieve it I think I 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.320
 I think many girls will make of 

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:03.780
 here because they find it in the 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:06.810
 dollar tree stores and this make their 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:09.300
 order on ebay or if you have 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.220
 any site they want to buy 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.990
 even in dollar stores 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.760
 seen that they also sell well some cakes 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.950
 and this they stick and it will serve them for 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:20.010
 sign their videos if they do so with 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:23.070
