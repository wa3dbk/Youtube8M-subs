00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:11.730
 reggie 18 kozak gentlemen here in crisis 2 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.820
 with an analysis of three black reasons 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.820
 ops 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.359
 Let's start with the first clip one 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.880
 kind of student who sticks on 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.830
 floors looks like it can go a lot 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.960
 far the one from reader or even 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.900
 on the other side of the motta but we'll see 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:39.180
 obviously here also with the impact 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:41.370
 direct behind the walls yes yes we don't say 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.940
 still if it's a new specialty or 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.950
 both the viewfinder that makes this goes further 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.780
 the walls can also be seen beyond the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.949
 smoke 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:58.129
 the long jump is not lacking 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:58.129
 which was also in black ops 1 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.920
 behind embankments 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:14.730
 difficult now but very much this ticket 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:22.200
 look at a kind of turret that 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:30.920
 will disorient very bad enemies for 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:30.920
 opponents the drones already seen in the trailer 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.220
 they work as the acquitted brand 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:43.460
 present but I have for three but these here 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.460
 want traveling no but wait 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.930
 the lovely shields will certainly not be able to 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.890
 will bring the thought but hamas were 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.890
 also equipped with a rifle 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.020
 with which through the opening of the 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.020
 shield I will kill 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.470
 the most damaged part of the video 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.730
 it would seem precisely this term is 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.560
 the only thing that comes to mind 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.990
 I hope he did as a joker but if not 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:35.020
 they will be very difficult to kill 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:38.590
 knife- cut teletubbies is the theme 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:44.680
 usa is very nice for this 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:46.900
 but here are the snipers who can't 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.880
 like the stumps andy co and now he will give us 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.490
 only with a stroke finally for the 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.560
 play lovers 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:59.980
 and here is also object without myths but 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:01.450
 watch it a sniper with no viewfinder 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.450
 after co2 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.200
 I do n't think there were any more 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.800
 finally they put it like 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.800
 battlefield 3 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:19.739
 this would seem very strong here 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.739
 it would seem like a goal but I don't think so 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:31.610
 think about it 4 the aesthetic changed 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:33.980
 obviously a shotgun is a 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:39.859
 blackburn and you go to crash remember 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:42.439
 which usually the future is black box 2 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:46.819
 laps raised even by black ops 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:49.489
 sorry but it's very similar to well what to say 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.980
 leave a lot I like to sign up e 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.819
