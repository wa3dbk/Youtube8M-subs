00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
stuff to it so like for example here I

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.289 
stuff to it so like for example here I
like<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.130> dark<00:01:50.340> arcs<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:50.939> I'm<00:01:51.000> going<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.180> use

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
like the dark arcs so I'm going to use

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.800 
like the dark arcs so I'm going to use
the<00:01:51.390> dark<00:01:51.600> art<00:01:51.810> which<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.740> clock<00:01:53.810> then

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
the dark art which is the clock then

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.240 
the dark art which is the clock then
we're<00:01:54.930> going<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.110> have<00:01:55.259> ups<00:01:55.619> then<00:01:56.040> we're<00:01:56.130> going

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
we're going to have ups then we're going

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.800

skin<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.710> I'm<00:01:58.799> going<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.009> add<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.219> border<00:01:59.520> so

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
skin so I'm going to add the border so

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.569 
skin so I'm going to add the border so
depending<00:02:00.149> on<00:02:00.270> your<00:02:00.329> screen<00:02:00.540> resolution<00:02:00.630> and

depending on your screen resolution and

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.429 
depending on your screen resolution and
I<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:03.180> correspond<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:03.990> your<00:02:04.140> screen

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
I just correspond to your screen

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.319 
I just correspond to your screen
resolution<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:05.369> for<00:02:05.579> example<00:02:05.939> my<00:02:06.060> screen

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
resolution so for example my screen

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.930 
resolution so for example my screen
resolution<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:06.930> 1920<00:02:07.560> by<00:02:07.590> 1080<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.670> I'm<00:02:08.759> going

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
resolution is 1920 by 1080 so I'm going

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.050 
resolution is 1920 by 1080 so I'm going
to<00:02:09.000> use<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.899> actual

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
to use that that actual

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.170

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
you don't know how to do that like you

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:16.809 
you don't know how to do that like you

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
testing rotator so the testing rotators

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.710 
testing rotator so the testing rotators
on<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:04.519> under<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:04.819> skin<00:04:05.120> which<00:04:05.390> has<00:04:05.540> two

on the under the skin which has two

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.570 
on the under the skin which has two
rotator<00:04:06.290> there's<00:04:06.830> different<00:04:07.250> code<00:04:07.430> this

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580
