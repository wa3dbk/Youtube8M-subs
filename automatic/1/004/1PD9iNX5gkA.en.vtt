00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:05.060
 and now 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.020
 hello and welcome again i am cs and today 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.750
 I bring you a trick here on the map bay 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.840
 rays that would be with the jumping fan would be 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.700
 to go through is let's say wall and 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.080
 create a barrier outside what we have 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.360
 what to do is simply place it there 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.430
 how do you place it at the beginning 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.990
 and we should go around here slowly 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.880
 by the wall until we do this 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.340
 gesture that puts us here once done 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.800
 this we pick up the jumping pack since 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.880
 if he did not throw us out of here and well once 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.920
 here we will create a barrier of zombies 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.110
 it also serves for the other zombies that 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.150
 they are small those jumping for 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.970
 the goblins 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.740
 and then one of this trick is that 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.170
 it can be done with two players one and 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.060
 in this and another here here 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.090
 can you put in the trick there is there 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.640
 here next to you lying in the pasture 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.200
 Then I show him how he does 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.880
 and there the zombies do not come, you can 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.030
 combine pulling grenades 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:09.530
 and good this trick has recorded with 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:12.140
 pocho and nothing I hope you like him 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.350
