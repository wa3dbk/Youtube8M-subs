was<00:03:47.760> twice<00:03:48.180> as<00:03:48.480> devastating<00:03:49.230> but<00:03:49.560> it's

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
was twice as devastating but it's

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.470 
was twice as devastating but it's
revealed<00:03:50.100> that's<00:03:50.310> probably<00:03:50.790> not<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.300> case

too well for the most part yeah the

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.909 
too well for the most part yeah the
single<00:05:37.720> best<00:05:37.930> moment<00:05:38.440> is<00:05:38.530> probably

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
single best moment is probably

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.770 
single best moment is probably
Twilight's<00:05:39.520> passive<00:05:40.000> aggression<00:05:40.300> at<00:05:40.599> not

also I'm starting to suspect that gummy

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.770 
also I'm starting to suspect that gummy
