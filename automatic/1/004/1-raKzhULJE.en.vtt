00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
kind of wrapping a brain around it and

learned being here at local motors about
the<00:00:40.310> process<00:00:40.790> to<00:00:41.660> start<00:00:41.960> off<00:00:43.180> conventionally

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
the process to start off conventionally

we'd<00:01:26.810> like<00:01:26.990> things<00:01:27.770> like<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.760> actual

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
we'd like things like the actual

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.810 
we'd like things like the actual
suspension<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.590> upper<00:01:31.070> a-arms<00:01:31.549> lower

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
control arms things like that then we

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.060 
control arms things like that then we
want<00:01:35.540> to<00:01:35.600> be<00:01:35.690> able<00:01:35.780> to<00:01:35.960> bolt<00:01:36.320> those<00:01:36.500> things<00:01:36.830> on

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
want to be able to bolt those things on

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.609 
want to be able to bolt those things on
the<00:01:37.310> very<00:01:37.460> necessary<00:01:38.210> components<00:01:38.869> for<00:01:39.470> the

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
the very necessary components for the

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.100 
the very necessary components for the
card<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:40.070> motor<00:01:40.360> your<00:01:41.360> suspension<00:01:41.869> things

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
card the motor your suspension things

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.960 
card the motor your suspension things
like<00:01:42.320> that<00:01:42.500> and<00:01:42.830> then<00:01:43.369> we<00:01:43.460> want<00:01:43.640> to<00:01:43.700> roll<00:01:43.850> it

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
like that and then we want to roll it

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.870 
like that and then we want to roll it
off<00:01:44.119> before<00:01:44.299> so<00:01:44.900> it's<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:46.100> least<00:01:46.369> amount<00:01:46.729> of

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
off before so it's the least amount of

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.780 
off before so it's the least amount of
tooling<00:01:47.360> if<00:01:47.510> you<00:01:47.840> think<00:01:48.170> to<00:01:48.350> yourself<00:01:48.490> now<00:01:49.490> can

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
tooling if you think to yourself now can

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.090 
tooling if you think to yourself now can
I<00:01:49.880> three<00:01:50.150> didn't<00:01:50.510> print<00:01:50.720> this<00:01:50.869> part<00:01:51.200> in<00:01:51.439> with

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
I three didn't print this part in with

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.420 
I three didn't print this part in with
my<00:01:52.369> design<00:01:52.790> do<00:01:53.720> it<00:01:53.900> show<00:01:54.380> us<00:01:54.560> how<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:54.830> can<00:01:55.280> do

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
my design do it show us how you can do

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.370 
my design do it show us how you can do
that<00:01:55.580> because<00:01:55.760> we<00:01:55.939> want<00:01:56.090> to

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
plastic and what we what we are using

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.690 
plastic and what we what we are using
this<00:02:10.840> for<00:02:11.080> is<00:02:11.200> for<00:02:11.440> testing<00:02:11.650> of<00:02:12.099> how<00:02:12.550> we're

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
this for is for testing of how we're

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.150 
this for is for testing of how we're
going<00:02:12.819> to<00:02:12.880> bolt<00:02:13.090> things<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.720> it<00:02:13.870> and

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
going to bolt things to it and

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.320 
going to bolt things to it and
structural<00:02:15.160> testing<00:02:15.489> so<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:15.760> can<00:02:15.910> see<00:02:16.090> we

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
structural testing so you can see we

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.410 
structural testing so you can see we
have<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:16.480> bolt<00:02:16.810> ear<00:02:17.519> we<00:02:18.519> actually<00:02:18.730> drill<00:02:19.239> that

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
have a bolt ear we actually drill that

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.160 
have a bolt ear we actually drill that
out<00:02:19.599> inserted<00:02:20.319> a<00:02:20.819> sleeve<00:02:21.819> and<00:02:22.810> we're<00:02:22.959> going<00:02:23.110> to

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
out inserted a sleeve and we're going to

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.839 
out inserted a sleeve and we're going to
use<00:02:23.319> this<00:02:23.500> we've<00:02:23.860> been<00:02:24.010> doing<00:02:24.250> weight<00:02:24.430> testing

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
use this we've been doing weight testing

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.170 
use this we've been doing weight testing
with<00:02:25.120> just<00:02:25.390> this<00:02:25.510> one<00:02:25.750> bolt<00:02:26.050> but<00:02:26.230> see<00:02:27.180> how

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
with just this one bolt but see how

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.210 
with just this one bolt but see how
strong<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.660> can<00:02:29.200> be<00:02:29.290> so<00:02:29.500> this<00:02:29.709> is<00:02:29.920> tough

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
strong that can be so this is tough

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.130 
strong that can be so this is tough
stuff<00:02:30.430> that<00:02:30.940> can<00:02:31.090> be<00:02:31.180> used<00:02:31.360> as<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.540> structure

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
stuff that can be used as a structure

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.190 
stuff that can be used as a structure
now<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:33.280> doesn't<00:02:33.489> mean<00:02:33.640> that<00:02:33.760> your<00:02:34.150> car<00:02:34.510> has

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
now that doesn't mean that your car has

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.330 
now that doesn't mean that your car has
to<00:02:35.470> be<00:02:35.500> black<00:02:37.200> this<00:02:38.200> stuff<00:02:38.440> is<00:02:38.620> black<00:02:38.950> in<00:02:39.190> this

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
to be black this stuff is black in this

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.370 
to be black this stuff is black in this
the<00:02:39.519> only<00:02:39.610> color<00:02:39.910> comes<00:02:40.269> in<00:02:40.420> however<00:02:40.780> you<00:02:41.140> can

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
the only color comes in however you can

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.190 
the only color comes in however you can
print<00:02:41.650> your<00:02:41.799> structure<00:02:42.370> in<00:02:42.780> black<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.110> then

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
print your structure in black and then

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.110 
print your structure in black and then
as<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.709> extruder<00:02:45.160> is<00:02:45.250> moving<00:02:45.610> on<00:02:45.700> we<00:02:45.940> can

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
as the extruder is moving on we can

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.380 
as the extruder is moving on we can
switch<00:02:46.420> materials<00:02:47.019> midway<00:02:47.470> through<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:48.849> AVS

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
switch materials midway through to AVS

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.009 
switch materials midway through to AVS
plastic<00:02:49.420> which<00:02:50.200> normally<00:02:50.709> it's<00:02:51.010> white<00:02:51.579> and<00:02:52.569> it

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
plastic which normally it's white and it

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.839 
plastic which normally it's white and it
can<00:02:53.260> have<00:02:53.410> fiberglass<00:02:53.769> infuse<00:02:54.280> in<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.549> so<00:02:54.700> it's

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
can have fiberglass infuse in it so it's

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.660 
can have fiberglass infuse in it so it's
still<00:02:55.030> pretty<00:02:55.239> structural<00:02:56.310> but<00:02:57.310> we<00:02:57.489> can

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
still pretty structural but we can

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.910 
still pretty structural but we can
actually<00:02:58.030> add<00:02:58.209> color<00:02:58.720> as<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.049> process<00:02:59.680> goes

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
actually add color as the process goes

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.729 
actually add color as the process goes
on<00:03:00.280> so<00:03:00.579> as<00:03:01.180> it's<00:03:01.510> printing<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.079> the<00:03:02.500> layers

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
on so as it's printing and the layers

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.160 
on so as it's printing and the layers
going<00:03:03.220> up<00:03:03.459> you<00:03:04.180> can<00:03:04.359> start<00:03:04.630> with<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.959> black

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
going up you can start with the black

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.650 
going up you can start with the black
stuff<00:03:05.470> for<00:03:05.950> structure<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.910> as<00:03:07.030> it<00:03:07.239> goes<00:03:07.420> up

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
stuff for structure and as it goes up

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.420 
stuff for structure and as it goes up
and<00:03:07.870> you<00:03:08.049> can<00:03:08.260> go<00:03:08.380> to<00:03:08.440> white<00:03:08.739> it<00:03:09.069> can<00:03:09.280> go<00:03:09.400> to

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
and you can go to white it can go to

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.970 
and you can go to white it can go to
read<00:03:09.760> you<00:03:09.970> can<00:03:10.180> go<00:03:10.299> to<00:03:10.359> blue<00:03:10.690> we<00:03:11.560> haven't<00:03:11.889> even

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
read you can go to blue we haven't even

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.949 
read you can go to blue we haven't even
actually<00:03:12.549> experimented<00:03:13.180> with<00:03:13.540> all<00:03:13.780> the

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
actually experimented with all the

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.009 
actually experimented with all the
colors<00:03:14.109> available<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.829> us<00:03:14.980> so<00:03:15.549> as<00:03:15.880> it<00:03:15.940> goes<00:03:16.780> up

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
colors available to us so as it goes up

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.470 
colors available to us so as it goes up
the<00:03:17.829> layers<00:03:18.069> can<00:03:18.370> actually<00:03:18.760> change<00:03:19.060> from

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
the layers can actually change from

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.650 
the layers can actually change from
black<00:03:20.109> to<00:03:20.410> blue<00:03:21.100> to<00:03:21.340> white<00:03:21.639> and<00:03:22.120> you<00:03:22.450> can

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
black to blue to white and you can

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.759 
black to blue to white and you can
actually<00:03:22.810> have<00:03:23.049> multiple<00:03:23.260> colors<00:03:23.829> however

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
actually have multiple colors however

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.809 
actually have multiple colors however
unfortunately<00:03:26.769> we're<00:03:26.920> not<00:03:26.950> doing<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.519> type<00:03:27.790> of

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
unfortunately we're not doing a type of

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.170 
unfortunately we're not doing a type of
thing<00:03:28.120> where<00:03:28.329> we<00:03:28.630> would<00:03:28.780> print<00:03:29.579> vendors<00:03:30.579> to

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
thing where we would print vendors to

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.340 
thing where we would print vendors to
bolt<00:03:31.480> on

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
bolt on

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.560 
bolt on
we<00:03:32.950> would<00:03:33.100> like<00:03:33.250> defenders<00:03:33.730> to<00:03:33.880> be<00:03:34.000> a<00:03:34.030> part<00:03:34.390> of

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
we would like defenders to be a part of

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.820 
we would like defenders to be a part of
the<00:03:35.050> main<00:03:35.290> structure<00:03:36.010> as<00:03:36.220> a<00:03:36.870> one-piece<00:03:37.870> but<00:03:38.410> do

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
the main structure as a one-piece but do

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.590 
the main structure as a one-piece but do
you<00:03:38.890> feel<00:03:39.070> free<00:03:39.340> to<00:03:39.430> play<00:03:39.580> with<00:03:39.790> color<00:03:40.030> as<00:03:40.330> far

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
you feel free to play with color as far

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.320 
you feel free to play with color as far
as<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:41.320> actual<00:03:41.500> process<00:03:41.920> and<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.430> layers<00:03:42.670> now

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
as the actual process and the layers now

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.450 
as the actual process and the layers now
as<00:03:43.480> you<00:03:43.600> can<00:03:43.720> see<00:03:43.780> here<00:03:44.230> also<00:03:44.440> we're<00:03:45.190> going<00:03:45.400> to

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
as you can see here also we're going to

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.770 
as you can see here also we're going to
talk<00:03:45.610> a<00:03:45.640> little<00:03:45.910> bit<00:03:46.120> about<00:03:46.300> the<00:03:46.450> milling

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
talk a little bit about the milling

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.690 
talk a little bit about the milling
process<00:03:46.810> this<00:03:47.380> is<00:03:47.530> a<00:03:47.560> very<00:03:47.680> unfinished<00:03:48.340> piece

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
process this is a very unfinished piece

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.520 
process this is a very unfinished piece
you<00:03:49.300> can<00:03:49.450> see<00:03:49.630> there's<00:03:49.840> a<00:03:49.930> lot<00:03:50.110> of<00:03:52.530> variation

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
you can see there's a lot of variation

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.070 
you can see there's a lot of variation
in<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.770> layer<00:03:53.950> if<00:03:54.190> you<00:03:54.310> will<00:03:54.460> now<00:03:55.420> what<00:03:55.720> we<00:03:55.870> can

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
in the layer if you will now what we can

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.950 
in the layer if you will now what we can
do<00:03:56.320> is<00:03:56.670> on<00:03:57.670> this<00:03:58.030> edge<00:03:58.240> you<00:03:58.510> have<00:03:58.660> a<00:03:58.690> nice

00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:58.960 
do is on this edge you have a nice

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.530 
do is on this edge you have a nice
triangular<00:03:59.440> edge<00:03:59.770> here<00:04:00.160> you<00:04:00.940> can<00:04:01.180> actually

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
triangular edge here you can actually

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.310 
triangular edge here you can actually
take<00:04:02.200> the<00:04:02.620> subtractive<00:04:03.280> process<00:04:03.580> of<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.960> 3d
