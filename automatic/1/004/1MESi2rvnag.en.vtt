just<00:01:33.020> playing<00:01:33.200> in<00:01:33.289> your<00:01:33.380> backyard<00:01:33.530> that<00:01:34.490> just

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:35.359 
just playing in your backyard that just

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:37.569 
just playing in your backyard that just
just<00:01:35.570> is<00:01:35.689> what<00:01:35.960> you<00:01:36.049> want<00:01:36.429> you<00:01:37.429> can<00:01:37.549> have

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
just is what you want you can have

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:38.889 
just is what you want you can have
interference<00:01:38.149> issues<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:38.539> things<00:01:38.689> like<00:01:38.840> that

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
interference issues and things like that

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.719 
interference issues and things like that
the<00:01:39.409> days<00:01:39.560> of<00:01:39.710> crystals<00:01:40.100> are<00:01:40.219> long<00:01:40.369> gone<00:01:40.579> if

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
the days of crystals are long gone if

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.080 
the days of crystals are long gone if
you<00:01:40.820> even<00:01:40.909> know<00:01:41.060> what<00:01:41.149> I'm<00:01:41.210> talking<00:01:41.270> about

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
you even know what I'm talking about

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.940 
you even know what I'm talking about
but<00:01:44.090> there<00:01:44.240> are<00:01:44.359> a<00:01:44.390> few<00:01:44.619> important<00:01:45.619> features

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
but there are a few important features

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.410 
but there are a few important features
for<00:01:46.219> any<00:01:46.609> radio<00:01:46.909> that<00:01:47.030> you're<00:01:47.119> going<00:01:47.240> to<00:01:47.299> race

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
for any radio that you're going to race

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.690 
for any radio that you're going to race
with<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:47.899> the<00:01:48.590> first<00:01:48.799> one<00:01:49.009> is<00:01:49.189> endpoint

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
with and the first one is endpoint

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.559 
with and the first one is endpoint
adjustment<00:01:50.210> and<00:01:51.670> so<00:01:52.670> endpoint<00:01:53.119> adjustment

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
adjustment and so endpoint adjustment

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:55.929 
adjustment and so endpoint adjustment
dual<00:01:54.289> rate<00:01:54.759> throttle<00:01:55.759> and<00:01:55.850> steering

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
dual rate throttle and steering

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.669 
dual rate throttle and steering
exponential<00:01:56.840> you<00:01:56.990> probably<00:01:57.409> won't<00:01:57.560> use

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
exponential you probably won't use

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.179 
exponential you probably won't use
steering<00:01:57.920> exponential<00:01:58.520> and<00:01:59.299> then<00:01:59.539> atl<00:02:00.049> and<00:02:00.350> so

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
steering exponential and then atl and so

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.520 
steering exponential and then atl and so
this<00:02:01.490> radio<00:02:01.789> has<00:02:01.969> all<00:02:02.119> of<00:02:02.149> those<00:02:02.389> so<00:02:03.109> i<00:02:03.139> will

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
this radio has all of those so i will

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.260 
this radio has all of those so i will
take<00:02:03.679> a<00:02:03.740> few<00:02:03.950> seconds<00:02:04.490> and<00:02:04.609> i<00:02:04.880> will<00:02:05.030> show<00:02:05.210> you

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
take a few seconds and i will show you

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.929 
take a few seconds and i will show you
how<00:02:05.479> that<00:02:05.539> works<00:02:05.780> in<00:02:06.649> just<00:02:07.280> a<00:02:07.399> minute<00:02:07.520> here<00:02:07.729> a

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
how that works in just a minute here a

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.430 
how that works in just a minute here a
couple<00:02:08.690> other<00:02:08.810> things<00:02:08.869> you<00:02:09.080> want<00:02:09.229> to<00:02:09.319> consider

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
couple other things you want to consider

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.530 
couple other things you want to consider
hour<00:02:09.890> depending<00:02:10.459> on<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.700> size<00:02:10.940> of<00:02:11.000> your<00:02:11.060> hands

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
hour depending on the size of your hands

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.869 
hour depending on the size of your hands
a<00:02:11.720> lot<00:02:12.590> of<00:02:12.680> these<00:02:12.769> radios<00:02:13.159> these<00:02:13.310> days<00:02:13.549> can

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
a lot of these radios these days can

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:15.890 
a lot of these radios these days can
actually<00:02:14.330> they're<00:02:14.750> actually<00:02:15.170> little

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
actually they're actually little

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.559 
actually they're actually little
hols<00:02:16.379> and<00:02:16.500> they<00:02:16.920> can<00:02:17.069> adjust<00:02:17.189> not<00:02:18.120> only<00:02:18.150> like

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
hols and they can adjust not only like

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.720 
hols and they can adjust not only like
not<00:02:18.870> only<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.260> maybe<00:02:20.069> it's<00:02:20.370> easier<00:02:20.549> to<00:02:20.640> see

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
not only the maybe it's easier to see

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.699 
not only the maybe it's easier to see
from<00:02:20.879> the<00:02:20.939> back<00:02:21.090> not<00:02:21.720> only<00:02:21.750> like<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.230> angle<00:02:22.590> of

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
from the back not only like the angle of

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.369 
from the back not only like the angle of
the<00:02:22.860> trigger<00:02:23.129> but<00:02:23.909> they<00:02:24.000> can<00:02:24.150> adjust<00:02:24.390> how<00:02:24.810> hard

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
the trigger but they can adjust how hard

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.259 
the trigger but they can adjust how hard
the<00:02:25.620> trigger<00:02:25.860> pull<00:02:26.129> becomes<00:02:26.610> like<00:02:26.819> like<00:02:27.120> how

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
the trigger pull becomes like like how

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.300 
the trigger pull becomes like like how
firm<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.780> spring<00:02:28.019> tension<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.680> they<00:02:29.159> can

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
firm the spring tension is and they can

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.559 
firm the spring tension is and they can
actually<00:02:29.579> also<00:02:29.700> take<00:02:30.000> this<00:02:30.180> thing<00:02:30.390> right<00:02:30.540> here

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
actually also take this thing right here

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.349 
actually also take this thing right here
and<00:02:31.099> you<00:02:32.099> can<00:02:32.250> move<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.549> whole<00:02:32.790> trigger

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
and you can move the whole trigger

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.660 
and you can move the whole trigger
assembly<00:02:33.540> all<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.170> way<00:02:34.260> out<00:02:34.409> so<00:02:34.709> you<00:02:35.280> can<00:02:35.459> you

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
assembly all the way out so you can you

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.250 
assembly all the way out so you can you
can<00:02:35.849> basically<00:02:36.000> be<00:02:36.239> in<00:02:36.299> a<00:02:36.359> situation<00:02:36.810> where<00:02:36.959> if

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
can basically be in a situation where if

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.750 
can basically be in a situation where if
you<00:02:37.620> want<00:02:37.799> the<00:02:37.859> trigger<00:02:38.069> a<00:02:38.099> little<00:02:38.340> closer<00:02:38.519> you

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
you want the trigger a little closer you

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.250 
you want the trigger a little closer you
can<00:02:38.939> or<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.269> can<00:02:39.390> slide<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.720> whole<00:02:39.840> thing<00:02:40.049> so

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
can or you can slide the whole thing so

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.720 
can or you can slide the whole thing so
if<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.709> got<00:02:40.829> if<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.129> happen<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.310> have<00:02:41.430> you

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
if you got if you happen to have you

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.729 
if you got if you happen to have you
know<00:02:41.819> gorilla<00:02:42.239> paws<00:02:42.420> or<00:02:42.780> whatever<00:02:43.079> I<00:02:43.409> guess

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
know gorilla paws or whatever I guess

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.080 
know gorilla paws or whatever I guess
girl<00:02:44.069> is<00:02:44.159> ahead<00:02:44.280> pause<00:02:44.609> but<00:02:44.790> if<00:02:44.879> you<00:02:44.939> have

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
girl is ahead pause but if you have

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.390 
girl is ahead pause but if you have
gorilla<00:02:45.359> paws<00:02:45.599> you<00:02:45.900> can<00:02:46.379> send<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.159> trigger

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
gorilla paws you can send the trigger

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.069 
gorilla paws you can send the trigger
way<00:02:47.549> out<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:47.909> if<00:02:48.269> you've<00:02:48.420> got<00:02:48.540> little<00:02:48.720> renal

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
way out and if you've got little renal

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.330 
way out and if you've got little renal
Rainbow<00:02:49.349> Brite<00:02:49.500> girlie<00:02:49.829> hands<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.190> can

don't<00:03:09.180> mind<00:03:09.329> the<00:03:09.420> Duster<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.840> little<00:03:10.049> bit<00:03:10.200> I

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
don't mind the Duster a little bit I

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.589 
don't mind the Duster a little bit I
never<00:03:11.609> did<00:03:11.790> take<00:03:11.939> the<00:03:12.030> plastic<00:03:12.329> cover<00:03:12.510> off

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
never did take the plastic cover off

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.250 
never did take the plastic cover off
some<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:12.930> this<00:03:13.049> stuff<00:03:13.319> but<00:03:14.090> so<00:03:15.090> this<00:03:15.959> is<00:03:16.109> my

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
some of this stuff but so this is my

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.319 
some of this stuff but so this is my
radio<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.799> I'm<00:03:17.549> not<00:03:17.700> sure<00:03:17.849> how<00:03:17.970> good<00:03:18.030> you<00:03:18.209> can

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
radio and I'm not sure how good you can

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.309 
radio and I'm not sure how good you can
see<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.540> screen<00:03:18.720> but<00:03:18.900> I'll<00:03:19.019> make<00:03:19.139> sure<00:03:19.260> that

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
see the screen but I'll make sure that

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.589 
see the screen but I'll make sure that
you<00:03:19.439> can<00:03:19.590> hear<00:03:19.709> it<00:03:19.829> a<00:03:19.889> little<00:03:19.980> bit<00:03:20.220> I<00:03:20.599> don't

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
you can hear it a little bit I don't

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.970 
you can hear it a little bit I don't
know<00:03:21.660> why<00:03:21.750> that<00:03:21.870> was<00:03:21.959> down<00:03:23.000> so<00:03:24.000> as<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:24.299> can<00:03:24.449> see

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
know why that was down so as you can see

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.619 
know why that was down so as you can see
there's<00:03:25.980> my<00:03:26.160> model<00:03:26.549> and<00:03:26.699> the<00:03:27.329> way<00:03:27.419> I<00:03:27.449> have<00:03:27.510> it

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
there's my model and the way I have it

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.780 
there's my model and the way I have it
set<00:03:27.720> up<00:03:27.959> as<00:03:28.199> you<00:03:28.290> can<00:03:28.530> see<00:03:28.859> you<00:03:29.430> know<00:03:29.519> basically

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
set up as you can see you know basically

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.000 
set up as you can see you know basically
how<00:03:29.970> far<00:03:30.209> your<00:03:30.359> end<00:03:30.480> points<00:03:30.810> are<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.169> then<00:03:31.889> up

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
how far your end points are and then up

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.569 
how far your end points are and then up
here<00:03:32.040> you<00:03:33.500> can<00:03:34.500> see<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:34.620> little<00:03:34.709> better<00:03:34.829> you<00:03:35.099> can

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
here you can see a little better you can

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.080 
here you can see a little better you can
see<00:03:35.669> the<00:03:35.790> dr<00:03:36.120> says<00:03:36.359> 180<00:03:37.139> l<00:03:37.470> says<00:03:37.769> 58<00:03:38.129> now<00:03:38.849> if<00:03:38.970> we

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
see the dr says 180 l says 58 now if we

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.500 
see the dr says 180 l says 58 now if we
go<00:03:39.239> down<00:03:39.389> to<00:03:39.919> end<00:03:41.000> point<00:03:42.000> you<00:03:42.120> can<00:03:42.239> see<00:03:42.329> that<00:03:42.449> my

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
go down to end point you can see that my

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.559 
go down to end point you can see that my
steering<00:03:42.870> left<00:03:43.109> is<00:03:43.379> at<00:03:43.530> 89<00:03:43.949> writes<00:03:44.849> at<00:03:44.970> 84<00:03:45.359> and

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
steering left is at 89 writes at 84 and

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.930 
steering left is at 89 writes at 84 and
then<00:03:46.019> I<00:03:46.109> run<00:03:46.349> the<00:03:46.500> throttle<00:03:46.919> always<00:03:47.459> at<00:03:47.549> 100<00:03:47.879> in

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
then I run the throttle always at 100 in

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.960 
then I run the throttle always at 100 in
the<00:03:48.000> break<00:03:48.150> at<00:03:48.269> 100<00:03:48.599> now<00:03:48.959> you<00:03:49.019> can<00:03:49.260> see<00:03:49.470> that

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
the break at 100 now you can see that

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.530 
the break at 100 now you can see that
this<00:03:50.970> radio<00:03:51.299> actually<00:03:51.599> goes<00:03:51.750> up<00:03:52.079> to<00:03:52.889> 120<00:03:53.540> but

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
this radio actually goes up to 120 but

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.140 
this radio actually goes up to 120 but
I'm<00:03:54.629> going<00:03:54.750> to<00:03:54.810> warn<00:03:55.049> you<00:03:55.609> some<00:03:56.609> people<00:03:56.819> think

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
I'm going to warn you some people think

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.309 
I'm going to warn you some people think
that<00:03:57.209> it's<00:03:57.419> a<00:03:57.449> good<00:03:57.569> idea<00:03:57.629> to<00:03:57.780> calibrate<00:03:58.169> their

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
that it's a good idea to calibrate their

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.580 
that it's a good idea to calibrate their
speed<00:03:58.470> controls<00:03:58.769> using<00:03:59.040> 120<00:03:59.810> but<00:04:00.810> the

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
speed controls using 120 but the

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.869 
speed controls using 120 but the
downside<00:04:01.859> is<00:04:02.190> if<00:04:02.699> you<00:04:03.769> calculate<00:04:04.769> your<00:04:05.040> if<00:04:05.549> you

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
downside is if you calculate your if you

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.259 
downside is if you calculate your if you
calibrate<00:04:06.209> your<00:04:06.419> speed<00:04:06.690> control<00:04:06.840> using<00:04:07.739> 120

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
calibrate your speed control using 120

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.000 
calibrate your speed control using 120
you<00:04:09.269> may<00:04:09.449> end<00:04:09.629> up<00:04:09.720> in<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:09.930> situation<00:04:10.139> where<00:04:10.530> the

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
you may end up in a situation where the

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.589 
you may end up in a situation where the
speed<00:04:11.220> control<00:04:11.519> just<00:04:11.699> does<00:04:11.909> not<00:04:12.060> recognize

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
speed control just does not recognize

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.289 
speed control just does not recognize
the<00:04:12.810> radio<00:04:13.079> input<00:04:13.440> or<00:04:14.159> the<00:04:14.549> radio<00:04:14.819> is<00:04:15.000> sending

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
the radio input or the radio is sending

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.629 
the radio input or the radio is sending
a<00:04:15.359> signal<00:04:15.510> that's<00:04:15.870> just<00:04:16.159> too<00:04:17.159> much<00:04:17.370> for<00:04:17.549> the

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
a signal that's just too much for the

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.670 
a signal that's just too much for the
speed<00:04:17.849> control<00:04:18.150> I<00:04:18.329> do<00:04:18.720> know<00:04:19.109> for<00:04:19.320> a<00:04:19.349> specific

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
speed control I do know for a specific

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.460 
speed control I do know for a specific
fact<00:04:20.159> that<00:04:20.970> lrp<00:04:21.570> speed<00:04:21.840> controls<00:04:22.199> are

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
fact that lrp speed controls are

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.529 
fact that lrp speed controls are
designed<00:04:23.159> to<00:04:23.310> be<00:04:23.460> calibrated<00:04:24.000> with<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.270> radio

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
designed to be calibrated with the radio

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:28.580 
designed to be calibrated with the radio
set<00:04:24.870> at<00:04:25.020> 100<00:04:25.760> now<00:04:26.760> I<00:04:27.120> can't<00:04:28.080> tell<00:04:28.229> you<00:04:28.409> on<00:04:28.560> a

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
set at 100 now I can't tell you on a

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.690 
set at 100 now I can't tell you on a
spectrum<00:04:29.039> or<00:04:29.279> air<00:04:29.370> trying

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
spectrum or air trying

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.060 
spectrum or air trying
or<00:04:29.790> any<00:04:29.940> of<00:04:29.970> those<00:04:30.060> other<00:04:30.180> radios<00:04:30.570> exactly<00:04:31.530> if

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
or any of those other radios exactly if

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.440 
or any of those other radios exactly if
it's<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.370> same<00:04:32.550> but<00:04:33.150> I<00:04:33.210> would<00:04:33.360> definitely

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
it's the same but I would definitely

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.730 
it's the same but I would definitely
take<00:04:33.810> a<00:04:33.840> look<00:04:33.990> into<00:04:34.290> it<00:04:34.410> to<00:04:34.500> make<00:04:34.620> sure<00:04:34.650> that

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
take a look into it to make sure that

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.530 
take a look into it to make sure that
you<00:04:34.950> don't<00:04:35.130> end<00:04:35.280> up<00:04:35.340> calibrating<00:04:36.270> your<00:04:36.390> stuff

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
you don't end up calibrating your stuff

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.220 
you don't end up calibrating your stuff
improperly<00:04:37.700> now<00:04:38.700> end<00:04:39.150> points<00:04:40.020> are<00:04:40.080> pretty

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
improperly now end points are pretty

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.340 
improperly now end points are pretty
simple<00:04:40.640> you<00:04:41.640> just<00:04:41.820> go<00:04:41.940> ahead<00:04:42.030> and<00:04:42.390> you<00:04:42.720> take

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
simple you just go ahead and you take

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.440 
simple you just go ahead and you take
your<00:04:43.380> buggy<00:04:43.710> and<00:04:44.060> you<00:04:45.060> turn<00:04:45.210> the<00:04:45.300> wheel<00:04:45.420> all

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
your buggy and you turn the wheel all

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.020 
your buggy and you turn the wheel all
the<00:04:45.630> way<00:04:45.720> to<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:45.990> left<00:04:46.170> and<00:04:46.760> then<00:04:47.760> you<00:04:47.790> just

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
the way to the left and then you just

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.940 
the way to the left and then you just
dial<00:04:48.390> it<00:04:48.540> back<00:04:48.570> until<00:04:49.530> it's<00:04:49.740> no<00:04:49.920> longer

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
dial it back until it's no longer

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.490 
dial it back until it's no longer
binding<00:04:50.700> until<00:04:51.390> it<00:04:51.510> just<00:04:51.600> barely<00:04:51.900> locks<00:04:52.260> out

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
binding until it just barely locks out

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.710 
binding until it just barely locks out
and<00:04:52.800> you<00:04:52.890> do<00:04:52.980> that<00:04:53.100> for<00:04:53.160> both<00:04:53.430> sides<00:04:53.720> now

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
and you do that for both sides now

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.580 
and you do that for both sides now
brakes<00:04:55.050> hmm<00:04:56.040> it's<00:04:56.610> a<00:04:56.670> little<00:04:56.700> trickier<00:04:57.270> I<00:04:57.590> set

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
brakes hmm it's a little trickier I set

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.070 
brakes hmm it's a little trickier I set
my<00:04:58.710> brake<00:04:58.950> at<00:04:59.070> 100<00:04:59.400> on<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.550> radio<00:04:59.870> but<00:05:00.870> I<00:05:00.900> use

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
my brake at 100 on the radio but I use

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.040 
my brake at 100 on the radio but I use
something<00:05:01.350> called<00:05:01.500> a<00:05:01.710> TL<00:05:02.040> and<00:05:03.050> that's

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
something called a TL and that's

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.370 
something called a TL and that's
adjustable<00:05:04.980> throttle<00:05:05.790> limiting<00:05:06.360> but<00:05:07.230> on

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
adjustable throttle limiting but on

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.830 
adjustable throttle limiting but on
electric<00:05:07.920> vehicles<00:05:08.670> that's<00:05:08.910> only<00:05:09.210> for<00:05:09.630> the

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
electric vehicles that's only for the

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.890 
electric vehicles that's only for the
brake<00:05:10.020> side<00:05:10.290> now<00:05:10.920> I<00:05:10.980> have<00:05:11.280> a<00:05:11.580> little<00:05:12.450> dial<00:05:12.690> down

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
brake side now I have a little dial down

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.220 
brake side now I have a little dial down
here<00:05:13.260> this<00:05:14.070> one<00:05:14.280> controls<00:05:14.580> dual<00:05:14.910> rate<00:05:15.120> and<00:05:15.330> the

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
here this one controls dual rate and the

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.410 
here this one controls dual rate and the
bottom<00:05:16.530> one<00:05:16.680> the<00:05:17.430> top<00:05:17.610> on<00:05:17.760> the<00:05:17.820> dual<00:05:17.940> rate<00:05:18.120> the

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420 
bottom one the top on the dual rate the

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.830 
bottom one the top on the dual rate the
bottom<00:05:18.660> ones<00:05:18.810> ata<00:05:19.400> now<00:05:20.400> basically<00:05:21.090> I<00:05:21.570> can

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
bottom ones ata now basically I can

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.200 
bottom ones ata now basically I can
leave<00:05:21.990> my<00:05:22.230> brake<00:05:22.650> at<00:05:22.920> 100<00:05:23.340> and<00:05:23.520> I<00:05:23.790> can<00:05:23.970> adjust

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
leave my brake at 100 and I can adjust

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.590 
leave my brake at 100 and I can adjust
it<00:05:24.600> on<00:05:24.690> the<00:05:24.750> fly<00:05:24.930> with<00:05:25.380> my<00:05:25.530> ATL<00:05:25.980> so<00:05:26.600> technically

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
it on the fly with my ATL so technically

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.430 
it on the fly with my ATL so technically
that's<00:05:27.720> 50<00:05:28.050> percent<00:05:28.080> brake<00:05:28.610> 58<00:05:29.870> 64<00:05:30.870> wherever<00:05:31.350> I

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
that's 50 percent brake 58 64 wherever I

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.540 
that's 50 percent brake 58 64 wherever I
want<00:05:31.770> it<00:05:32.180> so<00:05:33.180> ATL<00:05:33.690> is<00:05:33.720> brake<00:05:34.140> side<00:05:34.380> only<00:05:34.620> for

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
want it so ATL is brake side only for

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.670 
want it so ATL is brake side only for
the<00:05:35.610> speed<00:05:35.820> control<00:05:36.120> and<00:05:36.240> dual<00:05:36.870> rate<00:05:37.110> that's

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
the speed control and dual rate that's

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.380 
the speed control and dual rate that's
that's<00:05:38.160> basically<00:05:38.400> once<00:05:38.790> you<00:05:38.910> set<00:05:39.120> your<00:05:39.150> end

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
that's basically once you set your end

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.000 
that's basically once you set your end
points<00:05:39.750> and<00:05:39.840> you<00:05:40.140> have<00:05:40.170> everything<00:05:40.680> that<00:05:40.830> goes

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
points and you have everything that goes

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.960 
points and you have everything that goes
lock<00:05:41.310> left<00:05:41.730> and<00:05:42.000> lock<00:05:42.120> right<00:05:43.580> dual<00:05:44.580> rate<00:05:44.790> just

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
lock left and lock right dual rate just

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.420 
lock left and lock right dual rate just
allows<00:05:45.210> you<00:05:45.450> to<00:05:45.600> use<00:05:45.840> a<00:05:46.220> percentage<00:05:47.220> of

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
allows you to use a percentage of

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.490 
allows you to use a percentage of
steering<00:05:47.880> so<00:05:48.270> if<00:05:48.480> your<00:05:48.600> dual<00:05:48.780> rates<00:05:48.990> at<00:05:49.140> 100

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
steering so if your dual rates at 100

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.710 
steering so if your dual rates at 100
the<00:05:50.370> wheels<00:05:50.580> will<00:05:50.760> turn<00:05:50.910> lock<00:05:51.150> to<00:05:51.300> lock<00:05:51.330> both

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
the wheels will turn lock to lock both

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.650 
the wheels will turn lock to lock both
left<00:05:52.200> and<00:05:52.380> right<00:05:52.560> if<00:05:52.770> the<00:05:53.700> dual<00:05:53.880> rates<00:05:54.120> at<00:05:54.270> 90

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
left and right if the dual rates at 90

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.170 
left and right if the dual rates at 90
the<00:05:55.620> steering<00:05:55.950> will<00:05:56.100> only<00:05:56.220> turn<00:05:56.460> 90<00:05:56.850> percent

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
the steering will only turn 90 percent

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.270 
the steering will only turn 90 percent
left<00:05:57.330> and<00:05:57.600> 90<00:05:57.930> percent<00:05:57.960> right<00:05:58.470> so<00:06:01.160> one<00:06:02.160> other

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
left and 90 percent right so one other

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.320 
left and 90 percent right so one other
function<00:06:02.520> you<00:06:02.760> might<00:06:02.850> really<00:06:03.060> want<00:06:03.150> to

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
function you might really want to

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.390 
function you might really want to
consider<00:06:03.480> is<00:06:06.080> exponential<00:06:07.160> exponential<00:06:08.160> is

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
consider is exponential exponential is

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.840 
consider is exponential exponential is
right<00:06:08.550> here<00:06:08.870> throttle<00:06:09.870> x-bow<00:06:10.340> steering<00:06:11.340> Expo

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
right here throttle x-bow steering Expo

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.630 
right here throttle x-bow steering Expo
now<00:06:12.240> nobody<00:06:12.750> I<00:06:12.780> know<00:06:12.870> uses<00:06:13.320> steering<00:06:13.620> Expo<00:06:13.950> but

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:14.640 
now nobody I know uses steering Expo but

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.400 
now nobody I know uses steering Expo but
a<00:06:14.670> lot<00:06:14.880> of<00:06:15.150> people<00:06:15.390> use<00:06:15.540> throttle<00:06:15.930> Expo<00:06:16.200> and

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410 
a lot of people use throttle Expo and

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.250 
a lot of people use throttle Expo and
the<00:06:16.740> reason<00:06:17.040> is<00:06:17.360> basically<00:06:18.360> if<00:06:18.540> you're<00:06:19.140> on<00:06:19.230> a

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:19.260 
the reason is basically if you're on a

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.140 
the reason is basically if you're on a
slippery<00:06:19.530> track<00:06:19.890> you<00:06:20.400> can<00:06:20.550> put<00:06:20.700> some<00:06:20.820> negative

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
slippery track you can put some negative

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.540 
slippery track you can put some negative
Expo<00:06:21.450> in<00:06:21.570> the<00:06:21.660> car<00:06:21.840> and<00:06:22.130> as<00:06:23.130> you<00:06:23.310> grab<00:06:23.520> the

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
Expo in the car and as you grab the

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.120 
Expo in the car and as you grab the
throttle<00:06:24.120> it'll<00:06:24.630> be<00:06:24.780> more<00:06:25.050> gentle<00:06:25.380> earlier<00:06:25.950> on

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
throttle it'll be more gentle earlier on

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.760 
throttle it'll be more gentle earlier on
in<00:06:26.310> the<00:06:26.400> band<00:06:26.610> and<00:06:26.880> then<00:06:27.390> as<00:06:27.630> the<00:06:28.050> car<00:06:28.260> as<00:06:28.560> you

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
in the band and then as the car as you

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.050 
in the band and then as the car as you
squeeze<00:06:29.010> the<00:06:29.100> throttle<00:06:29.250> more<00:06:29.550> full<00:06:29.880> power

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
squeeze the throttle more full power

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.360 
squeeze the throttle more full power
will<00:06:30.300> come<00:06:30.450> on<00:06:30.660> now<00:06:31.620> if<00:06:31.890> you<00:06:32.010> have<00:06:32.160> a<00:06:32.190> high

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
will come on now if you have a high

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.560 
will come on now if you have a high
traction<00:06:32.640> track<00:06:32.970> sometimes<00:06:33.210> you'll<00:06:33.480> do

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:33.570 
traction track sometimes you'll do

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.360 
traction track sometimes you'll do
exactly<00:06:33.600> the<00:06:33.990> opposite<00:06:34.410> you'll<00:06:34.980> go<00:06:35.130> ahead<00:06:35.250> and

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
exactly the opposite you'll go ahead and

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.650 
exactly the opposite you'll go ahead and
you'll<00:06:35.550> put<00:06:35.730> a<00:06:35.760> little<00:06:35.880> bit<00:06:35.970> of<00:06:36.060> positive<00:06:36.360> x1

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
you'll put a little bit of positive x1

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.180 
you'll put a little bit of positive x1
there<00:06:36.810> so<00:06:37.050> the<00:06:37.140> car<00:06:37.350> just<00:06:37.500> jumps<00:06:37.890> right<00:06:37.950> out<00:06:38.160> of

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
there so the car just jumps right out of

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.670 
there so the car just jumps right out of
the<00:06:38.340> corners<00:06:38.700> but<00:06:38.960> generally<00:06:39.960> speaking<00:06:39.990> I<00:06:40.440> try

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 
the corners but generally speaking I try

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.890 
the corners but generally speaking I try
to<00:06:40.740> leave<00:06:40.890> everything<00:06:41.160> at<00:06:41.400> zero<00:06:41.640> but<00:06:42.630> if<00:06:42.750> it's

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 
to leave everything at zero but if it's

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:43.610 
to leave everything at zero but if it's
a<00:06:42.960> little<00:06:43.140> slippery

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
a little slippery

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.870 
a little slippery
I'll<00:06:43.650> definitely<00:06:43.830> turn<00:06:44.160> the<00:06:44.280> x-bow<00:06:44.520> down<00:06:44.729> on

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 
I'll definitely turn the x-bow down on

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.750 
I'll definitely turn the x-bow down on
the<00:06:44.970> throttle<00:06:45.710> other<00:06:46.710> than<00:06:46.979> that<00:06:47.040> there's<00:06:47.669> a

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:47.760 
the throttle other than that there's a

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.040 
the throttle other than that there's a
ton<00:06:47.910> of<00:06:47.970> functions<00:06:48.360> a<00:06:48.449> lot<00:06:48.570> of<00:06:48.630> these<00:06:48.720> radios

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
ton of functions a lot of these radios

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.659 
ton of functions a lot of these radios
have<00:06:49.290> with<00:06:49.530> lap<00:06:49.740> timers<00:06:50.160> and<00:06:50.280> all<00:06:50.370> that<00:06:50.490> kind

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:50.669 
have with lap timers and all that kind

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:52.100 
have with lap timers and all that kind
of<00:06:50.699> fancy<00:06:51.000> stuff<00:06:51.060> but<00:06:51.600> I<00:06:51.630> don't<00:06:51.720> know<00:06:51.870> that<00:06:52.050> you

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110 
of fancy stuff but I don't know that you

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.960 
of fancy stuff but I don't know that you
really<00:06:52.229> need<00:06:52.320> much<00:06:52.710> or<00:06:53.100> any<00:06:53.340> of<00:06:53.490> it<00:06:53.580> other<00:06:53.760> than

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:53.970 
really need much or any of it other than

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:59.030 
really need much or any of it other than
dual<00:06:54.750> rate<00:06:55.220> exponential<00:06:56.220> and<00:06:56.900> ATL<00:06:57.900> so<00:06:58.470> that's

00:06:59.030 --> 00:06:59.040 
dual rate exponential and ATL so that's

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.550 
dual rate exponential and ATL so that's
about<00:06:59.160> that<00:07:02.660> okay<00:07:03.660> well<00:07:03.990> there<00:07:04.110> you<00:07:04.199> have<00:07:04.410> it

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 
about that okay well there you have it

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.560 
about that okay well there you have it
we<00:07:05.130> talked<00:07:05.340> a<00:07:05.370> little<00:07:05.550> bit<00:07:05.699> about<00:07:05.820> dual<00:07:06.120> rate<00:07:06.360> a

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:06.570 
we talked a little bit about dual rate a

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:12.320 
we talked a little bit about dual rate a
little<00:07:06.840> bit<00:07:06.930> about<00:07:07.080> EPA<00:07:09.139> ATL<00:07:11.240> exponential<00:07:12.240> all

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.330 
little bit about EPA ATL exponential all

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.680 
little bit about EPA ATL exponential all
that<00:07:12.510> stuff<00:07:12.800> basically<00:07:13.800> your<00:07:14.639> radio<00:07:15.030> outside

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:15.690 
that stuff basically your radio outside

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.350 
that stuff basically your radio outside
of<00:07:16.080> having<00:07:16.199> the<00:07:16.410> perfect<00:07:16.620> tires<00:07:17.039> your<00:07:17.970> radio

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 
of having the perfect tires your radio

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.719 
of having the perfect tires your radio
is<00:07:18.479> probably<00:07:18.870> the<00:07:19.169> the<00:07:19.710> next<00:07:20.100> most<00:07:20.280> important

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:20.729 
is probably the the next most important

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:23.330 
is probably the the next most important
things<00:07:20.940> to<00:07:21.389> get<00:07:21.539> set<00:07:21.720> up<00:07:21.750> right<00:07:22.080> you<00:07:23.039> probably

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:23.340 
things to get set up right you probably

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.890 
things to get set up right you probably
have<00:07:23.520> your<00:07:23.639> speed<00:07:23.850> control<00:07:23.940> off<00:07:24.270> a<00:07:24.539> little<00:07:24.660> bit

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900 
have your speed control off a little bit

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.659 
have your speed control off a little bit
and<00:07:25.080> you<00:07:25.229> can<00:07:25.380> really<00:07:25.530> tune<00:07:25.830> with<00:07:26.039> the<00:07:26.130> radio<00:07:26.400> I

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:26.669 
and you can really tune with the radio I

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:29.900 
and you can really tune with the radio I
don't<00:07:27.060> think<00:07:27.270> enough<00:07:27.539> racers<00:07:28.199> out<00:07:28.350> there<00:07:28.910> pay

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:29.910 
don't think enough racers out there pay

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:31.700 
don't think enough racers out there pay
close<00:07:30.240> enough<00:07:30.419> attention<00:07:30.570> to<00:07:31.080> really<00:07:31.380> fine

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:31.710 
close enough attention to really fine

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.650 
close enough attention to really fine
tuning<00:07:32.190> the<00:07:32.699> way<00:07:32.820> their<00:07:33.000> car<00:07:33.210> handles<00:07:33.510> with

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:33.660 
tuning the way their car handles with

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.629 
tuning the way their car handles with
the<00:07:33.690> radio<00:07:34.050> these<00:07:34.860> rate<00:07:35.100> we<00:07:35.250> pay<00:07:35.400> a<00:07:35.430> lot<00:07:35.610> of

00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:35.639 
the radio these rate we pay a lot of

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:36.860 
the radio these rate we pay a lot of
money<00:07:35.760> for<00:07:36.030> these<00:07:36.150> things<00:07:36.210> I<00:07:36.449> mean<00:07:36.600> this<00:07:36.690> one
