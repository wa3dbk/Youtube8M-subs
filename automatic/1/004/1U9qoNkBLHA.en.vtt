thirdly is the ninety degree rule so if

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.979 
thirdly is the ninety degree rule so if
I<00:02:26.819> was<00:02:26.970> going<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.120> be<00:02:27.239> sitting<00:02:27.599> in<00:02:27.780> this<00:02:27.930> chair

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
I was going to be sitting in this chair

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.280 
I was going to be sitting in this chair
right<00:02:28.440> here<00:02:29.690> that<00:02:30.690> makes<00:02:30.900> my<00:02:31.049> body

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
right here that makes my body

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.619 
right here that makes my body
orientation<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:32.069> 90<00:02:32.370> degree<00:02:32.610> angle<00:02:32.640> that's

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
orientation a 90 degree angle that's

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:34.550 
orientation a 90 degree angle that's
safe<00:02:33.989> okay

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
safe okay

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.250 
safe okay
this<00:02:35.370> rule<00:02:35.610> pertains<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.090> if<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.720> close<00:02:37.019> that

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
this rule pertains to if you close that

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.050 
this rule pertains to if you close that
angle<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.620> make<00:02:37.860> it<00:02:38.010> less<00:02:38.220> than<00:02:38.430> 90<00:02:38.730> degrees

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
angle you make it less than 90 degrees

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.869 
angle you make it less than 90 degrees

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
so you can't bend forward past 90

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.949 
so you can't bend forward past 90
degrees<00:02:42.209> or<00:02:42.799> with<00:02:43.799> your<00:02:44.010> left<00:02:44.310> leg<00:02:44.840> bring<00:02:45.840> it
