00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
offense what's next year I think you're

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.280 
offense what's next year I think you're
going<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.340> continue<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.940> watch<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.780> offense

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
going to continue to watch the offense

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.260 
going to continue to watch the offense
really<00:00:43.890> evolve<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.520> that's<00:00:44.700> obviously<00:00:44.940> going

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
really evolve and that's obviously going

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.630 
really evolve and that's obviously going
to<00:00:45.539> include<00:00:45.930> Nathan<00:00:46.620> Scheelhaase<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.370> think

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
to include Nathan Scheelhaase I think

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.220 
to include Nathan Scheelhaase I think
one<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.969> reasons<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.329> he<00:00:48.570> won<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> job

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
one of the reasons that he won a job

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.110 
one of the reasons that he won a job
last<00:00:49.620> year<00:00:49.950> was<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.460> fact<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:50.760> he<00:00:50.850> was<00:00:50.969> able

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
last year was the fact that he was able

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.209 
last year was the fact that he was able
to<00:00:51.300> make<00:00:51.539> plays<00:00:51.840> with<00:00:52.170> his<00:00:52.350> legs<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
to make plays with his legs so the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.619 
to make plays with his legs so the
entire<00:00:53.489> offense<00:00:53.969> wasn't<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.420> at<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
entire offense wasn't in at the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.029 
entire offense wasn't in at the
beginning<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.170> year<00:00:55.410> but<00:00:55.800> when<00:00:55.890> they

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
beginning of the year but when they

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.279 
beginning of the year but when they
finally<00:00:56.340> got<00:00:56.610> into<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> situation<00:00:57.090> later<00:00:57.840> on<00:00:58.079> in

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
finally got into a situation later on in

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.099 
finally got into a situation later on in
the<00:00:58.379> season<00:00:58.620> where<00:00:59.250> he<00:00:59.280> could<00:00:59.879> understand<00:01:00.750> and

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
the season where he could understand and

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.590 
the season where he could understand and
really<00:01:01.620> get<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> good<00:01:02.430> focus<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> grasp<00:01:03.359> on

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
really get a good focus on a grasp on

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.719 
really get a good focus on a grasp on
the<00:01:03.660> off<00:01:03.930> fence<00:01:04.229> they<00:01:04.589> were<00:01:04.650> able<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.040> continue

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
the off fence they were able to continue

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.399 
the off fence they were able to continue
to<00:01:06.090> add<00:01:06.240> more<00:01:06.510> plays<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.990> think<00:01:07.170> they're<00:01:07.290> going

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
to add more plays I think they're going

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.899 
to add more plays I think they're going
to<00:01:07.470> continue<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.890> add<00:01:08.070> plays<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:08.580> year<00:01:08.640> as

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
to continue to add plays this year as

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.700 
to continue to add plays this year as
well<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.390> we're<00:01:09.750> going<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.930> see<00:01:10.200> him<00:01:10.470> develop

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
well and we're going to see him develop

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.429 
well and we're going to see him develop
more<00:01:11.280> as<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> passive<00:01:12.150> there's<00:01:12.689> some<00:01:12.930> danger<00:01:13.380> in

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
more as a passive there's some danger in

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.350 
more as a passive there's some danger in
this<00:01:13.560> evolution<00:01:14.280> thing<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.640> mean<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:14.880> go<00:01:15.030> back<00:01:15.210> to
