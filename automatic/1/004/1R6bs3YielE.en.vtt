00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.680
 Welcome today, I'll show you 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.109
 how to do league of legends 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.719
 live bar in a particular color 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.049
 I would like to have changes 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.730
 have just in game the color orange 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.650
 taken by wright that was confirmed 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.990
 that one is not banished because 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.210
 that no intervention otherwise plays is into the 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.859
 game is there is just the color of 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.869
 railroad terrain so that in the team time so 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.340
 a bit has the advantage that you 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.570
 see yourself because if all 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.859
 always the same have it a bit 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.650
 I already have a file 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.480
 prepared where the color is the same 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.250
 you have to only dollar and if you 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.140
 Otherwise, she might like the color too 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.910
 Change yourself as I show you 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.800
 I have this one right now 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.920
 bit adjusted slightly stronger green 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.360
 taken and something for the opponents 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.950
 bright red so you stop that way 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.289
 a little bit in the overview it goes 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.230
 actually alone about the 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.350
 general character file under the dash 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.239
 she lets you get that file over 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.640
 this download link in the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.680
 description is unfortunately I have no 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.650
 own house roof or no cloud 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.420
 memory that I offer that differently 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.010
 that means you can just open one 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.869
 new tab or click in the 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.820
 description below on the link so then 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.890
 This small side cloud opens up 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.070
 zero i really can not help it 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.930
 then you click on download free 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.729
 is then prepared that will take then 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.950
 It takes about 30 seconds to do that 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.840
 30 seconds not approximately it takes 30 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.700
 seconds then I'll show you right here 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.170
 make it so the file gets 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.759
 It's not that hard 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.409
 and you can do that for a short while 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.909
 Do not earn money with it that's easy 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.689
 only quickly created free account 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:43.680
 so you general character in 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:45.299
 blabla can download that's all 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.979
 I have not found anything else now 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.930
 on the fast what somehow 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.549
 Reasonably good would be here then 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.020
 a text if you do not read correctly 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.619
 you can here on this part 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.810
 to press 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:00.090
 You can always change that then 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:02.369
 you just make eeg mwst 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.840
 a blank and then the house number 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.600
 is the number eleven and then enter 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.099
 press then comes a small page 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.300
 you have the maximum number of free 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.340
 downloads I've just got that 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.140
 just tried that you can 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.480
 Download a single time 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.700
 the file otherwise you have to be his account 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.950
 the three hours have to wait 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.660
 or so so the file you can do so 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.150
 In any case , the file could get 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.980
 also retransmit colleagues if you like that 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.880
 could have usually taken 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.570
 you can download now 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:35.730
 the file is 16 16 16 kilobytes big so 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.560
 and then the file is easy with the 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.140
 right mouse button cut out from 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.200

 the right mouse button the file a the 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.830
 you can then overwrite or or 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.660
 you would still have paste 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.260
 not that is not there because that added 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.420
 there 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.040
 then you can use this file with a 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.220
 double click open 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.840
 and if you changed your eleven now 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.280
 wanted to have a particular color 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.579
 I once again a string in the 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:36.750
 description this is color scheme online 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:40.049
 v2 there you can have any color 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.510
 click and the color code you have 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.799
 Here you only need to pay these three 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.799
 I'll show you now like that 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:50.190
 works it's easy it 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:54.510
 go to edit and then go 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:57.570
 are you just here above self de 1 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.400
 then you go on searching and then 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.200
 you can find your column down here 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.180
 that you need then you go up 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.500
 abort, stop 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.500
 scroll down a bit here you 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.920
 have to stay on self de champions 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.799
 even fouled and then you have home 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.079
 Eleven was carla this is your pharma 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.090
 healthcare it's only important 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.489
 These three numbers have to be changed 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.650
 but with the blank it stays that way 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.030
 means you have 255 here the last time 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.760
 ignored that is just the 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.440
 Coverage of color in the game that is 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.790
 If you are 2008 then it will always be 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.050
 more transparent and at some point you can 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.450
 Do not see the color anymore 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.930
 that means those three are paying 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:43.350
 important that means if you say now 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:46.530
 we want you to like the color you 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.410
 I would like the color I had now 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:53.870
 of orange waiting sometimes get the short 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:56.100
 25 51 53 51 I think so or so 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.580
 25 years that gives way a bit 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.520
 from it 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.230
 but that's just when you're the one 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.120
 the color wants to have the up here 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.480
 or let's say, for example, the bread 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:10.800
 here 255 is marked at the beginning then you 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:12.870
 this number and leads for it 51 1 51 and 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.780
 for the zero mark also quite beautiful 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:19.620
 clean 51 then you can the file 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:22.680
 just save it and then you have 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.060
 this color as life bar in-game me 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.130
 I do not want to save that now because of me 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.220
 I did that a bit darker orange 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.680
 that's very important yes and then 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.150
 Do you already have this color in 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.530
 Game if you just have the file 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.490
 downloads then it stays just like 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.200
 I have that too 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.090
 otherwise you can change the same 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.890
 with this page here 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.200

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.300

 quite simply then insert the steps 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.550
 after how it said that I am 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.590
