00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:08.489 
beautiful
the<00:07:06.879> jumpies<00:07:07.269> were<00:07:07.509> pretty<00:07:07.749> good<00:07:07.959> as<00:07:08.080> well<00:07:08.110> but

00:07:08.489 --> 00:07:08.499 
the jumpies were pretty good as well but

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:10.559 
the jumpies were pretty good as well but
they<00:07:08.679> weren't<00:07:08.889> quite<00:07:09.429> as<00:07:09.459> flavorsome<00:07:10.179> as<00:07:10.419> the

00:07:10.559 --> 00:07:10.569 
they weren't quite as flavorsome as the

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:12.179 
they weren't quite as flavorsome as the
other<00:07:10.749> ones

00:07:12.179 --> 00:07:12.189 
other ones

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:14.489 
other ones
I<00:07:12.249> thought<00:07:12.789> likely<00:07:13.089> but<00:07:13.509> again<00:07:13.929> they're<00:07:14.469> not

00:07:14.489 --> 00:07:14.499 
I thought likely but again they're not

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:16.649 
I thought likely but again they're not
quite<00:07:14.919> got<00:07:15.219> that<00:07:15.279> sort<00:07:15.729> of<00:07:15.789> bang<00:07:16.149> to<00:07:16.360> them<00:07:16.479> so

00:07:16.649 --> 00:07:16.659 
quite got that sort of bang to them so

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:19.049 
quite got that sort of bang to them so
I'd<00:07:16.779> give<00:07:16.959> them<00:07:17.110> probably<00:07:17.529> an<00:07:17.679> eight<00:07:18.059> the

00:07:19.049 --> 00:07:19.059 
I'd give them probably an eight the

00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:21.059 
I'd give them probably an eight the
knickknacks<00:07:19.479> I<00:07:19.839> think<00:07:20.589> I'd<00:07:20.679> give<00:07:20.800> them<00:07:20.949> an

00:07:21.059 --> 00:07:21.069 
knickknacks I think I'd give them an

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:21.570 
knickknacks I think I'd give them an
eight<00:07:21.189> as<00:07:21.339> well

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:21.580 
eight as well

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.519 
eight as well

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:23.529 
I like them I'm just wondering what the

I like them I'm just wondering what the
actual<00:07:24.249> shell<00:07:24.729> is<00:07:25.089> on<00:07:25.330> the<00:07:25.449> outside<00:07:25.899> because

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:26.289 
actual shell is on the outside because

00:07:26.289 --> 00:07:29.449 
actual shell is on the outside because
unfortunately<00:07:26.969> my<00:07:27.969> German<00:07:28.419> is<00:07:28.629> at<00:07:28.869> best

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:29.459 
unfortunately my German is at best

00:07:29.459 --> 00:07:31.169

questionable<00:07:30.459> I've<00:07:30.610> got<00:07:30.759> a<00:07:30.789> choice<00:07:30.939> between

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:31.179 
questionable I've got a choice between

00:07:31.179 --> 00:07:35.249 
questionable I've got a choice between
German<00:07:31.749> or<00:07:31.869> Italian<00:07:31.990> and<00:07:33.509> on<00:07:34.509> the<00:07:34.749> packet<00:07:35.110> and

00:07:35.249 --> 00:07:35.259 
German or Italian and on the packet and

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:37.439 
German or Italian and on the packet and
frankly<00:07:35.680> neither<00:07:36.369> really<00:07:36.849> helps<00:07:37.269> me<00:07:37.419> to

00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:37.449 
frankly neither really helps me to

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:38.999 
frankly neither really helps me to
figure<00:07:37.689> out<00:07:37.930> what's<00:07:38.139> actually<00:07:38.319> in<00:07:38.619> that<00:07:38.769> but

00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:39.009 
figure out what's actually in that but

00:07:39.009 --> 00:07:41.100 
figure out what's actually in that but
they<00:07:39.459> were<00:07:39.639> very<00:07:39.669> nice<00:07:40.119> but<00:07:40.360> very<00:07:40.599> very<00:07:40.749> salty

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.110
