00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:08.570 

I'm<00:00:06.359> on<00:00:06.599> instance<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.379> today<00:00:07.919> I'm<00:00:08.160> going<00:00:08.460> to

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
I'm on instance and today I'm going to

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.089 
I'm on instance and today I'm going to
show<00:00:08.850> you<00:00:08.910> how<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.360> separate<00:00:10.080> water<00:00:10.769> and

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
show you how to separate water and

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.959 
show you how to separate water and
ethanol<00:00:11.250> using<00:00:12.030> salts<00:00:12.570> so<00:00:13.379> here<00:00:13.770> we<00:00:13.889> have<00:00:14.100> 250

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
ethanol using salts so here we have 250

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.810 
ethanol using salts so here we have 250
milliliters<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.510> water<00:00:16.310> and<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:17.490> with<00:00:17.789> a

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
milliliters of water and this with a

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.300 
milliliters of water and this with a
volumetric<00:00:18.600> flow<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:19.019> is<00:00:19.320> exactly<00:00:19.769> 250

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
volumetric flow so is exactly 250

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.400 
volumetric flow so is exactly 250
milliliters<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.849> water<00:00:21.089> and<00:00:21.269> 250<00:00:21.900> milliliters

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
milliliters of water and 250 milliliters

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.130 
milliliters of water and 250 milliliters
of<00:00:22.439> ethanol<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.669> pour<00:00:24.150> these<00:00:24.300> into<00:00:24.659> our

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
of ethanol so pour these into our

00:00:25.140 --> 00:01:06.170 
of ethanol so pour these into our
graduated<00:00:25.740> cylinder<00:01:01.190> settle<00:01:03.829> and<00:01:04.850> as<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.060> can

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
graduated cylinder settle and as you can

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.480 
graduated cylinder settle and as you can
see<00:01:06.360> we<00:01:06.570> put<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.900> exactly<00:01:07.320> 500<00:01:07.979> milliliters

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
see we put in exactly 500 milliliters

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.990 
see we put in exactly 500 milliliters
and<00:01:08.820> as<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:10.380> two<00:01:10.590> mixed<00:01:11.400> together<00:01:11.520> because

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
and as the two mixed together because

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.490 
and as the two mixed together because
they<00:01:12.120> are<00:01:12.150> completely<00:01:12.480> immiscible<00:01:12.930> liquids

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
they are completely immiscible liquids

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.830 
they are completely immiscible liquids
they<00:01:14.070> will<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:15.060> volume<00:01:15.360> will<00:01:15.510> actually

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
they will the volume will actually

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.590 
they will the volume will actually
decrease<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.680> that's<00:01:17.040> due<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.370> the<00:01:17.610> water<00:01:18.420> and

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
decrease and that's due to the water and

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.530 
decrease and that's due to the water and
ethanol<00:01:18.750> mixing<00:01:19.490> so<00:01:20.490> now<00:01:20.700> what<00:01:21.270> we're<00:01:21.420> going

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
ethanol mixing so now what we're going

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.060 
ethanol mixing so now what we're going
to<00:01:21.600> do<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.840> we're<00:01:21.960> going<00:01:22.050> to<00:01:22.140> take<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.650> little

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
to do is we're going to take a little

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.590 
to do is we're going to take a little
bit<00:01:23.190> of<00:01:23.250> food<00:01:23.460> coming<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.120> you<00:01:24.240> can<00:01:24.330> see

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
bit of food coming just so you can see

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.260 
bit of food coming just so you can see
the<00:01:24.750> separation<00:01:24.930> process<00:01:25.790> occur<00:01:26.790> when<00:01:27.000> we<00:01:27.120> add

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the separation process occur when we add

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.380 
the separation process occur when we add
salt<00:01:27.690> so<00:01:28.050> we<00:01:28.800> have<00:01:29.010> five<00:01:29.250> drops<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.060> food

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
salt so we have five drops of the food

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:44.480 
salt so we have five drops of the food
color

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:56.980 

you

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.010 

as<00:01:57.740> we<00:01:57.920> can<00:01:58.100> see<00:01:58.250> we<00:01:58.430> have<00:01:58.460> a<00:01:59.180> consistent

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
as we can see we have a consistent

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.899 
as we can see we have a consistent
liquid<00:02:00.380> where<00:02:00.650> the<00:02:01.159> food<00:02:01.340> coloring<00:02:01.610> is

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
liquid where the food coloring is

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.899 
liquid where the food coloring is
disposed<00:02:02.690> evenly<00:02:03.110> so<00:02:03.920> now<00:02:04.460> what<00:02:04.640> we're<00:02:04.790> going

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
disposed evenly so now what we're going

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.120 
disposed evenly so now what we're going
to<00:02:04.970> do<00:02:05.150> is<00:02:05.330> we're<00:02:05.450> going<00:02:05.540> to<00:02:05.600> add<00:02:05.750> 15<00:02:06.020> grams<00:02:06.830> of

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
to do is we're going to add 15 grams of

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.160 
to do is we're going to add 15 grams of
potassium<00:02:07.670> carbonate<00:02:08.390> which<00:02:08.840> is<00:02:08.990> just<00:02:09.110> a

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
potassium carbonate which is just a

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:19.479 
potassium carbonate which is just a
simple<00:02:09.410> salt<00:02:09.770> and<00:02:11.200> what<00:02:12.200> this<00:02:13.180> do<00:02:18.489> separate

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
simple salt and what this do separate

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.460 
simple salt and what this do separate
the<00:02:19.700> ethanol<00:02:20.209> and<00:02:20.450> water<00:02:20.540> so<00:02:21.020> first<00:02:21.230> we<00:02:21.350> have

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
the ethanol and water so first we have

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.370 
the ethanol and water so first we have
to<00:02:21.590> shake<00:02:21.830> it<00:02:21.980> up<00:02:22.100> to<00:02:22.130> get<00:02:22.840> tasting<00:02:23.840> carbonate

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
to shake it up to get tasting carbonate

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:42.839 
to shake it up to get tasting carbonate
to<00:02:25.090> mix<00:02:26.090> in<00:02:26.330> with<00:02:26.569> the<00:02:26.810> liquids

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:55.899 

and<00:02:44.019> what<00:02:45.019> you<00:02:45.079> can<00:02:45.200> see<00:02:45.230> what<00:02:45.530> happens<00:02:45.890> so<00:02:54.909> we

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:55.909 
and what you can see what happens so we

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.789 
and what you can see what happens so we
might<00:02:56.150> have<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:56.480> add<00:02:56.629> a<00:02:56.659> little<00:02:57.079> bit<00:02:57.290> more<00:02:57.319> salt

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
might have to add a little bit more salt

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.959 
might have to add a little bit more salt
so<00:03:00.799> again<00:03:01.010> this<00:03:01.129> is<00:03:01.280> just<00:03:01.400> a<00:03:01.579> tasting

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:01.969 
so again this is just a tasting

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:31.530 
so again this is just a tasting
carbonate

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:47.850 

you

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.920 

looks<00:03:48.580> like<00:03:48.760> we<00:03:48.910> may<00:03:49.060> have<00:03:49.090> more<00:03:49.570> potassium

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
looks like we may have more potassium

00:03:49.930 --> 00:04:32.590 
looks like we may have more potassium
carbonate

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.840 

you

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.870 

and<00:04:40.170> now<00:04:41.170> we<00:04:41.230> can<00:04:41.470> see<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:41.980> water<00:04:42.160> starting<00:04:42.730> to

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
and now we can see the water starting to

00:04:42.880 --> 00:05:28.900 
and now we can see the water starting to
separate<00:04:43.300> from<00:04:43.540> the<00:04:43.720> ethanol<00:04:44.020> layer

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.500 

and<00:05:29.570> we<00:05:30.260> should<00:05:30.860> actually<00:05:31.250> be<00:05:31.700> able<00:05:32.090> to<00:05:32.270> add<00:05:32.480> a

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
and we should actually be able to add a

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.420 
and we should actually be able to add a
little<00:05:32.810> bit<00:05:32.990> more<00:05:33.230> salt<00:05:33.850> it<00:05:34.850> should<00:05:35.540> make<00:05:35.780> a

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
little bit more salt it should make a

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:49.180 
little bit more salt it should make a
little<00:05:37.430> bit<00:05:37.730> more<00:05:46.030> water<00:05:47.500> much<00:05:48.500> time<00:05:48.830> can

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
little bit more water much time can

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:59.360 
little bit more water much time can
possibly<00:05:49.670> take<00:05:50.290> the<00:05:51.400> separation

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:14.620 

you

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.060 

occur<00:06:15.630> a<00:06:15.990> little<00:06:16.770> bit<00:06:16.890> faster<00:06:17.340> this<00:06:17.460> time

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
occur a little bit faster this time

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:33.780 
occur a little bit faster this time
so<00:06:20.070> separation<00:06:20.730> starting<00:06:21.060> to<00:06:21.180> happen

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:33.790 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:07:27.720 

you

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:27.730 

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:31.330 

so<00:07:28.730> as<00:07:29.270> you<00:07:29.480> can<00:07:29.600> see<00:07:29.660> we<00:07:30.290> have<00:07:30.800> separation

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:31.340 
so as you can see we have separation

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.800 
so as you can see we have separation
here<00:07:31.640> we<00:07:31.760> have<00:07:31.910> our<00:07:32.030> water<00:07:32.240> layer<00:07:32.510> on<00:07:32.690> the

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:32.810 
here we have our water layer on the

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.990 
here we have our water layer on the
bottom<00:07:33.170> which<00:07:33.350> is<00:07:33.530> clear<00:07:33.890> it<00:07:34.160> does<00:07:34.640> contain

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:35.000 
bottom which is clear it does contain

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.450 
bottom which is clear it does contain
our<00:07:35.300> potassium<00:07:35.840> carbonate<00:07:36.350> and<00:07:36.590> then<00:07:37.130> we<00:07:37.310> have

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:37.460 
our potassium carbonate and then we have

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.820 
our potassium carbonate and then we have
our<00:07:37.640> dye<00:07:37.850> up<00:07:38.300> here<00:07:38.630> with<00:07:38.870> the<00:07:38.990> ethanol<00:07:39.500> so<00:07:39.680> it's

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:39.830 
our dye up here with the ethanol so it's

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.480 
our dye up here with the ethanol so it's
staying<00:07:40.100> in<00:07:40.670> the<00:07:40.820> ethanol<00:07:41.150> air
