00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.859
 I'll show you how to make mistakes with 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.679
 using this obd2 device 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.799
 principle on all machines on most 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.360
 foreign cars vazy also fits well I know 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.369
 Volga does not fit this device 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.560
 slightly different is very convenient because 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.260
 near salon or workshop take off 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.199
 read onboard computer errors there 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.179
 about 500 rubles 600 rubles 700 so 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.430
 This thing in China costs 300 rubles. 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.430
 together the screensaver came to me that is here u 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.649
 us and leave the body to anyone interested buy 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.989
 and once learn will be enjoyed 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.180
 all your life, see what you need 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.070
 do this thing choose a panel here 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.960
 Sima I have a car mentality such 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:52.289
 connector you can't go wrong 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.129
 nothing else out there won't fit you 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.610
 can you do it differently 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:00.149
 saw the light bulbs lit up the code and blackflies 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.520
 panel do not have to shoot what I do 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.760
 Next Next I turn on the ignition for two 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.299
 clicks on my machine so errors 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.900
 considered what we do next we take 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.409
 phone 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:17.159
 my case is such a broken-down lenovo and 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.259
 beauty in china already ordered in 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.490
 In principle, everything will be visible including me 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.229
 bluetooth is here for the first time 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.840
 have to come from the device and go to 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:34.229
 bluetooth settings can be found here 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:39.110
 I have already paired see further we go 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.110
 In the program I will help torque so read 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.920
 here gps we do not connect and this 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:50.659
 I press the yellow button I press 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:54.020
 loupe shala make a connection so 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:59.030
 easily mate setting to walk 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:04.549
 1234 is a standard approach ok so 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:10.729
 now back and again the yellow button again 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:12.760
 stupidly so torque connect now for sure 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.700
 must work stupid everything went 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.829
 Now they will look for mistakes for a very long time. 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.489
 I'll show you the back of my check 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:23.629
 on the panel 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.170
 yellow light now everything should 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:28.190
 disappear 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.500
 let me wait while I tell you what 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.090
 useful it is still a thing very happens 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.410
 different situation and any motorist 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.250
 car lovers need this thing because 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:43.129
 and I carry this sensor chapan with me 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.840
 the law is called as correctly called with 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.400
 a glove compartment and even if a person 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.579
 pop up there on the track 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.590
 may blunt electronics may fuel 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.900
 bad in and for the day and the reasons may be 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.599
 weight is better to connect immediately count 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.980
 remove the error go online through 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.069
 Basically an hour on your mobile can 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:05.569
 go all very cheap go 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:11.540
 look for the error and then shoot 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:13.370
 a mistake and if anything needs repairing 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.590
 we look at the first mistake I found 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.819
 knock sensor 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:22.940
 then I will see what else it is 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:28.510
 however it is u2 sensor high voltage so 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:31.280
 error p01 32 then find it look 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.079
 what is this garbage then I click 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.889
 settings click here reset errors 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:39.950
 you had a button here read the condition 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:42.290
 give all sorts of warnings here 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.799
 error we see 21 percent all now 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.799
 take off 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.099
 same program Turk can 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.739
 use as on-board computer in 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.599
 Basically, you will understand who you need 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:03.630
 I have the chief doctor to base mistakes to learn 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:07.819
 we all see the magazine empty come out 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.819
 apps are different with bluetooth 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.380
 be sure to turn on 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:19.209
 what we do we start the car 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:22.180
 and see that the person shot the bulb is no longer 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:26.340
