00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
okay so here we have the on/off switch

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.490 
okay so here we have the on/off switch
which<00:01:08.380> is<00:01:08.650> lighted<00:01:09.869> I'm<00:01:10.869> gonna<00:01:11.080> say<00:01:11.320> I<00:01:11.350> don't

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
which is lighted I'm gonna say I don't

which is lighted I'm gonna say I don't
like<00:01:12.070> this<00:01:12.400> particular<00:01:12.640> switch<00:01:13.180> just<00:01:13.540> because

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
like this particular switch just because

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.719 
like this particular switch just because
it's<00:01:13.960> not<00:01:14.110> an<00:01:14.200> LED<00:01:14.650> inside<00:01:15.040> it's<00:01:15.220> a<00:01:15.310> light<00:01:15.520> bulb

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
it's not an LED inside it's a light bulb

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.200 
it's not an LED inside it's a light bulb
wrong<00:01:16.630> a<00:01:16.960> little<00:01:17.830> more<00:01:18.040> amperage<00:01:18.369> than<00:01:18.700> an<00:01:18.790> LED

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
wrong a little more amperage than an LED

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.130 
wrong a little more amperage than an LED
would<00:01:19.479> and<00:01:20.049> drawn<00:01:20.409> my<00:01:20.530> batteries<00:01:20.979> this<00:01:21.880> is

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.010 
I so that some test so I'll see like
there's<00:02:04.750> Bank<00:02:05.080> one<00:02:05.320> and<00:02:05.500> two<00:02:05.680> and<00:02:06.630> when<00:02:07.630> I<00:02:07.750> try

there's Bank one and two and when I try

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.419 
there's Bank one and two and when I try
and<00:02:08.050> fire<00:02:08.440> them<00:02:08.649> see<00:02:08.950> ya

nothing happens okay now I switch it to

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.990 
nothing happens okay now I switch it to
arm<00:02:13.620> that's<00:02:14.620> switch<00:02:14.920> sorry<00:02:15.810> now<00:02:17.910> see<00:02:18.910> I'm

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
arm that's switch sorry now see I'm

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.130 
arm that's switch sorry now see I'm
firing<00:02:19.300> two<00:02:19.660> banks<00:02:20.730> simultaneously<00:02:21.730> um<00:02:22.600> I<00:02:22.959> can

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
firing two banks simultaneously um I can

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.930 
firing two banks simultaneously um I can
just<00:02:23.350> turn<00:02:23.500> off<00:02:23.709> bank<00:02:24.040> two<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:24.610> just<00:02:24.640> go

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
just turn off bank two and just go

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.190 
just turn off bank two and just go
through<00:02:25.500> faint<00:02:26.500> one<00:02:27.540> let's<00:02:28.540> see<00:02:28.810> here's<00:02:29.140> a

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
through faint one let's see here's a

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.270 
through faint one let's see here's a
little<00:02:29.440> beasts<00:02:29.530> lat

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
little beasts lat

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.580 
little beasts lat
so<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:32.200> know<00:02:32.320> I<00:02:32.350> can<00:02:32.709> go<00:02:32.890> through<00:02:33.280> each<00:02:34.120> Bank

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
so you know I can go through each Bank

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.490 
so you know I can go through each Bank
sequentially<00:02:35.590> if<00:02:36.250> I<00:02:36.520> want<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:36.970> or<00:02:37.239> I<00:02:37.750> can<00:02:38.260> turn

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
sequentially if I want to or I can turn

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.479 
sequentially if I want to or I can turn
on<00:02:39.060> say<00:02:40.060> like<00:02:40.300> I<00:02:40.540> want<00:02:40.570> to<00:02:40.989> shoot<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.440> front<00:02:41.860> out

on say like I want to shoot a front out

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.420 
on say like I want to shoot a front out
of<00:02:42.550> these<00:02:42.910> two<00:02:43.180> slats<00:02:43.600> at<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.959> 50<00:02:44.800> foot<00:02:45.010> spread

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
of these two slats at a 50 foot spread

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.790 
of these two slats at a 50 foot spread
and<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:45.730> can<00:02:45.970> fire<00:02:46.660> those<00:02:46.870> in<00:02:47.140> parallel<00:02:47.590> you

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
and I can fire those in parallel you

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.990 
and I can fire those in parallel you
know<00:02:48.420> essentially<00:02:49.420> it's<00:02:49.540> just<00:02:49.600> a<00:02:50.550> lot<00:02:51.550> of<00:02:51.580> scab

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
know essentially it's just a lot of scab

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.310 
know essentially it's just a lot of scab
we're<00:02:52.300> really<00:02:52.780> fancy<00:02:53.290> here<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:54.640> turn<00:02:54.880> on<00:02:55.320> two

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
we're really fancy here and turn on two

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.550 
we're really fancy here and turn on two
of<00:02:56.470> these<00:02:56.650> slats<00:02:57.070> and<00:02:57.430> then<00:02:57.640> on<00:02:57.900> fire<00:02:58.900> all

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
of these slats and then on fire all

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.789 
of these slats and then on fire all
three<00:03:00.070> positions<00:03:00.660> simultaneously<00:03:01.660> or<00:03:02.500> you

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
three positions simultaneously or you

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.699 
three positions simultaneously or you
know<00:03:02.920> you<00:03:03.040> could<00:03:03.220> turn<00:03:03.430> off<00:03:03.700> your<00:03:04.709> main

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
know you could turn off your main

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.890 
know you could turn off your main
station<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.459> just<00:03:06.640> have<00:03:06.820> a<00:03:06.850> 50<00:03:07.269> foot<00:03:07.480> spread

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
station and just have a 50 foot spread

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.979 
station and just have a 50 foot spread
and<00:03:08.230> you<00:03:09.010> know<00:03:09.130> fire<00:03:09.430> in<00:03:09.580> parallel<00:03:10.030> you<00:03:10.750> could

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
and you know fire in parallel you could

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.340 
and you know fire in parallel you could
have<00:03:11.430> all<00:03:12.430> these<00:03:12.940> slats<00:03:13.329> on<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:13.780> sides<00:03:14.079> in

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.170 
have all these slats on the sides in
parallel<00:03:14.860> and<00:03:17.130> have<00:03:18.130> even<00:03:18.280> work<00:03:18.579> to<00:03:18.790> use<00:03:18.910> that

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
parallel and have even work to use that

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.970 
parallel and have even work to use that
like<00:03:20.610> turn<00:03:21.610> off<00:03:21.640> just<00:03:22.030> one<00:03:22.269> side<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:23.860> know

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980
