make small cuts as I go along and I'm

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.850 
make small cuts as I go along and I'm
just<00:01:24.240> sort<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.479> always<00:01:24.810> keeping<00:01:24.990> in<00:01:25.259> mind<00:01:25.439> that

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
just sort of always keeping in mind that

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.800 
just sort of always keeping in mind that
one<00:01:26.159> spot<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> collar<00:01:27.240> where<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.570> want<00:01:27.780> to

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
one spot on the collar where I want to

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.890 
one spot on the collar where I want to
stop<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.979> once<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.250> get<00:01:29.369> close<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:30.090> can<00:01:30.689> stop

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
stop and once you get close you can stop

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.359 
stop and once you get close you can stop
because<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.229> don't<00:01:31.500> want<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.799> cut<00:01:31.979> through

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
because you don't want to cut through

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.850 
because you don't want to cut through
that<00:01:33.180> seam<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:34.079> now<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.290> can<00:01:34.409> see<00:01:34.590> what<00:01:34.740> it's

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
that seam so now you can see what it's

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.350 
that seam so now you can see what it's
looking<00:01:35.250> like<00:01:35.280> you've<00:01:35.549> got<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:35.880> piece<00:01:36.090> it's

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
still attached here and that's fine you

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.920 
still attached here and that's fine you
can<00:01:38.400> just<00:01:38.549> leave<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:38.880> now<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.360> go<00:01:39.869> to

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
can just leave that for now and go to

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.300 
can just leave that for now and go to
cut<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> other<00:01:40.320> side<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.950> make<00:01:41.070> sure<00:01:41.220> that

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
cut the other side and make sure that

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.770

under<00:03:36.340> where<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:36.549> sleeves<00:03:36.880> would<00:03:37.060> be<00:03:37.180> on<00:03:37.900> both

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
under where the sleeves would be on both

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.319 
under where the sleeves would be on both
sides<00:03:38.410> and<00:03:38.799> that's<00:03:39.730> what<00:03:39.880> your<00:03:39.970> shirts<00:03:40.150> going

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:41.430 
sides and that's what your shirts going
to<00:03:40.420> end<00:03:40.540> up<00:03:40.600> looking<00:03:40.870> like<00:03:40.900> it's<00:03:41.200> just<00:03:41.319> with

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
to end up looking like it's just with

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.379 
to end up looking like it's just with
this<00:03:41.560> nice<00:03:41.859> ring<00:03:42.190> still<00:03:42.819> attached<00:03:43.090> to<00:03:43.269> the

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
this nice ring still attached to the

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:44.789 
this nice ring still attached to the
collar<00:03:43.540> it's<00:03:43.750> not<00:03:43.900> technically<00:03:44.319> a<00:03:44.410> halter

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
collar it's not technically a halter

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.199 
collar it's not technically a halter
because<00:03:45.069> the<00:03:45.190> back<00:03:45.340> is<00:03:45.370> still<00:03:45.700> intact

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
because the back is still intact

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.030 
because the back is still intact
but<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.139> front<00:03:47.440> will<00:03:47.709> give<00:03:47.829> the<00:03:47.950> illusion

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
but the front will give the illusion

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.319 
but the front will give the illusion
that<00:03:48.340> it's<00:03:48.519> a<00:03:48.579> halter<00:03:48.790> but<00:03:49.000> you'll<00:03:49.120> still
