because<00:01:47.399> we<00:01:47.759> want<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.210> large<00:01:48.659> open<00:01:49.320> area<00:01:49.619> to

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.929 
feel like we have creative freedom and
we<00:01:52.409> didn't<00:01:52.680> get<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.920> with<00:01:53.100> like<00:01:53.280> ravine<00:01:53.670> and

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
we didn't get that with like ravine and

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.120 
we didn't get that with like ravine and
impact<00:01:54.450> which<00:01:54.720> were<00:01:54.930> quite<00:01:55.470> small<00:01:55.920> and

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
impact which were quite small and

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.980 
impact which were quite small and
erosion<00:01:56.670> was<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.969> little<00:01:57.210> bit<00:01:57.329> bigger<00:01:57.509> but<00:01:57.810> it

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
erosion was a little bit bigger but it

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.810 
erosion was a little bit bigger but it
still<00:01:58.320> felt<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:58.619> we<00:01:58.890> were<00:01:59.009> limited<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.640> just

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
still felt like we were limited to just

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.940 
still felt like we were limited to just
the<00:02:00.000> cave<00:02:00.270> when<00:02:00.719> we<00:02:00.899> maybe<00:02:01.320> wanted<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.740> go

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
the cave when we maybe wanted to go

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.380 
the cave when we maybe wanted to go
outside<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.820> map

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
outside of the map

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.780 
outside of the map
from<00:02:03.570> erosion<00:02:03.900> so<00:02:04.650> we<00:02:04.800> still<00:02:05.070> feel<00:02:05.250> limited<00:02:05.670> in

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
from erosion so we still feel limited in

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.900 
from erosion so we still feel limited in
all<00:02:05.970> these<00:02:06.150> maps<00:02:06.390> or<00:02:06.980> unnecessarily<00:02:07.980> small
