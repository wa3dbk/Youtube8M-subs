00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
goals of this exhaust system is to

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.950 
goals of this exhaust system is to
improve<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.460> handling<00:00:20.699> by<00:00:21.390> splitting<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
improve the handling by splitting the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.050 
improve the handling by splitting the
weight<00:00:22.140> evenly<00:00:22.320> right<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.100> left<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.550> moving

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
weight evenly right to left and moving

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.790 
weight evenly right to left and moving
the<00:00:24.150> weight<00:00:24.300> forward<00:00:24.660> on<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.019> machine<00:00:25.380> it

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
the weight forward on the machine it

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.009 
the weight forward on the machine it
helps<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.279> whoopty-doo<00:00:26.609> Zanda<00:00:27.359> turn<00:00:27.869> in

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
helps in the whoopty-doo Zanda turn in

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.320 
helps in the whoopty-doo Zanda turn in
is<00:00:28.170> very<00:00:28.349> good<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.859> also<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:30.029> muffler

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
is very good and also this muffler

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.479 
is very good and also this muffler
system<00:00:30.570> gave<00:00:30.960> us<00:00:31.080> improve<00:00:31.349> flow<00:00:31.710> which<00:00:32.279> gives

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
system gave us improve flow which gives

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.639 
system gave us improve flow which gives
better<00:00:32.759> body<00:00:33.059> manpower<00:00:33.570> on<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:33.960> out<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.590> this

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
better body manpower on this out of this

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.540 
better body manpower on this out of this
bike<00:00:35.120> also<00:00:36.120> for<00:00:36.390> 2006<00:00:37.290> we<00:00:38.040> change<00:00:38.399> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
bike also for 2006 we change the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.330 
bike also for 2006 we change the
cylinder<00:00:39.210> head<00:00:39.239> porting<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.020> camshaft

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
cylinder head porting and a camshaft

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.860 
cylinder head porting and a camshaft
that<00:00:41.340> gave<00:00:41.520> us<00:00:41.550> more<00:00:41.790> power<00:00:42.030> on<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.390> top<00:00:42.629> and

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
that gave us more power on the top and

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.569 
that gave us more power on the top and
in<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.620> middle<00:00:43.860> we<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.160> now<00:00:44.370> have<00:00:44.550> a

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
in the middle we have now have a

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.420 
in the middle we have now have a
40-millimeter<00:00:45.149> carburetor<00:00:45.930> instead<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.800> 37

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
40-millimeter carburetor instead of a 37

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.160 
40-millimeter carburetor instead of a 37
millimeter<00:00:47.760> carburetor<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.809> gave<00:00:49.020> us<00:00:49.140> a

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
millimeter carburetor and that gave us a

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.310 
millimeter carburetor and that gave us a
good<00:00:49.410> punch<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.950> middle<00:00:51.050> for<00:00:52.050> weight

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
good punch in the middle for weight

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.360 
good punch in the middle for weight
savings<00:00:52.860> we<00:00:53.460> put<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.940> shorter<00:00:54.510> forks<00:00:54.870> on

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
savings we put the shorter forks on

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.189 
savings we put the shorter forks on
let's<00:00:56.370> say<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.610> some<00:00:56.879> weight<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.329> then<00:00:57.420> 406

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
let's say to some weight and then 406

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.020 
let's say to some weight and then 406
same<00:00:58.469> as<00:00:58.559> our<00:00:58.680> 450<00:00:59.250> we<00:00:59.670> have<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> new

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
same as our 450 we have the new

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.830 
same as our 450 we have the new
lightweight<00:01:00.270> rear<00:01:00.719> hub<00:01:01.730> also<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:03.239> work<00:01:03.449> with

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
lightweight rear hub also to work with

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.460 
lightweight rear hub also to work with
the<00:01:03.930> new<00:01:04.110> rear<00:01:04.409> end<00:01:04.619> feel<00:01:04.949> we<00:01:05.489> recast<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
the new rear end feel we recast the

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.100 
the new rear end feel we recast the
front<00:01:07.470> steering<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.280> frame<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:09.990> a

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
front steering on the frame so this is a

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.140 
front steering on the frame so this is a
new<00:01:10.260> casting<00:01:10.770> up<00:01:10.920> here<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.490> helps<00:01:11.729> balance<00:01:11.909> out

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
new casting up here it helps balance out

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.499 
new casting up here it helps balance out
the<00:01:12.210> chassis<00:01:12.979> 406<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.400> recap<00:01:14.490> we<00:01:15.299> have<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
the chassis 406 so to recap we have the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.030 
the chassis 406 so to recap we have the
twin<00:01:15.720> exhaust<00:01:16.110> for<00:01:16.560> better<00:01:16.799> weight

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
twin exhaust for better weight

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.249
