try to fix it after the fact what we're
finding<00:03:00.510> now<00:03:00.720> is<00:03:00.989> that<00:03:01.739> it's<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.130> rank<00:03:02.340> and

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
finding now is that it's the rank and

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.580 
finding now is that it's the rank and
file<00:03:02.790> that<00:03:03.180> are<00:03:03.390> most<00:03:03.870> in<00:03:04.080> need<00:03:04.110> because

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
file that are most in need because

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.010 
file that are most in need because
they're<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.190> ones<00:03:05.430> with<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:06.300> sledgehammers

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
they're the ones with the sledgehammers

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.920 
they're the ones with the sledgehammers
and<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.950> drills<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:09.030> tearing<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.690> walls

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
and the drills and tearing the walls

down<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.350> they're<00:03:10.770> they're<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.370> ones<00:03:11.550> who

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
down and they're they're the ones who

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.150 
down and they're they're the ones who
will<00:03:11.940> see<00:03:12.209> what<00:03:12.900> we're<00:03:13.050> concerned<00:03:13.470> about<00:03:13.709> and

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
will see what we're concerned about and

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.370 
will see what we're concerned about and
that<00:03:14.190> is<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.880> fuzzy<00:03:15.060> moldy<00:03:15.660> material<00:03:16.170> that's

that is the fuzzy moldy material that's
the<00:03:16.739> source<00:03:17.040> one<00:03:17.730> of<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.940> things<00:03:18.180> that<00:03:18.360> I

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
the source one of the things that I
