you can see they're contoured to fit

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.580 
you can see they're contoured to fit
very<00:05:53.910> nicely<00:05:54.150> on<00:05:54.420> your<00:05:54.540> body<00:05:54.840> so<00:05:55.260> that<00:05:55.290> you

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
very nicely on your body so that you

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.000 
very nicely on your body so that you
don't<00:05:55.770> have<00:05:55.860> any<00:05:56.240> arm<00:05:57.240> where<00:05:57.810> where<00:05:58.650> it<00:05:58.740> rubs

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
don't have any arm where where it rubs

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.760 
don't have any arm where where it rubs
on<00:06:00.350> like<00:06:01.350> your<00:06:01.530> armpit<00:06:01.830> area<00:06:01.860> your<00:06:02.310> chest<00:06:02.550> area

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
on like your armpit area your chest area

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.720 
on like your armpit area your chest area
and<00:06:04.770> then<00:06:05.040> this<00:06:05.340> I<00:06:05.700> think<00:06:06.570> it's<00:06:06.690> really<00:06:06.840> cool

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 
and then this I think it's really cool

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.920 
and then this I think it's really cool
they<00:06:08.730> have<00:06:08.760> that<00:06:09.000> extra<00:06:09.210> support<00:06:09.510> there

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
they have that extra support there

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.490 
they have that extra support there
across<00:06:10.110> the<00:06:10.350> back<00:06:10.530> so<00:06:11.690> once<00:06:12.690> again<00:06:12.840> your<00:06:13.230> back

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
across the back so once again your back

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.260 
across the back so once again your back
it's<00:06:13.800> going<00:06:13.920> to<00:06:14.010> help<00:06:14.190> support<00:06:14.490> the<00:06:14.790> bag<00:06:14.970> more

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
it's going to help support the bag more

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.010 
it's going to help support the bag more
than<00:06:15.450> your<00:06:15.540> shoulders<00:06:15.960> will<00:06:16.140> so<00:06:18.020> that's

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
than your shoulders will so that's
