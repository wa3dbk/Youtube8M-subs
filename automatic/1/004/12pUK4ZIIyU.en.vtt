00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.839
 is cristian rodríguez and these rodríguez 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.919
 blogs and today I'm from 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:16.919
 The federal district 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.410
 good and today we are going to talk 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.620
 on a very controversial subject that many 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:30.070
 they are going to jump they are going to come 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.720
 the sandy the fanboys and the haters and 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.820
 trolls are going to come to this video and they're going to 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.980
 trolling or maybe not this video will 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.860
 title dragon ball z the battle of the 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.480
 gods sucks and yes because I am 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.460
 saying good so I'm saying 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.430
 because I already saw that movie obviously 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.190
 in Japanese language subtitled and more is 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.190
 say pinche bat I had because you waited to 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.380
 see it folded in Latin Spanish by 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.810
 say something the truth that I always thought 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.790
 this film would not be what 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.579
 everyone expected dragon ball 7 the battle 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.690
 of the gods is a movie 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.700
 overrated and I'm assuring you 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.399
 as we have seen it with other 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.940
 movies but I really do not think that 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:12.040
 It's worth going and spending I do not know 50 pesos 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.690
 60 pesos depending on how much it costs in the 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.850
 cinema where you bought your ticket 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.250
 but I really recommend that the 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.750
 checks on the internet first and if you 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.930
 It convinces good to see it in Spanish 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.230
 Latin or wait 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.420
 candle and tell me wey planet is not 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.970
 cool I liked the movie talk 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.370
 hi for that are the comments so it's 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.680
 that down in the comments leave your 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.300
 opinion about this movie dragonball z 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.790
 the battle of the gods that both 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.180
 we hope because you imagine we wait 10 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.840
 years for them to go back to dragon 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.680
 ball z no gt dragon ball z the battle of 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.660
 the gods 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.390
 so it's unfair to me that you go 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.369
 and you pay I do not know 40 50 or 60 pesos like already 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.380
 I had repeated it to you and better sail in 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.580
 internet the truth the net and why do you 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.229
 I'm recommending that you see it in 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.000
 good internet because I assure you that 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.090
 all the people who have gone to a 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.220
 convention or that is fan boy otaku or what 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.479
 that you want has seen pirate series 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.450
 in fact most people see 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.130
 pirate series or see them on the internet 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.680
 you are going to let me lie, what are you 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.989

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.130
 dragon ball z the beta of the gods without 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.870
 There's nothing wrong with the Internet 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.910

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.120

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.830

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.180
