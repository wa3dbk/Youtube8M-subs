for that environment but from a user
perspective<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.930> really<00:00:37.410> wanna<00:00:37.559> have<00:00:37.649> access

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
perspective I really wanna have access

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.040 
perspective I really wanna have access
to<00:00:38.040> my<00:00:38.129> content<00:00:38.520> no<00:00:38.610> matter<00:00:38.670> where<00:00:39.300> it's<00:00:39.540> you

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
to my content no matter where it's you

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.290 
to my content no matter where it's you
know<00:00:40.170> where<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.680> lives<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.610> from<00:00:42.059> my<00:00:42.149> mobile

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
know where it lives and from my mobile

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.970 
know where it lives and from my mobile
device<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.750> just<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.020> logical<00:00:43.440> extension<00:00:43.739> of

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
device is just a logical extension of

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.450 
device is just a logical extension of
that<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:45.030> we<00:00:45.329> believe<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.050> over<00:00:47.010> time<00:00:47.190> more

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
that so we believe that over time more

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.889 
that so we believe that over time more
and<00:00:47.520> more<00:00:47.700> contents<00:00:48.149> going<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> become

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
and more contents going to become

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.319 
and more contents going to become
available<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> mobile<00:00:50.370> device<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.210> way

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
available to a mobile device and the way

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.240 
available to a mobile device and the way
to<00:00:51.360> do<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.750> most<00:00:51.989> easily<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.559> use<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.039> same

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
to do that most easily is use the same

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.680 
to do that most easily is use the same
technology<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:53.879> they're<00:00:54.210> leveraging<00:00:54.420> on
