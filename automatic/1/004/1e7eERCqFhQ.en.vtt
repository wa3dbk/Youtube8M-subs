00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:09.360
 He is the crowning glory of the A3 series 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.639
 at least until the RS3 comes so long 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.309
 the audi s3 may be the ingolstÃ¤dter 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.500
 Lead the compact class and of course 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.630
 also applies to the new is 3 less 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.410
 weight more power less consumption 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.810
 slimmed down in comparison to his 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.539
 predecessor 60 kilos he lost works 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.480
 now 1395 kilo that's not so much 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.260
 if you consider the power 300 hp 380 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.480
 newton meter 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.980
 there is so few and that he can what 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.550
 you can see that from the outside 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.920
 on overworked aprons with larger ones 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.739
 air intakes wider side skirts 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.379
 a lot of aluminum a roof edge spoiler and 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.899
 the double pipes show that ms three 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.000
 a true athlete is still 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.800
 he does not seem too pretentious and proves 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.809
 especially with the quality in the interior 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.390
 once more that audi just one 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.500
 premium manufacturer is the shows 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.719
 even at the price 38 1900 euro costs the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.080
 s3 at least with the six-speed 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.420
 Double clutch transmission s tronic 40 1800 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.380
 but it will hardly be worth it 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.299
 keep buyer 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.210
 too tempting is the list of 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.790
 special equipment a real athlete 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.650
 the rs3 is also on the street 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.049
 two-liter four-cylinder throws the 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.659
 compact audi straight forward in 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.180
 4.8 seconds is the 100 km h mark 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.610
 just cracked at fleets 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.420
 Curve rides makes the s3 a very 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.610
 good figure 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.979
 which among other things the longer wheelbase 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.270
 the wider track and the new one 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.060
 Progressively steering is due 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.609
 the more direct the steering wheel gets 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.310
 it is a crisp 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:48.340
 gear a tight chassis and the 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:52.689
 light relief four-wheel drive that is 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.429
 real driving pleasure so that the whole force 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.229
 from the s3 also here in the interior 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.240
 is over and above all audible 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.000
 have the people of audi there such a 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.280
 built-in sound actuator reinforced 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.780
 the engine noise here in the cockpit and 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.969
 that is especially nice when you are in 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.069
 dynamic mode drives because of the gears 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.899
 goes really long and then hears 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.150
 you rumle all this beautiful engine 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.470
 that is really nice and therefore the 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.810
 people also have something out there 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.790
 there's still sound in the 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.610
 exhaust system the amplifying sound 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.230
 next to it also outside 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.850
 The people know exactly here now 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.600
 I'll get the street free 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:30.090
 you want to make it rather inconspicuous 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.550
 The s3 can be different when traveling 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.310
 he drives in the comfort setting 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.750
 pleasantly relaxed not too hard and before 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.360
 everything quieter 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.970
 then also the standard consumption of 6 moves 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.400
 9 liters within reach 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.620
 at least until it gets boring 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.800
 and you would rather turn back 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.800
 to hunt
