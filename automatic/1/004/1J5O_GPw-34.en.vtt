 Unlike what's known in the world, a young man came into an open restaurant window. 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:07.580

 Unlike the article that a young man was caught hungry and filled with hunger, 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.489
 Take up to 4 yogurt and watch popular entertainment for a while 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:23.959
