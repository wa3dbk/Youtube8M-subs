00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:13.919
 in letter already have that matter in the most is Bahrain is totally buried is 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:18.739
 are used are taught leadership tools based on the environment 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:20.480
 and in meditation 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.420
 What are these tools is a tool that allows for example that 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.210
 nothing happens to you, we have to start 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.869
 to finish 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.369
 in our lives new habits 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.110
 then eliminated the accused and detained obsolete 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.110
 which are unfortunately rooted in cell phones 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.780
 but treated and holy rose we need to create new 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.280
 so there is a great demand in March to start 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.200
 focusing 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.210
 in every action we do 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.010
 so for example at the time you brush your teeth 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.060
 pay attention to seal 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.610
 do not brush your teeth 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.900
 then pick up the identical attitude on the part of the teeth it follows the color of the paste 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.890
 teeth that one notices is that the student of the toothbrush is more likely to 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.860
 already thinking about the next meeting is just what I was thinking 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.770
 sick 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.320
 separated 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.890
 it is enough for barbosa to wash dishes 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.090
 enough 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.370
 will prepare some meeting prepare the meeting 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.970
 enough 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.370
 forget the past do not think about the future and prepare your present 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.820
 so not only with attention and concentration in every thing that one does 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.170
 as simple as she did it is what is said about the power of now wants 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.990
 from you being 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.800
 is evident in each 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.580
 mouse is playing with the son is there needing to win a son did the 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.740
 defense presents is better not necessary not as long as you 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.570
 is really present there but it is difficult to bring a 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.200
 quantity and quality 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.740
 back to the surface because she is already accustomed to running behind 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.250
 tail like songs from all over the country 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.950
 that frenzy arising from Paris wanted me not to be the best at the crisis 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.340
 better than the other who sees everything for you are the needs of the rego 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.690
 of the ego that needs power that needs control that needs approval 

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:15.509
 our time 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.860
 playing in a simple language like pt has little devil who has a little we 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.209
 we have players because there is shade 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.370
 so we have to increase since April 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.169
 but we have to make it today in all-powerful florence 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:32.610
 and that's what you want 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.580
 were 7h their point of reference from outside and put in their inner power ' 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.740
 He who is his, we can have this conscience. 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.050
 failed for those who never took that first step 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.320
 the minutes resound in an activity but can not concentrate on the day 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.860
 of tomorrow life lesson or in the fight because they posted the night before 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.490
 what do you do 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.820
 in a practical and simple way 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.110
 for you to come back here I am in this moment of the attack I will pay attention 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.420
 It is a matter of a hebe practice 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.229
 when you start checking 

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:10.549
 first this guy 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.589
 according to abc color third time to stay fourth wishing a little bit and so 

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:18.589
 It's going to take you some time to learn a new technique. 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.379
 focusing attention at the present moment is a technique 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.280
 and have to train but if you feel your body sometimes 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.150
 if you already vote 324 body do a deeper investigation 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.900
 bring this pesky tension focus here I forgot the pastor and through the body 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.980
 you can also reach this state of concentration no doubt because 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.739
 how often do not we listen to our own body curious fact with the support 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:46.759
 of people 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:50.239
 we have within us an intelligent who knows what is right and what is wrong 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:54.889
 but there were no final proposals, but instead of leaving the fear and 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:59.069
 servers sometimes in the back and two on the shoulder will be the human carrying 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.129
 too much load 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.759
 I think this is the first tip 

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:04.959
 He wears these guys. 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.069
 in total 8 300 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.239
 You're going to scatter again. It's all good. You do not have to be critical. 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.549
 try trial yesterday hospitalized missing at the present moment you're going to stay one 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.489
 month she is beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful in the second month and goes 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.870
 be easier 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.200
 until you get by 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.349
 memory sided sides 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.120
 then our saw engraved 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.280
 that we have to run of political interest is something that I think of peace 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.160
 is to torture this total in the worst of the last five years in the 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.870
 been in the next 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.540
 so we have to change what I call the philosophy of selling you nothing 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.779
 change habits 

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:47.180
 there are many sides then eliminate 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.180
 those who are old and obsolete who make you ill 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.319
 that make gingivitis patterns of behavior and had the skin react 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:58.279
 aggressively is also a letter could be one of the regions still 

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:01.089
 but so far nothing exactly 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:04.089
 then it is not the time when you will react 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:07.819
 and take a deep breath 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:09.110
 take focus 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.320
 given the importance of the thing 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.960
 enter if you compare with your balance that problem in creating 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.400
 cities, I lost half the importance and their reaction to the fact 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.050
 to be another I always say that suffering notices in fact 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.779
 is in our perception of fla 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:32.549
 so when you're nervous the speed with that fire element 

00:05:32.549 --> 00:05:35.870
 present is done with what awaits them 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.420
 the cheshire josef mobility scut you lose the reason to live 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.809
 now before responding 

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:47.770
 deep breath

 control the breath you control the mind you control the emotions and 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.809
 you win 

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:04.370
 yesterday the situation you become
