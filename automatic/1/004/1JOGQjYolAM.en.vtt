per<00:02:24.320> shallow<00:02:24.620> hooked<00:02:24.920> fish<00:02:25.160> survival<00:02:25.940> is<00:02:26.090> high

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
per shallow hooked fish survival is high

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.140 
per shallow hooked fish survival is high
at<00:02:26.690> around<00:02:26.959> ninety-seven<00:02:27.769> percent<00:02:27.910> while<00:02:28.910> for

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
so when fishing for snapper use hooks

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.100 
so when fishing for snapper use hooks
such<00:02:36.280> as<00:02:36.459> circle<00:02:36.880> hooks<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.510> limit<00:02:37.870> hooks
