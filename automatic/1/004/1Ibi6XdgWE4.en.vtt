00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
the way the league here is going to work

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.969 
the way the league here is going to work

command<00:01:37.679> cup<00:01:37.950> at<00:01:38.069> the<00:01:38.159> end<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.399> the<00:01:38.520> league<00:01:38.729> you

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:39.209 
command cup at the end of the league you

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:41.120 
command cup at the end of the league you
must<00:01:39.539> have<00:01:39.810> enough<00:01:40.169> command<00:01:40.619> points<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:41.039> be

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:44.999 
so we're going to go through the stage

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:46.489 
so we're going to go through the stage
events<00:01:45.209> because<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.049> how<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.259> earn

that as the command cut pro and it's

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:59.170 
that as the command cut pro and it's
really<00:05:57.530> exciting<00:05:57.740> I<00:05:58.250> can't<00:05:58.280> actually<00:05:58.669> wait<00:05:59.000> to

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
really exciting I can't actually wait to

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.209 
really exciting I can't actually wait to
see<00:05:59.449> how<00:05:59.719> an<00:06:00.320> event<00:06:00.560> like<00:06:00.680> that<00:06:00.740> would<00:06:01.009> be<00:06:01.130> to

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:01.219 
see how an event like that would be to

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:02.980 
see how an event like that would be to
turn<00:06:01.430> out<00:06:01.729> because<00:06:02.330> it's<00:06:02.479> never<00:06:02.659> been<00:06:02.930> before

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
turn out because it's never been before

excessive<00:06:06.289> is<00:06:06.469> never<00:06:06.770> been<00:06:06.949> attempted<00:06:07.190> as

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
excessive is never been attempted as

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.499 
excessive is never been attempted as
well<00:06:07.639> and<00:06:07.759> I<00:06:07.789> think<00:06:07.820> it'll<00:06:08.120> be<00:06:08.150> really<00:06:08.240> good

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:08.509 
well and I think it'll be really good
