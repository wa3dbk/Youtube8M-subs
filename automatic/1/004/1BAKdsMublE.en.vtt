 the corridors among the bio organics on the wall we 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.960
 find the panel now activated by this 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.960
 panels we opened the door closed earlier and 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.820
 Behind her the first thing eyes rush once

 Alien painted eggs are real 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.920
 Easter eggs are also next to the eggs 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.350

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.980
 walk down the hall 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.200
 our motion sensor will notice something in 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.590
 the cafeteria in fact it will turn out to be a piece 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.110
 blanket spinning ventilation and who knows 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.299
 maybe this piece of blanket belongs 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:17.099
 exactly newt how she always hid 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:19.049
 exactly ventilation walking along the colony in 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.569
 one of the corridors we will find two robots 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.579
 in one hour there will be 10 and in the chuck 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.290
 the second 0 the same robots were 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.599
 special edition of the film 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.579
 who stopped the attack of strangers 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:34.470
 only when one job remained 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:35.430
 ten patron and in the second 0 wandering around 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.500
 sewage system 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.829
 we will have to start the pump for 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.329
 distracting xenomorphs and so on 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.329
 him and go until we noticed 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.880
 we turn right and notice the head 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.000
 dolls lying on barrels 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.870
 this is the head of a casey doll toy which 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.910
 could not take from her asylum 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.520
 also for the found head we will get 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.459
 Achievement mostly they come at night 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.130
 almost the same phrase said newt in 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:25.210
 the original film will soon be dark 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.100
 come night always chapter 7 when we 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.110
 we will walk through the laboratory of Voland 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.020
 you can find a sealed capsule 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.970
 deterrence but instead of someone else it will 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.060
 lay a little straw hat and 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.520
 the cane is a reference to the film parody 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.070
 space eggs in which they said goodbye 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.560

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:55.570
 hila may baby in the same chapter before 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.390
 the entrance to the lab on one of the rocks 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:02.190
 there is a box with donuts we shoot at 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.190
 her and look forward to the road 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:14.900
 a huge donut will roll straight towards us 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.900
 which will fall into the lava and explode 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:28.720
 walking the alien ship we will find 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.720
 engineer sitting behind a huge gun 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.130
 if you shoot him in the head a little 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.110

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.450

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.130
 some other flying object 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:05.219

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:07.439
 This is a reference to saying that cats t.yu. 

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:12.409
 but the second ship is not very strong 

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:15.089
 similar to take it so hard to say 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:15.719
 The last Easter egg is in the plot 

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:18.449
