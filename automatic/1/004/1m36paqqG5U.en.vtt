00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.940
 more good james frey a little video of 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.980
 a little trick that I've done myself 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.320
 late with friends in the mode 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.260
 online gta also known as gt 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.760
 online well I have to tell you that I 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.369
 would have liked to upload more videos of 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.720
 this game but it's the most 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.090
 you will already know that the online mode 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.520
 of gta came out yesterday about 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.500
 the 11 hour Spanish and is giving 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.119
 enough problems what are these 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.520
 problems because basically not 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.169
 allow you to connect to online mode not 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.120
 you can play you keep loading the 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.039
 game and good people are leaving 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.109
 very much but we have to understand and 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:39.999
 you have to understand that there are many 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:42.069
 people who are trying to connect 

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:44.710
 hit the game and the servers are 

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:46.420
 supersaturated according from rockstar 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.829
 they have been said on twitter and in several 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.870
 pages that are trying 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.659
 solve it as soon as possible are 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.459
 trying to work against the clock to 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.289
 try to solve this problem what 

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:57.609
 before they can agree and 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.619
 well this little video was created 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:01.179
 it seemed like an entertaining short race 

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:03.940
 It is already in step to explain you a 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:05.830
 little the ideas that I have now in 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.360
 go ahead to upload online gta 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.460
 to start calm that the series of 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.110
 7 to the story mode I'll continue 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.900
 going up as now from Monday to Friday 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.030
 in chapters of about 20 minutes of 20 a 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.740
 Approximate 30 minutes according as 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.290
 you always have the schedules in the 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.150
 information of the videos and well I have 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.430
 you thought about making several videos 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.290
 miniseries with online gta since what 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.180
 been trying a little bit I've seen that 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.950
 they have so many possibilities for 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.500
 make videos of humor in plan with the 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.910
 friends and all this in fact right now 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.980
 possibly when you are seen and 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.570
 Watching this video forgiveness and would 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.630
 working trying not to record any 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.520
 little thing for tomorrow and tomorrow is Thursday 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.080
 bring some video of agreement for 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.330
 entertain you already know that that's what 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.670
 that I love I like to make videos in 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.350
 plan humor so you have fun 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.729
 he has also thought one thing that I already 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.260
 you will say that you think of them 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.510
 comments that is to do as a 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.760
 small miniseries that possibly makes 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.860
 and upload exclusively to my facebook 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.810
 channel to try so give it a 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.580
 little bit of promotion since they are few 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.140
 about 80 people who follow me in 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.240
 said facebook and I think if I did 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.700
 this series and just upload it on facebook 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.430
 would possibly attract more public from 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.099
 according to this series would be a miniseries 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.260
 in a few minutes of few minutes that 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.730
 would go up once a week or two in the 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.159
 that there were little parodies of movies 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.349
 and of series and when uploading it only to 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:25.030
 facebook and not the channel would give me the 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.950
 possibility to play music 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.829
 little things with copyright without fear that my 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.079
 channel suffer the consequences you will see 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.310
 in the comments what do you think and good 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.780
 let's talk a little about this race 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.010
 that has been quite fun I have 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.200
 to tell you that I'm playing with friends 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.209
 and I think that even a guiri did not get 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.430
 I'm sure in a circuit that 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.980
 possibly this zone sounds to you since 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.579
 I have mentioned several times several 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.019
 times sorry in the series is this area of 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.090
 watering that there is in the angels that both 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.310
 I like it and that you try movies 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.530
 left after a race to three 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.120
 turns if I'm not wrong and has been 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.590
 pretty funny because if you are 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.989
 watching the video there have been quite a few 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.489
 Cakes enough wafers will go and I hope 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.260
 that you liked the video guys here 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.049
 I got the goal the quick draw in 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.040
 first position as not that if already 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.290
 you have seen that I have stuck a lot 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.819
 short jazz with my colleagues and good 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.319
 I hope you liked the video and I 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.909
 I promise that during this next week 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.220
 let's hope it starts to improve the 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:20.650
 online and can upload the many 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.820
 videos the truth is that it is very cool and 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.620
 you know if you have any question 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.630
 As always, any doubt 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.040

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.600

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.310
 functions just tell you a little something 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.410
 According to have a little patience 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.390

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.950
