where<00:00:14.099> do<00:00:14.190> you<00:00:14.250> go<00:00:14.429> from<00:00:14.580> there<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:14.880> how<00:00:15.420> can

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
where do you go from there and how can

you should be able to do it after a bit
of<00:00:40.079> practice<00:00:40.199> from<00:00:41.160> there<00:00:41.429> as<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.910> become

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:42.179 
of practice from there as you become

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:44.450 
of practice from there as you become
more<00:00:42.239> familiar<00:00:42.480> with<00:00:43.170> both<00:00:43.350> head<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:44.280> should

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
more familiar with both head you should

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.520 
more familiar with both head you should
gradually<00:00:44.879> raise<00:00:45.329> your<00:00:45.690> turns<00:00:45.929> per<00:00:46.140> second

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530

during<00:00:48.660> your<00:00:48.870> solves<00:00:49.320> some<00:00:49.890> people<00:00:50.190> even<00:00:50.489> set

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
during your solves some people even set

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.639 
during your solves some people even set
up<00:00:50.699> a<00:00:50.850> metronome<00:00:51.269> while<00:00:51.660> solving<00:00:52.019> which<00:00:52.440> can

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
up a metronome while solving which can

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.189 
up a metronome while solving which can
help<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.980> keep<00:00:53.249> a<00:00:53.489> steady<00:00:53.789> turn<00:00:54.210> rate<00:00:54.480> then<00:00:54.899> as

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
help you keep a steady turn rate then as

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.810 
help you keep a steady turn rate then as
you<00:00:55.440> improve<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.920> flick<00:00:56.190> head<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.640> can

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
you improve the flick head you can

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.610 
you improve the flick head you can
simply<00:00:57.179> raise<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.570> tempo<00:00:57.929> on<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.260> metronome

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
simply raise the tempo on the metronome

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.770 
simply raise the tempo on the metronome
this<00:00:59.190> may<00:00:59.370> not<00:00:59.519> be<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.789> best<00:00:59.969> method<00:01:00.179> for<00:01:00.390> some

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
this may not be the best method for some

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.479 
this may not be the best method for some
people<00:01:01.109> but<00:01:01.350> it's<00:01:01.589> still<00:01:01.769> a<00:01:01.829> pretty<00:01:02.249> good<00:01:02.370> way

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
people but it's still a pretty good way

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.549 
people but it's still a pretty good way
to<00:01:02.550> familiarize<00:01:03.149> yourself<00:01:03.870> with<00:01:03.929> look<00:01:04.320> head

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
to familiarize yourself with look head

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.520 
to familiarize yourself with look head
especially<00:01:05.129> as<00:01:05.579> a<00:01:05.850> beginner<00:01:06.200> moving<00:01:07.200> on<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
especially as a beginner moving on the

especially as a beginner moving on the
second<00:01:07.890> method<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.399> also<00:01:08.640> pretty

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
second method is also pretty

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.270 
second method is also pretty

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
different method make sure let me know
