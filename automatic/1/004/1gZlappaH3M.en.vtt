00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.489
 particular video so we're on far 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.320

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.270
 moment but I'm not there at all 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.190
 to talk to you about that even if you 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.649
 during this time you can appreciate 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.660
 the beauty of this game is 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.860
 I'm coming today for you 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.690
 talk about two things next 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.789
 firstly for one for an absence 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.430
 which I will speak to you after during the 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:12.180
 next week and secondly for 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.060
 talk about a famous christmas contest diablo 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.080
 x9 goes into Santa Claus mode I play at 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.270
 Santa Claus this year 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.940
 then the contest is for 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.119
 technically you'll tell me a 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.860
 little to everyone even if the target of 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.649
 this contest the targets of his competition 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.700
 are rather the people who may have 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:35.250
 not lucky to be able to receive Christmas 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.410
 the gift they want to say everything 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.789
 just people who can not get 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.310
 allow all do not have the chance to 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.110
 can have a nice Christmas gaming and 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.720
 have the chance to have 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.480
 one or more pretty gifts and 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.100
 that's why we'll try I'll 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.800
 ask yourself even if many are not going to 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.600
 not do it to participate only if 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.490
 you just do not really have this 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.050
 chance to have the nice gifts where you 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.510
 you wait to see under the tree 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.030
 the contest is aimed specifically 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.360
 to these people here then honestly 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.979
 you do what you want but it's 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.869
 true that at the base it is rather addressed 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.090
 to this type of person to be able to 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.170
 offer to those who have a little less 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.740
 of luck a pretty christmas 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.700
 so here I come to things a little 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.850
 more interesting 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.250
 there are a lot of prizes to win and 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.420
 that is to say I associated myself with 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.270
 three big brands 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.270
 we have game auniac on avermedia and we have 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.070

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.090

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.650
 of the sum but it's absolutely
