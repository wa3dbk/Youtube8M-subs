 story is exclusive to playstation 3 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.210
 basically, I said that I was going to 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.019
 make a video about the locks in in 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.210

 Premium tickets characters and such and such 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.759
 basically the characters that we have 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:30.419
 to unlock are brian leo to liza 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:32.369

 have left none and good basically 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.780
 good the characters are unlocked to 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.309
 the following premium points and the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.379
 points weeks points first points 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.679
 gift and that same gift point of what 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.070
 so much for playing in the arcade to play 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:49.559
 also matched games we are going to play 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.300
 in almost everything but good basically the 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.850
 first player who give it to the 1,000 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.810
 points gifts the second player will 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.610
 give seven thousand gift points 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.880
 with 10,000 gift points you get 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.380
 100,000 is money basically at 20 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.780
 thousand gift points give you 100 thousand 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.390
 genes again at 30,000 they give you the 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.460
 third character unlockable at 40 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.640
 100,000 thousand are again the ga 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.890
 50,000 points gift will give you 100k 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.650
 again at the 60,000 points gifts you 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.410
 they give the fourth player to 70,000 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.510
 gift points give you 100 thousand g at 80 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:27.260
 thousand gift points give you 100 thousand seven 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.660
 also already 90 thousand give you the fifth 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.690
 fifth player unlockable then to the 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.119
 120 thousand gift points give you the sixth 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.880
 player and I guess it will be every 100 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.470
 every 30 thousand or 150,000 you are going to 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.640
 give another but well basically there's only 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.540
 6 with which because you're not going to 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.560
 unlock another unless they take out more 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.740
 fighters and then they achieve 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.869
 directly but it would reach 150,000 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.210
 Gift points will be very difficult 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.439
 you have to be all day 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.810
 basically the tickets are first 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.939
 you can get if you win five times 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.609
 online the first time and then you have 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.490
 online then 20 times online and then 30 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:09.239
 times online 50 times online well sometimes 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.250
 online 200 300 400 and then I already think that 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.360
 is every 100 we go it has not reached me 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.120
 500 still but because it will be something every 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.400
 100 in victory because they will give you a ticket 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.349
 prizes then also by game to 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.599
 arcade also if they play the first time 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.700
 I think they give you a premium ticket and 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.560
 then ten times to the arcade they give you another 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.560
 premium ticket 30 times playing 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.480
 mayor have another 50 we also have 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.640
 another premium ticket to the hundreds in 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.069
 another premium ticket and then I do not know what 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.599
 more I do not know how much will arrive so that 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:45.239
 we have another premium and good ticket 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.370
 it seems that there are points for five if 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.500
 you use an experiment during this week 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.609
 I think it ends today and I have 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.530
 tried 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:55.720
 make the most of 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.060
 I believe that I will not be able anymore, I will not 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.880
 there are awards labels for the style 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.310
 I do not know if they buy more coins but I think 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.940
 that is five euros for thirty coins 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.069
 so premium comes out to be quite profitable 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.260
 and if you do not usually lose but usually 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.720
 lose we go is the best wasted the 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.910
 I am the money that buys 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.220
 30 coins and cursed a lot 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.850
 very much very much very much and the 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.870
 I'm really happy with it 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.480
 good the other day of advice on how 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.280
 how to stop certain attacks with that 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.239
 today the law supports you the characters that 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.970
 more problems you usually give to people and 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.200
 the truth as I say it is so difficult 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.790
 in this game for example those that 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.769
 you can move that that's a little bit of 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.500
 distance and know when you're going to do that 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.450
 fucking shit and when you see what he's going to do 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.520
 that is because it is already 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.070
 especially when you are on the ground 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.500
 what the other fighter will do 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.470
 that I have never said what he will do 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.290
 another fighter always or almost always 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:03.110
 we arrive 60 and 70 times if not 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.990
 you have a lot of level is stuck down 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.090
 most likely so good to get up 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.250
 already ducking because he will tell if he 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.810
 backwards is when it is covered without 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.880
 But you can also do 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.130
 a counterattack that basically if you 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.410
 you know that they kill you down below and you give 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.400
 in the opposite direction as you defend yourself 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:26.010
 crouching thiago down and back to the 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.330
 once down and forward at the same time and you throw the 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.870
 leg towards the ground for making a 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.580
 Counterattack of several blows is a 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.430
 thing that does not exist difficult to 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.740
 doing is not the last things so 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.180
 you can master the tec in the part of 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.270
 get rid of those in the recitals 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.310
 that is also something difficult 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.139
 release all the holds basically if 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.240
 they are grabbing you with the square more 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.760
 plus the X you can free yourself with the 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.800
 square is worth of pulses squared if 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.590
 is grabbing you with the triangle and the 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.840
 circle of liberates with the triangle all 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.520
 it depends on fixing with what hand you 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.889
 grab or if you grab with the left or 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.270
 with the right that you already have it well to 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.070
 you in practical mode like what 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.979
 put and things like that practice practice 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.930
 that then if it's a special grip it's 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.900
 with the square the triangle at the same time what 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:16.650
 you can release but as I say I do not 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:19.560
 nor does it sometimes cost me a lot 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:22.580
 I can not I can not I do not have so many 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.889
 reflexes that is already playing every day 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.259
 really just play this game and already 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:31.650
 Well, I appreciate it because the good 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:36.780
 with which it is very difficult 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:39.600
 to learn the things that we carry that 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.729
 you can do correctly 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.889
 the only things that do not sting do not dominate 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:47.070
 in fact when I started to grab me 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:50.070
 they embitter life the truth and I as you see 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:52.760
 only win very very very little very little 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.590
 little by little sometimes 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.720
 that's why it's basically my 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.810
 weakness and I do not want to want to use it either 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.150
 so normally when the other 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.370
 cursor starts hitting you below or 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.380
 things like that his weakness will always be 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.260
 from below they always show their 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.090
 weaknesses doing what they 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.220
 jode not thinking that others and them 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.930
 they can catch the same thing with which good 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.140
 it's better not to grab just in case it's going to 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:21.220
 think that they do not get rid of the 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.690
 grip is not basically a game of 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.930
 I believe that games in a game of 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.480
 mentality you do not have to if you have to 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.450
 show 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:35.050
 things that you would not do and do them in 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:36.190
 work either with a shooter or a game 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.450
 of fights over a whole fight game 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.540
 that are one against one that always 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:43.110
 you have to try to change the 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.700
 way of watching play look and grasp 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.970
 youngsters are what I grasp base in all the 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.970
 departure 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:54.919
 and nothing else we go in the next video 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:54.919
 until next time
