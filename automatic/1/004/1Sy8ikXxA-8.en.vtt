get Rafa to a 92 as well you can do this

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.440 
get Rafa to a 92 as well you can do this
with<00:00:31.830> every<00:00:32.160> single<00:00:32.189> player<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.940> I've<00:00:33.120> done

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
with every single player and I've done

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.479 
with every single player and I've done
this<00:00:33.630> with<00:00:33.870> Rafa<00:00:34.290> because<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:34.890> thought<00:00:35.250> he

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
this with Rafa because I thought he

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.030 
this with Rafa because I thought he
might<00:00:35.730> not<00:00:35.969> get<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.540> far<00:00:36.899> but<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.440> did<00:00:37.890> not

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
might not get that far but I did not

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.720 
might not get that far but I did not
expect<00:00:38.100> him<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.730> get<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> 92<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.399> think

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
expect him to get to a 92 so I think

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.270 
expect him to get to a 92 so I think
there<00:00:42.420> won't<00:00:42.780> be<00:00:42.899> too<00:00:43.320> much<00:00:43.500> difference<00:00:44.070> if

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
there won't be too much difference if

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.430 
there won't be too much difference if
you<00:00:44.430> grow<00:00:44.700> him<00:00:44.969> normally<00:00:45.870> he<00:00:46.110> will<00:00:46.260> get

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
you grow him normally he will get

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.610 
you grow him normally he will get
probably<00:00:46.890> up<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.370> an<00:00:47.489> 86<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.079> not<00:00:49.289> too

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
probably up to an 86 and that is not too

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.189 
probably up to an 86 and that is not too
much<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.190> difference<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.789> 92<00:00:51.390> trust<00:00:51.809> me<00:00:52.020> I

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
much of a difference to 92 trust me I

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.340 
much of a difference to 92 trust me I
have<00:00:52.530> played<00:00:52.829> him<00:00:53.010> when<00:00:53.250> he<00:00:53.340> was<00:00:53.520> around<00:00:53.910> 86<00:00:54.719> 87

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
pan there was no big difference it is

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.740 
pan there was no big difference it is
just<00:00:58.590> like<00:00:58.859> with<00:00:59.219> if<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.820> have<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.149> barbell<00:01:00.600> up

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
fashion and those crosses I would say

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.420 
fashion and those crosses I would say
50%<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.509> time<00:02:00.840> turned<00:02:01.320> into<00:02:01.530> goals<00:02:02.009> and

50% of the time turned into goals and
his<00:02:02.610> skilling<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.360> really<00:02:03.840> amazing<00:02:04.380> just

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
his skilling is really amazing just

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.969 
his skilling is really amazing just

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
because of his smallness he is really

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.729 
because of his smallness he is really
able<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.610> dribble<00:02:08.910> around<00:02:09.090> defenders<00:02:09.929> just<00:02:10.530> by

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
able to dribble around defenders just by

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.080
