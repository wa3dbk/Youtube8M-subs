00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
out here to see how it works now try to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.590 
out here to see how it works now try to
put<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.350> one<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.850> earlier<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.239> did<00:00:48.420> have

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
put this one on earlier and I did have

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.420 
put this one on earlier and I did have
some<00:00:48.719> difficulties<00:00:49.230> with<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:49.739> hopefully

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
some difficulties with it so hopefully

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.229 
some difficulties with it so hopefully
it<00:00:50.820> will<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.239> going<00:00:52.020> easier<00:00:52.320> now<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:52.969> you<00:00:53.969> start

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.290 
it will be going easier now so you start
off<00:00:54.300> course<00:00:54.840> well<00:00:55.379> with<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.039> silicon<00:00:56.579> layer

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.790 

and<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.420> course<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.870> want<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.199> do<00:01:01.289> an<00:01:01.410> honest

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
and of course I want to do an honest

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.750 
and of course I want to do an honest
review<00:01:02.010> here<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.760> them<00:01:03.739> um<00:01:04.739> what<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.369> think

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
review here of them um what I think

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.289 
review here of them um what I think
about<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.510> okay<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.159> first<00:01:08.159> piece<00:01:08.430> on<00:01:08.640> not

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
about this okay so first piece on not

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.340 
about this okay so first piece on not
super<00:01:10.260> at<00:01:10.320> most<00:01:10.700> so<00:01:11.700> let's<00:01:12.330> see<00:01:12.630> here<00:01:12.960> if<00:01:13.170> we

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
super at most so let's see here if we

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.960 
super at most so let's see here if we
can<00:01:13.530> put<00:01:13.710> on<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:15.140> outer<00:01:16.140> layer

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
can put on so this is the outer layer

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.429 
can put on so this is the outer layer
which<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.090> harder<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:20.360> mean<00:01:21.360> like<00:01:21.600> or<00:01:21.930> like<00:01:22.200> pull

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
which is harder I mean like or like pull

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.640 
which is harder I mean like or like pull
the<00:01:22.530> cover<00:01:22.740> on<00:01:22.860> something<00:01:24.049> so<00:01:25.049> let's<00:01:25.470> try<00:01:25.590> to

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
the cover on something so let's try to

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.330 
the cover on something so let's try to
put<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:28.340> let's<00:01:29.340> go<00:01:29.490> saying<00:01:29.790> slip<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.570> case

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
put it in let's go saying slip in case

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.789 
put it in let's go saying slip in case
see<00:01:32.340> here<00:01:33.079> start<00:01:34.079> off<00:01:34.200> from<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.520> bottom<00:01:35.939> and

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
see here start off from the bottom and

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.700 
see here start off from the bottom and
then<00:01:37.799> let's<00:01:38.040> see<00:01:38.220> here<00:01:38.960> now<00:01:39.960> I'm<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.409> emen

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
then let's see here now I'm the emen

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.090 
then let's see here now I'm the emen
usually<00:01:41.100> never<00:01:41.280> good<00:01:41.610> at<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:43.009> putting<00:01:44.009> on

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
usually never good at and putting on

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.179 
usually never good at and putting on
like<00:01:44.280> screen<00:01:44.549> flickers<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.329> also<00:01:45.899> not<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.350> I

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
like screen flickers and also not and I

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.270 
like screen flickers and also not and I
can<00:01:47.579> really<00:01:47.759> have<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.939> hard<00:01:48.090> time<00:01:48.360> with<00:01:48.659> these

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
can really have a hard time with these

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.410 
can really have a hard time with these
cases<00:01:50.280> where<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.549> have<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.850> push<00:01:51.119> something

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
cases where you have to push something

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.109 
cases where you have to push something
in<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.170> can<00:01:52.530> even<00:01:52.680> feel<00:01:53.040> some<00:01:53.340> friction<00:01:53.939> or

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
in so I can even feel some friction or

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.330 
in so I can even feel some friction or
something<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:55.200> have<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.380> push<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.770> live

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
something that you have to push it live

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.020 
something that you have to push it live
it<00:01:56.460> hard<00:01:56.700> let's<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.689> here<00:01:58.259> if<00:01:59.070> we<00:01:59.189> can<00:01:59.369> proper

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
it hard let's see here if we can proper

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.639 
it hard let's see here if we can proper
line<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:01.100> okay<00:02:02.100> push<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.549> little<00:02:02.670> bit<00:02:02.909> harder

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
line it okay push a little bit harder

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.979 
line it okay push a little bit harder
push<00:02:04.649> at<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:04.979> top<00:02:06.140> okay<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:07.200> far<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:07.680> good<00:02:08.129> I

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
push at the top okay so far so good I

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.520 
push at the top okay so far so good I
think

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.710 

okay<00:02:15.530> let's<00:02:15.890> see<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.610> this<00:02:17.360> could<00:02:17.540> be<00:02:17.690> very

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
okay let's see and this could be very

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.530 
okay let's see and this could be very
annoying<00:02:18.230> with<00:02:18.500> these<00:02:18.710> kinds<00:02:18.980> of<00:02:19.040> cases<00:02:19.540> where

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
annoying with these kinds of cases where

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:28.180 
annoying with these kinds of cases where
you<00:02:20.570> have<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.810> slip<00:02:21.140> in<00:02:21.410> things<00:02:21.800> I<00:02:26.830> mean<00:02:27.830> just

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190

think that will do so soft buttons the

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.720 
think that will do so soft buttons the
other<00:03:19.459> side<00:03:20.470> overall<00:03:21.470> course<00:03:21.860> this<00:03:22.160> will

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.390 
other side overall course this will
protect<00:03:23.030> your<00:03:23.330> device<00:03:23.480> a<00:03:23.989> lot<00:03:24.590> from<00:03:25.190> the

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
outside but this doesn't look good that

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.030
