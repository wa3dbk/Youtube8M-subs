00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.430
 hello viewers today with a video 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:09.860
 motorcycle review kayo 125 now i'm 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:15.770
 made a little blego tag so they could 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:21.590
 see his appearance such a motorcycle 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:25.880
 the field beckons incomprehensibly that means 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:31.880
 what are we looking for in front of us fork 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:38.390
 inverted type 17 drive cross 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:40.670
 wanting tires like this but disc 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.890
 brakes spirit spirit piston brake 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:49.180
 caliper reinforced shiry 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:54.219
 reinforced hoses further 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:58.070
 behind us is a pendulum worth 17 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:01.520
 14 wheel is also on the same evil 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:09.799
 worn out rubber that's adjustable 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:12.289
 stiffness shock absorber here we are alone 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.939
 piston brake caliper is the same 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:20.090
 disc brake is also reinforced 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:26.619
 reinforced hoses are engine 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.619
 here 125 cubes on the cylinder from type 124 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.900
 that means 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.130
 the motor is quite heavy in the box 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.960
 4-speed 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.310
 neutral and everything rises up leg 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.979
 then folding it when it does not fall 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.229
 break off here is the usual carburetor without 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.180
 caption japan 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:51.320
 here is some kind of chinese flap 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.530
 mechanical air filter worth 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.250
 nulevik 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:00.840
 or as simply put 0 filterability 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:02.789
 eat but no use until I know 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.489
 how much I almost never know how 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:11.280
 pakka dries me during the day and what are you called me 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:15.390
 gobble up the steering wheel 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.630
 wide grip here we have a step forward 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.380
 brakes tank for tormozuhu handle gas 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.560
 then soft stuff so you can 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.209
 head off not fight so hard on the bumps 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.250
 here we have a clutch lever button 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:34.260
 start-stop 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.090
 Yes, and everything is basically here at least 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.730
 electricians 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:44.120
 generally at least straight very least not here 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.280
 then there is nothing electric starter 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.590
 he starts up with legs to dissolve him not 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.730
 I can then how she just hangs out here and 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.570
 hours the bike is not running 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.730
 although he is only two months here means well, 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.000
 the sound he has to say is enough 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:07.940
 loud such a straight bass players but although if 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.070
 take into account that he has mufflers in it 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.880
 there is nothing besides this mesh 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.350
 the tube is clear why not such a sound 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.190
 principle motor goes quite well but 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.600
 I had a ttr irbis ttr 125 he goes 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.600
 well I did not think that it was something from him 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.150
 different of course yes to him to him 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.530
 phaser away 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:33.600
 Here he goes on all the same too 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:35.850
 Well, that's rubber, but just together 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.920
 shit for the city for asphalt especially 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.120
 for wet asphalt on not intended 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.769
 throwing him and just scared to ride 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:49.159
 type nifiga does not protect against dirt 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:52.379
 purely so for decoration here 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:55.140
 such a motorcycle costs about 40 thousand 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:58.650
 rubles and basically my personal opinion 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.079
 what's a motorcycle to take is pure 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.319
 go learn and just by 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:06.569
 kill him even a killer on him 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.989
 the truth is possible because if dramatically 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:14.519
 gazanut then he rides on the back wheel without 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:16.680
 you have so many varieties on 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.699
 air donkey cooling is simple 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:25.169
 air cooling of 140 cubes we everyones 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:30.060
 that means what else to tell what else 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:32.190
 tell the show so well they say that 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.380
 these types of diseases such as chain on at 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.780
 all attacks there right 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.880
 but also in principle it is not bad 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.610
 stretched and why is the pit bike strongly 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.419
 taut chain because it is very 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:49.710
 strongly spring 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:53.039
 by the way I will show the course of the fork one way or better. 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:57.930
 show you how i look at him with 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:05:00.560
 my height is eighty so now 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.560
 now 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:18.320
 so well about something like that now here it is 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.320
 I 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.910
 here is a moped 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.230
 here is hot wheels 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:58.610
 very much a chur not me who we really 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:06:00.700
 soft here i'm like dimensional sit omon 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.700
 omon 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:18.479
 very light very light and therefore 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:21.629
 so easy to drive but motor 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:24.009
 motor easy to pull it 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:26.020
 I say my not motorcycle principle 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:28.389
 good for the money and pray find 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:35.099
 grandmother thousand up to 25 will be 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:38.860
 chic i think thats but something-something-something 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:40.149
 so I would replace it would replace not 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.300
 you know we are dear you use i 

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:45.580
 personally on shit and on forests little ride and 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.879
 more around the city and for the city i would 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:51.909
 would make him rubber put his throat 

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:55.569
 slightly you almost city would do with 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:57.459
 his motor yes that's all right 

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:58.990
 I like everything but maybe what else 

00:06:57.459 --> 00:07:03.519
 electrician is missing but this is not a problem 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:05.769
 I can do what I think about it all 

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:08.080
