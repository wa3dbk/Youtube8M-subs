models<00:01:16.979> with<00:01:17.369> two<00:01:17.700> four<00:01:18.270> or<00:01:18.479> six<00:01:19.039> terabytes<00:01:20.039> of

models with two four or six terabytes of
storage<00:01:20.250> each<00:01:21.090> one<00:01:21.390> has<00:01:21.570> four<00:01:21.810> drives<00:01:22.109> this<00:01:22.679> is

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:22.859 
storage each one has four drives this is

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:25.969 
storage each one has four drives this is
the<00:01:23.009> two<00:01:23.159> terabyte<00:01:23.579> model<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.450> has<00:01:24.600> 4<00:01:25.049> 500

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
the two terabyte model and it has 4 500

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.719 
the two terabyte model and it has 4 500
gigabyte<00:01:26.700> drives<00:01:27.920> now<00:01:28.920> why<00:01:29.280> would<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.579> have

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
gigabyte drives now why would you have

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.690 
gigabyte drives now why would you have
so<00:01:29.880> many<00:01:29.969> drives<00:01:30.329> well<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.859> terastation<00:01:32.219> uses

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
so many drives well the terastation uses

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.969 
so many drives well the terastation uses
raid<00:01:32.939> 5<00:01:33.270> technology<00:01:33.899> and<00:01:34.079> what<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.469> means<00:01:34.710> is

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
raid 5 technology and what that means is

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.069 
raid 5 technology and what that means is
the<00:01:35.219> data<00:01:35.369> from<00:01:35.640> one<00:01:35.850> drive<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.329> actually

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
the data from one drive is actually

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.690 
the data from one drive is actually
spread<00:01:37.469> also<00:01:37.890> spread<00:01:38.130> across<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.399> other

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
spread also spread across the other

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.880 
spread also spread across the other
three<00:01:38.939> drives<00:01:39.179> as<00:01:39.359> well<00:01:39.569> so<00:01:40.259> if<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.530> one<00:01:40.679> drive

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
three drives as well so if the one drive

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.739 
three drives as well so if the one drive
should<00:01:41.069> fail<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.999> can<00:01:42.149> actually<00:01:42.329> take<00:01:42.630> it

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:42.749 
should fail you can actually take it

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:44.300 
should fail you can actually take it
right<00:01:42.899> out<00:01:42.960> without<00:01:43.710> turning<00:01:44.069> off<00:01:44.280> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
right out without turning off the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.029 
right out without turning off the
terastation<00:01:44.789> put<00:01:45.509> another<00:01:45.749> drive<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.319> and<00:01:46.530> its

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
terastation put another drive in and its

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.010 
terastation put another drive in and its
contents<00:01:47.549> will<00:01:47.670> be<00:01:47.759> automatically<00:01:48.359> rebuilt

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
contents will be automatically rebuilt

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.359 
contents will be automatically rebuilt
from<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.289> data<00:01:49.590> from<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.950> other<00:01:50.069> three

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
from the data from the other three

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.609 
from the data from the other three
drives<00:01:50.759> all<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:52.079> may<00:01:52.229> sound<00:01:52.380> complicated

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
drives all this may sound complicated

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.289 
drives all this may sound complicated
but<00:01:53.039> it's<00:01:53.399> easy<00:01:53.609> to<00:01:53.759> set<00:01:53.909> up<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.119> terror

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
but it's easy to set up the terror

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.569 
but it's easy to set up the terror
station<00:01:54.659> all<00:01:55.109> you<00:01:55.319> have<00:01:55.469> to<00:01:55.619> do<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:56.009> plug<00:01:56.490> it

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
station all you have to do is plug it

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.980 
station all you have to do is plug it
into<00:01:56.729> your<00:01:56.819> home<00:01:57.030> network<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.600> turn<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.869> on

the data that's stored on the
terastation<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:12.750> easiest<00:02:13.140> way<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.319> do<00:02:13.500> that

terastation the easiest way to do that

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.460 
terastation the easiest way to do that
is<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:14.120> map<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.510> one<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.050> drives<00:02:16.260> on

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
is to map it to one of the drives on

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.440 
is to map it to one of the drives on
your<00:02:16.590> computer<00:02:17.010> in<00:02:17.610> windows<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:18.180> do<00:02:18.270> that

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
your computer in windows you do that

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.270 
your computer in windows you do that
through<00:02:18.630> Windows<00:02:18.900> Explorer<00:02:19.380> what<00:02:20.160> I'm<00:02:20.250> doing

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
through Windows Explorer what I'm doing

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.110 
through Windows Explorer what I'm doing
is<00:02:20.640> mapping<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.840> dr-z<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.680> now<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.760> can

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
is mapping it to dr-z and now I can

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.640 
is mapping it to dr-z and now I can
access
