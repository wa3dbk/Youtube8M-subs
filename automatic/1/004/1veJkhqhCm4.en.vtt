it<00:02:43.190> forward<00:02:43.520> a<00:02:43.550> little<00:02:43.790> bit<00:02:43.910> just<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.210> let<00:02:44.420> it

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
it forward a little bit just to let it

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.480 
it forward a little bit just to let it
dry<00:02:47.350> and<00:02:48.350> then<00:02:48.410> you<00:02:48.620> can<00:02:48.800> flip<00:02:48.950> that<00:02:49.100> over<00:02:49.250> so

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
dry and then you can flip that over so

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.800 
dry and then you can flip that over so
you<00:02:49.550> can<00:02:49.670> see<00:02:49.850> you're<00:02:49.970> starting<00:02:50.120> to<00:02:50.330> get<00:02:50.450> a

pretty good little bit of height there

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.360 
pretty good little bit of height there
and<00:02:53.990> then<00:02:54.110> you'll<00:02:54.230> take<00:02:54.470> another<00:02:54.710> section<00:02:55.190> of

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370
