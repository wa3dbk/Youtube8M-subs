00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:04.970
 between November 17 and 21 organizations and added passions of 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.059
 support for entrepreneurs celebrated the global week of igniting uribismo 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.920
 with workshops and conferences on the challenges of this activity that undertakes 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.660
 We travel to Uruguay to participate in the cycle of conferences of the foundation 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.840
 endeavor 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.590
 and if I had the opportunity to meet dozens of entrepreneurs from the southern cone 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.869
 so in the next few days we are going to share some of the talks from the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.820
 interviews we did in Montevideo to learn about specific cases of 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.900
 Successful entrepreneurs know how they did it and what are the challenges they see 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.989
 asia the future but to start successfully many men and women think 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.749
 first in the money 

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:47.729
 the money that is needed and many times the first challenge to solve is not the 

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:51.949
 topic of capital we are going to start this series of interviews that 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.629
 We did in intur montevideo with that conversation we had with Carmen 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.010
 strap executive director tendedor uruguay 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.459
 who told us about his ideas just about 

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:04.989
 the money that money is not always the first thing an entrepreneur needs 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.870
 who in some way when there is a good idea 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.090
 the captain gn mind in pairs 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.910
 and on the other hand it's not just the capital 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.250
 Entrepreneurs follow him saying he needs capital and when he formulates 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.290
 question and for what is going to stop with that capital 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.060
 - to bless king who would use it 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.930
 so we believe that first they have to work 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.540
 in other things as management improve putting together a business plan 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.560
 arm a9 mind or maybe a 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.950
 more strategic planning 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.610
 before receiving this capital because once I received them in the capital 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.860
 cuela takes 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.290
 and if they do not misuse this endeavor it can fail then sometimes 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.899
 first is not the money 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.640
 and this month is an error of conception of those who are not so expert when undertaking 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.640
 if it is not order 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.220
 If I need money, obviously I need money. 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.930
 especially when starting 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.080
 or at the moment of wanting to grow that enterprise but in some way this 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.339
 have to be clear 

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:20.739
 As I see it, maybe I'm going to use it on a clear channel, what will the 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.049
 objective 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.519
 to be able to use those funds 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.620
 cross in taji of what entrepreneurs are 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.629
 that's why today they come to organizations like in voice 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.879
 they are in the phase I need the money and they really have to start with another 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:34.659
 place 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.669
 I would say that I get married with a banana in the environment of 35% 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:43.859
 it's a good sign it's a bad sign on the level of clec training 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.230
 that comes from having the company 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.800
 of origin in the dtm increase of your company with her with you 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.020
 the good sign for us is that it is only money to what they need and 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.260
 we have as well as a number of other organizations a quantity of 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.529
 tools for lending to the coach 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:03.429
 then ibi has shown what we are going to connect with investor networks 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:04.529
 angels 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:09.429
 or with a venture capital fund we put aside and facilitate the veto of the tools 

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:13.759
 as sharp consultancy mentoring training workshops that lead to 

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:14.879
 to ease 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.839
 We trust to organize your company for the moment 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:22.059
 kenneth which continues to receive those funds the company is at a stage that 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:24.629
 can really make good airs 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:29.290
 we are in a complicated context reach the financial crisis the crisis 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.699
 credit 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:34.129
 the big question of cehegín where will be the resources and is that there 

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:39.209
 and even that is to say yes to her and that she and prepare well and formalize these 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.399
 processes and you do if you need the money although you have to do this side 

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:46.549
 He also makes the issue of money - he bought the consequences of 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.549
 this crisis about the availability of resources for entrepreneurs 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:55.049
 we see with concern how any citizen can give it, no one is 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.089
 unaware of this crisis a global crisis are not had a country of mine in the 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:00.029
 region 

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:01.350
 in the same mind 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.970
 somehow we are optimistic that we will have opportunities for the 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.309
 Entrepreneurs especially for entrepreneurs in Latin America 

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:14.749
 because in the old investors fear that there are people in both states 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:16.209
 united as in europe 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.560
 maybe they are not trusting so much in the capital markets maybe they are not 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.440
 seeing that it is really your investments are giving the expected results 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.900
 to try to identify what exists in latin america what opportunities there are 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.620
 in latin america what ventures to go 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.669
 in which they could invest 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.629
 then as they expand they visit the 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:42.580
 this general opportunities and we believe that they will see opportunities to 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.479
 the companies 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.419
 but it seems that here the issue is the degree of innovation that 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:48.919
 meat projects 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.800
 undoubtedly the degree of innovation that is a truly dynamic entrepreneurship a 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.860
 entrepreneurship 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.639
 only sir we talk about high impact training to which the entrepreneurship 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.110
 that really bet will come more wants to keep taking risks is a m 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.330
 entrepreneurship to have the potential to follow 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.400
 in general the answer to really attract these investments and it's not 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.520
 innovate difficult agree that you can get the necessary funds in addition 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.389
 of the characteristics that you establish for our audience in america 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:21.449
 latina would ask you what does it mean that the project is innovative 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:27.800
 there is a very broad concept and does not mean that in which you have reinvented 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.289
 wheel as we always say in some way there may be innovation 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:35.819
 in being vitiated there can be innovation in the management of the company 

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:40.799
 but somehow you have to yield the kun ventures that is obviously 

00:05:40.799 --> 00:05:44.219
 will use the technology and just remus 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:49.050
 this and innovation and tic and training and constant improvement within 

00:05:49.049 --> 00:05:50.189
 of your enterprise 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:51.980
 to close they count 11 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.160
 from my entrepreneurship jobs to entrepreneurs who have been innovators 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.840
 city ​​and that it is not easy for you that are characteristic 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.800
 this one homeless 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.180
 somehow kanawa and we have a few innovative ventures 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.610
 we have a 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:06.990
 I trained bar 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.129
 for example they are giving the mara páez zeta 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:15.449
 he was a racer and one day he decided to form a company that what 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:18.469
 seeks to minimize traffic accidents 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.340
 ccoo and found inside what was his youth and streets ravage a 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.379
 entrepreneurship that is innovative 

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:29.410
 that has a lot of technology, a lot remains in what it does to services 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.710
 and that in turn is a good to the community because what it tries to do is a haystack 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.550
 the accident rate and 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.839
 as well as to him we have a meter paris 5 anand and advance blanton of 

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:43.999

 also seeks innovation generally seek 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:59.229
 the dif devastating underdeveloped industries in the country 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:04.270

 South American rally champion Fernando Camarote Cambio andic Rosenblat de 

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:09.389
