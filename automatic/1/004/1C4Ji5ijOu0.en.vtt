underneath my chin where I normally use

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.790 
underneath my chin where I normally use
a<00:02:54.180> contour<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:54.989> just<00:02:55.170> kind<00:02:55.380> of<00:02:55.470> gives<00:02:55.620> you

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
a contour and it just kind of gives you

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.680 
a contour and it just kind of gives you
a<00:02:55.830> little<00:02:56.160> warm<00:02:56.400> glow<00:02:56.820> but<00:02:57.239> like<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.390> said<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.630> is
