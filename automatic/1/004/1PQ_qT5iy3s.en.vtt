could've just stay in and try to kill my
apron<00:04:58.420> a<00:04:58.480> I<00:04:58.720> guess<00:04:59.140> he<00:04:59.350> was<00:04:59.470> like<00:04:59.650> taking<00:05:00.010> that

apron a I guess he was like taking that
at<00:05:00.520> the<00:05:00.670> end<00:05:00.910> he's<00:05:01.150> probably<00:05:01.390> not<00:05:01.630> gonna<00:05:01.840> kill

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140

at the end he's probably not gonna kill
that<00:05:02.170> because<00:05:02.800> at<00:05:03.280> the<00:05:03.490> end<00:05:03.520> you<00:05:03.730> probably

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.510 
that because at the end you probably
have<00:05:04.240> he<00:05:04.690> won't<00:05:04.900> have<00:05:05.050> enough<00:05:05.290> HP<00:05:05.500> to<00:05:06.040> set<00:05:06.280> up<00:05:06.400> a
