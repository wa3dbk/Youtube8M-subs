00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.469
 hello my name is in this video wants 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.549
 I'll tell you a little bit about that 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.549
 show vertical fishing 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.220
 For the most part , we only do it in tk 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.570
 winter when the fish are not active 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.210
 and lying on the floor 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.480
 while in the summer we tend to do that 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.599
 fishing or fishing with art 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.270
 prefer the vertical goes of course 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.280
 also to make it is not an issue only 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.540
 we use the vertically adjusted 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.820
 we now have an outside temperature of 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.370
 four degrees and a water temperature of 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.490
 45 degrees 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.740
 we are here once the games 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.950
 is a bit red-eyed today 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.710
 dead red-eye and ink-fishes at 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:01:00.960
 Try it on vertically and how to do it 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.150
 makes the route and the playa what you do 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.750
 she uses and the systems will 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.700
 I now introduce in this video 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:12.659
 there are vertical finished systems 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.369
 For example, to buy a brush 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.979
 in the lead is fish in the bait 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.350
 pushed and thus rat firmly 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.229
 So it's tied very well 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.310
 just something for me in everyday life or whatever 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.710
 a bit of deterring is for such a thing 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.620
 system has to pay 18 euros and here 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.200
 but have a lot of trees and that 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.750
 more often system departure namely in the 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.150
 trees will stick then it will 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.350
 easy to do and so I use it completely 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:47.400
 normal three heads mostly from 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.740
 harassment and that's exactly how it works 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.680
 then drilling and hanging there 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.340
 let the dead fish on it and that 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.500
 Boat round just above the ground and fell 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.280
 so stood the ground and try if 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.430
 her nobel prize and especially if she 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.710
 somewhere you can see the crete 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:13.049
 where i use i need it today 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:15.870
 frozen with a red eye and as 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:20.400
 second baits the slightly bigger ones i have 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:23.519
 me brought along by foresee the very 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.680
 a lot of fat is very much in the tissue 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.140
 fatty fish are 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.200
 maybe it works better then 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.650
 of course my favorite bait of the 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.040
 squid with a heavy heavy 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.500
 Lead a heavy mission to something 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.790
 smaller with the light and as 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.299
 actually everything I do to the vertical 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.420
 need and I do not do it now 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:51.150
 great cult out everything possible 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.000
 need systems or different hooks 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.159
 but as I said normal and lead 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.700
 taken head 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:01.859
 maybe then it is still or at the 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.629
 Graphic one sees this in special 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:12.180
 meat pots america long with 150 grams 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:13.889
 and 80 grams and the land actually to 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:19.969
 I do not need more vertical vision 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:25.439
 i just need a swirl as or 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:28.159
 used a strong vertical rudder with 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.159
 a multi-role 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:38.060
 today is 2 meters long and has one 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:42.050
 Throw weight from 50 to 150 grams 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.050
 that's enough 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:54.780
 but not active are quiet there no and 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:58.650
 Heimstarken bucket try now first 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.020
 the good old fish with a 42 grams 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:05.310
 That 's enough for everyday life 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.020
 we have about six meters here and there 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.000
 you do not need to weight heavy 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.410
 fishing 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.830
 the whole thing is going down to the ground now 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.830
 calmly 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:58.660
 just kept the same 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.660
 scarce is the squid 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.700
 sometimes you can be more beautiful on the ground 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:14.900
 grind 1 deeper is now one time 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:14.900
 little bit to start the big search 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.150
 now also a house 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:45.719
 the
