00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
all that and it looks very unrealistic I

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.460 
all that and it looks very unrealistic I
mean<00:01:23.820> it's<00:01:24.000> not<00:01:24.119> going<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.390> be<00:01:24.509> all<00:01:24.990> should<00:01:25.380> an

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
mean it's not going to be all should an

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.020

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
on that I mean obviously it's not gonna

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.960 
on that I mean obviously it's not gonna
be<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.450> floodlight<00:01:30.750> but<00:01:31.170> even<00:01:31.890> even<00:01:32.369> with<00:01:32.939> a

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
be a floodlight but even even with a

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.719 
be a floodlight but even even with a
little<00:01:33.180> white<00:01:33.420> like<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.920> you'll<00:01:34.920> still<00:01:35.280> get

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
little white like that you'll still get

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.230
