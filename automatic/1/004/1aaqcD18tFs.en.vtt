things<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.470> liked<00:01:52.740> about<00:01:52.829> having<00:01:53.280> two

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.120

with<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.200> barrelling<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.770> vignetting

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
with the barrelling and the vignetting

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.490 
with the barrelling and the vignetting
but<00:01:59.640> also<00:01:59.790> had<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.299> less<00:02:00.540> dramatic<00:02:00.689> wide-angle

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
but also had a less dramatic wide-angle

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.230 
but also had a less dramatic wide-angle
option<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:01.979> while<00:02:02.189> still<00:02:02.490> significantly

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.480

wider<00:02:03.540> than<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> standard<00:02:04.380> view<00:02:04.560> avoided

this extreme distortion in vignetting

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.979 
this extreme distortion in vignetting
and<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.310> found<00:02:08.520> both<00:02:08.849> options<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.539> be<00:02:09.629> very

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
and I found both options to be very

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.680 
and I found both options to be very
useful<00:02:10.229> but<00:02:11.069> here<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.819> only<00:02:12.030> option<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.450> the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
useful but here the only option is the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.820 
useful but here the only option is the
full-on<00:02:13.050> Fisher

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
get that of course but it's not too bad

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.230 
get that of course but it's not too bad
sharpness<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.010> contrast<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.730> reasonably

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
center things do get progressively worse

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.160 
center things do get progressively worse
at<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.740> edges<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.940> on<00:02:39.150> some<00:02:39.480> subjects<00:02:40.050> you

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
at the edges and on some subjects you

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.080 
at the edges and on some subjects you
will<00:02:40.380> still<00:02:40.770> get<00:02:40.950> some<00:02:41.010> color<00:02:41.520> fringing

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
will still get some color fringing

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.800 
will still get some color fringing
throughout<00:02:42.450> but<00:02:43.290> I've<00:02:43.590> seen<00:02:43.860> worse<00:02:44.810> flaring

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
throughout but I've seen worse flaring

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.570 
throughout but I've seen worse flaring
from<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.140> Sun<00:02:46.350> or<00:02:46.590> bright<00:02:46.890> light<00:02:47.130> sources

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
from the Sun or bright light sources

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.250 
from the Sun or bright light sources
isn't<00:02:48.060> too<00:02:48.210> bad<00:02:48.360> which<00:02:48.780> was<00:02:49.020> a<00:02:49.050> surprise

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
isn't too bad which was a surprise

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.000 
isn't too bad which was a surprise
really

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
really

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.490 
really
so<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:51.240> do<00:02:51.390> make<00:02:51.600> a<00:02:51.630> compromise<00:02:52.110> on<00:02:52.470> your

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
so you do make a compromise on your

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.230 
so you do make a compromise on your
image<00:02:52.950> quality<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.550> a<00:02:53.580> relatively<00:02:54.120> small

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
image quality to a relatively small

image quality to a relatively small
extent<00:02:55.140> but<00:02:55.709> what<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:55.950> get<00:02:56.130> in<00:02:56.220> return<00:02:56.370> are

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
extent but what you get in return are

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.420 
extent but what you get in return are
some<00:02:57.300> very<00:02:57.570> useful<00:02:57.900> creative<00:02:58.650> options<00:02:58.800> both
