00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.939 
about where this post here is and where
this<00:00:29.059> fence<00:00:29.329> is<00:00:29.569> and<00:00:30.229> just<00:00:30.439> go<00:00:30.559> ahead<00:00:30.679> and<00:00:30.859> run

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
this fence is and just go ahead and run

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.560 
this fence is and just go ahead and run
a<00:00:30.979> piece<00:00:31.220> of<00:00:31.339> chain<00:00:31.579> link<00:00:31.609> all<00:00:32.029> the<00:00:32.149> way<00:00:32.270> from

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
a piece of chain link all the way from

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.779 
a piece of chain link all the way from
there<00:00:32.840> to<00:00:33.079> the<00:00:33.829> other<00:00:33.980> side<00:00:34.250> and<00:00:34.460> then<00:00:34.609> put

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:34.789 
there to the other side and then put

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:38.590 
there to the other side and then put
that<00:00:34.940> gate<00:00:35.239> there<00:00:35.949> and<00:00:36.949> half<00:00:37.609> this<00:00:37.910> out<00:00:38.179> so

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
that gate there and half this out so

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.020 
that gate there and half this out so
that<00:00:38.780> this<00:00:38.870> is<00:00:39.079> two<00:00:39.260> different<00:00:39.440> pins<00:00:40.000> so<00:00:41.000> that

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
that this is two different pins so that

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.900 
that this is two different pins so that
when<00:00:41.300> I<00:00:41.329> do<00:00:41.449> have<00:00:41.809> mmm<00:00:42.559> the<00:00:42.829> moma<00:00:43.070> have<00:00:43.339> a<00:00:43.370> baby

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
when I do have mmm the moma have a baby

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.500 
when I do have mmm the moma have a baby
like<00:00:44.210> this<00:00:44.449> I<00:00:45.550> can<00:00:46.550> take<00:00:46.699> and<00:00:46.910> separate<00:00:47.359> them

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
like this I can take and separate them

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.869 
like this I can take and separate them
that<00:00:47.960> way<00:00:48.109> because<00:00:48.469> these<00:00:48.769> two<00:00:48.980> here<00:00:49.339> they're

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
that way because these two here they're

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.029 
that way because these two here they're
pretty<00:00:50.089> rough<00:00:50.359> they're<00:00:50.629> still<00:00:50.899> young<00:00:51.769> and

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
when they want to play like that they

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.899 
when they want to play like that they
may<00:00:58.879> hit<00:00:59.120> the<00:00:59.149> baby<00:00:59.449> when<00:00:59.719> it's<00:00:59.870> born<00:00:59.929> so<00:01:00.909> okay
