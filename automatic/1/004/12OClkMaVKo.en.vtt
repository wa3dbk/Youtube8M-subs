00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.740 

here<00:05:39.410> we<00:05:39.560> go<00:05:39.740> I<00:05:39.770> think<00:05:39.919> this<00:05:40.370> is<00:05:40.610> a<00:05:40.750> either

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
here we go I think this is a either

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.430 
here we go I think this is a either
cheetah<00:05:42.650> or<00:05:43.430> leopard<00:05:44.240> that<00:05:44.840> was<00:05:44.960> my<00:05:45.110> next

is<00:06:07.370> what<00:06:07.640> I'm<00:06:07.760> gonna<00:06:07.910> assume<00:06:08.360> but<00:06:09.080> they<00:06:09.169> all

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.289 
is what I'm gonna assume but they all

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:13.930 
is what I'm gonna assume but they all
say<00:06:09.500> the<00:06:09.650> same<00:06:09.680> thing<00:06:12.460> look<00:06:13.460> at<00:06:13.550> the<00:06:13.669> monster

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
feet on that thing but I think that is

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.330 
feet on that thing but I think that is
it<00:06:23.200> the<00:06:24.200> rest<00:06:24.350> of<00:06:24.470> these<00:06:24.560> are<00:06:24.740> little<00:06:24.919> people

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.779 
it the rest of these are little people
