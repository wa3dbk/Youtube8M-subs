unscrews<00:02:13.480> like<00:02:13.750> this<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.410> then<00:02:14.560> actual<00:02:15.870> ink

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
unscrews like this and then actual ink

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.520

flat flatness this is this is a better

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.449 
flat flatness this is this is a better
actual<00:02:52.440> tool<00:02:53.440> if<00:02:53.680> you<00:02:53.769> were<00:02:53.860> gonna<00:02:53.980> use<00:02:54.250> it
