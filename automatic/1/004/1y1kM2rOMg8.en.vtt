and also match so let's take a look at

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.170 
and also match so let's take a look at
some<00:00:40.140> order<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.309> also<00:00:41.460> do<00:00:41.640> get<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
some order that you also do get the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.580 
some order that you also do get the
first<00:00:42.390> thing<00:00:42.540> you're<00:00:42.660> gonna<00:00:42.750> notice<00:00:42.960> here<00:00:43.379> is

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
first thing you're gonna notice here is

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.100 
first thing you're gonna notice here is
that<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.980> don't<00:00:44.190> get<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.820> green<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.629> variant

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
that you don't get the green and variant

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.069 
that you don't get the green and variant
that<00:00:46.550> you<00:00:47.550> do<00:00:47.670> get<00:00:47.879> like<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.329> your<00:00:48.420> iPhone<00:00:48.780> 5

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
that you do get like in your iPhone 5

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.290 
that you do get like in your iPhone 5
which<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.680> found<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.129> bit<00:00:50.250> weird<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:51.000> actually

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
which I found a bit weird you actually

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.439 
which I found a bit weird you actually
do<00:00:51.449> get<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.780> also<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.379> all<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.890> iPhones

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
do get it also in all of the iPhones

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.910 
do get it also in all of the iPhones
it's<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.510> little<00:00:54.690> bit<00:00:54.780> awkward<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.680> start

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
it's a little bit awkward so you start

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.010 
it's a little bit awkward so you start
here<00:00:55.980> with<00:00:56.280> one<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.640> blue<00:00:56.940> colors<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.690> do

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
here with one of the blue colors that do

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.619 
here with one of the blue colors that do
seem<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.590> different<00:00:58.890> tone<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.789> then

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
seem to have a different tone and then

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.219 
seem to have a different tone and then
the<00:01:00.660> one<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.949> do<00:01:02.730> get<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.420> iPhone<00:01:03.899> 5

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
the one that you do get on the iPhone 5

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.630 
the one that you do get on the iPhone 5
and<00:01:05.299> also<00:01:06.299> on<00:01:06.570> Apple's<00:01:07.110> iPad<00:01:07.409> or<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:07.890> Apple's<00:01:08.549> I

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
tone even I'm not even sure and then we

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:43.180 
tone even I'm not even sure and then we
have<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:28.500> one<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.009> use<00:01:29.280> did<00:01:29.700> show

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.740 

there<00:01:44.190> we<00:01:44.340> go<00:01:44.550> that's<00:01:45.240> how<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.659> looks<00:01:45.870> I<00:01:47.750> do

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
there we go that's how it looks I do

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.500 
there we go that's how it looks I do
like<00:01:49.050> this<00:01:49.229> color<00:01:49.530> though<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:50.040> do<00:01:50.250> like<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.760> and

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
like this color though I do like it and

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.600 
like this color though I do like it and

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
then we do have this one which could

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.850 
then we do have this one which could
also<00:01:53.880> be<00:01:54.330> a<00:01:54.360> little<00:01:54.630> bit<00:01:54.810> almost<00:01:54.990> like<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.229> space

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
also be a little bit almost like a space

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.350 
also be a little bit almost like a space
gray<00:01:56.280> color<00:01:56.580> maybe<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.300> new<00:01:57.420> iPhones

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
gray color maybe for the new iPhones

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:07.760 
gray color maybe for the new iPhones
almost<00:02:00.360> like<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.540> little<00:02:00.810> bit<00:02:00.960> grey<00:02:06.770> intro

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
almost like a little bit grey intro

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:15.800 
almost like a little bit grey intro
thing<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:09.770> then<00:02:10.770> we<00:02:11.009> have<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.850> one<00:02:14.810> which

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
thing and then we have this one which

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.130 
thing and then we have this one which
may<00:02:16.080> not<00:02:16.140> be<00:02:16.410> super<00:02:16.650> new<00:02:17.660> if<00:02:18.660> you'd<00:02:18.840> also<00:02:18.989> have

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
may not be super new if you'd also have

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.310 
may not be super new if you'd also have
a<00:02:19.260> different<00:02:19.590> tone<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:21.019> maybe<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:24.900> have<00:02:25.110> to

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
a different tone to it maybe you have to

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:37.550 
a different tone to it maybe you have to
do<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.440> side-by-side<00:02:25.830> comparison<00:02:26.930> on<00:02:27.930> these

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:47.160
