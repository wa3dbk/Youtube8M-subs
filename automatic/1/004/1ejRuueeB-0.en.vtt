what<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.979> looks<00:01:32.159> kind<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.610> flame<00:01:33.150> I

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
what it looks kind of like a flame I

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.789 
what it looks kind of like a flame I
don't<00:01:33.509> know<00:01:33.600> if<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:33.780> animated<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.439> does<00:01:34.619> look

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
don't know if it's animated it does look

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.830 
don't know if it's animated it does look
a<00:01:34.890> little<00:01:35.070> bit<00:01:35.280> animated<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.970> guess<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.689> one

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
a little bit animated I guess this one

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.810 
a little bit animated I guess this one
does<00:01:37.049> look<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.380> little<00:01:37.740> bit<00:01:37.979> decent<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:38.640> not

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
does look a little bit decent it's not

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.429 
does look a little bit decent it's not
as<00:01:38.970> bad<00:01:39.210> as<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.450> thought<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.659> was<00:01:39.930> when<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.200> first

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
as bad as I thought it was when I first

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.830 
as bad as I thought it was when I first
saw<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.740> but<00:01:40.860> I've<00:01:41.670> definitely<00:01:41.939> like<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.479> kind

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
saw it but I've definitely like the kind

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.230 
saw it but I've definitely like the kind
of<00:01:42.930> black<00:01:43.170> on<00:01:43.409> flame<00:01:44.070> effect<00:01:44.250> but<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.880> looks<00:01:45.149> a

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
of black on flame effect but it looks a

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.090 
of black on flame effect but it looks a
little<00:01:45.360> bit<00:01:45.540> too<00:01:45.659> simple<00:01:45.869> if<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:46.680> animated

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
little bit too simple if it's animated

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.350 
little bit too simple if it's animated
it<00:01:47.310> might<00:01:47.460> be<00:01:47.579> able<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.790> be<00:01:47.850> cooler<00:01:48.090> but<00:01:48.270> if

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
it might be able to be cooler but if

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.450 
it might be able to be cooler but if
it's<00:01:48.509> just<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:48.960> simple<00:01:49.200> kind<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.710> color<00:01:50.250> to

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
it's just this simple kind of color to

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.859 
it's just this simple kind of color to
it<00:01:50.579> then<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.909> might<00:01:51.060> not<00:01:51.240> be<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.450> that

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
it then it might not be that that

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.389 
it then it might not be that that
