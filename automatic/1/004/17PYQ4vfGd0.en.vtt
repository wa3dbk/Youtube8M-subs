00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.710 
with her but but I just adjust my body
language<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:47.310> my<00:01:47.490> position<00:01:48.030> at<00:01:48.149> her<00:01:48.299> shoulder

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
language in my position at her shoulder

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.410 
language in my position at her shoulder
to<00:01:48.750> get<00:01:49.200> her<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.799> give<00:01:50.130> me<00:01:50.310> two<00:01:50.520> eyes<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:51.180> change

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
to get her to give me two eyes to change

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.149 
to get her to give me two eyes to change
directions

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.179 

I<00:01:59.049> think<00:02:00.049> she's<00:02:00.259> doing<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.679> really<00:02:00.950> good<00:02:01.130> job

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
I think she's doing a really good job

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.789 
I think she's doing a really good job
with<00:02:01.640> her<00:02:01.909> speed<00:02:02.210> control<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:02.899> also<00:02:03.289> changing

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
with her speed control and also changing

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.160 
with her speed control and also changing
directions<00:02:04.149> respectfully<00:02:05.149> but<00:02:05.719> again<00:02:05.990> this

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
directions respectfully but again this

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.410 
directions respectfully but again this
is<00:02:06.409> just<00:02:06.439> her<00:02:06.920> first<00:02:07.189> time<00:02:07.609> so<00:02:07.939> she's<00:02:08.179> a<00:02:08.239> little

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
is just her first time so she's a little

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.570 
is just her first time so she's a little
sticky<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:09.140> you'll<00:02:09.769> definitely<00:02:09.920> see<00:02:10.459> a<00:02:10.489> lot

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580

desensitize her because I did have to

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.950 
desensitize her because I did have to
spank<00:02:37.340> quite<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:37.820> bit<00:02:38.090> with<00:02:38.240> that<00:02:38.270> whip<00:02:38.660> when

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
going to hurt her and it's just an

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.850 
going to hurt her and it's just an
extension<00:02:46.820> of<00:02:47.210> my<00:02:47.540> arm<00:02:47.570> that's<00:02:48.530> going<00:02:48.770> to

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860

her to think that everything I do with

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.030 
her to think that everything I do with
the<00:02:53.360> whip<00:02:53.510> means<00:02:53.840> something<00:02:54.350> or<00:02:54.650> that<00:02:54.860> she

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
the whip means something or that she

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.340 
the whip means something or that she
needs<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.340> be<00:02:55.580> apprehensive<00:02:56.180> or<00:02:56.630> afraid<00:02:57.080> of<00:02:57.200> it

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
needs to be apprehensive or afraid of it

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.680 
needs to be apprehensive or afraid of it
so<00:02:57.950> I'm<00:02:58.160> rubbing<00:02:58.520> this<00:02:58.670> whip<00:02:58.880> all<00:02:59.120> over<00:02:59.540> her

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
so I'm rubbing this whip all over her

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.690 
so I'm rubbing this whip all over her
body<00:02:59.840> slapping<00:03:00.680> it<00:03:00.800> on<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.010> ground<00:03:01.250> next<00:03:01.520> to

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
body slapping it on the ground next to

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.580

her<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.450> just<00:03:02.480> really<00:03:03.050> getting<00:03:03.260> her

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
her and just really getting her

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.520 
her and just really getting her
desensitized<00:03:04.580> to<00:03:04.880> it<00:03:05.030> being<00:03:05.480> around<00:03:05.990> her<00:03:06.260> and

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
desensitized to it being around her and

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:16.840 
desensitized to it being around her and
moving

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.840 

I<00:03:17.380> really<00:03:18.380> love<00:03:18.560> these<00:03:18.710> longer<00:03:19.220> driving<00:03:19.520> whips

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
I really love these longer driving whips

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.790 
I really love these longer driving whips
because<00:03:20.270> they're<00:03:20.540> so<00:03:20.780> lightweight<00:03:21.110> and<00:03:21.380> easy

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
because they're so lightweight and easy

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.250 
because they're so lightweight and easy
to<00:03:21.920> use<00:03:22.250> but<00:03:22.610> they're<00:03:22.820> also<00:03:23.240> nice<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:23.750> long<00:03:23.960> so

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
to use but they're also nice and long so

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.570 
to use but they're also nice and long so
it<00:03:24.380> allows<00:03:24.590> you<00:03:24.770> to<00:03:24.890> keep<00:03:25.070> a<00:03:25.190> healthy<00:03:25.340> distance

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
it allows you to keep a healthy distance

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.360 
it allows you to keep a healthy distance
from<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.300> horse<00:03:26.540> and<00:03:26.870> I<00:03:27.680> like<00:03:27.890> to<00:03:28.040> use<00:03:28.220> it

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
from the horse and I like to use it

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.520 
from the horse and I like to use it
again<00:03:28.640> as<00:03:28.880> an<00:03:29.030> extension<00:03:29.390> of<00:03:29.600> my<00:03:29.660> arm<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:30.320> Pat

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
again as an extension of my arm to Pat

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.710 
again as an extension of my arm to Pat
her<00:03:30.650> all<00:03:30.860> over<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:31.760> see<00:03:31.970> if<00:03:32.090> she<00:03:32.270> has<00:03:32.300> any

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.420 
her all over and see if she has any
sensitive<00:03:33.380> spots<00:03:33.710> that<00:03:34.040> I<00:03:34.100> need<00:03:34.310> to

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
sensitive spots that I need to

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.400 
sensitive spots that I need to
desensitize<00:03:34.760> on<00:03:35.420> her<00:03:35.630> body<00:03:35.840> a<00:03:38.410> simple

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
desensitize on her body a simple

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.380 
desensitize on her body a simple
exercise<00:03:39.770> I<00:03:40.160> love<00:03:40.400> doing<00:03:40.700> with<00:03:40.820> Colts<00:03:41.240> is

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
exercise I love doing with Colts is

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.810 
exercise I love doing with Colts is
asking<00:03:41.930> them<00:03:42.110> to<00:03:42.140> spin<00:03:42.830> around<00:03:43.070> the<00:03:43.430> lead<00:03:43.580> rope

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
asking them to spin around the lead rope

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.330 
asking them to spin around the lead rope
and<00:03:44.030> essentially<00:03:44.960> what<00:03:45.080> I<00:03:45.110> do<00:03:45.230> is<00:03:45.650> I<00:03:45.980> put<00:03:46.250> it

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
and essentially what I do is I put it

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.520 
and essentially what I do is I put it
behind<00:03:46.460> their<00:03:46.910> rear<00:03:47.090> end<00:03:47.300> and<00:03:47.540> I<00:03:47.780> gently<00:03:48.080> tug

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
behind their rear end and I gently tug

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.160 
behind their rear end and I gently tug
until<00:03:49.430> they<00:03:49.580> follow<00:03:49.910> their<00:03:50.270> nose<00:03:50.510> through<00:03:51.050> the

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
until they follow their nose through the

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.920 
until they follow their nose through the
lead<00:03:51.350> rope<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:51.770> do<00:03:52.070> a<00:03:52.100> complete<00:03:52.550> spin<00:03:53.120> what

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
lead rope and do a complete spin what

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.080 
lead rope and do a complete spin what
this<00:03:54.110> does<00:03:54.350> is<00:03:54.560> it<00:03:54.680> actually<00:03:55.130> forces<00:03:55.430> them<00:03:55.850> to

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
this does is it actually forces them to

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.930 
this does is it actually forces them to
stop<00:03:56.660> looking<00:03:57.140> at<00:03:57.260> me<00:03:57.380> with<00:03:57.560> one<00:03:57.800> I<00:03:58.010> completely

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
stop looking at me with one I completely

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.910 
stop looking at me with one I completely
lose<00:03:59.390> me<00:03:59.720> in<00:03:59.870> their<00:04:00.020> field<00:04:00.290> of<00:04:00.380> vision<00:04:00.560> and
