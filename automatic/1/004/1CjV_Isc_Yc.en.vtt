tested<00:00:22.619> yet<00:00:22.830> but<00:00:23.670> anyway<00:00:24.029> let's<00:00:24.240> begin<00:00:24.390> our

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
tested yet but anyway let's begin our

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.019 
tested yet but anyway let's begin our
face<00:00:25.830> we<00:00:25.859> need<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.220> make<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> quick<00:00:26.609> render

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
face we need to make a quick render

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.490 
face we need to make a quick render
setup<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:28.730> let's<00:00:29.730> just<00:00:29.880> go<00:00:30.199> create<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.230> plane

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
setup so let's just go create a plane

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.090 
setup so let's just go create a plane
forty<00:00:32.399> segments<00:00:32.850> by<00:00:33.059> forty<00:00:33.559> go<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.620> modify

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
forty segments by forty go to modify

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.819 
forty segments by forty go to modify
panel<00:00:35.340> go<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.059> modifier<00:00:36.630> list<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.140> add<00:00:37.290> bend

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
panel go to modifier list and add bend

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.680 
panel go to modifier list and add bend
modifier<00:00:39.260> angle<00:00:40.260> will<00:00:40.410> be<00:00:40.440> minus<00:00:40.920> ninety<00:00:41.690> band

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
modifier angle will be minus ninety band

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.040 
modifier angle will be minus ninety band
axis<00:00:43.110> will<00:00:43.290> x<00:00:43.530> limit<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.370> effect<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.050> just

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
axis will x limit the effect and just

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.299 
axis will x limit the effect and just
drag<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.410> out<00:00:47.360> something<00:00:48.360> like<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.309> i

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
drag it out something like this and i

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.369 
drag it out something like this and i
just<00:00:50.610> hit<00:00:50.730> f4<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> perspective<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.140> you

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
just hit f4 on a perspective so you

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.540 
just hit f4 on a perspective so you
could<00:00:52.559> get<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:53.750> reg<00:00:54.750> basis<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.460> don't<00:00:56.460> know

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
could get a reg basis I don't know

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.170 
could get a reg basis I don't know
create<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> simple<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.629> don't<00:00:57.840> know<00:00:57.899> maybe<00:00:59.180> let's

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
create a simple I don't know maybe let's

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.349 
create a simple I don't know maybe let's
create<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.420> few<00:01:00.600> objects<00:01:01.020> actually<00:01:02.180> see<00:01:03.180> what

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
create a few objects actually see what

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.810 
create a few objects actually see what
we're<00:01:03.539> doing<00:01:03.890> let's<00:01:04.890> create<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.159> spear<00:01:05.489> oh<00:01:07.820> and

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
we're doing let's create a spear oh and

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.100 
we're doing let's create a spear oh and
let's<00:01:09.360> create<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.600> teapot<00:01:11.780> just<00:01:12.780> increase<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
let's create a teapot just increase the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.830 
let's create a teapot just increase the
segments

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
segments

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.910 
segments
to<00:01:15.530> get<00:01:15.679> smoother

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
to get smoother

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.560 
to get smoother
it's<00:01:18.460> a<00:01:18.520> bit<00:01:18.670> too<00:01:18.820> much<00:01:19.000> let's<00:01:19.270> go<00:01:19.479> maybe<00:01:20.159> 14

see<00:03:39.320> we<00:03:40.250> get<00:03:40.400> a<00:03:40.580> lot<00:03:40.880> of<00:03:40.940> difference<00:03:41.450> so<00:03:41.900> let's

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
see we get a lot of difference so let's

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.940 
see we get a lot of difference so let's
just<00:03:42.410> switch<00:03:42.770> above<00:03:43.100> them<00:03:43.400> and<00:03:44.920> create<00:03:45.920> a

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
just switch above them and create a

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.220 
just switch above them and create a
camera<00:03:46.460> hit<00:03:46.760> ctrl-c<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:47.690> going<00:03:47.930> to<00:03:47.990> create<00:03:48.170> a

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
camera hit ctrl-c and going to create a

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.680 
camera hit ctrl-c and going to create a
camera<00:03:48.650> from<00:03:48.830> the<00:03:48.950> perspective<00:03:49.490> you<00:03:49.610> or<00:03:49.820> what

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.250 
to the front and just lower down spear
get<00:04:01.640> just<00:04:02.270> a<00:04:02.390> little<00:04:02.420> bit<00:04:02.720> under<00:04:02.960> the<00:04:03.050> plane

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
get just a little bit under the plane

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.410 
get just a little bit under the plane
doesn't<00:04:03.500> really<00:04:03.710> matter<00:04:03.950> so<00:04:04.670> go<00:04:05.090> to<00:04:05.150> camera

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
doesn't really matter so go to camera
