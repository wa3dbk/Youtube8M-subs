00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 lomÃ© poupette hello today I 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.760
 come with a twittos for one is 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.940
 so here's a tutorial donkey jeb for 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:16.350
 able to wear your glasses from 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.029
 sun finally what you want and so 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.270
 today I'm going to actually use a 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.080
 don quarrie jab here I got 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.990
 frankly I do not know that at all 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.310
 it is a long barking which falling 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.640
 really good in that is pretty heavy 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.070
 so by light hijab and I also come 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.460
 used here below in fact of my 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.940
 head 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.600
 a band of the mark evelyne or and 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.239
 wlan and in fact it's a so it's a 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.460
 company began to make the 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.800
 hats so for who I so 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.079
 I have a headband here from the brand and wlan 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.530
 whose center of ebondo I have 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.360
 really found great because they do not 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.730
 are not actually made of cotton like 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.449
 every year so we find on the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.020
 market in some shops on 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.110
 Internet 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.350
 these bands here are already a field 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.790
 who are like revolutionary we are going 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.159
 to say in quotation marks is a bit like that 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.439
 so they've already done in spandex 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.760
 so it's kind of you know and 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.299
 elastic like the bonnets a little bit of 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.830
 two pools a little less we mean 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.330
 a little less elastic and more solid I 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.540
 find one so it's really really 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.340
 elastic and so the revolution is 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.720
 what is it that we finally thought about our 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.390
 ears and our poor little ears 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.009
 which therefore remain under the band 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.040
 all day and I honestly 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.869
 I like it's really the big problem 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.490
 that I have with the headbands is that 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.200
 when I keep them all day 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.759
 the end of the day I have ears 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.220
 in compote and I have the impression that I 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.619
 the temples that I feel at 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.390
 level of tents that taps a believer 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.390
 purposes and it's amazing like that like 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.560
 it hurts at the end of the day and therefore 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.860
 when frankly I saw 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.240
 so I saw this site that proposed 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.220
 this is the most wonderful side of this 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.020
 band up and that that wanted his 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.369
 smooth hair so at the end of the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.560
 day you have the hair that remains 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.649
 smooth so unlike some 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.479
 headbands counting con con but account 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.289
 and the end adding the hair remain 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.970
 dry etc 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.069
 I really found it really is 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.690
 side there me that really attracted me more 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.910
 that the holes in the ears 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.010
 but also because it does not serve me 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.680
 the ears and so I'm going 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.180
 use this one at the very beginning so the 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.410
 headband you shoots so had the headband 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.019
 lambda in tubes and I had felt when 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.610
 even a pressure at the end of the day 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.540
 so I used the one that tie 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.180
 behind the head 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.250
 and there you can actually set set 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.030
 at your ease in fact the greatness by 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.319
 report to your head 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.640
 I think it's good we tulle to 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.349
 his peak speaks for little heads 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.290
 eat anyway to a pretty enough head 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.670
 round end so here's in any case so 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.799
 great finds i will put you the 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.299

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.250
 below the video waiting for me 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.459
 leave with the igem tutorial for 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.459
 glasses 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.300
 I 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.250
 I
