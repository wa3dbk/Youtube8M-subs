00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.290 
ordered from but if you go to my Italian
wave<00:05:24.760> video<00:05:26.350> I<00:05:27.350> mean<00:05:28.040> the<00:05:28.430> company<00:05:28.850> they<00:05:29.270> are

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
wave video I mean the company they are

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.840 
wave video I mean the company they are
cuz<00:05:30.260> I<00:05:30.320> can't<00:05:30.650> think<00:05:30.800> of<00:05:30.830> a<00:05:30.890> name<00:05:30.980> or<00:05:31.130> pants<00:05:31.370> but

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
cuz I can't think of a name or pants but

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.850 
cuz I can't think of a name or pants but
the<00:05:31.940> name<00:05:32.090> it<00:05:32.270> is<00:05:32.420> on<00:05:32.720> my<00:05:32.990> other<00:05:33.140> video<00:05:33.500> so<00:05:33.770> if

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
the name it is on my other video so if

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.730 
the name it is on my other video so if
you<00:05:33.890> go<00:05:34.430> there<00:05:34.670> you'll<00:05:34.850> be<00:05:34.970> able<00:05:35.030> to<00:05:35.150> find<00:05:35.360> date

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
you go there you'll be able to find date

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.060 
you go there you'll be able to find date
so<00:05:36.740> I<00:05:37.070> guess<00:05:38.030> that's<00:05:38.240> all<00:05:38.360> so<00:05:39.290> good<00:05:39.590> night<00:05:39.740> and

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.370 
so I guess that's all so good night and
sleep<00:05:40.580> tight<00:05:40.940> don't<00:05:41.210> let<00:05:41.660> the<00:05:41.750> bedbugs<00:05:42.050> bite

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
sleep tight don't let the bedbugs bite

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.960
