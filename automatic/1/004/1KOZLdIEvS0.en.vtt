seeing all around me is all to do with
cars<00:00:10.170> this<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:10.830> still<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.340> gadget<00:00:11.880> guru<00:00:12.090> show

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
cars this is still the gadget guru show

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.330 
cars this is still the gadget guru show
this<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.929> still<00:00:13.230> all<00:00:13.259> about<00:00:13.590> technology<00:00:14.099> but

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
this is still all about technology but

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.460 
this is still all about technology but
the<00:00:14.549> cool<00:00:14.730> part<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.210> that<00:00:15.450> we're<00:00:16.020> here<00:00:16.260> today

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
the cool part is that we're here today

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.980 
the cool part is that we're here today
to<00:00:16.560> prove<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.279> very<00:00:17.940> important<00:00:18.539> point<00:00:18.810> that

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
to prove a very important point that

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.570 
to prove a very important point that
technology<00:00:19.890> today<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.430> big

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
technology today is the big

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.939 
technology today is the big
differentiator<00:00:20.910> in<00:00:21.600> almost<00:00:22.050> any<00:00:22.320> car<00:00:22.680> all

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
differentiator in almost any car all

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.920 
differentiator in almost any car all
cars<00:00:23.400> almost<00:00:23.670> do<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.060> same<00:00:24.269> thing<00:00:24.510> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
cars almost do the same thing the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.400 
cars almost do the same thing the
technology<00:00:25.920> around<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.820> car<00:00:27.029> inside<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.170> car

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
technology around the car inside the car

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.009 
technology around the car inside the car
makes<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.369> big<00:00:29.550> difference<00:00:29.810> big<00:00:30.810> beautiful

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
makes the big difference big beautiful

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.810 
makes the big difference big beautiful

technology with a very different kind

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.600 
technology with a very different kind
this<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.539> armored<00:00:54.989> cars<00:00:55.320> cars<00:00:55.710> for<00:00:55.860> security

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
this is armored cars cars for security

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.880 
this is armored cars cars for security
cars<00:00:56.820> for<00:00:57.059> people<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.840> truly<00:00:58.140> need<00:00:58.620> that

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
level of security and we haven't really

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.750 
level of security and we haven't really
seen<00:01:01.289> much<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:01.949> India<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.309> if<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.489> is

shatter resistant special glass I'm
going<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.430> show<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.579> how<00:01:29.670> thick<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.180> is

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
going to show you how thick it is

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.160 
going to show you how thick it is
polycarbonate<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.530> glass<00:01:32.720> 25mm<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.049> that's

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
polycarbonate and glass 25mm and that's

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.249 
polycarbonate and glass 25mm and that's
about<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.770> thick<00:01:35.100> right<00:01:35.400> these<00:01:36.259> run-flat

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
about this thick right these run-flat

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.109 
about this thick right these run-flat
tires<00:01:37.560> are<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> situation<00:01:38.220> but<00:01:39.030> you're

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
tires are in a situation but you're

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.359 
tires are in a situation but you're
actually<00:01:39.329> under<00:01:39.750> attack<00:01:40.079> can<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.590> imagine<00:01:40.770> in

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
actually under attack can you imagine in

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.090 
actually under attack can you imagine in
a<00:01:41.490> situation<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.150> if<00:01:42.590> they<00:01:43.590> go<00:01:43.770> first

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
a situation like this if they go first

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.740 
a situation like this if they go first
for<00:01:44.280> your<00:01:44.399> tires<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.909> your<00:01:45.030> tires<00:01:45.270> are<00:01:45.600> flat

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
for your tires in your tires are flat

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.480 
for your tires in your tires are flat
what's<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.350> idea<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.770> having<00:01:46.890> an<00:01:47.130> armored<00:01:47.430> car

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
what's the idea of having an armored car

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.940 
what's the idea of having an armored car
so<00:01:47.790> these<00:01:47.939> can<00:01:48.149> run<00:01:48.420> about<00:01:48.840> 30<00:01:49.140> kilometers

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
so these can run about 30 kilometers

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.010 
so these can run about 30 kilometers
even<00:01:50.610> if<00:01:50.700> they've<00:01:50.850> been<00:01:51.030> shot<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.509> hell<00:01:51.540> and

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
even if they've been shot to hell and

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.560 
even if they've been shot to hell and
this<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.860> where<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.070> think<00:01:53.430> Mercedes<00:01:53.700> really

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
this is where I think Mercedes really

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.749 
this is where I think Mercedes really
makes<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.930> big<00:01:54.960> difference<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:56.250> they

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
makes a big difference and that is they

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.030 
makes a big difference and that is they
build<00:01:57.060> their<00:01:57.270> armored<00:01:57.630> cars<00:01:57.869> from<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.619> ground

the factory in Germany

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.350 
the factory in Germany
it's<00:02:07.860> built<00:02:08.130> from<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.430> ground<00:02:08.550> up<00:02:08.940> with

everything that they've done including
of<00:02:10.920> course<00:02:10.979> here<00:02:11.550> this<00:02:12.060> i'm<00:02:12.330> going<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.540> show

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
of course here this i'm going to show

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.910 
of course here this i'm going to show
you<00:02:12.720> exactly<00:02:13.620> how<00:02:13.800> take<00:02:14.130> this<00:02:14.280> glass<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:14.880> watch

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
you exactly how take this glass is watch

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.790 
you exactly how take this glass is watch
that's<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.460> thickness<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.390> glass<00:02:18.800> 25mm

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
that's the thickness of the glass 25mm

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.730 
that's the thickness of the glass 25mm
shatterproof<00:02:20.580> polycarbonate<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:22.110> i<00:02:22.500> think

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
shatterproof polycarbonate and i think

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.110 
shatterproof polycarbonate and i think
that<00:02:22.920> really<00:02:22.950> makes<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.520> big<00:02:23.550> difference<00:02:24.000> and

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
that really makes a big difference and

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.120 
that really makes a big difference and
then<00:02:24.210> all<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:25.110> armoring<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.800> everything

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
then all this armoring and everything

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.670 
then all this armoring and everything
else<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.490> what's<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:27.420> car<00:02:27.690> look<00:02:27.960> like<00:02:27.990> the
