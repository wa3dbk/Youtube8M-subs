a little bit different because they go
to<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> different<00:00:23.130> part<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.820> pond<00:00:24.060> then<00:00:24.420> say

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
to a different part of the pond then say

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.390 
to a different part of the pond then say
where<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.260> water<00:00:25.470> lily<00:00:25.710> would<00:00:25.949> go<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.250> the

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
where a water lily would go in the

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.790 
where a water lily would go in the
center<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.000> deeper<00:00:27.269> parts<00:00:27.599> yeah<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.650> is

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
center in the deeper parts yeah this is

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.859 
center in the deeper parts yeah this is
the<00:00:28.890> transition<00:00:29.460> zone<00:00:29.490> from<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.240> pond<00:00:30.599> out

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
the transition zone from the pond out

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.290 
the transition zone from the pond out
into<00:00:31.170> your<00:00:31.289> landscape<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.949> sort<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.269> helps<00:00:33.269> to
