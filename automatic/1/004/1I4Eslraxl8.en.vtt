00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.790
 there everything is already programmed at the moment 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:21.170
 had talked to higuain and liked 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:23.869
 this item was dug and then in the 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.730
 The time I scored the goal, I remembered him and I. 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.899
 always when when you get home like this 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:32.000
 and it is much easier to give the 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:35.239
 goalkeeper did not come so fast he saw 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.100
 I was waiting for him to give the boat. 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.460
 but when I caught the ball in the middle of 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.010
 field is already in the finished head is 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.899
 it also has our trust 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.609
 when the player is confident that the 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.100
 things are much more naturally then 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:52.030
 If it was the first game were it not for this 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:57.499
 I spoke at the table with him. It was not something. 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:01:00.920
 or dream that I made shortly after the 

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:04.580
 game was even commented to him just 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.670
 have its reality and then the dug is a 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.740
 with one thing I train rather ne 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.900
 the boot in the game that I then train in 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.320
 practice a game by making the player 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.320
 be 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:47.320
 fed tamas, you have to do what I 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.390
 nor saw was 53,000 thought it was very 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.340
 ahead of the midfield after 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.340
 I saw the replay of the video I saw that 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.649
 I was very much behind me at the time. 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.780
 I realized that time was of note was 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:03.729
 So taboo was dead so now you do not 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.020
 said it is not always open in the 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.910
 counterattack 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.910
 so I went and went
