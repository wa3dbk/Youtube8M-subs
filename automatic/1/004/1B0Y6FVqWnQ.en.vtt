I<00:02:21.099> love<00:02:21.280> that<00:02:21.310> movie<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:22.000> one<00:02:22.120> from<00:02:22.299> the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
I love that movie the one from the

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.270 
I love that movie the one from the
fifties<00:02:22.840> or<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.170> recent<00:02:23.590> one<00:02:23.680> but<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.250> one

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
fifties or the recent one but the one

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.729 
fifties or the recent one but the one
from<00:02:24.519> the<00:02:24.579> fifties<00:02:24.940> is<00:02:25.090> one<00:02:25.239> of<00:02:25.360> them<00:02:25.510> ok<00:02:26.019> but

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
from the fifties is one of them ok but

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:27.900 
from the fifties is one of them ok but
like<00:02:26.769> that's<00:02:27.130> what<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.370> think<00:02:27.640> is<00:02:27.700> gonna<00:02:27.819> happen

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
like that's what I think is gonna happen

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.479 
like that's what I think is gonna happen
on<00:02:28.329> 2012<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:29.319> feel<00:02:29.620> like<00:02:29.739> aliens<00:02:30.310> are<00:02:30.370> gonna

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
on 2012 I feel like aliens are gonna

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.430 
on 2012 I feel like aliens are gonna
come<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.880> earth<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.660> I<00:02:31.870> have<00:02:32.079> this<00:02:32.200> theory

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
come to earth and I have this theory

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.039 
come to earth and I have this theory
that<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:33.849> center<00:02:34.420> of<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.540> earth<00:02:34.599> is<00:02:34.870> just

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
that the center of the earth is just

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.710 
that the center of the earth is just
like<00:02:35.170> this<00:02:35.319> big<00:02:35.590> asteroid<00:02:36.250> nucular<00:02:36.519> reactor

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
like this big asteroid nucular reactor

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.089 
like this big asteroid nucular reactor
and<00:02:37.720> that<00:02:38.019> the<00:02:38.110> aliens<00:02:38.530> are<00:02:38.620> gonna<00:02:38.739> give<00:02:38.950> us

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
and that the aliens are gonna give us

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.100 
and that the aliens are gonna give us
like<00:02:39.280> 24<00:02:39.730> hours<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.209> declare<00:02:40.540> world<00:02:40.870> peace

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
like 24 hours to declare world peace

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.410 
like 24 hours to declare world peace
wait<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.560> minute<00:02:41.739> like<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:41.890> machine<00:02:42.459> in<00:02:43.269> the

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
wait a minute like a machine in the

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.759 
wait a minute like a machine in the
center<00:02:43.660> of<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.840> world<00:02:43.959> no<00:02:44.260> it's<00:02:44.470> just<00:02:44.560> like<00:02:44.739> a

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
center of the world no it's just like a

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.670 
center of the world no it's just like a
big<00:02:45.040> nucular<00:02:45.459> reactor<00:02:46.049> just<00:02:47.049> a<00:02:47.170> big<00:02:47.410> glowing

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
big nucular reactor just a big glowing

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.849 
big nucular reactor just a big glowing
massive<00:02:48.220> radiation<00:02:48.519> and<00:02:48.970> they<00:02:49.060> o.o<00:02:49.329> like<00:02:50.109> have

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
massive radiation and they o.o like have

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:52.680 
massive radiation and they o.o like have
this<00:02:51.100> detonator<00:02:51.430> that'll<00:02:52.090> blow<00:02:52.329> up<00:02:52.510> the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
this detonator that'll blow up the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.360 
this detonator that'll blow up the
inside<00:02:52.930> of<00:02:52.989> the<00:02:53.200> air<00:02:53.290> then<00:02:53.590> kill<00:02:53.829> us<00:02:53.950> off<00:02:54.100> we

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
inside of the air then kill us off we

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.790 
inside of the air then kill us off we
can't<00:02:54.609> declare<00:02:54.910> well

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
can't declare well

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.430 
can't declare well
yeah<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:57.060> that's<00:02:57.480> pretty<00:02:57.810> cool<00:02:58.110> that<00:02:58.320> makes

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
yeah that that's pretty cool that makes

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.740 
yeah that that's pretty cool that makes
me<00:02:58.650> think<00:02:58.890> that's<00:02:59.070> pretty<00:02:59.340> interesting<00:02:59.750> yeah

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750
