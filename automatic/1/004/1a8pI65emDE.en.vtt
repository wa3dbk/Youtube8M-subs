00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.629
 It is the question that has puzzled mankind since the Greeks 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.569
 Up to the twenty-first century, we still crave to know 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.679
 Who came first? Chicken or egg? The question would be simple if taken 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.620
 Literally. The animals that bleached were found before the chicken much, so 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.730
 Technically the egg came before the hen. But this question, better formulated 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.140
 Chicken or chicken eggs focuses more on the rotating case and result. 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.279
 In the sense that if the hen is born of an egg, where did the egg come from? Supposedly 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.840
 There is another chicken. Which certainly came from an egg, if who came first? 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.340
 On the one hand we have a chicken team. Research indicates that protein 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.700
 Basic for the formation of chicken eggs, called OV-17 exists 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.289
 Just in the chicken spawning. Without it, chicken eggs can not be formed. 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.980
 So without chicken, technically you can not get chicken eggs 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.350
 But it all depends on the nature and definition of the chicken egg in 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.730
 Primarily. After all, is the chicken egg an egg with a chicken? Or just 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.940
 Egg containing chicken? 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.390
 It is clear that the hen carrying the OV-17 must have come from somewhere. 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.200
 But if an elephant lay an egg and a lion was struck, would it be an egg or an egg? 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.620
 Lion egg? This leads to the other side of the story, the egg team. Through 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.370
 Reproduction passes two genes into their genetic information 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.970
 DNA, but the replication of this DNA is never 100% 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.800
 Accurate and often produce little changes in the new object. 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.560
 These small mutations in DNA over thousands of generations create factions 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.729
 New. But these genetic mutations must occur in the zygote or primary cell, therefore 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.630
 The creature was very much like a chicken (which we can call an initial chicken) that 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.380
 Mates with another primary chicken and a small genetic mutation 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.979
 They had the first chicken, 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.939
 Which grew in an egg. So I took the egg first? Maybe the chicken team is arguing 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.229
 That this was just a chicken growing inside the primary egg. However it can not 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.329
 A mutant would ever form a truly new platoon. Although we humans would like 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.140
 Categorize all creatures into different groups and names 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.310
 This is based on how things are currently, not how they were millions of years ago 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.749
 The evolution process is so gradual that it is not possible to mate between the first two chickens 

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:12.000
 Could lead to the emergence of a new faction at that time. This is very similar to how dogs 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.040
 Came from wolves, when humans began to interact with the wolves' domestication 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.430
 It was not at one point that the wolf had a dog. 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.159
 But rather as special qualities came from selective pressures such as, 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.779
 Choose wolves who were not afraid of humans, or those that were less aggressive 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:31.549
 For many generations we have had very large genetic and behavioral differences 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.040
 Where does this leave us? We have 2 scenarios. Some of the primordial primates of eggs 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.950
 Led to the creation of the primary hen, which laid the primary egg 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.849
 In one egg there was a mutation that led to a slight change 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.689
 And thus found the first chicken and the successively 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:49.340
 I started laying eggs 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.909
 In this case the chicken came first. Or our 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.150
 The primary hen that gave birth to the hen inside is half of it 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.450
 Chicken egg and hence the egg came first. Which brings us back to 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.310
 Labels and questions, what is a chicken egg? It is fairly 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.170
 The question does not make sense, but in the end, what we all can agree on is that 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.370
 Regardless of whether the egg is a chicken egg or an initial chicken egg, the first real hen 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.409
 Came from an egg. And egg 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.989
 She came first 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.019
