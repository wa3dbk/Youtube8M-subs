you have a a traditional garden what you
find<00:00:56.310> is<00:00:56.610> there<00:00:57.150> are<00:00:57.180> perfect<00:00:57.780> rows<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.410> one

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130

type of vegetable and there are a lot of

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.080 
type of vegetable and there are a lot of
gaps<00:01:01.560> between<00:01:01.860> those<00:01:02.250> vegetables

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
gaps between those vegetables

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.160 
gaps between those vegetables
now<00:01:03.720> those<00:01:04.320> gaps<00:01:04.710> or<00:01:05.430> bare<00:01:05.820> soil<00:01:06.210> or<00:01:06.900> what<00:01:07.140> I

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
now those gaps or bare soil or what I

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.880 
now those gaps or bare soil or what I

to fill those empty spaces now the most
common<00:01:44.460> thing<00:01:44.730> that<00:01:44.760> happens<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.690> weeds

do<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.190> job<00:01:47.520> weaves<00:01:48.480> are<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.680> ultimate

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
do that job weaves are the ultimate

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.719 
do that job weaves are the ultimate
empty<00:01:50.880> niche<00:01:51.060> space<00:01:51.360> filler<00:01:52.159> if<00:01:53.159> they<00:01:53.460> weren't

empty niche space filler if they weren't

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.420 
empty niche space filler if they weren't
they<00:01:54.150> wouldn't<00:01:54.450> be<00:01:54.690> called<00:01:54.960> weeds<00:01:55.370> now<00:01:56.370> the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
they wouldn't be called weeds now the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.640 
they wouldn't be called weeds now the
way<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.390> we<00:01:57.570> deal<00:01:57.810> with<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.440> in<00:01:58.530> the

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
way that we deal with this you in the

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.640 
way that we deal with this you in the
food4wealth<00:01:59.159> method<00:01:59.760> is<00:02:00.630> we<00:02:00.870> don't<00:02:01.440> have

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
food4wealth method is we don't have

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.390 
food4wealth method is we don't have
empty<00:02:02.490> nice<00:02:02.670> spaces<00:02:03.440> we're<00:02:04.440> gonna<00:02:04.560> run<00:02:05.040> these

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
empty nice spaces we're gonna run these

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.320 
empty nice spaces we're gonna run these
plots<00:02:05.909> at<00:02:06.540> full<00:02:07.020> carrying<00:02:07.530> capacity<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.399> what

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
plots at full carrying capacity and what

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.000 
plots at full carrying capacity and what
we<00:02:09.450> also<00:02:09.600> going<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.929> do<00:02:10.080> we're<00:02:10.260> gonna<00:02:10.350> build<00:02:10.799> up

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
we also going to do we're gonna build up

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.940 
we also going to do we're gonna build up
a<00:02:11.220> seed<00:02:11.670> supply<00:02:12.090> in<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.750> soil<00:02:13.049> we're<00:02:13.709> going<00:02:13.860> to

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
a seed supply in the soil we're going to

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.310 
a seed supply in the soil we're going to
let<00:02:14.130> some<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.670> plants<00:02:15.060> go<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.390> seed<00:02:15.780> so

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
let some of the plants go to seed so

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.580 
let some of the plants go to seed so
there's<00:02:16.680> always<00:02:17.299> thousands<00:02:18.299> of<00:02:18.690> seeds<00:02:19.140> lying

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
there's always thousands of seeds lying

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.400 
there's always thousands of seeds lying
dormant<00:02:19.890> in<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.760> soil<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.510> if<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:21.840> remove<00:02:22.290> a

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
dormant in the soil so if you remove a

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.759 
dormant in the soil so if you remove a
plan<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.010> do<00:02:23.280> create<00:02:23.549> an<00:02:23.790> empty<00:02:24.030> space

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
plan and you do create an empty space

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.710 
plan and you do create an empty space
there's<00:02:25.769> something<00:02:26.190> good<00:02:26.459> near<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:27.209> fill<00:02:27.510> the

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
there's something good near to fill the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.170 
there's something good near to fill the
gap<00:02:28.100> something<00:02:29.100> good<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.549> fill<00:02:29.850> that<00:02:30.000> empty

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
gap something good to fill that empty

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.479 
gap something good to fill that empty
mesh<00:02:30.540> space<00:02:30.810> because<00:02:31.769> if<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.010> don't<00:02:32.310> have

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
mesh space because if you don't have

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.000 
mesh space because if you don't have
something<00:02:32.700> good<00:02:33.090> there<00:02:33.360> then<00:02:33.660> weeds<00:02:34.620> will<00:02:34.860> do

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
something good there then weeds will do

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.869 
something good there then weeds will do
it<00:02:35.130> for

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
it for

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.369 
it for
now<00:02:36.879> there's<00:02:37.060> another<00:02:37.120> benefit<00:02:37.870> for<00:02:37.900> having<00:02:38.110> a

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
now there's another benefit for having a

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.000 
now there's another benefit for having a
garden<00:02:38.769> really<00:02:39.340> plaintiff<00:02:40.120> sickly<00:02:40.540> and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
garden really plaintiff sickly and

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.110 
garden really plaintiff sickly and
running<00:02:42.010> in<00:02:42.129> full<00:02:42.310> prepare<00:02:42.670> carrying

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
running in full prepare carrying

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.839 
running in full prepare carrying
capacity<00:02:43.629> and<00:02:43.840> that<00:02:44.410> is<00:02:44.590> it's<00:02:45.040> producing<00:02:45.760> a

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
capacity and that is it's producing a

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.839 
capacity and that is it's producing a
lot<00:02:46.090> more<00:02:46.620> now<00:02:47.620> because<00:02:48.040> it's<00:02:48.220> producing<00:02:48.730> a

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
lot more now because it's producing a

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.520 
lot more now because it's producing a
lot<00:02:49.000> more<00:02:49.209> you<00:02:49.690> have<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:49.989> put<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.200> little<00:02:50.379> bit

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
lot more you have to put a little bit

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.190 
lot more you have to put a little bit
into<00:02:50.830> it<00:02:50.950> as<00:02:51.069> well<00:02:51.599> but<00:02:52.599> I'm<00:02:52.720> not<00:02:52.750> talking

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
into it as well but I'm not talking

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.320 
into it as well but I'm not talking
about<00:02:53.230> hard<00:02:53.709> Anthony<00:02:54.400> I'm<00:02:54.700> just<00:02:55.060> talking

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
about hard Anthony I'm just talking

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.990 
about hard Anthony I'm just talking
about<00:02:55.390> compost<00:02:56.379> what<00:02:57.040> we're<00:02:57.190> gonna<00:02:57.310> try<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.670> do

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
about compost what we're gonna try to do

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.720 
about compost what we're gonna try to do
is<00:02:58.510> set<00:02:58.750> up<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.959> system<00:02:59.310> so<00:03:00.310> that<00:03:00.459> when<00:03:00.580> you

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
is set up a system so that when you

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.089 
is set up a system so that when you
bring<00:03:00.910> nutrients<00:03:01.510> into<00:03:01.720> your<00:03:01.930> life<00:03:02.080> it<00:03:02.739> kept

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
bring nutrients into your life it kept

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.759 
bring nutrients into your life it kept
them<00:03:03.220> in<00:03:03.489> your<00:03:04.030> system<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:05.349> you<00:03:05.500> put<00:03:05.680> them

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
them in your system and you put them

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.650 
them in your system and you put them
into<00:03:05.950> your<00:03:06.129> garden<00:03:06.310> through<00:03:06.849> your<00:03:07.060> composting

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
into your garden through your composting

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.800 
into your garden through your composting
system<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:09.190> then<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:09.400> eat<00:03:09.579> them<00:03:09.849> your<00:03:10.390> 8vr

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
system and then you eat them your 8vr

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.039 
system and then you eat them your 8vr
plants<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:11.890> then<00:03:12.519> any<00:03:13.060> waste<00:03:13.360> goes<00:03:13.660> back<00:03:13.930> to

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
plants and then any waste goes back to

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.600 
plants and then any waste goes back to
you<00:03:14.110> comments<00:03:14.590> so<00:03:15.069> you're<00:03:15.160> getting<00:03:15.370> a<00:03:15.430> nice

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
you comments so you're getting a nice

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.920 
you comments so you're getting a nice
nutrient<00:03:16.239> flow<00:03:16.480> a<00:03:16.870> nice<00:03:17.260> cycling<00:03:17.799> flow<00:03:18.930> now

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
nutrient flow a nice cycling flow now

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.050 
nutrient flow a nice cycling flow now
we're<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.230> traditional<00:03:20.860> garden<00:03:21.280> what<00:03:22.030> I

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
we're the traditional garden what I

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.479 
we're the traditional garden what I
won't<00:03:22.629> be<00:03:22.840> fine<00:03:23.079> is<00:03:23.410> when<00:03:23.709> these<00:03:23.890> empty<00:03:24.310> nice

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
won't be fine is when these empty nice

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.180 
won't be fine is when these empty nice
faces<00:03:25.090> get<00:03:25.569> filled<00:03:25.870> with<00:03:26.049> weeds<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.829> first

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
faces get filled with weeds the first

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.309 
faces get filled with weeds the first
thing<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:27.640> traditional<00:03:28.209> gardener<00:03:28.660> does<00:03:28.870> is

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
thing the traditional gardener does is

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.369 
thing the traditional gardener does is
dig<00:03:29.680> those<00:03:29.890> weeds<00:03:30.220> over<00:03:30.989> now<00:03:31.989> there's<00:03:32.170> a<00:03:32.230> few

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
dig those weeds over now there's a few

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.080 
dig those weeds over now there's a few
problems<00:03:32.829> with<00:03:32.980> doing<00:03:33.160> that<00:03:33.400> what<00:03:33.879> they're

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
problems with doing that what they're

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.350 
problems with doing that what they're
doing<00:03:34.360> is<00:03:34.810> they're<00:03:35.140> taking<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:36.370> dry<00:03:36.670> crusty

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
doing is they're taking the dry crusty

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.629 
doing is they're taking the dry crusty
structureless<00:03:37.930> soil<00:03:38.440> that's<00:03:38.890> lying<00:03:39.370> on<00:03:39.549> the

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
structureless soil that's lying on the

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.280 
structureless soil that's lying on the
top<00:03:39.880> and<00:03:40.299> they're<00:03:40.540> turning<00:03:40.750> it<00:03:40.989> over<00:03:41.079> and

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
top and they're turning it over and

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.440 
top and they're turning it over and
putting<00:03:41.380> it<00:03:41.709> underneath<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.400> that<00:03:43.209> soil

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
putting it underneath and that soil

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.690 
putting it underneath and that soil
underneath<00:03:43.840> has<00:03:44.139> got<00:03:44.350> good<00:03:44.590> structure<00:03:45.280> but

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
underneath has got good structure but

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.280 
underneath has got good structure but
now<00:03:45.910> you're<00:03:46.060> putting<00:03:46.359> on<00:03:46.480> top<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:46.989> it's<00:03:47.170> gonna

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
now you're putting on top and it's gonna

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.990 
now you're putting on top and it's gonna
dry<00:03:47.620> out<00:03:47.650> and<00:03:48.010> it's<00:03:48.190> gonna<00:03:48.370> lose<00:03:48.670> its

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
dry out and it's gonna lose its

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.949 
dry out and it's gonna lose its
structure<00:03:49.829> the<00:03:50.829> problem<00:03:51.370> was<00:03:51.579> weeds<00:03:51.970> but<00:03:52.720> now

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
structure the problem was weeds but now

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.559 
structure the problem was weeds but now
you've<00:03:53.380> created<00:03:53.620> a<00:03:53.920> new<00:03:53.950> problem<00:03:54.430> we<00:03:55.150> created

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
you've created a new problem we created

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.629 
you've created a new problem we created
the<00:03:55.660> problem<00:03:56.019> of<00:03:56.200> having<00:03:56.349> structureless<00:03:57.069> soil

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
the problem of having structureless soil

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.030 
the problem of having structureless soil
now<00:03:58.329> structureless<00:03:58.870> soil<00:03:59.349> has<00:03:59.620> its<00:03:59.829> own

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
now structureless soil has its own

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.910 
now structureless soil has its own
problems<00:04:00.510> firstly<00:04:01.510> it<00:04:01.599> can't<00:04:01.870> hold<00:04:02.109> water<00:04:02.500> as

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
problems firstly it can't hold water as

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.789 
problems firstly it can't hold water as
well<00:04:03.489> as<00:04:03.730> good<00:04:04.299> structured<00:04:04.900> soil<00:04:05.169> so<00:04:05.680> you're

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
well as good structured soil so you're

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.009 
well as good structured soil so you're
gonna<00:04:05.889> have<00:04:06.040> to<00:04:06.130> put<00:04:06.280> more<00:04:06.489> water<00:04:06.760> into<00:04:07.389> garden

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
gonna have to put more water into garden

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.339 
gonna have to put more water into garden
now<00:04:08.919> the<00:04:08.980> other<00:04:09.400> problem<00:04:09.639> it<00:04:10.030> causes<00:04:10.269> is<00:04:10.720> it

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
now the other problem it causes is it

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.170 
now the other problem it causes is it
can't<00:04:11.680> pass<00:04:11.980> on<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.459> nutrients<00:04:13.030> to<00:04:13.150> the

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
can't pass on the nutrients to the

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.530 
can't pass on the nutrients to the
plants<00:04:13.590> as<00:04:14.590> effectively

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
plants as effectively

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.240 
plants as effectively
so<00:04:17.540> we<00:04:17.660> started<00:04:18.139> out<00:04:18.290> with<00:04:18.410> a<00:04:18.470> weed<00:04:18.769> problem

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
so we started out with a weed problem

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.849 
so we started out with a weed problem
and<00:04:19.639> now<00:04:19.850> we've<00:04:20.030> got<00:04:20.239> the<00:04:20.359> problem<00:04:20.660> of<00:04:20.989> soil

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
and now we've got the problem of soil

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.820 
and now we've got the problem of soil
that<00:04:22.340> doesn't<00:04:22.550> hold<00:04:22.820> water<00:04:23.120> and<00:04:23.650> we've<00:04:24.650> also

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
that doesn't hold water and we've also

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.710 
that doesn't hold water and we've also
got<00:04:25.100> the<00:04:25.190> problem<00:04:25.460> of<00:04:25.730> soil<00:04:26.330> that<00:04:26.540> doesn't

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
got the problem of soil that doesn't

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.080 
got the problem of soil that doesn't
pass<00:04:27.230> on<00:04:27.440> its<00:04:27.590> nutrients<00:04:28.100> so<00:04:28.580> now<00:04:28.760> we<00:04:28.820> have<00:04:28.970> to

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
pass on its nutrients so now we have to

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.200 
pass on its nutrients so now we have to
add<00:04:29.330> in<00:04:29.750> organic<00:04:30.200> fertilizers<00:04:31.100> now<00:04:31.910> when<00:04:32.120> you

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
add in organic fertilizers now when you

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.330 
add in organic fertilizers now when you
do<00:04:32.389> that<00:04:32.419> you<00:04:33.020> start<00:04:33.320> to<00:04:33.440> kill<00:04:33.620> all<00:04:33.770> the<00:04:33.950> all

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
do that you start to kill all the all

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.520 
do that you start to kill all the all
the<00:04:34.639> biological<00:04:34.880> life<00:04:35.630> that's<00:04:35.960> in<00:04:36.110> the<00:04:36.230> soil

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
the biological life that's in the soil

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.100 
the biological life that's in the soil
and<00:04:36.950> that<00:04:37.730> biological<00:04:38.419> life<00:04:38.570> is<00:04:38.780> actually

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
and that biological life is actually

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.570 
and that biological life is actually
important<00:04:39.740> to<00:04:40.400> actually<00:04:41.240> build<00:04:41.840> structure<00:04:42.580> so

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
important to actually build structure so

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.070 
important to actually build structure so
you'll<00:04:43.760> end<00:04:43.880> up<00:04:44.060> with<00:04:44.210> the<00:04:44.360> ability<00:04:44.600> to<00:04:44.780> get

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
you'll end up with the ability to get

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.730 
you'll end up with the ability to get
substance<00:04:45.740> and<00:04:46.330> with<00:04:47.330> this<00:04:47.510> method<00:04:48.050> with<00:04:48.590> the

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
substance and with this method with the

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.920 
substance and with this method with the
fruitful<00:04:49.160> wealth<00:04:49.340> method<00:04:49.790> the<00:04:50.720> most

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
fruitful wealth method the most

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.320 
fruitful wealth method the most
important<00:04:51.650> thing<00:04:51.830> to<00:04:52.190> remember<00:04:52.430> is<00:04:52.820> look

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
important thing to remember is look

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.260 
important thing to remember is look
after<00:04:53.600> your<00:04:53.930> soil<00:04:54.229> because<00:04:55.220> if<00:04:55.430> your<00:04:55.580> soil<00:04:55.940> is

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
after your soil because if your soil is

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.210 
after your soil because if your soil is
well<00:04:56.630> looked<00:04:56.840> after<00:04:57.020> it<00:04:57.440> will<00:04:57.560> look<00:04:57.740> after<00:04:58.070> you

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
well looked after it will look after you

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.120 
well looked after it will look after you
and<00:04:59.060> the<00:04:59.180> way<00:04:59.330> we<00:04:59.479> look<00:04:59.600> after<00:05:00.080> is<00:05:00.530> we<00:05:00.770> don't

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
and the way we look after is we don't

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.800 
and the way we look after is we don't
touch<00:05:02.080> we've<00:05:03.080> let<00:05:03.290> it<00:05:03.410> lie<00:05:03.650> underneath<00:05:04.810> we

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
touch we've let it lie underneath we

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.680 
touch we've let it lie underneath we
don't<00:05:06.020> dig<00:05:06.470> it<00:05:06.680> we<00:05:06.950> don't<00:05:07.160> turn<00:05:07.460> we<00:05:08.300> want<00:05:08.419> it<00:05:08.570> to

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
don't dig it we don't turn we want it to

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.840 
don't dig it we don't turn we want it to
retain<00:05:09.229> that<00:05:09.260> beautiful<00:05:10.010> structure<00:05:10.580> so<00:05:10.790> it

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
retain that beautiful structure so it

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.300 
retain that beautiful structure so it
can<00:05:11.000> hold<00:05:11.270> nutrients<00:05:12.080> and<00:05:12.410> pass<00:05:12.830> them<00:05:13.070> under

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
can hold nutrients and pass them under

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.020 
can hold nutrients and pass them under
the<00:05:13.400> plants<00:05:13.820> they<00:05:14.210> can<00:05:14.389> hold<00:05:14.660> water<00:05:15.850> so<00:05:16.850> the

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
the plants they can hold water so the

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.170 
the plants they can hold water so the
number<00:05:18.020> one<00:05:18.050> rule<00:05:18.440> with<00:05:18.889> this<00:05:19.070> method<00:05:19.520> is<00:05:19.880> No

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
number one rule with this method is No

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.150 
number one rule with this method is No

the<00:05:22.160> only<00:05:22.460> way<00:05:22.820> we<00:05:23.060> work<00:05:23.300> the<00:05:23.510> soil<00:05:23.720> is<00:05:24.290> we<00:05:24.530> add

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
the only way we work the soil is we add

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.670 
the only way we work the soil is we add
layers<00:05:25.160> of<00:05:25.490> compost<00:05:26.120> on<00:05:26.510> the<00:05:26.570> top<00:05:27.200> as<00:05:27.440> a

gonna mostly just mix everything up
there's<00:05:57.890> a<00:05:57.980> good<00:05:58.010> reason<00:05:58.190> for<00:05:58.730> doing<00:05:58.850> this

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
there's a good reason for doing this

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.530 
there's a good reason for doing this
firstly<00:05:59.960> it<00:06:00.620> gives<00:06:00.950> you<00:06:01.100> much<00:06:01.430> better<00:06:01.790> pest

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 
firstly it gives you much better pest

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.870 
firstly it gives you much better pest
protection<00:06:03.520> now<00:06:04.660> pests<00:06:05.660> who<00:06:05.930> eat<00:06:06.080> your<00:06:06.500> crops

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
protection now pests who eat your crops

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.620 
protection now pests who eat your crops
usually<00:06:07.880> identify<00:06:08.540> them<00:06:08.840> by<00:06:09.320> sight<00:06:09.710> or<00:06:09.980> smell

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
usually identify them by sight or smell

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.090 
usually identify them by sight or smell
now<00:06:11.630> when<00:06:11.870> you've<00:06:11.990> got<00:06:12.170> everything<00:06:12.440> mixed<00:06:12.980> up

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 
now when you've got everything mixed up

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.030 
now when you've got everything mixed up
it<00:06:13.460> is<00:06:13.670> very<00:06:13.700> hard<00:06:14.480> for<00:06:14.750> the<00:06:15.020> piste<00:06:15.410> to

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
it is very hard for the piste to

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.270 
it is very hard for the piste to
actually<00:06:16.730> see<00:06:17.210> the<00:06:18.020> specific<00:06:18.620> plant<00:06:19.010> that

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
actually see the specific plant that

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.940 
actually see the specific plant that
they<00:06:19.400> like<00:06:19.700> it<00:06:20.480> just<00:06:20.780> looks<00:06:20.990> like<00:06:21.050> a<00:06:21.170> jumbled

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:21.950 
they like it just looks like a jumbled

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.550 
they like it just looks like a jumbled
mess<00:06:22.280> and<00:06:22.760> it's<00:06:23.540> impossible<00:06:23.900> for<00:06:24.200> them<00:06:24.410> to

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
mess and it's impossible for them to

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.830 
mess and it's impossible for them to
smell<00:06:24.800> it<00:06:25.130> because<00:06:26.060> there's<00:06:26.480> too<00:06:26.780> many

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 
smell it because there's too many

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.410 
but I have done all the hard work so

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.070 
but I have done all the hard work so
that<00:06:32.560> you<00:06:32.740> don't<00:06:32.950> have<00:06:33.130> to<00:06:33.340> look<00:06:34.090> just<00:06:34.720> read

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 
that you don't have to look just read

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.960 
that you don't have to look just read

plant new plants the way I tell you you
will<00:06:45.070> actually<00:06:45.280> get<00:06:45.760> over<00:06:46.000> a<00:06:46.360> few<00:06:46.630> years<00:06:46.900> this

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:47.320 
will actually get over a few years this

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.040 
will actually get over a few years this
beautiful<00:06:48.130> ecosystem<00:06:48.910> form<00:06:49.180> and<00:06:49.780> you<00:06:49.900> will

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.050 
beautiful ecosystem form and you will

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.320 
beautiful ecosystem form and you will
learn<00:06:50.170> so<00:06:50.530> much<00:06:50.710> about<00:06:50.890> ecology<00:06:51.310> that<00:06:52.210> you
