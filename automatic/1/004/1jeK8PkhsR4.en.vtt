different boxers even this one here for
the<00:01:51.960> younger<00:01:52.229> boxers<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.860> actually<00:01:53.280> had<00:01:53.579> to

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
the younger boxers I actually had to

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.770 
the younger boxers I actually had to
draw<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> little<00:01:53.970> circle<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.570> mirror

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
draw a little circle in the mirror

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.700 
draw a little circle in the mirror
because<00:01:54.930> they<00:01:55.290> were<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:56.130> small<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:57.710> they

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
because they were so so small that they

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.859 
because they were so so small that they
they<00:01:59.399> were<00:01:59.460> covering<00:02:00.149> in<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.390> whole<00:02:00.540> mirror

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
they were covering in the whole mirror

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.179 
they were covering in the whole mirror
so<00:02:01.829> again<00:02:02.719> it's<00:02:03.719> one<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.320> few<00:02:04.469> times<00:02:04.799> where

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
so again it's one of the few times where

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.029 
so again it's one of the few times where
being<00:02:06.000> having<00:02:06.450> your<00:02:06.659> face<00:02:06.899> directly<00:02:07.530> in<00:02:07.920> the

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
being having your face directly in the

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.109 
being having your face directly in the
picture<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.520> not<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.700> good<00:02:08.879> thing

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
picture is not a good thing

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.080 
picture is not a good thing
Thanks
