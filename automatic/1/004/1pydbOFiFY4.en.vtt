00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
self-centered little maggot so that

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.369 
self-centered little maggot so that
never<00:00:59.190> went<00:00:59.460> over<00:00:59.520> very<00:00:59.670> well

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
never went over very well

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.990 
never went over very well
most<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.590> Caillou's<00:01:01.949> behavior<00:01:02.489> was<00:01:02.670> because

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
most of Caillou's behavior was because

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.700 
most of Caillou's behavior was because
he<00:01:03.149> wanted<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.629> always<00:01:03.989> be<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.290> center<00:01:04.470> of

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710

he wanted to always be the center of
attention<00:01:04.979> he<00:01:05.670> thought<00:01:05.909> he<00:01:06.030> was<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> king<00:01:06.540> of

the world
so<00:01:07.590> his<00:01:07.740> bad<00:01:07.979> behavior<00:01:08.159> wasn't<00:01:09.030> just<00:01:09.420> about
