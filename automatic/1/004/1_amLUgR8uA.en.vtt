as<00:00:01.620> I<00:00:01.800> mentioned<00:00:01.829> before<00:00:02.520> these<00:00:03.360> could<00:00:03.659> be

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
as I mentioned before these could be

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.540 
as I mentioned before these could be
made<00:00:03.990> out<00:00:04.020> of<00:00:04.200> so<00:00:04.799> different<00:00:05.190> kinds<00:00:05.549> of<00:00:05.640> wood

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:07.550 
made out of so different kinds of wood

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.129 
made out of so different kinds of wood
what<00:00:08.550> I<00:00:08.580> do<00:00:08.730> is<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:09.510> take<00:00:10.110> nine<00:00:10.620> pieces<00:00:11.099> of

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
what I do is to take nine pieces of

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.820 
what I do is to take nine pieces of
contrasting<00:00:13.139> colors<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:13.650> wood<00:00:15.560> these<00:00:16.560> would

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
contrasting colors of wood these would

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.730 
contrasting colors of wood these would
be<00:00:18.140> maple<00:00:19.140> boy<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.710> apricot<00:00:20.580> in<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:20.910> case

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
be maple boy and apricot in this case

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.179 
be maple boy and apricot in this case
wood<00:00:22.740> glue<00:00:22.949> those<00:00:23.130> three<00:00:23.490> together<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:25.189> ds3

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
wood glue those three together and ds3

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.310 
wood glue those three together and ds3
together<00:00:27.170> and<00:00:28.170> those<00:00:28.740> three<00:00:28.980> together<00:00:30.320> when

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
together and those three together when

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.660 
together and those three together when
they're<00:00:31.470> dry<00:00:32.120> you<00:00:33.120> want<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.329> sand<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.780> edges

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
they're dry you want to sand the edges

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.760 
they're dry you want to sand the edges
entirely<00:00:35.670> flat<00:00:37.040> and<00:00:38.390> then<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.600> rills<00:00:39.870> pieces

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.880 
entirely flat and then the rills pieces
together<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:41.250> can<00:00:41.399> make<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> block<00:00:42.649> this<00:00:43.649> block

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
together you can make a block this block

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.100 
together you can make a block this block
should<00:00:44.340> be<00:00:44.399> two<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.360> half<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.719> three<00:00:45.750> inches

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
an apricot tree river work very well

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.729 
an apricot tree river work very well
because<00:01:00.000> it's<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.660> contrasting<00:01:01.260> color<00:01:01.289> between

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
because it's a contrasting color between

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.759 
because it's a contrasting color between
the<00:01:02.070> hardwood<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.760> southward<00:01:03.589> it<00:01:04.589> needs

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
the hardwood and the southward it needs

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.510 
the hardwood and the southward it needs
to<00:01:04.920> be<00:01:05.040> dry<00:01:06.619> this<00:01:07.619> would<00:01:07.860> make<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.040> good<00:01:08.310> one

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
to be dry this would make a good one

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.469 
to be dry this would make a good one
mrs.<00:01:08.700> Osage<00:01:09.240> orange<00:01:13.850> after<00:01:14.850> these<00:01:15.030> pieces<00:01:15.299> are

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
mrs. Osage orange after these pieces are

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.890 
mrs. Osage orange after these pieces are
good<00:01:15.720> together<00:01:16.759> wood<00:01:17.759> trim<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.150> end<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.479> soot

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
good together wood trim the end of soot

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.570 
good together wood trim the end of soot
they're<00:01:19.140> flush<00:01:20.509> and<00:01:21.890> then<00:01:22.890> cut<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.220> corners

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
they're flush and then cut the corners

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.820 
they're flush and then cut the corners
off<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.240> makes<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.570> little<00:01:24.810> easier<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.380> turn

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
off so it makes a little easier to turn

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.620 
off so it makes a little easier to turn
on<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.070> lights<00:01:26.460> drilled<00:01:26.909> centering<00:01:27.330> holes

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
on the lights drilled centering holes

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
on the lights drilled centering holes

for the tail stock and headstock on your
way<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:34.280> then<00:01:35.280> we<00:01:35.460> turn<00:01:35.759> those<00:01:35.970> into<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:37.170> spool

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
way and then we turn those into a spool

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.990 
way and then we turn those into a spool
shape<00:01:38.630> this<00:01:39.630> needs<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.110> be<00:01:40.200> about<00:01:40.979> an<00:01:41.310> inch<00:01:41.729> and

after<00:01:52.940> he<00:01:53.030> turned<00:01:53.330> had<00:01:53.570> then<00:01:54.170> you<00:01:54.410> turn<00:01:55.090> that

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
after he turned had then you turn that

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.850 
after he turned had then you turn that
piece<00:01:56.510> into<00:01:57.910> cut<00:01:58.910> the<00:01:59.060> pattern<00:01:59.510> that<00:02:00.380> you<00:02:00.440> want

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
piece into cut the pattern that you want

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.880 
piece into cut the pattern that you want
in<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.820> center<00:02:02.390> of<00:02:02.620> this<00:02:03.620> one<00:02:03.950> would<00:02:04.670> be<00:02:05.890> an

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
in the center of this one would be an

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.520 
in the center of this one would be an
angel<00:02:10.270> and<00:02:11.270> that<00:02:11.480> for<00:02:11.750> those<00:02:11.870> edges<00:02:12.410> are

trimmed off those two pieces of it

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.260 
trimmed off those two pieces of it
turned<00:02:14.570> inside<00:02:14.990> out<00:02:15.730> these<00:02:16.730> edges<00:02:17.120> are

trimmed and those two pieces would be

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.790 
trimmed and those two pieces would be
glued<00:02:20.600> together<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:21.290> never<00:02:21.470> give<00:02:21.770> a

been<00:02:28.820> trimmed<00:02:29.390> already<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.950> can<00:02:31.010> see<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.610> cut

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
been trimmed already you can see the cut

been trimmed already you can see the cut
this<00:02:32.750> will<00:02:32.990> be<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.170> cross<00:02:34.300> return<00:02:35.300> those<00:02:35.480> inside

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
this will be a cross return those inside

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.710 
this will be a cross return those inside
out<00:02:36.850> glue<00:02:37.850> them<00:02:38.030> back<00:02:38.060> together<00:02:40.510> when<00:02:41.510> those

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
out glue them back together when those

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.540 
out glue them back together when those
are<00:02:41.959> driving<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.560> you<00:02:42.620> glue<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:43.070> other<00:02:43.280> two

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
are driving and you glue the other two

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.490 
are driving and you glue the other two
together<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:45.580> end<00:02:46.580> up<00:02:46.790> with<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:47.300> block<00:02:47.720> like

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
together and end up with a block like

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.180 
together and end up with a block like
this<00:02:49.840> will<00:02:50.840> be<00:02:51.050> a<00:02:51.080> small<00:02:51.380> hole<00:02:51.680> in<00:02:51.709> the<00:02:52.010> end

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
this will be a small hole in the end

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.190 
this will be a small hole in the end
this<00:02:52.700> these<00:02:53.030> are<00:02:53.060> glued<00:02:53.360> together<00:02:53.480> so<00:02:53.990> we
