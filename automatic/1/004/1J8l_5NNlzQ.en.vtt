00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
place and that period we just simply

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.900 
place and that period we just simply
tighten<00:03:12.000> away<00:03:12.180> till<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.780> string<00:03:13.020> is<00:03:13.170> up<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.410> a

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
tighten away till the string is up to a

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.610 
tighten away till the string is up to a
the<00:03:14.910> pitch<00:03:15.120> we're<00:03:15.330> looking<00:03:15.600> for<00:03:15.780> now<00:03:16.290> fresh

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
the pitch we're looking for now fresh

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.500 
the pitch we're looking for now fresh
strings<00:03:16.950> won't<00:03:17.430> stay<00:03:17.640> in<00:03:17.790> tune<00:03:17.970> for<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.330> first

strings won't stay in tune for the first
30<00:03:19.140> minutes<00:03:19.380> or<00:03:19.590> so<00:03:19.620> you're<00:03:19.830> gonna<00:03:19.920> constantly

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
30 minutes or so you're gonna constantly

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.160 
30 minutes or so you're gonna constantly
have<00:03:20.550> to<00:03:20.610> retune<00:03:20.940> it<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:21.600> just<00:03:21.750> go<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:21.989> get<00:03:22.110> it

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
have to retune it so just go and get it

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.220 
have to retune it so just go and get it
tuned<00:03:22.440> up<00:03:23.209> turn<00:03:24.209> it<00:03:24.239> up<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.660> then<00:03:24.780> let<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:24.959> sit

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
tuned up turn it up and then let it sit
