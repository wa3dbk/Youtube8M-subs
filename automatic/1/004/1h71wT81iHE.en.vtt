00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.719
 bundles through the air 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.329
 working on them without partners you can 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.190
 perform them faster and technically then 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.320
 on the legs, work on the strength of the blows in 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.390
 this bundle do not forget that only 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.640
 well- placed strikes will bring success 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.379
 in combat there is another feature 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.269
 real fight that can not

 consider if you really want 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.909
 to win 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.100
 never put yourself in the same 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.750
 conditions with the enemy it did not burn you 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.059
 gymnasium in a street fight 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.860
 most brutal tricks are used and 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.350
 insidious tricks only with their help 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.220
 you can count on winning forget 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.619
 maneuvering battle 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.149
 that is, a sport type match where 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.100
 wins the strongest who is today 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.210
 turned out to be in better shape and better 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.700
 prepared for fights 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.050
 the street is far from the gym and there is no need 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.179
 try to compete with your 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.160
 adversary and go and always from that 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:25.990
 that the enemy is stronger than you therefore here 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.149
 not until sparring competitions you 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.280
 inevitably lose of course you can 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.960
 afford it if your physical 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.030
 data significantly superior to yours 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.340
 opponents and you have solid experience 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.140
 martial arts but what to do 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.630
 if the enemy is not in front of you 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.060
 inferior or more often surpasses you 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.830
 for example numerically or in weapons then 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.720
 requires competent self-defense 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.250
 art that can guarantee 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.250
 victory of the word over strong
