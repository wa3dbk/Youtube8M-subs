00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
gameplay and I feel that it's kind of a

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.749 
gameplay and I feel that it's kind of a
that's<00:01:43.439> something<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.189> just<00:01:44.220> don't<00:01:44.520> do

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549

playing like a half of a half of a game
you<00:01:48.360> know<00:01:48.530> but<00:01:49.530> anyways<00:01:49.890> what<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.100> was<00:01:50.280> saying

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
is that you know crisis was very

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.810 
is that you know crisis was very
overhyped<00:01:52.950> dealing<00:01:53.100> with<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.250> graphics<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
overhyped dealing with the graphics the

overhyped dealing with the graphics the
gameplay<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.570> whatnot<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.290> perhaps<00:01:55.860> maybe

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
gameplay and whatnot and perhaps maybe

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.060 
gameplay and whatnot and perhaps maybe
just<00:01:57.270> maybe<00:01:57.420> I'm<00:01:57.750> just<00:01:58.200> saying<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:58.950> is

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
just maybe I'm just saying and this is

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
my own personal opinion that maybe the

like<00:03:48.730> i<00:03:48.819> said<00:03:49.060> i<00:03:49.090> don't<00:03:49.269> think<00:03:49.510> it's<00:03:49.630> being

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
like i said i don't think it's being

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.620 
like i said i don't think it's being
overhyped<00:03:50.380> i<00:03:50.560> feel<00:03:50.799> that<00:03:51.040> they<00:03:51.579> are<00:03:51.630> smart

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
overhyped i feel that they are smart

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.660 
overhyped i feel that they are smart
enough<00:03:52.720> developers<00:03:53.350> and<00:03:54.160> I<00:03:54.220> think<00:03:54.430> that's<00:03:54.549> why

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
enough developers and I think that's why

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.979 
enough developers and I think that's why
they're<00:03:54.850> not<00:03:54.970> revealing<00:03:55.359> that<00:03:55.569> much<00:03:55.780> to
