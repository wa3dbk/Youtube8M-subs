okay<00:00:00.690> now<00:00:00.870> where<00:00:01.170> we're<00:00:02.100> at<00:00:02.280> warp<00:00:02.550> speed<00:00:02.820> and

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:03.950 
okay now where we're at warp speed and

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.880 
okay now where we're at warp speed and
we're<00:00:04.950> now<00:00:05.130> moving<00:00:05.700> into

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:06.890 
we're now moving into

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:14.390 
we're now moving into
od2<00:00:08.189> which<00:00:08.849> is<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:10.080> very<00:00:11.870> high<00:00:12.870> gain<00:00:13.200> like<00:00:14.099> like

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
od2 which is a very high gain like like

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.120 
od2 which is a very high gain like like
I<00:00:16.070> explained<00:00:17.070> earlier<00:00:17.220> on<00:00:17.960> it's<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.140> load<00:00:19.890> and

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
I explained earlier on it's a load and

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.599 
I explained earlier on it's a load and
channel<00:00:20.609> which<00:00:20.820> means<00:00:21.650> exaggerated<00:00:22.650> bottom

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
channel which means exaggerated bottom

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.720 
channel which means exaggerated bottom
end<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.230> exaggerated<00:00:25.230> highs<00:00:25.550> even<00:00:26.550> though

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
end and exaggerated highs even though

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.720 
end and exaggerated highs even though
we've<00:00:27.119> got<00:00:27.470> lots<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.619> lots<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:28.920> gain<00:00:29.189> at<00:00:29.519> our

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
we've got lots and lots of gain at our

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.130 
we've got lots and lots of gain at our
disposal<00:00:30.920> it<00:00:31.920> still<00:00:32.399> sounds<00:00:33.360> musical<00:00:33.870> and

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
disposal it still sounds musical and

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.340 
disposal it still sounds musical and
it's<00:00:34.350> still<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:35.250> not<00:00:35.460> fizzy<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:37.050> still

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
it's still it's not fizzy and it still

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.740 
it's still it's not fizzy and it still
retains<00:00:37.829> like<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.670> said<00:00:38.940> some<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.360> some<00:00:39.660> of

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
retains like I said some of that some of

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.600 
retains like I said some of that some of
that<00:00:39.809> vintage<00:00:40.140> quality<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.010> roundness<00:00:41.460> to

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
that vintage quality that roundness to

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.720 
that vintage quality that roundness to
the<00:00:41.820> note<00:00:42.000> let's<00:00:42.570> kick<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.230> have<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.469> listen

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
the note let's kick in and have a listen

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.240 
the note let's kick in and have a listen
at<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.879> moment<00:00:45.329> I've<00:00:45.450> got<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> DPR<00:00:46.350> wound<00:00:46.980> all

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
at the moment I've got the DPR wound all

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.100 
at the moment I've got the DPR wound all
the<00:00:47.550> way<00:00:47.760> up<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.590> 200<00:00:50.190> watt<00:00:50.399> mark<00:00:50.730> and

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
the way up so the the 200 watt mark and

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.959 
the way up so the the 200 watt mark and
the<00:00:52.110> gain<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.530> only<00:00:52.559> on<00:00:53.039> about<00:00:53.520> one<00:00:53.789> or<00:00:53.940> two

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
the gain is only on about one or two

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.660 
the gain is only on about one or two
o'clock<00:00:54.420> there<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.670> ISF<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:57.500> set<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.980> nine

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
o'clock there and the ISF is set to nine

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.479 
o'clock there and the ISF is set to nine
o'clock<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.420> kind<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:01.100> we're<00:01:02.100> over<00:01:02.340> that

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
o'clock so we kind of we're over that

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.750 
o'clock so we kind of we're over that
side<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.629> Atlantic<00:01:04.170> or<00:01:04.379> where<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:05.250> am

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
side of the Atlantic or where I am

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.030 
side of the Atlantic or where I am
should<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.420> say<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:07.170> we're<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.860> American

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
should I say so is we're in the American

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.359 
should I say so is we're in the American
sound<00:01:08.610> at<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.820> moment<00:01:09.409> treble<00:01:10.409> halfway<00:01:10.830> mid

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
sound at the moment treble halfway mid

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.550 
sound at the moment treble halfway mid
range<00:01:11.580> scooped<00:01:11.939> out<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.180> bit<00:01:12.479> roundabout<00:01:13.229> sort

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
range scooped out a bit roundabout sort

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.850 
range scooped out a bit roundabout sort
of<00:01:13.619> seven<00:01:13.920> o'clock<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.960> base<00:01:15.960> set<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.619> three

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
of seven o'clock and base set to three

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.950 
of seven o'clock and base set to three
o'clock<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.640> I'm<00:01:17.759> going<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.000> start<00:01:18.299> off<00:01:18.570> with<00:01:18.600> a

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
o'clock so I'm going to start off with a

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.500 
o'clock so I'm going to start off with a
rather<00:01:19.170> surprising

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:03:05.860 

it's<00:01:26.510> kind<00:01:26.780> of<00:01:26.979> surprisingly<00:01:27.979> clean

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.830 

I'm<00:03:06.530> using<00:03:07.040> incredibly<00:03:08.030> high<00:03:08.299> amounts<00:03:08.750> of

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
I'm using incredibly high amounts of

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.100 
I'm using incredibly high amounts of
gain<00:03:09.140> there<00:03:09.500> but<00:03:10.040> still<00:03:10.819> the<00:03:11.450> notes<00:03:11.750> are<00:03:11.959> very

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
gain there but still the notes are very

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:28.319 
gain there but still the notes are very
musical

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.280 

okay<00:03:29.329> I<00:03:29.360> just<00:03:29.420> going<00:03:29.689> to<00:03:29.750> make<00:03:29.900> some<00:03:30.110> minor

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
okay I just going to make some minor

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.959 
okay I just going to make some minor
adjustments<00:03:30.500> to<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.069> sound<00:03:31.310> now<00:03:31.519> I'm<00:03:31.760> going

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:31.969 
adjustments to the sound now I'm going

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:35.080 
adjustments to the sound now I'm going
to<00:03:32.030> drop<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.840> DPR<00:03:33.439> down<00:03:34.069> considerably<00:03:34.670> well

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
to drop the DPR down considerably well

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.569 
to drop the DPR down considerably well
in<00:03:35.180> fact<00:03:35.420> I've<00:03:35.900> got<00:03:35.930> it<00:03:36.140> down<00:03:36.230> pretty<00:03:36.469> much<00:03:36.590> on

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
in fact I've got it down pretty much on

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.539 
in fact I've got it down pretty much on
the<00:03:37.730> 20<00:03:38.000> watt<00:03:38.120> setting<00:03:38.659> I'm<00:03:39.290> able<00:03:39.739> to<00:03:39.920> create

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
the 20 watt setting I'm able to create

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.789 
the 20 watt setting I'm able to create
these<00:03:40.790> high<00:03:41.239> gain<00:03:41.689> very<00:03:42.469> tight<00:03:42.769> very

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
these high gain very tight very

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.110 
these high gain very tight very
distorted<00:03:43.370> sounds<00:03:44.000> at<00:03:44.150> a<00:03:44.569> low<00:03:44.989> wattage<00:03:45.319> and

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
distorted sounds at a low wattage and

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.250 
distorted sounds at a low wattage and
also<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.239> other<00:03:47.329> thing<00:03:47.540> about<00:03:47.599> dropping<00:03:48.170> the

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
also the other thing about dropping the

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.750 
also the other thing about dropping the
DPR<00:03:48.680> down<00:03:48.920> is<00:03:49.069> course<00:03:49.310> is<00:03:49.430> that<00:03:49.579> we're<00:03:49.670> going

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
DPR down is course is that we're going

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.460 
DPR down is course is that we're going
to<00:03:49.819> start<00:03:50.090> getting<00:03:50.359> the<00:03:50.450> power<00:03:50.689> amp<00:03:50.959> valves

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
to start getting the power amp valves

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.550 
to start getting the power amp valves
starting<00:03:52.250> to<00:03:52.400> do<00:03:52.780> do<00:03:53.780> their<00:03:53.959> thing<00:03:54.139> a<00:03:54.230> bit<00:03:54.379> more

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
starting to do do their thing a bit more

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.349 
starting to do do their thing a bit more
and<00:03:54.680> starting<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:55.040> join<00:03:55.280> in<00:03:55.549> so<00:03:55.790> you<00:03:56.150> sometimes

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
and starting to join in so you sometimes

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.149 
and starting to join in so you sometimes
get<00:03:56.720> a<00:03:56.750> little<00:03:56.810> bit<00:03:57.109> of<00:03:57.200> a<00:03:57.260> morphing<00:03:57.739> sort<00:03:58.040> of

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
get a little bit of a morphing sort of

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:02.199 
get a little bit of a morphing sort of
sound<00:03:58.430> going<00:03:59.090> on<00:03:59.420> but<00:04:00.459> listen<00:04:01.459> to<00:04:01.730> listen<00:04:02.060> to

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
sound going on but listen to listen to

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.000 
sound going on but listen to listen to
mean<00:04:02.540> streets<00:04:02.930> listen<00:04:03.319> to<00:04:03.409> the<00:04:03.500> guitar<00:04:03.620> riff

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
mean streets listen to the guitar riff

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.920 
mean streets listen to the guitar riff
on<00:04:04.220> that<00:04:04.430> and<00:04:04.639> that's<00:04:04.819> a<00:04:04.909> classic<00:04:05.269> example<00:04:05.389> of

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
on that and that's a classic example of

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.080 
on that and that's a classic example of
the<00:04:06.049> power<00:04:06.230> reduction<00:04:06.590> and<00:04:07.370> I<00:04:07.459> found<00:04:07.849> that

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
the power reduction and I found that
