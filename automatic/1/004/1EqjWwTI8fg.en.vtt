00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:27.760
 knitting irish leaf notches 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:30.140
 knit 8 air loops and then 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.090
 skip one loop 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:41.390
 at the base and next loop 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:46.239
 knit a column without nakid so knit 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.239
 to the end of the air chain 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:08.270
 knit the very last loop 3 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.270
 single crochet 1 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.180
 2 and 3 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:32.850
 now turn and we will tie 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.850
 knit air chain on the other hand 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.840
 single crochets to end of row 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:17.330
 and knit the very last loop 3 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:21.030
 nakida 1 2 and 3 column and again 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:26.280
 turn over and we will knit with another 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:32.120
 the sides this time will knit through 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.120
 half loop and single crochet 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.860
 do not tie up to the edge of two columns 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:09.980
 here we have two loops left to 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:15.079
 knitted then knit 3 air loops 1 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.079
 2 and 3 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:28.099
 then we turn to skip one 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:36.260
 loop and next loop 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:40.829
 we knit a column without nakida and further 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:46.579
 knit so to the end of the series in each 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:50.750
 loop on one column without nakida 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:54.169
 we knit them through the back 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.169
 half loop 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:22.940
 we knit at the base of the leaf 3 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:25.340
 knit single crochet 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:34.360
 through the back wall 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:34.360
 loops and then turn around 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:43.800
 and we also oblige the other side 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:47.039
 we knit through half loops 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:52.550
 single crochets 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:52.550
 do not end up with 2 loops 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:23.980
 Here I have two loops left not to 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:23.980
 knitted and then knit 3 air loops 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:33.980
 roll over and skip one 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:41.950
 loop of the air chain next 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:47.660
 loop we knit a column without nakida and 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:51.640
 Similarly, knit until the end of the row to 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.640
 the base of our leaf 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:06.069
 so we can knit everything 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:09.599
 subsequent rows and leaflet we can 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:13.330
 get a different size 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:16.229
 such as we want big or 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.229
 little 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:30.010
 I have turned out so interesting 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.790
 a leaflet can be nibbled if desired 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:35.730
 to smooth 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:38.970
