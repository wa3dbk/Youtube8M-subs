when<00:00:09.420> I<00:00:09.540> go<00:00:09.660> up<00:00:09.780> into<00:00:09.929> space<00:00:10.019> I'll<00:00:10.469> be

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
when I go up into space I'll be

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.799 
when I go up into space I'll be
traveling<00:00:10.980> from<00:00:11.160> Britain<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.459> New<00:00:12.150> Mexico<00:00:12.660> and

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
traveling from Britain to New Mexico and

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.449 
traveling from Britain to New Mexico and
that's<00:00:12.930> going<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.110> take<00:00:13.320> about<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:14.039> best<00:00:14.250> part

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:14.459 
that's going to take about the best part

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:15.980 
that's going to take about the best part
of<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.580> days<00:00:14.789> to<00:00:15.059> get<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.299> where<00:00:15.420> space<00:00:15.660> pains

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
of a days to get to where space pains

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.499 
of a days to get to where space pains
take<00:00:16.470> out<00:00:16.680> from<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.250> our<00:00:17.880> planet<00:00:18.210> seems<00:00:18.419> a

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:18.509 
take out from and our planet seems a

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:20.630 
take out from and our planet seems a
pretty<00:00:18.720> big<00:00:18.960> world<00:00:19.200> it's<00:00:19.470> over<00:00:19.710> 12,000

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
pretty big world it's over 12,000

pretty big world it's over 12,000
kilometers<00:00:21.210> across<00:00:21.360> but<00:00:22.020> compared<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.860> some

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:23.009 
kilometers across but compared to some

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:24.350 
kilometers across but compared to some
of<00:00:23.099> the<00:00:23.160> other<00:00:23.340> planets<00:00:23.640> it's<00:00:24.060> actually<00:00:24.300> a

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
of the other planets it's actually a

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.589 
of the other planets it's actually a
pretty<00:00:24.509> measly<00:00:25.380> kind<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.860> little<00:00:26.040> place

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
pretty measly kind of a little place

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
pretty measly kind of a little place
well<00:00:27.599> I've<00:00:27.840> got<00:00:27.989> some<00:00:28.110> fruit<00:00:28.259> here<00:00:28.439> let<00:00:28.590> me

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
well I've got some fruit here let me

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.370 
well I've got some fruit here let me
show<00:00:28.829> you<00:00:29.029> imagine<00:00:30.029> this<00:00:30.149> blueberry<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:31.110> our

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
show you imagine this blueberry is our

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.440 
show you imagine this blueberry is our
planet<00:00:31.739> Earth<00:00:31.919> now<00:00:32.579> if<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.730> take<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.090> biggest

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
planet Earth now if I take the biggest

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.880 
planet Earth now if I take the biggest
planet<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.989> grapefruit<00:00:34.469> here<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.629> Jupiter

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
planet this grapefruit here is Jupiter

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.560 
planet this grapefruit here is Jupiter
when<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.980> start<00:00:38.219> closer<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.700> home<00:00:39.120> looking<00:00:39.480> at

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
when I start closer to home looking at

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.779 
when I start closer to home looking at
our<00:00:39.719> neighbor<00:00:40.020> worlds<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.559> space<00:00:40.589> so<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.640> is

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:41.789 
our neighbor worlds in space so this is

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:44.779 
our neighbor worlds in space so this is
our<00:00:42.210> earth<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:43.800> planet<00:00:44.160> that's<00:00:44.280> closest

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
our earth and the planet that's closest

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.729 
our earth and the planet that's closest
to<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.030> Sun<00:00:45.269> is<00:00:45.449> little<00:00:45.780> mercury<00:00:46.019> when<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.559> say

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
to the Sun is little mercury when I say

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.520 
to the Sun is little mercury when I say
little<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.280> mean<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.879> as<00:00:48.030> tiny<00:00:48.300> as<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:49.320> as

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
little I mean it is as tiny as that as

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.500 
little I mean it is as tiny as that as
tiny<00:00:49.769> is<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.100> peppercorn<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:51.089> the<00:00:51.239> scale<00:00:51.480> of

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
tiny is the peppercorn on the scale of

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.360 
tiny is the peppercorn on the scale of
the<00:00:51.659> planets<00:00:52.079> compared<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.800> our<00:00:52.920> blueberry

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
the planets compared to our blueberry

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.270 
the planets compared to our blueberry
earth<00:00:53.550> next<00:00:54.420> up<00:00:54.569> we<00:00:55.050> have<00:00:55.079> Venus<00:00:55.920> that's

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
earth next up we have Venus that's

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.739 
earth next up we have Venus that's
almost<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.670> twin<00:00:56.909> of<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.149> earth<00:00:57.269> so<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.539> need

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:57.749 
almost the twin of the earth so I need

00:00:57.749 --> 00:00:59.599 
almost the twin of the earth so I need
another<00:00:57.960> blueberry<00:00:58.440> roughly<00:00:59.159> about<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.429> same

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
another blueberry roughly about the same

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.779 
another blueberry roughly about the same
size<00:00:59.909> that's<00:01:00.749> Venus<00:01:01.199> our<00:01:01.530> earth<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.579> next

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
size that's Venus our earth and the next

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.190 
size that's Venus our earth and the next
one<00:01:02.940> out<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.300> Mars<00:01:04.940> red<00:01:05.940> planet<00:01:06.300> Mars<00:01:06.450> about

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
one out is Mars red planet Mars about

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.350 
one out is Mars red planet Mars about
half<00:01:07.440> the<00:01:07.590> size<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.040> earth<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.520> what

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
half the size of the earth and what

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.850 
half the size of the earth and what
these<00:01:09.570> four<00:01:09.810> planets<00:01:10.080> have<00:01:10.290> got<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.500> common

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
these four planets have got in common

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.859 
these four planets have got in common
they're<00:01:11.040> all<00:01:11.159> made<00:01:11.340> out<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.580> rock<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
they're all made out of rock so the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.539 
they're all made out of rock so the
astronomers<00:01:13.409> call<00:01:13.590> them<00:01:13.740> terrestrial

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
astronomers call them terrestrial

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.060 
astronomers call them terrestrial
planets<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.119> means<00:01:15.360> earth-like<00:01:16.110> volatile

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
planets that means earth-like volatile

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.179 
planets that means earth-like volatile
planets<00:01:17.430> he<00:01:17.640> hopes<00:01:17.850> where<00:01:18.180> did<00:01:18.299> mercury<00:01:18.689> go

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
planets he hopes where did mercury go

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.560 
planets he hopes where did mercury go
there<00:01:20.189> we<00:01:20.280> are<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.110> our<00:01:22.710> immediate

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
there we are and that is our immediate

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.810 
there we are and that is our immediate
planetary<00:01:24.570> neighbors<00:01:24.899> in<00:01:25.020> space<00:01:25.549> when<00:01:26.549> we<00:01:26.579> get

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
planetary neighbors in space when we get

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.880 
planetary neighbors in space when we get
out<00:01:26.969> beyond<00:01:27.299> Mars<00:01:27.600> we<00:01:27.869> get<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.289> the<00:01:28.409> giant

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
out beyond Mars we get to the giant

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.920 
out beyond Mars we get to the giant
planets<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:29.939> call<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.180> giant<00:01:30.630> planets

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
planets and we call the giant planets

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.510 
planets and we call the giant planets
because<00:01:31.110> they<00:01:31.229> are<00:01:31.320> real<00:01:31.530> whoppers<00:01:31.979> take<00:01:32.490> a

this<00:01:49.020> gaseous<00:01:49.770> world<00:01:50.039> is<00:01:50.250> rotating<00:01:51.000> really

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
this gaseous world is rotating really

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.260 
this gaseous world is rotating really
quickly<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.170> earth<00:01:52.350> turns<00:01:52.979> around<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.520> 24

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
quickly the earth turns around in 24

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.419 
quickly the earth turns around in 24
hours<00:01:54.509> gives<00:01:54.719> us<00:01:54.840> our<00:01:54.990> day<00:01:55.200> Jupiter<00:01:56.130> there<00:01:56.340> was

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
hours gives us our day Jupiter there was

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.120 
hours gives us our day Jupiter there was
so<00:01:56.520> much<00:01:56.640> bigger<00:01:56.820> goes<00:01:57.359> around<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:58.649> less<00:01:58.979> than

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
so much bigger goes around in less than

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.190 
so much bigger goes around in less than
10<00:01:59.369> hours<00:01:59.399> so<00:02:00.210> day<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.600> night<00:02:00.719> comes<00:02:00.899> really

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
10 hours so day and night comes really

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.499 
10 hours so day and night comes really
quickly<00:02:01.409> there<00:02:01.859> and<00:02:02.100> it's<00:02:02.460> giant<00:02:02.939> gravity

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
quickly there and it's giant gravity

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.380 
quickly there and it's giant gravity
squeezes<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.590> gas<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.399> becomes<00:02:05.700> actually

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
squeezes the gas so it becomes actually

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.060 
squeezes the gas so it becomes actually
denser<00:02:06.899> than<00:02:07.020> water<00:02:07.229> even<00:02:07.710> though<00:02:07.799> it's<00:02:07.920> made

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
denser than water even though it's made

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.340 
denser than water even though it's made
out<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.250> gas<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.630> would<00:02:09.780> sink<00:02:10.020> oh<00:02:10.670> machine

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
out of gas so it would sink oh machine

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.840 
out of gas so it would sink oh machine
take<00:02:13.350> these<00:02:13.530> sorry<00:02:13.950> flowers<00:02:14.370> move<00:02:14.610> those<00:02:14.730> out

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
take these sorry flowers move those out

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.460 
take these sorry flowers move those out
of<00:02:15.000> ours<00:02:15.180> for<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.420> moment

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
of ours for the moment

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.580 
of ours for the moment
if<00:02:16.770> we<00:02:16.920> could<00:02:17.100> put<00:02:17.220> Jupiter<00:02:17.730> into<00:02:18.600> of<00:02:19.230> hours<00:02:19.470> of

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
if we could put Jupiter into of hours of

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.360 
if we could put Jupiter into of hours of
water<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:21.120> let<00:02:21.270> go<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:22.350> sinks<00:02:22.830> even<00:02:23.250> those

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
water and let go it sinks even those

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.090 
water and let go it sinks even those
made<00:02:23.550> of<00:02:23.670> gas<00:02:24.410> beyond<00:02:25.410> Jupiter<00:02:25.650> we<00:02:26.070> have

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
made of gas beyond Jupiter we have

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.310 
made of gas beyond Jupiter we have
Saturn<00:02:26.970> now<00:02:27.390> we<00:02:27.450> think<00:02:27.660> of<00:02:27.750> Saturn<00:02:28.080> with<00:02:28.230> this

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
Saturn now we think of Saturn with this

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.260 
Saturn now we think of Saturn with this
beautiful<00:02:29.040> four<00:02:29.220> rings<00:02:29.430> going<00:02:29.790> around<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.240> I

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
beautiful four rings going around it I

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.940 
beautiful four rings going around it I
thought<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.570> Saturn's<00:02:31.110> rings<00:02:31.380> another<00:02:31.680> time

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
thought that Saturn's rings another time

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.800 
thought that Saturn's rings another time
but<00:02:32.190> today<00:02:32.610> let's<00:02:33.090> look<00:02:33.240> at<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.450> planet

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
but today let's look at the planet

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.310 
but today let's look at the planet
itself<00:02:34.460> without<00:02:35.460> its<00:02:35.730> rings<00:02:35.940> it's<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.900> second

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
itself without its rings it's the second

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.160 
itself without its rings it's the second
biggest<00:02:37.500> planet<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:38.550> it's<00:02:38.790> an<00:02:39.000> orange<00:02:39.420> in<00:02:40.020> my

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
biggest planet so it's an orange in my

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.290 
biggest planet so it's an orange in my
fruit<00:02:40.320> bowl<00:02:40.590> compared<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.580> blue<00:02:42.150> brief

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
fruit bowl compared to the blue brief

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.140 
fruit bowl compared to the blue brief
for<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.570> earth<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.410> like<00:02:43.590> Jupiter<00:02:44.130> Saturn<00:02:44.700> is

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
for the earth and like Jupiter Saturn is

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.030 
for the earth and like Jupiter Saturn is
made<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.810> gas<00:02:46.080> throughout<00:02:46.470> mainly<00:02:46.860> hydrogen

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
made of gas throughout mainly hydrogen

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.400 
made of gas throughout mainly hydrogen
but<00:02:47.910> it's<00:02:48.090> less<00:02:48.300> squeezed<00:02:48.720> by<00:02:48.960> the<00:02:48.990> planets

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
but it's less squeezed by the planets

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.340 
but it's less squeezed by the planets
gravity<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.490> that<00:02:50.610> means<00:02:50.880> that<00:02:51.330> if<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:52.140> took

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
gravity and that means that if you took

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.520 
gravity and that means that if you took
Saturn<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.400> put<00:02:53.580> it<00:02:53.670> into<00:02:53.880> an<00:02:54.000> ocean

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
Saturn and you put it into an ocean

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.580 
Saturn and you put it into an ocean
Saturn's<00:02:55.530> light<00:02:55.740> enough<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.130> Hershey<00:02:56.430> float

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.200 

the<00:03:01.590> final<00:03:01.950> two<00:03:02.130> planets<00:03:02.520> are<00:03:02.640> another<00:03:02.880> pair

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
the final two planets are another pair

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.230 
the final two planets are another pair
of<00:03:03.240> twins<00:03:03.630> Uranus<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.380> Neptune<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:05.460> my<00:03:06.000> fruit

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
of twins Uranus and Neptune and my fruit

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.630 
of twins Uranus and Neptune and my fruit
bowl<00:03:06.390> they<00:03:06.600> would<00:03:06.750> be<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:06.870> couple<00:03:07.170> of<00:03:07.230> small

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
bowl they would be a couple of small

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.980 
bowl they would be a couple of small
satsumas<00:03:08.670> now<00:03:09.330> they're<00:03:09.510> they're<00:03:09.690> smaller

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
satsumas now they're they're smaller

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.690 
satsumas now they're they're smaller
than<00:03:10.470> Jupiter<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:10.980> Saturn<00:03:11.370> they're<00:03:11.550> so

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
than Jupiter and Saturn they're so

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.010 
than Jupiter and Saturn they're so
pretty<00:03:11.880> monstrous<00:03:12.150> compared<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.900> earth

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
pretty monstrous compared to the earth

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.020 
pretty monstrous compared to the earth
so<00:03:13.320> he<00:03:13.500> is<00:03:13.590> one<00:03:14.190> of<00:03:14.280> our<00:03:14.370> outer<00:03:14.550> planets

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
so he is one of our outer planets

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.930 
so he is one of our outer planets
compared<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.810> our<00:03:15.960> little<00:03:16.830> blueberry<00:03:17.430> earth

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
compared to our little blueberry earth

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.750 
compared to our little blueberry earth
and<00:03:18.390> they're<00:03:18.780> made<00:03:18.960> up<00:03:19.140> of<00:03:19.170> water<00:03:20.070> throughout

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
and they're made up of water throughout

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.400 
and they're made up of water throughout
so<00:03:21.270> Neptune<00:03:21.600> is<00:03:21.690> aptly<00:03:21.840> quite<00:03:21.989> a<00:03:22.050> good<00:03:22.200> name

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
so Neptune is aptly quite a good name

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.900 
so Neptune is aptly quite a good name
because<00:03:22.620> Neptune<00:03:23.010> was<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.310> god<00:03:23.489> of<00:03:23.700> the

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
because Neptune was the god of the

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.720 
because Neptune was the god of the
oceans<00:03:24.330> Uranus<00:03:25.200> is<00:03:25.500> pretty<00:03:25.800> old<00:03:25.980> because<00:03:26.310> why

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
oceans Uranus is pretty old because why

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.090 
oceans Uranus is pretty old because why
most<00:03:26.940> planets<00:03:27.300> spin<00:03:28.110> around<00:03:28.200> that<00:03:28.620> way<00:03:28.770> to<00:03:28.830> go

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
most planets spin around that way to go

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.710 
most planets spin around that way to go
around<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.400> Sun<00:03:29.670> Yoren<00:03:30.360> is<00:03:30.510> actually

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
around the Sun Yoren is actually

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.350 
around the Sun Yoren is actually
spinning<00:03:30.900> on<00:03:31.230> its<00:03:31.440> side<00:03:31.830> like<00:03:32.190> that<00:03:32.580> as<00:03:33.180> it

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
spinning on its side like that as it

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.940 
spinning on its side like that as it
goes<00:03:33.540> around<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.900> Sun<00:03:34.080> so<00:03:34.110> it<00:03:34.320> has<00:03:34.470> very

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
goes around the Sun so it has very

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.190 
goes around the Sun so it has very
strange<00:03:35.190> seasons<00:03:35.840> those<00:03:36.840> are<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.080> eight

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
strange seasons those are the eight

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.440 
strange seasons those are the eight
planets<00:03:37.560> of<00:03:37.860> our<00:03:37.920> solar<00:03:37.980> system<00:03:38.550> from<00:03:38.850> Mercury

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
planets of our solar system from Mercury

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.199 
planets of our solar system from Mercury
all<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:39.989> way<00:03:40.110> out<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.470> Neptune<00:03:40.950> but<00:03:41.940> how<00:03:42.090> about

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
all the way out to Neptune but how about

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.670 
all the way out to Neptune but how about
I<00:03:42.239> said<00:03:42.450> you're<00:03:42.660> saying<00:03:42.900> where's<00:03:43.290> Pluto

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
I said you're saying where's Pluto

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.110 
I said you're saying where's Pluto
what's<00:03:44.160> happened<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.489> Pluto<00:03:44.850> well

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
what's happened to Pluto well

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.240 
what's happened to Pluto well
astronomers<00:03:45.989> have<00:03:46.019> demoted<00:03:46.860> it<00:03:46.950> they<00:03:47.130> no

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
astronomers have demoted it they no

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.070 
astronomers have demoted it they no
longer<00:03:47.280> call<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:47.940> planet<00:03:48.209> it's<00:03:48.660> a<00:03:48.810> dwarf

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
longer call it a planet it's a dwarf

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.960 
longer call it a planet it's a dwarf
planet<00:03:49.320> but<00:03:49.830> not<00:03:49.950> one<00:03:50.130> of<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.280> eight<00:03:50.400> main

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
planet but not one of the eight main

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.210 
planet but not one of the eight main
planners<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:52.050> the<00:03:52.110> reason<00:03:52.380> why<00:03:52.560> is<00:03:52.800> basically

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
planners and the reason why is basically

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.460 
planners and the reason why is basically
it's<00:03:53.580> so<00:03:53.790> small<00:03:54.180> let<00:03:54.810> me<00:03:54.900> show<00:03:55.019> you<00:03:55.080> let<00:03:55.440> me

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
it's so small let me show you let me

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.380 
it's so small let me show you let me
just<00:03:55.560> let<00:03:56.040> me<00:03:56.100> put<00:03:56.459> these<00:03:56.580> poor<00:03:56.820> flowers<00:03:57.209> back

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
just let me put these poor flowers back

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.710 
just let me put these poor flowers back
in<00:03:57.540> their<00:03:57.720> VARs<00:03:58.820> clear<00:03:59.820> a<00:03:59.850> bit<00:04:00.000> of<00:04:00.090> space<00:04:00.330> and

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
if Pluto is a planet then we have to

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.320 
if Pluto is a planet then we have to

probably comes as a thousands maybe a

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
everything move and that is the Sun I

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.379 
everything move and that is the Sun I
don't<00:04:47.400> have<00:04:47.580> anything<00:04:47.790> big<00:04:47.970> enough<00:04:48.150> in<00:04:48.300> my

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
don't have anything big enough in my

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.390 
don't have anything big enough in my
fruit<00:04:48.630> bowl<00:04:48.810> for<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.110> Sun<00:04:49.320> it's<00:04:49.620> massive<00:04:50.160> so

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
fruit bowl for the Sun it's massive so

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.030 
fruit bowl for the Sun it's massive so
let's<00:04:51.030> find<00:04:51.449> something<00:04:51.720> it<00:04:52.020> she's<00:04:52.380> a<00:04:52.680> bit

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
let's find something it she's a bit

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.159 
let's find something it she's a bit
bigger<00:04:53.570> it's<00:04:55.220> exercise<00:04:56.220> ball<00:04:56.870> should<00:04:57.870> do<00:04:58.020> the

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
bigger it's exercise ball should do the

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:10.670 
bigger it's exercise ball should do the
job<00:05:08.449> let's<00:05:09.449> find<00:05:09.780> out<00:05:09.960> how<00:05:10.139> we're<00:05:10.320> going<00:05:10.440> to<00:05:10.500> it

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
job let's find out how we're going to it

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:20.050 
job let's find out how we're going to it
in<00:05:10.830> a<00:05:10.860> place<00:05:11.190> I<00:05:11.720> think<00:05:12.720> it<00:05:12.810> could<00:05:12.930> be<00:05:13.050> out<00:05:13.139> and

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:40.460 

pump<00:05:21.060> it<00:05:21.150> up<00:05:21.300> and<00:05:21.600> see<00:05:21.660> how<00:05:21.990> big<00:05:22.169> it<00:05:22.229> gets<00:05:39.470> this

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
pump it up and see how big it gets this

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:41.529 
pump it up and see how big it gets this
could<00:05:40.710> take<00:05:40.860> some<00:05:41.130> time

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
could take some time

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.250 
could take some time
especially<00:05:42.539> where<00:05:42.630> my<00:05:42.720> pumps<00:05:43.050> just

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
especially where my pumps just

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:54.190 
especially where my pumps just
disintegrated<00:05:49.610> now<00:05:50.610> let's<00:05:50.880> try<00:05:51.060> it<00:05:51.120> again<00:05:51.270> I

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:12.830 

never<00:05:55.200> was<00:05:55.440> a<00:05:55.470> solar<00:05:55.740> physicist<00:05:56.220> I<00:06:11.780> need<00:06:12.780> a

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
never was a solar physicist I need a

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:28.450 
never was a solar physicist I need a
better<00:06:13.020> pump<00:06:13.320> for<00:06:13.500> this<00:06:13.620> one

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.270 

well<00:06:29.460> okay<00:06:30.389> that's<00:06:30.629> one<00:06:31.620> ball<00:06:31.860> Gareth<00:06:32.129> this

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
well okay that's one ball Gareth this

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:42.290 
well okay that's one ball Gareth this

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
one you just tell me if I hold the tube

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:55.820 
one you just tell me if I hold the tube
in<00:06:42.569> place<00:06:53.629> this<00:06:54.629> is<00:06:54.780> this<00:06:54.990> is<00:06:55.169> as<00:06:55.319> far<00:06:55.560> as<00:06:55.590> I've

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:55.830 
in place this is this is as far as I've

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:56.270 
in place this is this is as far as I've
got

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 
got

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.100 
got
it's<00:06:56.610> not<00:06:56.759> totally<00:06:57.030> inflated<00:06:57.690> but<00:06:57.870> you<00:06:57.960> can

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
it's not totally inflated but you can

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.439 
it's not totally inflated but you can
begin<00:06:58.710> to<00:06:58.830> see<00:06:58.979> just<00:06:59.190> how<00:06:59.250> big<00:06:59.520> the<00:07:00.000> Sun<00:07:00.240> is

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:00.449 
begin to see just how big the Sun is

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:02.649 
begin to see just how big the Sun is
well<00:07:00.900> let<00:07:01.020> me<00:07:01.050> show<00:07:01.229> you<00:07:01.289> it<00:07:01.860> is<00:07:01.979> ours<00:07:02.159> or

well let me show you it is ours or

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:05.959 
well let me show you it is ours or
blueberry<00:07:03.659> earth<00:07:03.840> compared<00:07:04.740> to<00:07:04.830> the<00:07:04.919> Sun<00:07:05.159> and

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:05.969 
blueberry earth compared to the Sun and

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:08.839 
blueberry earth compared to the Sun and
even<00:07:06.449> John<00:07:06.659> planet<00:07:07.110> Jupiter<00:07:07.590> is<00:07:08.310> nothing

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:08.849 
even John planet Jupiter is nothing

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:10.369 
even John planet Jupiter is nothing
compared<00:07:09.150> to<00:07:09.180> this<00:07:09.389> massive<00:07:09.810> monster<00:07:10.289> I've

00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:10.379 
compared to this massive monster I've

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:12.920 
compared to this massive monster I've
got<00:07:10.500> in<00:07:10.590> my<00:07:10.680> hand<00:07:10.710> and<00:07:11.250> you<00:07:12.000> take<00:07:12.210> a<00:07:12.419> thousand

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:12.930 
got in my hand and you take a thousand

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:13.279 
got in my hand and you take a thousand
earths

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:13.289 
earths

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:15.770 
earths
to<00:07:13.620> fit<00:07:13.740> inside<00:07:14.009> one<00:07:14.639> Jupiter<00:07:15.180> you<00:07:15.360> take<00:07:15.599> a

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780 
to fit inside one Jupiter you take a

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.170 
to fit inside one Jupiter you take a
thousand<00:07:16.409> Jupiter's<00:07:16.979> to<00:07:17.219> fit<00:07:17.370> inside<00:07:17.610> the<00:07:17.849> Sun

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 
thousand Jupiter's to fit inside the Sun

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.360 
thousand Jupiter's to fit inside the Sun
so<00:07:18.449> you<00:07:18.780> did<00:07:18.930> a<00:07:18.960> million<00:07:19.379> of<00:07:19.500> our<00:07:19.590> planets<00:07:20.039> to

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:20.370 
so you did a million of our planets to

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.580 
so you did a million of our planets to
fill<00:07:20.550> up<00:07:20.669> our<00:07:20.879> Sun<00:07:21.360> it<00:07:21.539> has<00:07:21.659> something<00:07:21.900> on<00:07:22.080> how

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:22.590 
fill up our Sun it has something on how

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.170 
fill up our Sun it has something on how
we<00:07:22.740> could<00:07:22.889> do<00:07:23.009> that<00:07:23.219> and<00:07:23.370> this<00:07:23.490> massive<00:07:23.909> beast

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:24.180 
we could do that and this massive beast

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.540 
we could do that and this massive beast
is<00:07:24.659> what<00:07:24.870> controls<00:07:25.229> the<00:07:25.740> eight<00:07:25.860> planets<00:07:26.190> and

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:26.550 
is what controls the eight planets and

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.159 
is what controls the eight planets and
the<00:07:26.639> debris<00:07:27.120> and<00:07:27.539> everything<00:07:27.690> else<00:07:27.960> in<00:07:28.110> our

the debris and everything else in our
solar<00:07:28.409> system<00:07:28.529> and<00:07:29.069> the<00:07:29.520> Sun<00:07:29.550> is<00:07:30.449> not<00:07:30.719> a<00:07:30.750> planet

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:31.020 
solar system and the Sun is not a planet

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.830 
solar system and the Sun is not a planet
itself<00:07:31.440> it's<00:07:31.919> a<00:07:32.130> star<00:07:32.430> and<00:07:32.880> stars<00:07:33.180> are
