 for 2010 is made possible in part by cz 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 and her sister 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.499
 in this episode of hart liver tv 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:22.590
 the oral cavity express 15 3 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.590
 these two go 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.190
 welcome to 8 7 tv 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.930
 a professional impe camera is talking about today the mobotix press 15d 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.590
 but before we take a look at the new heart first after looking at Brugge 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.570
 municipality of sint oedenrode six 2013 that have namely completed this week 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.170
 goes to the printer and December 20 is in the store 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.840
 and you still want to kill subscriber and immediately find less six 2013 what to do 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.470
 then that is possible until next Sunday 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.660
 register them no later than Sunday and you will have the base on the 20th 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:02.610
 doormat 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.050
 May that live shorter at the central case over a pecker bid xs Dec. 15 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.070
 a test series at the camera the shooting of a few tens of that 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.720
 about this 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.170
 several hundred euros but you already get a special one 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.370
 still blunt it is a strange thing he says professional horse but they with 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.969
 you should think of a plot 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:21.929
 this type of device hangs at intersections on major traffic problems 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:23.990
 newspaper a business stuff 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.840
 and also the issue of calm water and dust proof realized very literally 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.680
 taken by chance to view someone from Rijkswaterstaat 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.920
 have extra attention yes because the neighbors are not that stuff what is there 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.759
 That this is a device meant for offices in particular 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.170
 the cameras of education go but also outside that village says one 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.560
 professional environment yes 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.620
 the special thing about this room and senate is it is not a camera but 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.469
 there are two of them 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:47.920
 and it is also a bad idea what the goal is actually this is also you 

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:51.149
 once you have the heart of the device it is already a logic and the 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.259
 two cables of every two meters, so we switch on 2 cameras and in this case 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.959
 they are two rooms one for the day and so you say that you are not expecting each other 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:04.200
 can take place and that moment changes when it becomes less focused 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.050
 what more often those p cameras do have a stand for the night but it is always one 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.089
 Little help if you get along with a camera can never be very good for that 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:14.769
 as dark as lights 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.859
 and it has been one of the two falls in terms of image quality for years 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:22.099
 well you penny the shoe two cameras in that short speech bike racks 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.049
 optimizes follows both 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.890
 Javaux for both to reactor reactor cameras and a back room that itself too 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:31.250
 green black white I can not color is the right but very sensitive and sensitive 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.510
 So no one has lighting there either, which is not an annual order 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.810
 must pull out and pink dark his name even in the reasonably dark a good one 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:38.889
 to be able to shoot images 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.879
 and he does indeed quite a good but this is a setup where there 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.589
 two years actually used two rooms as one because they work 

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:47.969
 at the same time, in this month where you can, those cameras will also take away 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:51.669
 and i can also choose the rag weekday cameras if you have indians 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:54.789
 a device must be in the meter cupboard experience in 2000 is in addition both on 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:58.019
 to hang from a logical room from a network site 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.919
 device with which two cameras can actually be used at the same time 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:02.259
 we make it look yes 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:06.509
 anderson goal of this camera is this gigantic viewing angle because that is what i am 

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:09.959
 generally the problems that pk maastricht are on one 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.009
 but yes you see a part 

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:17.449
 fall the space fill up the outside space where the room the room hangs for months 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:20.319
 can now buy things I just happen in a corner what the camera 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:21.110
 don't mind 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.980
 this thing just has bad luck almost 180 degrees freeze sets therefore it is already 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.920
 180 degrees to say that is also almost complete with the saliva test 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.350
 If you look at the image of the camera images, then you actually just see it 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.459
 the dog image 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.219
 smart care that you are there that it will be different that it becomes one 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:40.180
 made a very nice image but you can also opt for such a camera 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.150
 for being found to hang in the middle of the room and attractive the fight with 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.030
 the whole space and you can also smell a virtual camera angle again 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.810
 allowing based on it from the part to the introduction 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.500
 Different views bid all directions cannot be on a door however 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.680
 not on a window or 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.699
 think in the short term, grab one or more files 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:59.619
 And that's just very handy to have a whole battery without having to watch TV 

00:03:59.619 --> 00:04:03.139
 Cameras on nevertheless pretty good overview of the room too 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.949
 Get it and if you feel at the US open for a long time if you are in cameras for six months 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:08.950
 plan hangs above the door 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.470
 but i have i no matter where the burglar comes from you always see one 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.819
 rise from positive from left to right throughout your facade naturally came 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.819
 corners do with some distortion even though it is being put a reasonable where 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.480
 the biggest factor that those 5 megapixels you also have if you only so much 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.490
 is still viewing a reasonable resolution 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.610
 Whatever a study then let's get the point that whole field of vision is that 5 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.810
 megapixels 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.949
 and you what I certainly like security camera is going to use that people 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:35.280
 so can recognize 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.740
 who does not pay images, they must be sharp enough there lambert 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.450
 says himself that up to a meter apart gets the real pro recognition from doing 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.379
 of faces 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:47.470
 and then further you recognize people even further than the people where say 9 wants 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:51.110
 You get the high resolution to small things, there are other people for this camera 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.369
 must be available this six hundred and eighty degrees spring but we are 

00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:56.369
 quite a few also with much smaller viewing angles 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.780
 that software that the building seems slightly lower bibob bid series there a lot of work 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.810
 has stopped in just about all this bit and stuff 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:05.970
 jani according to rouvoet 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.250
 why it seems as simple as possible but also that all the options you have 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.740
 but can wish to experience yes that had to do with the paradox that is tricky in it 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.580
 is a lot to set up and too soft is also super stadium that there is 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.010
 what is said but be long fall two cameras case again i know 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.940
 from experience as approving that the device is testing 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.780
 this device is breaking use never got stuck i got it like a train 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.580
 I have to say we are super dead but I find the 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.940
 software delivers a bit of a mix of it 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.780
 that it must be user-friendliness but the part is to blame 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.950
 increases it is a bit difficult to put your finger on but I will go there 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.660
 often with new devices and also with new interfaces and that goes 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:39.800
 also every reason for it 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.830
 but you really needed to get the hang of it 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:43.590
 get well 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.389
 the two men with it also just fine hey and so there is also you can choose to 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:50.800
 some images that are recorded as if they are registered to baltanas 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.870
 or to a server what an obscure but 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.990
 there is also a micro sd card so that you could record immediately as well 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.060
 so your network is not always burdened if you don't seem to like the camera 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.330
 when you are reading and when you say you have a criminal who comes along and jonas 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.590
 research still takes a backup of the van, but this year is precise 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:13.299
 a disadvantage is the holes but with two cables the base station falls to the 

00:06:13.299 --> 00:06:16.869
 cameras with the cable toppers a standardized setting 

00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:18.889
 the two meters you have then you don't have to 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:22.270
 yes it seems a bit better van der meer is better that's it for me too 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.939
 well but you can't order me because abe lenstra would use them so would say 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:27.749
 two meters that they do not survive the strings 

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:28.860
 he was a shame because 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.439
 so actually just have two cameras here and one would be nice for you 

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:34.060
 The room says one in the middle of a room takes you with a nice name 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.469
 space 

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:37.770
 and that goes through that limited counter of itself but a total of four meters 

00:06:37.769 --> 00:06:40.999
 your wealthy neighborhoods goes that we generally do not work and so is you 

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:42.339
 so again two base stations 

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:45.239
 by this year and the extra costs that it entails per year, but that is there anyway 

00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:49.119
 a solution where 5 a camera can do all this and that is of course 

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:52.939
 cheap if this solution with knowing yes susana men was with the meter cupboard it 

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:55.269
 with two years of existence in addition to which both of to issue for something 

00:06:55.269 --> 00:06:58.830
 do or Sunday night set up as what we want yes but what the belief it 

00:06:58.829 --> 00:07:02.599
 debate not cheap as just the exact prices after the numbers of the kids 

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:06.249
 wise forest sale then you have to be at the job station about 780 euro thinkers really 

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:09.360
 limburg and so i can depend on which side are two 

00:07:09.359 --> 00:07:13.330
 dogs 240 euros so it is not so cheap and not as stated 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.869
 really meant for business use 

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:19.229
 and then it is not so bad because the build quality and therefore also the 

00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:20.840
 reliability is still very high 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.620
 yes and if you later occur in the burglary then is hefty but that will come 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.830
 direct wk certainly for store owners start with being able to do something 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.660
 Buying from you pretty sure it works and you like it and break into it 

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.950
 Always the assassination of a fiat who finds out that your camera can actually be a World Cup 

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:34.589
 does not work 

00:07:34.589 --> 00:07:37.469
 and that you will not soon happen again so far the mobotix 

00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:40.469
 camera and this episode of acting for TV 

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:44.110
 many not we are completely awake Wednesday and Friday 

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.410
 the actor must watch 

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.249
 it up for the honor 

00:07:47.249 --> 00:07:50.819
 the union can make a backup of how exactly that girl works on things 

00:07:50.819 --> 00:07:53.840
 what they used to look yes that is very well-arranged and that may have continued 

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.020
 someone who is a lot true and through which a very difficult but if not 

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.740
 have so much experience with it then it is very handy yes for example offer 

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.940
 also a hassle free well then you can very easily if you are outside of your own 

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.300
 network band connect to one thing i didn't have access to that 

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:06.940
 is about the same
