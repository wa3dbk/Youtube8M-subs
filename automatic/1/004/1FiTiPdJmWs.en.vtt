00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
they're fully clean whenever there isn't

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.530 
they're fully clean whenever there isn't
any<00:02:07.439> soap<00:02:07.890> coming<00:02:08.190> out<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.519> it<00:02:08.640> anymore<00:02:08.850> so<00:02:09.479> I

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
any soap coming out of it anymore so I

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.210 
any soap coming out of it anymore so I
kind<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.810> just<00:02:09.959> wait<00:02:10.170> until<00:02:10.470> then<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.979> make

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
kind of just wait until then to make

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.240 
kind of just wait until then to make
sure<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.489> there<00:02:11.700> aren't<00:02:12.510> still<00:02:13.250> like

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
sure that there aren't still like

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.100 
sure that there aren't still like
lathered<00:02:14.850> in<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.209> soap<00:02:15.450> or<00:02:15.660> anything<00:02:15.780> because

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
lathered in the soap or anything because

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.509 
lathered in the soap or anything because
it's<00:02:16.410> just<00:02:16.530> like<00:02:16.680> your<00:02:16.829> hair<00:02:17.070> if<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.340> don't

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
it's just like your hair if you don't

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.099 
it's just like your hair if you don't
rinse<00:02:17.730> out<00:02:17.910> everything<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.630> gets<00:02:18.750> kind<00:02:19.049> of

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:19.109 
rinse out everything it gets kind of

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:21.620 
rinse out everything it gets kind of
like<00:02:19.230> weird<00:02:19.530> afterwards<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.459> then<00:02:21.180> also

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
like weird afterwards and then also

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.379 
like weird afterwards and then also
another<00:02:22.139> really<00:02:22.530> important<00:02:23.070> tip<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.519> to<00:02:23.609> keep

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:24.389 
another really important tip is to keep

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:26.150 
another really important tip is to keep
the<00:02:24.600> water<00:02:24.870> with<00:02:25.139> anything<00:02:25.709> that's<00:02:25.859> not<00:02:26.040> the

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
the water with anything that's not the

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.020 
the water with anything that's not the
bristles<00:02:26.579> like<00:02:26.790> this

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
bristles like this

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.420 
bristles like this
silver<00:02:27.330> in<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.540> blue<00:02:27.810> it's<00:02:28.440> really<00:02:28.950> bad<00:02:29.160> if

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
silver in the blue it's really bad if

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.580 
silver in the blue it's really bad if
you<00:02:29.580> get<00:02:29.700> water<00:02:30.120> on<00:02:30.270> those<00:02:30.630> especially<00:02:31.110> if

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
you get water on those especially if

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.870 
you get water on those especially if
you're<00:02:31.770> sitting<00:02:32.069> your<00:02:32.310> brushes<00:02:32.670> up

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
you're sitting your brushes up

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.210 
you're sitting your brushes up
afterwards<00:02:33.480> because<00:02:34.140> it<00:02:34.380> just<00:02:34.530> takes<00:02:34.920> the

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
afterwards because it just takes the

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.180 
afterwards because it just takes the
life<00:02:35.670> out<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.569> brush<00:02:36.810> like<00:02:37.140> it'll<00:02:37.500> be<00:02:37.770> a

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
life out of the brush like it'll be a

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.600 
life out of the brush like it'll be a
bad<00:02:38.520> brush<00:02:38.910> sooner<00:02:39.569> so<00:02:40.410> whenever<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.580> are

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
bad brush sooner so whenever you are

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.520 
bad brush sooner so whenever you are
drying<00:02:42.030> them<00:02:42.300> make<00:02:42.690> sure<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:42.990> lay<00:02:43.290> them<00:02:43.500> down

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
drying them make sure you lay them down

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.130 
drying them make sure you lay them down
on<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:43.920> towel<00:02:44.220> or<00:02:44.610> better<00:02:45.060> if<00:02:45.330> you<00:02:45.450> can<00:02:45.630> somehow

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
on a towel or better if you can somehow

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.740 
on a towel or better if you can somehow
lay<00:02:46.920> them<00:02:47.160> upside<00:02:47.550> down<00:02:47.580> that<00:02:48.180> works<00:02:48.450> even

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
lay them upside down that works even

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.110 
lay them upside down that works even
better<00:02:48.870> but<00:02:49.530> this<00:02:50.130> I'm<00:02:50.430> just<00:02:50.580> doing<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:50.910> same
