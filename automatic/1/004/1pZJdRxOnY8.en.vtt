00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.739

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.610
 live too to give a little 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.570
 the hand this lack like what I have 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.110
 given in the beginning in relation to 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.720
 proportions of the top 8 at the end of day 1 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.830
 and then here I hope that's it 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.880
 will help people because I want 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.500
 is that people who knew 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.369
 that there was to see it but there is 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.740
 many people are aware 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.159
 that there is a stream we can see the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.900
 final 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.640
 maybe even the semifinal I know 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.080
 more but I think it's that the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.340
 final stages so yes there will be the 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.070
 semi-final there would be the semi-finals 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.380
 also so on the site of konami so I 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.759
 will put the link of this live directly 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.079

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.210
 already people to run this 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.170

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.880
 people who are not interested in that 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.229
 will still be a final even if it 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.520

 still a final with a big enough 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.110
