00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
this is actually going to be a very

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.760 
this is actually going to be a very
interesting<00:01:48.060> aspect<00:01:48.870> a<00:01:48.960> very<00:01:49.200> interesting

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
interesting aspect a very interesting

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.770 
interesting aspect a very interesting
turn<00:01:50.190> on<00:01:50.580> first<00:01:50.910> person<00:01:51.300> shooting<00:01:51.630> in

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
turn on first person shooting in

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.120 
turn on first person shooting in
cooperative<00:01:52.290> gameplay<00:01:52.530> that's<00:01:52.920> what<00:01:53.040> they

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
cooperative gameplay that's what they

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.250 
cooperative gameplay that's what they
said<00:01:53.370> and<00:01:53.750> apparently<00:01:54.750> it's<00:01:54.900> going<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.050> take

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
said and apparently it's going to take

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.460 
said and apparently it's going to take
place<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:55.650> its<00:01:55.830> own<00:01:55.920> universe<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:57.110> we<00:01:58.110> might<00:01:58.320> be

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
place in its own universe so we might be

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.050 
place in its own universe so we might be
seeing<00:01:58.680> some<00:01:58.920> sequels<00:01:59.310> from<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.610> game<00:01:59.850> but

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
some gameplay later on in the future and

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.290 
some gameplay later on in the future and
maybe<00:03:19.980> we'll<00:03:20.250> get<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.520> see<00:03:20.700> what<00:03:20.910> this<00:03:21.030> game

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
maybe we'll get to see what this game

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.970 
maybe we'll get to see what this game
plays<00:03:21.600> like<00:03:21.840> but<00:03:22.050> that's<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.320> more<00:03:22.530> important

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
plays like but that's a more important

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.560 
plays like but that's a more important
thing<00:03:23.190> when<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:23.460> show<00:03:23.640> off<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.790> game<00:03:24.120> it's<00:03:24.330> more

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
thing when you show off a game it's more

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.450 
thing when you show off a game it's more
important<00:03:24.990> to<00:03:25.050> show<00:03:25.260> gameplay<00:03:25.800> first<00:03:26.160> rather

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
important to show gameplay first rather

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.699 
important to show gameplay first rather
than<00:03:26.640> a<00:03:26.820> trailer<00:03:27.330> so<00:03:27.930> that<00:03:28.080> way<00:03:28.260> you<00:03:28.320> guys<00:03:28.650> can

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
than a trailer so that way you guys can

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.530 
than a trailer so that way you guys can
get<00:03:29.130> a<00:03:29.160> general<00:03:29.489> idea<00:03:29.580> of<00:03:29.910> how<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.150> game<00:03:30.420> is

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.000 
get a general idea of how the game is
going<00:03:30.570> to<00:03:30.690> be<00:03:30.750> played<00:03:31.080> what<00:03:31.380> it<00:03:31.500> looks<00:03:31.770> like

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
going to be played what it looks like

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.850 
going to be played what it looks like
how<00:03:32.489> it<00:03:32.700> plays<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.390> all<00:03:34.110> that<00:03:34.260> sorts<00:03:34.560> of<00:03:34.620> stuff

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
how it plays and all that sorts of stuff

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.010 
how it plays and all that sorts of stuff
to<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.130> but<00:03:35.340> you<00:03:36.330> know<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.480> lot<00:03:36.690> of<00:03:36.750> games

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
to it but you know a lot of games

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.360 
to it but you know a lot of games
probably<00:03:37.410> don't<00:03:37.530> have<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.739> lot<00:03:37.920> of<00:03:37.950> gameplay

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
probably don't have a lot of gameplay

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.310 
probably don't have a lot of gameplay
right<00:03:38.670> now<00:03:38.850> so<00:03:39.120> I<00:03:39.150> do<00:03:39.300> appreciate<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.989> trailer

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.900 
it's pretty cool and like I said it
looks<00:03:43.080> exactly<00:03:43.260> like<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.830> Borderlands<00:03:44.459> game<00:03:44.670> in

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
looks exactly like a Borderlands game in

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.699 
looks exactly like a Borderlands game in
some<00:03:45.180> areas<00:03:45.570> like<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.840> character<00:03:46.260> designs

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709

a<00:06:36.569> spin-off<00:06:36.840> of<00:06:36.990> borderlands<00:06:37.500> like<00:06:37.650> basically

00:06:38.059 --> 00:06:38.069 
a spin-off of borderlands like basically

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:42.200
