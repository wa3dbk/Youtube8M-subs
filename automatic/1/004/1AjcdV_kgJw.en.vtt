00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.400 

a<00:03:32.550> lot<00:03:33.210> of<00:03:33.330> times<00:03:33.510> I'll<00:03:33.720> get<00:03:33.870> like<00:03:34.050> a<00:03:34.110> piece

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
a lot of times I'll get like a piece

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.950 
a lot of times I'll get like a piece
like<00:03:34.590> this<00:03:34.650> that<00:03:35.190> was<00:03:36.030> like<00:03:36.330> ruined<00:03:36.720> by<00:03:36.900> the

like this that was like ruined by the
clip<00:03:37.380> so<00:03:37.920> I'll<00:03:38.190> just<00:03:38.370> go<00:03:38.520> in<00:03:38.640> with<00:03:38.760> my<00:03:38.940> flat

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
clip so I'll just go in with my flat

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.330 
clip so I'll just go in with my flat
iron<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.870> just<00:03:40.110> go<00:03:40.260> over<00:03:40.290> top<00:03:40.830> of<00:03:40.860> it<00:03:41.100> just

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
iron and just go over top of it just

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.780 
iron and just go over top of it just
just<00:03:41.520> smooth<00:03:41.760> it<00:03:41.850> out<00:03:41.910> with<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:47.220> top<00:03:47.400> layer<00:03:47.580> I

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
just smooth it out with the top layer I

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.760 
just smooth it out with the top layer I
make<00:03:48.000> all<00:03:48.180> of<00:03:48.240> the<00:03:48.540> curls<00:03:48.780> go<00:03:49.080> away<00:03:49.410> from<00:03:49.590> my

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
make all of the curls go away from my

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.740 
make all of the curls go away from my
face<00:03:49.980> I<00:03:50.250> don't<00:03:50.550> know<00:03:50.700> why<00:03:50.880> I<00:03:50.940> just<00:03:51.180> really<00:03:51.600> like

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
face I don't know why I just really like

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.510 
face I don't know why I just really like
the<00:03:51.900> way<00:03:51.990> that<00:03:52.170> it<00:03:52.260> looks<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:53.160> instead<00:03:53.460> of

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
the way that it looks so instead of

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.280 
the way that it looks so instead of
alternating<00:03:53.820> them<00:03:54.390> on<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:54.660> top<00:03:54.840> I<00:03:54.990> just<00:03:55.050> make

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
alternating them on the top I just make

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:10.790 
alternating them on the top I just make
them<00:03:55.380> all<00:03:55.650> go<00:03:55.680> away<00:03:56.040> from<00:03:56.370> my<00:03:56.490> face

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.020 

so<00:04:11.800> now<00:04:11.920> I'm<00:04:12.010> just<00:04:12.100> going<00:04:12.310> to<00:04:12.400> let<00:04:12.670> down<00:04:12.850> the

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
so now I'm just going to let down the

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.540 
so now I'm just going to let down the
other<00:04:13.240> side<00:04:13.600> of<00:04:13.840> my<00:04:14.050> hair<00:04:14.319> and<00:04:14.530> do<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.130> exact

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
other side of my hair and do the exact

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.220 
other side of my hair and do the exact
same<00:04:15.640> thing<00:04:16.000> on<00:04:16.150> this<00:04:16.420> side<00:04:16.480> that<00:04:16.810> we<00:04:16.900> did<00:04:17.049> on

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
same thing on this side that we did on

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.930 
same thing on this side that we did on
the<00:04:17.410> other<00:04:17.590> side<00:04:17.890> also<00:04:18.340> when<00:04:18.489> I'm<00:04:18.579> curling<00:04:18.760> my

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
the other side also when I'm curling my

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.670 
the other side also when I'm curling my
hair<00:04:19.060> I<00:04:19.299> really<00:04:19.660> try<00:04:19.810> to<00:04:19.840> make<00:04:20.049> sure<00:04:20.079> that<00:04:20.470> each

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
hair I really try to make sure that each

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.410 
hair I really try to make sure that each
piece<00:04:20.709> is<00:04:21.280> nice<00:04:21.489> and<00:04:21.700> combed<00:04:22.000> out<00:04:22.090> or<00:04:22.390> just

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
piece is nice and combed out or just

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.170 
piece is nice and combed out or just
brushed<00:04:23.350> out<00:04:23.590> beforehand<00:04:24.250> or<00:04:24.550> if<00:04:24.820> you<00:04:24.940> need<00:04:25.090> to

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
brushed out beforehand or if you need to

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.390 
brushed out beforehand or if you need to
go<00:04:25.270> back<00:04:25.419> and<00:04:25.600> do<00:04:25.720> it<00:04:25.870> you<00:04:26.080> can<00:04:26.400> because

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
go back and do it you can because

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.010 
go back and do it you can because
sometimes<00:04:27.430> when<00:04:28.060> it<00:04:28.150> twists<00:04:28.450> around<00:04:28.540> it<00:04:28.870> gives

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
sometimes when it twists around it gives

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.450 
sometimes when it twists around it gives
a<00:04:29.110> completely<00:04:29.500> different<00:04:29.590> look<00:04:29.919> and<00:04:30.340> it

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
a completely different look and it

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.920 
a completely different look and it
doesn't<00:04:30.760> really<00:04:30.850> give<00:04:31.030> that<00:04:31.180> effortless<00:04:31.720> kind

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
doesn't really give that effortless kind

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.750 
doesn't really give that effortless kind
of<00:04:32.020> vibe<00:04:32.140> but<00:04:32.320> ends<00:04:32.590> up<00:04:32.650> looking<00:04:32.830> really<00:04:33.370> kind

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
of vibe but ends up looking really kind

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.120 
of vibe but ends up looking really kind
of<00:04:33.850> weird<00:04:34.090> sometimes<00:04:34.560> so<00:04:35.560> just<00:04:35.890> make<00:04:36.010> sure

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
of weird sometimes so just make sure

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.830 
of weird sometimes so just make sure
that<00:04:36.160> each<00:04:36.520> piece<00:04:36.550> is<00:04:36.820> brushed<00:04:37.360> out<00:04:37.570> really

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
that each piece is brushed out really

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.190 
that each piece is brushed out really
well<00:04:38.080> at<00:04:38.350> least<00:04:38.560> that's<00:04:38.740> how<00:04:38.860> I<00:04:38.980> do<00:04:39.580> it<00:04:39.700> and

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
well at least that's how I do it and

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.480 
well at least that's how I do it and
then<00:04:41.200> again<00:04:41.290> with<00:04:41.530> that<00:04:41.650> top<00:04:41.860> section<00:04:42.070> I<00:04:42.310> like

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
then again with that top section I like

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.130 
then again with that top section I like
to<00:04:42.610> go<00:04:42.730> over<00:04:43.000> it<00:04:43.090> with<00:04:43.120> my<00:04:43.360> flat<00:04:43.600> iron<00:04:43.810> from

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
to go over it with my flat iron from

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.020 
to go over it with my flat iron from
nume<00:04:44.440> just<00:04:44.830> to<00:04:45.010> make<00:04:45.160> sure<00:04:45.340> that<00:04:45.520> I<00:04:45.580> get<00:04:45.669> rid<00:04:45.910> of

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
nume just to make sure that I get rid of

00:04:46.030 --> 00:05:03.210 
nume just to make sure that I get rid of
any<00:04:46.360> frizz<00:04:46.630> or<00:04:46.870> any<00:04:47.350> kinks<00:04:47.890> from<00:04:48.010> the<00:04:48.160> clips

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.790

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
like to take my wand and put it right

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.040 
like to take my wand and put it right
underneath<00:05:29.980> the<00:05:30.490> root<00:05:30.790> of<00:05:31.090> the<00:05:31.210> hair<00:05:31.480> make

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
underneath the root of the hair make

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.110 
underneath the root of the hair make
sure<00:05:32.080> it<00:05:32.380> does<00:05:32.560> not<00:05:33.010> touch<00:05:33.340> your<00:05:33.550> head<00:05:33.730> because

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
sure it does not touch your head because

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.620 
sure it does not touch your head because
it<00:05:34.300> will<00:05:34.390> burn<00:05:34.690> off<00:05:35.050> your<00:05:35.320> scalp<00:05:35.560> but<00:05:36.370> I<00:05:36.730> never

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
it will burn off your scalp but I never

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.690 
it will burn off your scalp but I never
see<00:05:37.930> anybody<00:05:38.230> do<00:05:38.530> this<00:05:38.560> and<00:05:38.740> I'm<00:05:39.100> so<00:05:39.400> shocked

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
see anybody do this and I'm so shocked

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.360 
see anybody do this and I'm so shocked
because<00:05:40.120> this<00:05:40.510> gives<00:05:40.810> me<00:05:41.080> instant<00:05:41.740> volume<00:05:42.190> and

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
because this gives me instant volume and

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.160 
because this gives me instant volume and
it<00:05:42.430> also<00:05:42.670> helps<00:05:43.120> when<00:05:43.300> I<00:05:43.330> tease<00:05:43.690> my<00:05:43.720> hair<00:05:43.930> a

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.170 
it also helps when I tease my hair a

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.770 
it also helps when I tease my hair a
little<00:05:44.290> bit<00:05:44.500> to<00:05:45.070> make<00:05:45.310> that<00:05:45.640> volume<00:05:45.940> stay<00:05:46.420> so

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
little bit to make that volume stay so

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.570 
little bit to make that volume stay so
I'm<00:05:47.020> really<00:05:47.470> surprised<00:05:47.830> that<00:05:48.010> nobody<00:05:48.190> really

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
I'm really surprised that nobody really

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.690 
I'm really surprised that nobody really
does<00:05:48.700> this<00:05:48.940> but<00:05:49.660> I'm<00:05:49.870> just<00:05:50.080> going<00:05:50.350> to<00:05:50.740> put<00:05:51.550> this

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
does this but I'm just going to put this

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.720 
does this but I'm just going to put this
right<00:05:51.760> at<00:05:52.240> the<00:05:52.420> base<00:05:52.660> of<00:05:52.990> my<00:05:53.170> root<00:05:53.470> and<00:05:53.770> it<00:05:54.430> just

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:54.730 
right at the base of my root and it just

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.060 
right at the base of my root and it just
gives<00:05:54.910> it<00:05:55.030> a<00:05:55.090> rise<00:05:55.680> alright<00:05:56.680> so<00:05:56.830> now<00:05:56.950> I'm<00:05:57.040> going

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
gives it a rise alright so now I'm going

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:58.890 
gives it a rise alright so now I'm going
to<00:05:57.220> go<00:05:57.310> in<00:05:57.460> with<00:05:57.580> my<00:05:57.760> teasing<00:05:58.060> comb<00:05:58.240> I<00:05:58.690> guess

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
to go in with my teasing comb I guess

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.830 
to go in with my teasing comb I guess
this<00:05:59.080> is<00:05:59.230> technically<00:05:59.620> a<00:05:59.740> teasing<00:06:00.430> brush<00:06:01.180> but

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
this is technically a teasing brush but

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.900 
this is technically a teasing brush but
I'm<00:06:02.110> gonna<00:06:02.260> go<00:06:02.410> in<00:06:02.650> and<00:06:02.860> just<00:06:03.070> tease<00:06:03.400> the<00:06:03.610> areas

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
I'm gonna go in and just tease the areas

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.180 
I'm gonna go in and just tease the areas
that<00:06:03.940> we<00:06:04.150> went<00:06:04.720> in<00:06:04.840> with<00:06:05.020> that<00:06:05.230> curling<00:06:05.950> wand

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
that we went in with that curling wand

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:12.470 
that we went in with that curling wand
with<00:06:06.550> right<00:06:07.450> at<00:06:07.630> the<00:06:07.810> root<00:06:07.990> so<00:06:08.350> right<00:06:08.680> here

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:20.120 

back<00:06:13.480> here

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.770 

and<00:06:20.340> right<00:06:21.000> at<00:06:21.300> the<00:06:22.200> other<00:06:22.410> side<00:06:22.770> I<00:06:23.570> rarely<00:06:24.570> use

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
and right at the other side I rarely use

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.750 
and right at the other side I rarely use
hairspray<00:06:25.440> just<00:06:25.470> because<00:06:26.010> with<00:06:26.310> the<00:06:26.430> curling

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
hairspray just because with the curling

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.670 
hairspray just because with the curling
wand<00:06:26.820> that<00:06:27.210> I<00:06:27.240> use<00:06:27.450> it<00:06:27.750> really<00:06:28.170> helps<00:06:28.410> it<00:06:28.560> so

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
wand that I use it really helps it so

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.280 
wand that I use it really helps it so
that<00:06:28.860> they<00:06:29.100> stay<00:06:29.460> all<00:06:29.730> day<00:06:29.760> long<00:06:30.120> and<00:06:30.960> even

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.290 
that they stay all day long and even

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.570 
that they stay all day long and even
into<00:06:31.560> like<00:06:31.710> the<00:06:31.890> next<00:06:32.160> couple<00:06:32.400> of<00:06:32.460> days
