I reviewed but of all of them out of
these<00:02:16.390> probably<00:02:17.170> wipeout<00:02:17.799> 2048<00:02:18.299> stands<00:02:19.299> out

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
these probably wipeout 2048 stands out

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.600 
these probably wipeout 2048 stands out
for<00:02:19.689> me<00:02:19.750> graphically<00:02:20.530> superior<00:02:21.189> to<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.459> other

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
for me graphically superior to the other

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.670 
for me graphically superior to the other
games<00:02:21.849> I've<00:02:22.090> been<00:02:22.239> playing<00:02:22.510> also<00:02:23.379> little

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
games I've been playing also little

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.220 
games I've been playing also little
deviants<00:02:24.310> I've<00:02:25.209> been<00:02:25.450> playing<00:02:25.750> that<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:25.959> little

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
deviants I've been playing that a little

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.350 
deviants I've been playing that a little
bit<00:02:26.349> and<00:02:26.560> I<00:02:26.620> like<00:02:26.650> little<00:02:27.579> deviants<00:02:28.060> because

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
bit and I like little deviants because

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.440 
bit and I like little deviants because
it<00:02:28.450> uses<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:29.409> rear<00:02:30.129> touchpad<00:02:30.489> on<00:02:30.909> the<00:02:31.150> device

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
it uses the rear touchpad on the device

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.180 
it uses the rear touchpad on the device
so<00:02:31.810> it's<00:02:31.959> one<00:02:32.110> of<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.260> few<00:02:32.470> games<00:02:32.650> that<00:02:32.860> really

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
so it's one of the few games that really

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.420 
so it's one of the few games that really
does<00:02:33.340> utilize<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:34.150> rear<00:02:34.360> touchpad<00:02:34.659> a<00:02:34.930> lot

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
does utilize the rear touchpad a lot

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.970 
does utilize the rear touchpad a lot
also<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:37.000> surprise<00:02:37.569> to<00:02:37.959> me<00:02:38.079> was<00:02:38.290> Super<00:02:38.680> Stardust

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980

right<00:03:52.180> here<00:03:52.599> it<00:03:53.169> hasn't<00:03:53.470> been<00:03:53.849> fantastic<00:03:54.849> but

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
right here it hasn't been fantastic but

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.210 
right here it hasn't been fantastic but

any specifications on it yet

any specifications on it yet
but<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:30.830> fact<00:04:31.040> that<00:04:31.100> they're<00:04:31.310> working<00:04:31.460> on<00:04:31.760> one

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
but the fact that they're working on one

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.400 
but the fact that they're working on one
really<00:04:32.240> does<00:04:32.480> show<00:04:32.750> that<00:04:32.900> this<00:04:33.020> does<00:04:33.260> a

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
really does show that this does a

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.950 
really does show that this does a
battery<00:04:33.980> a<00:04:34.160> lot<00:04:34.730> quicker<00:04:35.030> than<00:04:35.330> one<00:04:35.750> would

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
battery a lot quicker than one would

battery a lot quicker than one would
really<00:04:36.500> like<00:04:36.770> it<00:04:37.040> to<00:04:37.300> the<00:04:38.300> build<00:04:38.660> quality<00:04:38.810> well

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
really like it to the build quality well

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.490 
really like it to the build quality well
very<00:04:40.130> very<00:04:40.400> nice<00:04:40.610> build<00:04:40.910> quality<00:04:41.230> loving<00:04:42.230> the

very very nice build quality loving the

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.010 
very very nice build quality loving the
sort<00:04:43.070> of<00:04:43.130> metal<00:04:43.610> feel<00:04:43.880> to<00:04:44.120> the<00:04:44.300> outside<00:04:44.840> I'm

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
sort of metal feel to the outside I'm

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.110 
sort of metal feel to the outside I'm
not<00:04:45.140> sure<00:04:45.290> if<00:04:45.410> it<00:04:45.530> is<00:04:45.560> actually<00:04:46.040> metal<00:04:46.280> but<00:04:47.000> it

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
not sure if it is actually metal but it

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.330 
not sure if it is actually metal but it
certainly<00:04:47.330> feels<00:04:47.720> very<00:04:48.140> well-made<00:04:48.620> under

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
certainly feels very well-made under

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.400 
certainly feels very well-made under
here<00:04:49.550> this<00:04:49.730> hides<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.330> sort<00:04:50.540> of<00:04:50.660> them<00:04:50.900> the

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
here this hides the sort of them the

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.770 
here this hides the sort of them the
game<00:04:51.620> cards<00:04:52.190> and<00:04:52.430> various<00:04:52.910> slots<00:04:53.240> we've<00:04:53.600> got

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
game cards and various slots we've got

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.950 
game cards and various slots we've got
extra<00:04:54.140> slots<00:04:54.470> on<00:04:54.830> the<00:04:55.730> underside<00:04:56.390> here<00:04:56.420> we've

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
extra slots on the underside here we've

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.620 
extra slots on the underside here we've
got<00:04:57.110> another<00:04:57.410> slot<00:04:57.800> on<00:04:57.980> this<00:04:58.190> side<00:04:58.490> here<00:04:59.300> for

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
got another slot on this side here for

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.370 
got another slot on this side here for
the<00:04:59.690> SIM<00:04:59.930> card

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
the SIM card

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.200 
the SIM card
I<00:05:00.500> think<00:05:00.770> the<00:05:00.830> SIM<00:05:01.010> card<00:05:01.040> goes<00:05:01.460> in<00:05:01.670> there<00:05:01.850> this

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
I think the SIM card goes in there this

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.060 
I think the SIM card goes in there this
is<00:05:02.420> for<00:05:02.600> the<00:05:02.660> memory<00:05:02.870> card<00:05:03.290> and<00:05:03.530> then<00:05:03.980> we've

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
is for the memory card and then we've

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.650 
is for the memory card and then we've
got<00:05:04.160> like<00:05:04.340> the<00:05:04.460> charging<00:05:04.940> port<00:05:05.150> here<00:05:05.480> and<00:05:05.510> a

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
got like the charging port here and a

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.690 
got like the charging port here and a
headphone<00:05:05.870> jack<00:05:06.380> so<00:05:06.620> everything<00:05:07.370> really

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
headphone jack so everything really

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.210 
headphone jack so everything really
nicely<00:05:08.150> positioned<00:05:08.540> and<00:05:09.140> it<00:05:09.620> feels<00:05:09.830> like<00:05:10.010> just

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
nicely positioned and it feels like just

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.990 
nicely positioned and it feels like just
a<00:05:10.370> good<00:05:10.670> quality<00:05:11.420> console<00:05:12.280> performance<00:05:13.280> well

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
a good quality console performance well

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.550 
a good quality console performance well
you<00:05:14.270> can<00:05:14.450> see<00:05:14.630> that<00:05:14.660> when<00:05:15.050> I've<00:05:15.170> been<00:05:15.320> playing

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
you can see that when I've been playing
