00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.910
 Hello and welcome to Wiesbaden Sport Nia Künzer is today 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.820
 our guest she the ambassador of the country Hessen for the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.840
 women's football world cup to celebrate the event in the sport year 2011 Nier 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.940
 get involved in the football World Cup 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.640
 yes absolutely but now I'm going to finally start m long 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.170
 many done that he calls it Unterzeil beds good tournament by that 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.700
 it can start right 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.980
 What impresses them most of the so-called hype of now with the World Cup 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.040
 starts the performance of our German national team or the 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.540
 is a beautiful summer fairy tale will 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.420
 It all fits together well as it impresses me already 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.480
 meanwhile he also television print media radio to no longer am 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.750
 Women's football is coming around 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.270
 but something like that awaits 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.780
 that is also about to come true that should surprise me and the 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.890
 German team 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.340
 she is just very good at percent 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.980
 which of course makes me happy because I'm already here at the finals 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.340
 German participation hope 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.960
 and they say they expected you where you could fix that 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.620
 that it will happen 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.130
 Nelson injured one of the fans 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.130
 Almost ten years ago an insane development was adopted 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.159
 in itself but you have to say so is a World Cup in your own country 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.630
 always something special and bands at the World Cup so big title 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.010
 It is simply German sports enthusiasm 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.760
 and in case of doubt, all the media behind it to just this tournament 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.620
 what has the Bundesliga to do to make it successful? 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.620
 Upswing in women's football can benefit 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.150
 because in fact two different things I think that even the 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.830
 Bundesliga has made progress in recent years as well 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.130
 Percent some teams have come closer together for me 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.570
 It would be important that more teams still fit on it in a work that way 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.000
 percent means the conditions are professional too, of course 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.770
 the media want to report that sponsors enter into partnerships 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.299
 because the clubs already have to work a lot on themselves 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.429
 around and hopes that they just take the momentum and percent 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:22.089
 who take the momentum of the World Cup and see what's possible, of course 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:24.479
 small squares and in smaller steps 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:28.949
 but it is very much possible if you show the initiative what you want 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:32.259
 in the finals which pairing and 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:35.259
 yes, how is your final ticket? 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.419
 I could well imagine the food is 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:41.869
 Final Germany Percent Brazil There is of course a dream too 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:44.869
 Germany only Sar he who of course super beautiful 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:49.029
 and then of course I hope that food 2 1 for Germany 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.359
 Klara tip from Nia Künzer her experts would be the football World Cup 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:55.619
