00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.059 

okay<00:00:01.230> what<00:00:01.439> I'm<00:00:01.530> showing<00:00:01.770> you<00:00:01.949> here<00:00:02.100> is<00:00:04.069> people

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
okay what I'm showing you here is people

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.190 
okay what I'm showing you here is people
were<00:00:05.220> asking<00:00:05.700> about<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:08.630> radiant<00:00:09.630> oscillator

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
were asking about the radiant oscillator

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.749 
were asking about the radiant oscillator
tubes<00:00:11.330> that<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.450> did<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.660> while<00:00:12.929> back<00:00:13.519> these<00:00:14.519> are

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
tubes that I did a while back these are

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.960 
tubes that I did a while back these are
built<00:00:15.389> into<00:00:15.630> an<00:00:15.990> mg<00:00:16.760> 1502<00:00:17.760> fourth<00:00:18.650> transistor

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
built into an mg 1502 fourth transistor

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.790 
built into an mg 1502 fourth transistor
and<00:00:21.920> i'm<00:00:22.920> going<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.189> show<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.340> one<00:00:23.609> run<00:00:23.850> here

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
and i'm going to show you one run here

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:32.120 
and i'm going to show you one run here
so<00:00:25.800> i'm<00:00:25.980> going<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.310> show<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.269> supply

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:42.670 

and<00:00:32.640> let's<00:00:33.630> be<00:00:33.870> here

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:59.440 

and<00:00:43.220> get<00:00:43.430> this<00:00:43.580> thing<00:00:43.640> to<00:00:44.000> work<00:00:44.030> here

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:05.100 

okay<00:01:00.020> so<00:01:00.080> there's<00:01:00.470> the<00:01:00.710> waveform

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.580 

on<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:05.920> oscillator

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.569 

and<00:01:09.100> I<00:01:09.250> can<00:01:09.429> adjust<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:10.000> voltage<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:12.310> we're<00:01:12.460> at

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:12.579 
and I can adjust the voltage so we're at

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:15.179 
and I can adjust the voltage so we're at
a<00:01:12.609> half<00:01:12.909> a<00:01:13.090> half<00:01:13.329> right<00:01:13.630> now<00:01:13.869> which<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:14.979> tube

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
a half a half right now which the tube

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.719 
a half a half right now which the tube
is<00:01:15.369> designed<00:01:15.789> to<00:01:15.969> do<00:01:16.679> and<00:01:17.679> we're<00:01:18.159> at<00:01:18.250> Tim<00:01:18.490> bolt

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
is designed to do and we're at Tim bolt

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.380 
is designed to do and we're at Tim bolt
so<00:01:18.909> there's<00:01:19.119> 12<00:01:19.479> volts<00:01:20.759> okay<00:01:21.759> so<00:01:21.819> we're<00:01:22.090> just<00:01:22.119> a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
so there's 12 volts okay so we're just a

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.569 
so there's 12 volts okay so we're just a
little<00:01:22.420> bit<00:01:22.750> over<00:01:22.990> half<00:01:23.229> half<00:01:23.500> there's<00:01:24.340> the

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
little bit over half half there's the

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:30.050 
little bit over half half there's the
waveform

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.960 

and<00:01:30.659> there's<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.200> battery<00:01:31.560> going<00:01:31.860> up<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.939> I

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
and there's the battery going up so I

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.819 
and there's the battery going up so I
don't<00:01:33.390> understand<00:01:35.240> why<00:01:36.240> people<00:01:36.869> are<00:01:37.710> having

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
don't understand why people are having

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.800 
don't understand why people are having
such<00:01:38.189> trouble<00:01:39.289> making<00:01:40.289> the<00:01:40.409> oscillators<00:01:41.070> work

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
such trouble making the oscillators work

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.719 
such trouble making the oscillators work
to<00:01:42.810> charge<00:01:43.110> batteries<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:43.829> anyway<00:01:44.100> here's<00:01:44.579> an

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
to charge batteries but anyway here's an

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.429 
to charge batteries but anyway here's an
explanation<00:01:45.090> but<00:01:45.479> anyway<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.140> tube

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
explanation but anyway this is the tube

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:53.060 
explanation but anyway this is the tube
and<00:01:47.340> it's<00:01:48.000> built<00:01:48.330> in<00:01:50.299> to<00:01:51.299> this<00:01:51.479> MJ<00:01:52.049> 1502<00:01:52.590> for

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
and it's built in to this MJ 1502 for

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.679 
and it's built in to this MJ 1502 for
transistor<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:55.320> can<00:01:55.530> see<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:56.179> on<00:01:57.179> the

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
transistor and you can see that on the

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.679 
transistor and you can see that on the
wave<00:01:58.039> form<00:01:59.039> that<00:01:59.520> it's<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.939> oscillator<00:02:00.539> and

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
wave form that it's the oscillator and

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.160 
wave form that it's the oscillator and
then<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.140> through<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:01.770> diode<00:02:02.929> it's<00:02:03.929> hooked

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
then it's through this diode it's hooked

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.350 
then it's through this diode it's hooked
up<00:02:04.350> just<00:02:04.590> like<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.950> SG<00:02:05.369> circuit<00:02:06.920> so<00:02:08.330> here<00:02:09.330> we

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
up just like the SG circuit so here we

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.999 
up just like the SG circuit so here we
go<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.810> can<00:02:09.959> see<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.200> batteries<00:02:10.769> going

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
go and you can see the batteries going

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.570 
go and you can see the batteries going
on<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:13.200> takes<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.650> while<00:02:13.799> because<00:02:13.980> it's<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.370> dead

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
on it takes a while because it's a dead

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.880 
on it takes a while because it's a dead
battery<00:02:14.880> but<00:02:15.239> you<00:02:15.390> can<00:02:15.510> see<00:02:15.660> moving<00:02:15.989> up

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.660 

that's<00:02:22.520> actually<00:02:22.760> pretty<00:02:23.180> quick<00:02:24.100> so<00:02:25.100> actually

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
that's actually pretty quick so actually

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.820 
that's actually pretty quick so actually
when<00:02:26.060> I<00:02:26.120> developed<00:02:26.690> this<00:02:26.840> for<00:02:27.170> was<00:02:27.410> for<00:02:27.440> the

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
when I developed this for was for the

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.150 
when I developed this for was for the
solar<00:02:28.130> panels<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.260> they<00:02:30.590> would<00:02:30.740> work<00:02:30.950> in

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
solar panels so that they would work in

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.809 
solar panels so that they would work in
low<00:02:31.370> light<00:02:32.830> and<00:02:35.680> i'll<00:02:36.680> be<00:02:36.860> talking<00:02:36.890> about<00:02:37.400> this

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
low light and i'll be talking about this

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:45.120 
low light and i'll be talking about this
more<00:02:39.940> on<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.180> energetics<00:02:41.810> form<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:44.390> on<00:02:44.720> the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
more on the energetics form and on the

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.010 
more on the energetics form and on the
science<00:02:46.130> forum<00:02:46.459> i<00:02:46.730> did<00:02:47.209> talk<00:02:47.420> about<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.840> on<00:02:47.959> the

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
science forum i did talk about it on the

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.229 
science forum i did talk about it on the
energetics<00:02:48.709> warm<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.630> i've<00:02:50.630> moved<00:02:50.989> to<00:02:51.350> the

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
energetics warm and i've moved to the

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.740 
energetics warm and i've moved to the
energy<00:02:53.239> science<00:02:53.660> forum<00:02:53.989> so<00:02:54.290> that's<00:02:54.500> my<00:02:54.739> home

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
energy science forum so that's my home

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.270 
energy science forum so that's my home
and<00:02:57.790> we<00:02:58.790> talked<00:02:59.060> about<00:02:59.239> it<00:02:59.510> there<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:01.130> how

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
and we talked about it there and how

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.840 
and we talked about it there and how
this<00:03:01.459> was<00:03:01.730> built<00:03:02.709> but<00:03:03.709> this<00:03:03.950> is<00:03:04.160> exactly

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
this was built but this is exactly

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.380 
this was built but this is exactly
what's<00:03:05.269> in<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.570> patent<00:03:06.370> on<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.670> oscillators

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
what's in the patent on the oscillators

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.259 
what's in the patent on the oscillators

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.860 

and<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:28.769> can<00:03:28.950> see<00:03:29.189> it's<00:03:29.400> raising<00:03:29.870> quickly

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
and you can see it's raising quickly

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.550 
and you can see it's raising quickly
here<00:03:32.120> so<00:03:34.129> there<00:03:35.129> you<00:03:35.250> have<00:03:35.310> it<00:03:35.989> anyway<00:03:36.989> one

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
here so there you have it anyway one

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.949 
here so there you have it anyway one
more<00:03:37.769> look<00:03:37.799> at<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.099> tube<00:03:38.480> it's<00:03:39.480> built<00:03:39.750> into

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
more look at the tube it's built into

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.210 
more look at the tube it's built into
the<00:03:40.170> transistor

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.420 

and<00:03:46.290> it's<00:03:47.290> charging<00:03:47.620> this

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.619 

this<00:03:51.030> is<00:03:51.209> an<00:03:51.359> 18<00:03:51.719> amp<00:03:51.930> hour<00:03:52.200> battery<00:03:53.480> so<00:03:54.480> it's

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
this is an 18 amp hour battery so it's

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:58.369 
this is an 18 amp hour battery so it's
doing<00:03:54.810> it<00:03:54.989> just<00:03:55.230> fine<00:03:56.900> barely<00:03:57.900> any<00:03:58.079> heat<00:03:58.349> at

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
doing it just fine barely any heat at

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.699 
doing it just fine barely any heat at
all<00:03:58.650> on<00:03:59.310> this<00:03:59.549> device<00:04:00.200> because<00:04:01.200> I<00:04:01.319> can<00:04:01.469> hold<00:04:01.650> my

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
all on this device because I can hold my

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.800 
all on this device because I can hold my
hand<00:04:01.829> right<00:04:02.250> there<00:04:02.310> on<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.700> case<00:04:03.920> so<00:04:04.920> anyway

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
hand right there on the case so anyway

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.420 
hand right there on the case so anyway
short<00:04:06.810> little<00:04:06.989> video<00:04:07.409> on<00:04:07.650> it<00:04:07.799> thanks<00:04:08.250> for

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
short little video on it thanks for

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.819 
short little video on it thanks for
watching
