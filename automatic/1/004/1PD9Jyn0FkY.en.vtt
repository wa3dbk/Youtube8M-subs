00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
hair and I'm looping it through two

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.890 
hair and I'm looping it through two
holes<00:00:24.039> actually<00:00:25.150> cuz<00:00:26.150> I'd<00:00:26.269> I'm<00:00:26.419> gonna<00:00:26.630> put<00:00:26.810> it

holes actually cuz I'd I'm gonna put it
on<00:00:27.310> three<00:00:28.310> one<00:00:28.550> hole<00:00:28.819> so<00:00:29.119> it<00:00:29.239> would<00:00:29.359> be<00:00:29.710> so<00:00:30.710> that

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
on three one hole so it would be so that

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.660 
on three one hole so it would be so that
one<00:00:31.399> thread<00:00:32.029> on<00:00:32.450> the<00:00:33.070> net<00:00:34.070> would<00:00:34.310> have<00:00:34.489> to

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
one thread on the net would have to

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.689 
one thread on the net would have to
support<00:00:35.059> this<00:00:35.390> entire<00:00:35.750> width<00:00:36.219> so<00:00:37.219> I<00:00:37.250> kind<00:00:37.609> of

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
support this entire width so I kind of

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:45.520 
support this entire width so I kind of
want<00:00:37.910> it<00:00:38.030> -<00:00:40.960> I<00:00:43.239> want<00:00:44.239> the<00:00:44.629> net<00:00:44.840> to<00:00:45.140> hold<00:00:45.320> the

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
want it - I want the net to hold the

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.069 
want it - I want the net to hold the
weft<00:00:45.769> basically<00:00:46.550> so<00:00:47.420> I'm<00:00:47.480> going<00:00:47.690> to<00:00:47.780> try<00:00:48.050> to

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
weft basically so I'm going to try to

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.110 
weft basically so I'm going to try to
put<00:00:48.320> it<00:00:48.440> through<00:00:48.589> as<00:00:48.710> many<00:00:48.920> hoes<00:00:49.190> as<00:00:49.429> I<00:00:49.550> can<00:00:49.789> so

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
put it through as many hoes as I can so

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.009 
put it through as many hoes as I can so
that<00:00:50.149> the<00:00:50.839> thread<00:00:51.140> from<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:51.440> knit<00:00:51.829> cap<00:00:53.019> the

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
weaving cap can hold the width so that's

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.240

for<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.860> sides<00:02:42.100> in<00:02:42.220> my<00:02:42.310> head<00:02:42.549> but<00:02:42.989> apparently

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
for the sides in my head but apparently

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.390 
for the sides in my head but apparently
I<00:02:44.110> didn't<00:02:44.440> but<00:02:44.530> like<00:02:44.620> I<00:02:44.650> said<00:02:44.769> maybe<00:02:45.130> it's<00:02:45.340> just

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
I didn't but like I said maybe it's just

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.340 
I didn't but like I said maybe it's just
because<00:02:45.610> my<00:02:45.940> hair<00:02:46.150> is<00:02:46.180> poofy<00:02:46.630> in<00:02:46.750> here<00:02:47.170> and

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
because my hair is poofy in here and

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.350 
because my hair is poofy in here and
it's<00:02:47.830> not<00:02:47.950> able<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.459> fit<00:02:48.790> my<00:02:48.940> head<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.330> way

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
it's not able to fit my head the way

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.229 
it's not able to fit my head the way
that<00:02:49.480> it<00:02:49.750> should<00:02:50.310> but<00:02:51.310> anyway<00:02:51.760> I'm<00:02:52.180> just

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
that it should but anyway I'm just

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.750 
that it should but anyway I'm just
showing<00:02:52.810> y'all<00:02:52.989> the<00:02:53.110> progress<00:02:53.590> I<00:02:53.950> picked<00:02:54.640> out

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
showing y'all the progress I picked out

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.699 
showing y'all the progress I picked out
a<00:02:54.820> few<00:02:55.030> of<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.630> curls<00:02:55.959> in<00:02:56.049> the<00:02:56.170> front<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.590> I

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
a few of the curls in the front and I

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.180 
a few of the curls in the front and I
think<00:02:56.739> it's<00:02:57.190> really<00:02:57.700> cute

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
think it's really cute

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.770 
think it's really cute
but<00:03:00.190> um<00:03:00.310> I<00:03:00.580> didn't<00:03:00.820> pick<00:03:00.940> out<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.209> rest<00:03:01.390> of<00:03:01.600> him

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.240 
but um I didn't pick out the rest of him
I<00:03:01.989> just<00:03:02.140> kind<00:03:02.500> of<00:03:02.530> wanted<00:03:02.769> to<00:03:02.799> get<00:03:02.920> an<00:03:03.010> idea

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
I just kind of wanted to get an idea

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.640 
I just kind of wanted to get an idea
what<00:03:03.400> its<00:03:03.549> gonna<00:03:03.700> look<00:03:03.820> like<00:03:04.350> anyway<00:03:05.350> this<00:03:05.500> is

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650

week was a little like too small for my

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.120 
week was a little like too small for my
head<00:03:54.910> so<00:03:55.910> what<00:03:56.120> I<00:03:56.150> did<00:03:56.240> is<00:03:56.690> I<00:03:56.870> took<00:03:56.930> a<00:03:57.350> second

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
head so what I did is I took a second

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.550 
head so what I did is I took a second
weaving<00:03:58.880> cap<00:03:59.770> and<00:04:00.770> the<00:04:01.310> only<00:04:01.520> thing<00:04:01.880> I<00:04:02.030> did<00:04:02.300> was

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
weaving cap and the only thing I did was

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.370 
weaving cap and the only thing I did was
go<00:04:03.560> around<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:05.120> edges<00:04:05.420> would<00:04:05.780> be<00:04:05.930> like<00:04:06.110> in<00:04:06.290> the

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
go around the edges would be like in the

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.230 
go around the edges would be like in the
back<00:04:06.620> like<00:04:07.010> I<00:04:07.130> went<00:04:07.340> around<00:04:07.490> the<00:04:07.670> edges<00:04:08.060> with

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
back like I went around the edges with

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.530 
back like I went around the edges with
that<00:04:08.510> cap<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:09.140> I<00:04:09.770> put<00:04:10.040> it<00:04:10.160> under<00:04:10.340> this<00:04:10.790> cap<00:04:11.120> and

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
that cap and I put it under this cap and

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.120 
that cap and I put it under this cap and
I<00:04:12.440> attached<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.400> front<00:04:13.790> of<00:04:14.120> the<00:04:14.890> weaving<00:04:15.890> cap

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
I attached the front of the weaving cap

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.780 
I attached the front of the weaving cap
together<00:04:16.790> so<00:04:17.480> it's<00:04:17.720> like<00:04:17.840> a<00:04:17.870> two-part<00:04:18.830> wig<00:04:19.250> I

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790
