00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 and today's super light project is 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:16.500
 making a chimney out of the ordinary 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:18.000
 tennis ball and since you already 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.770
 understand we need a tennis ball 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.609
 First we take 1 and do it. 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.859
 small hole 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.810
 then take the second cut exactly 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.849
 then cut the two halves in half 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.920
 also in half and then these four pieces 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.960
 starting to push into the other end 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.470
 the ball when the ball on the back other 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.420
 balls 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.130
 cut off a piece of aluminum hears 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.660
 this size so that you can return 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.399
 whole ball operating do this 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.200
 we push a toothpick into that hole 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.100
 which we did the boss and better 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.110
 just for souls 2 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.820
 after which the ball is finally wrapped 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.190
 aluminum paper tip can be cut 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.260
 the blade after which everything is tightly pressed 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.730
 and finally to the Don toothpicks from here 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.190
 will have to smoke when we 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.899
 let's hold not as a bonus to us at the video I 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.059
 decided to do something else if you take 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.190
 black ball and cut it in half then 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.079
 squad in falcon menu in mike and then peep 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.789
 Angarsk ball placed in the center and 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.530
 the sides put two toothpicks to 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.390
 make an exhaust pipe and sides 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.280
 then wrap this thing up and well 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.840
 prozhit then we have 2 age 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.939
 pipes and that means we can 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.890
 regulate the air flow and in principle 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.869
 all bend out from under the right corner of the floor 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.820
 . will spin when light up 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.950
 you can also make a rocket end 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.540
 The video will be link x1 so let's see 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.100

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.460

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.460
 cigarette lighter 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.030

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.920
