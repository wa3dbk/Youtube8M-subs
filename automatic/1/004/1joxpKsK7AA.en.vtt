00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
the glue will dry quickly use the next

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.899 
the glue will dry quickly use the next
pure<00:01:14.380> seconds<00:01:14.830> to<00:01:15.040> make<00:01:15.190> sure<00:01:15.340> the<00:01:15.490> cork<00:01:15.729> is

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909
