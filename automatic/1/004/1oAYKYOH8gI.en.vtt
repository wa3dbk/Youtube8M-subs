00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
now when you fired the arrow it will

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.939 
now when you fired the arrow it will
follow<00:00:30.300> its<00:00:30.599> trail<00:00:30.840> up<00:00:31.140> until<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.590> hits<00:00:31.769> its

mark now of course you could consider

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.020

this<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.410> kill<00:00:34.649> cam<00:00:34.860> if<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.280> know<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.700> actually

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
this a kill cam if you know you actually

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
actually very nice to give you a more

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.840 
actually very nice to give you a more
accurate<00:00:40.170> view<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.920> where<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.520> should<00:00:41.730> be

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
accurate view of where you should be

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.520 
accurate view of where you should be
firing<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.480> if<00:00:42.600> you're<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> little<00:00:43.079> bit<00:00:43.200> shy<00:00:43.500> of

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
firing so if you're a little bit shy of

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.830 
firing so if you're a little bit shy of
your<00:00:44.010> target<00:00:44.370> say<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:45.120> that's<00:00:45.300> inanimate

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
your target say for that's inanimate

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.330 
your target say for that's inanimate
object<00:00:46.440> target<00:00:46.890> right<00:00:47.070> there

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
object target right there

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.700 
object target right there
you're<00:00:47.879> gonna<00:00:48.000> think<00:00:48.270> that's<00:00:48.690> okay<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.680> I

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
you're gonna think that's okay so I

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.900 
you're gonna think that's okay so I
should<00:00:49.800> probably<00:00:50.010> bring<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.579> down<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> little

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
should probably bring it down a little

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.610 
should probably bring it down a little
more<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.300> as<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.600> can<00:00:51.719> see<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:51.899> hit<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.289> right

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
more and as you can see I hit it right

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.740 
more and as you can see I hit it right
on<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.949> red<00:00:53.100> mark<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.300> course<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.690> is

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
on the red mark so of course this is

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.510 
on the red mark so of course this is
very<00:00:55.079> useful<00:00:55.500> for<00:00:55.680> when<00:00:55.800> you're<00:00:55.949> hunting<00:00:56.309> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520

piggies or the sky piggies in this case

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.099
