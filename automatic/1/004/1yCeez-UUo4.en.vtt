00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 Well what kind of goals do you set when dieting ? 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.960
 It is likely to lose 5 kilograms by summer 8 which is common 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:16.320
 The goal is to say you can get 10 kilograms by summer 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:18.210
 But I've been doing various diets so far, the most important thing is body fat rather than its weight 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.020
 I think it is a rate 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.670
 That's why this time cheap target 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:28.840
 I No I certain measuring instruments and why the body or fat that important 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:31.960
 I would like to introduce you here is the first to introduce 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.550
 I think of the body scan 214 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.550
 or let's flip-up with a 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:46.260
 Went to Do manual and here in is the body I wish it out here battery 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:50.969
 The first set Please set go towards the first is very simple 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:56.089
 First set the region first, then gender height age 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.089
 There only measure riding hit after only put it 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:07.400
 We are fast immediately measured is quite Hey I I'd tried to Do the numbers came out 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.370
 Well first weight splash 76.4 k and body fat percentage 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:15.580
 18.8 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:23.170
 Is I wonder if would put me Oh enough but it was a 13 percent when measured in the scene speaking there 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:28.450
 35 or ax sail So I ne to the other something visceral fat rules Toka skeletal muscle percentage and the gold something body year 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:31.090
 Although it comes out with various numerical values , it should be noted that only weight and body fat percentage 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:35.570
 So here are some points of caution 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:40.159
 It's this type basically because only the foot is put, the body fat speed of the foot 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:44.510
 I from you Gagottsui of ne upper body I maybe I'm expenses like a feeling 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:48.950
 Maybe that's why my body fat came out 13 parts lower 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:51.080
 So people who say you want the scale to really it accurately can buy another this Reaching type 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.590
 It's fine but it's a bit expensive 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:58.590
 I think that is good about reference made me the guy that said 10,000 so I because you over 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:03.210
 I think that I am good with this type of foot placement 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.329
 After all this body fat ratio changes in the morning and the night And of course 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:10.830
 Having eaten it changes even after exercise 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:15.580
 Absolutely the same condition if Ke to measure it because 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:21.250
 Blu-ray is given quite ne If not it'll I want you to measure in the same time zone 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:26.890
 It is necessary to be careful because it moves to the pre. After these things such as these, measures for home use only 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.250
 But it doesn't mean that she has a great personality, of course there are also errors. 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.640
 I will 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:35.080
 I think that it is good to look at the reference level Well why why the body fat percentage is important 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.240
 I would like to move on to the story 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:43.270
 For example, you can drop 5 kg in one day until you're serious 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:47.240
 I'm running in the scorching sun 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:51.620
 About 4 to 5 kg to avoid hydration at all 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.570
 I understand that it's going to fall , and now it's about time I'm going to fall down and it's sloppy 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.830
 In such a feeling Well Kedomo I 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.640
 I can easily drop my weight , and I think everyone is over 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.710
 but 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.400
 Good luck to Saura and you have not experienced that you dropped 1 k or 2 kilometers 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.260
 Is not it 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.069
 Really everyone is pushing the weight as it is 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:16.769
 I wish I Maybe that was a swim salary is just below 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:21.450
 To some extent I'm getting weight back, even the basics Fat isn't burned, it's water 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:25.829
 Fat burning better is out in most of the cases that Tteyuu because I went I somewhat marriage 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.250
 I think that there is also something but I almost already water and moisture 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:31.150
 After basically I of human 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:36.159
 Water and fat muscles 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:40.900
 What you want to reduce in this will become fat after all 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:46.480
 In spite that say you also fell body weight I do not around the 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:50.739
 There pretty Punyapo and I Nane not me it like Ne was still muscle mass Gane 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.170
 There are a lot of such patterns that may fall down and leave the ball as it is 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.040
 a daka 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:58.400
 Basically you should do without reducing the amount of wasted fat 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:03.380
 In other words, it is important to lower the body fat percentage 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:07.940
 So body fat percentage that the body fat percentage went this way can measure not only the body weight 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:11.160
 I need these things and this is important too 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:14.430
 Once you measure your weight and body fat 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:19.200
 What in the Let's firmly I paddle does from is also God Note 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:24.420
 Or I, of course Toka or saved in Excel PC sounds good even if the smartphone 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.170
 Anything I should such play also recorded I wonder if not you there is another fundamental anything Nokosere 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:30.720
 is 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:31.150
 After all the work of the record is very important last time that I did homework last 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.960
 Ten 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:40.630
 Let's take a picture of the body of yeah After all that is also the record 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:45.370
 This time the recording party of heat and body weight rate and body fat rate is too low to see the data 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:50.979
 When my weight goes up I think it's a yabe That feeling is important 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:53.650
 What serves as is the other skeletal muscle Toka something had Uyauyashi in the spring of last here weight and body fat percentage 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:57.220
 This body fat percentage house can also be seen figures 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:00.940
 Prices, such as key there is about 2700 yen 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:05.360
 I bought it with amazon but it is not quite cheap but I bought it 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:08.870
 After all, weight loss aim even though of course is the body fat Ritsuken 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:13.310
 For example, weight is always together but body fat percentage 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:18.169
 If it is down, it should come to my mind even more 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:22.580
 I Oh and Necro is I do is nothing of the ground but I guess and its tone is good height 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:25.350
 There are 175 so it currently weighs 76 kg 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.560
 So there is as much height in front of you 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:33.120
 And take a look at people of similar weight 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:38.700
 Maybe I think it looks like that's a slender name 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:40.080
 After all there is a difference in body fat percentage Why do I want to ask you why I diet 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:45.370
 To say and do 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:49.240
 A diet for just saying you want to reduce the value of its weight 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:55.270
 Or I'm on a diet to make it look thinner 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:56.949
 Which of the Maybe body weight will of that it is as it is the body fat percentage is also down to look specifically there 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.760
 There is no big change up to 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:02.800
 But the weight is still body fat percentage 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:07.180
 5% or 10% school 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:10.330
 It different appearance array at all will be there when he reduced me Yeah 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:14.050
 So aim is the matter body fat percentage 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:19.810
 Let's do our best to everyone together towards the summer Well why 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:22.790
 And the details of the official who comes out from the story of the law are written on my blog 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:39.010
 I would like to see at the explanatory meeting I want more than 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:39.010
 Weight scale with audience rating is opa
