and even press it out with something

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.540 
and even press it out with something
flatter<00:03:07.270> but<00:03:07.900> for<00:03:08.080> me<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:08.440> bottom<00:03:08.710> is<00:03:08.860> totally

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
flatter but for me the bottom is totally

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.090 
flatter but for me the bottom is totally
covered<00:03:09.940> it's<00:03:10.780> brought<00:03:11.110> up<00:03:11.290> around<00:03:11.590> all<00:03:11.890> the

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
covered it's brought up around all the

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.680 
covered it's brought up around all the
edges<00:03:12.520> and<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:13.000> thickness<00:03:13.240> is<00:03:13.480> pretty

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
edges and the thickness is pretty

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.510 
edges and the thickness is pretty
consistent<00:03:14.050> over<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.920> course<00:03:15.160> of<00:03:15.340> the

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
consistent over the course of the

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.890 
consistent over the course of the

imperfections<00:03:17.020> in<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.710> bottom<00:03:18.040> because

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
imperfections in the bottom because

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.500 
imperfections in the bottom because
there's<00:03:18.880> something<00:03:19.150> covered<00:03:19.330> up<00:03:19.420> with

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
when one more time all right let's get

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.610 
when one more time all right let's get
our<00:04:34.810> crust<00:04:35.050> out<00:04:35.169> of<00:04:35.229> the<00:04:35.320> freezer<00:04:37.410> the<00:04:38.410> next

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
our crust out of the freezer the next

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.870 
our crust out of the freezer the next
step<00:04:38.770> is<00:04:38.860> pretty<00:04:38.950> easy<00:04:39.160> to<00:04:39.340> guess<00:04:39.490> we're<00:04:39.700> going

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
step is pretty easy to guess we're going

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.670 
step is pretty easy to guess we're going
to<00:04:40.000> take<00:04:40.180> our<00:04:40.389> filling<00:04:40.810> pour<00:04:41.260> it<00:04:41.350> into<00:04:41.500> our

to take our filling pour it into our

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.480 
to take our filling pour it into our
