00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.770
 low complexity and slow enemies 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.140
 after which they rushed to lament 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.690
 comments their thesis is extremely simple 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.969
 the game slipped supposedly into measured 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.469
 console shooting range while chip 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.090
 the series has always been staggering 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.609
 dynamics and drive 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.979
 the developers did not keep silent and 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.619

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.640
 assured that the infantryman safely 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.010
 survived the presentation and systematically everyone 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.020
 won only because it was driving 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.580
 hardcore expert besides 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.799
 the demonstration was not so great 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.990
 voluminous to properly cover the topic 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.689
 and clearly show the brutal carnage 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.700

 whatever it is according to strata to all 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.330
 accusations are groundless and vain 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.310
 There are many chances to make sure of it 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.950
 well yes okay foams too 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.680

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.200
 gameplay on the example of pitch though out 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.209

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.010
 procedural reflections and the like 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.470
 really saturate the picture and 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.110
 thicken the atmosphere we can only 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.150
 be glad for the eidos success and patiently 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.220
 wait well and not to dive in

 unpromising reasoning briefly 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.570
 I will designate that on sabbath indie developers 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.800

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.320
 over the past years he led to 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.900
 the fact that everything will be fine and fighting 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.060

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.590
 yes you are not yet but before the white match promises 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.540
 to be big and multifaceted and meanwhile 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.670
 slowly seeping first 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.250

 goast recon wildlands 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.609
 hardly anyone much surprised but the events 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.950
 will unfold in the near future where 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:46.650
 a squad of four ghosts comes to light 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.329
 on the mission to eliminate the drug cartel from

 cooperative not force or but 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.939
 recommended and gameplay promises 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:56.609
 vigorous wanderings in the vast living world 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.780
 pumping a wide range of weapons and 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.780
 vehicles 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.720
 and also surely a lot higher except 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.919
 that we are supposed to be forced to take 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.370
 ambiguous decisions consequences 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:10.950
 which will inevitably affect something 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.989
 We will follow the developments and on 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.299

 Yoshida about why dallas guardian 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.440
 spent so much time in a long box and 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.900
 became a Japanese symbol of unfinished 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.419
 premiere game trailer 6 years ago as 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.970
 It turned out not quite honestly presented 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.310
 the project video was significantly finalized 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.800
 manually because playstation 3 is not 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.320
 coped with the ambitions of the authors but later 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.190
 the question still got an edge cut 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.860
 either gameplay 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.050
 either grafon however just somewhere in that 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.380
 period already went the first timid whisper 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:52.050
 and ps4 that sdyuzhit on their gene case and 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.930
 the decision asked to postpone itself 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.409
 until better times, and that's how they are 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.289
 the table 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:05:00.389
 what we take the word and wish good luck 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.520
 the project looks to this day very 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.530
 Interesting by the way in between times here 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.080
 it turned out that backward compatibility on 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.569
 4 curling is better not to wait, alas 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.240
