00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.389
 and beautiful all guys here and I'll do club e 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.520
 today we are in a really random episode 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.500
 will be a bet 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.029
 I believe in the five minutes are the three 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.500
 minutes 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:27.050
 however it is a really fast bet 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.580
 we had to explain great dilemmas 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.699
 one of the great dilemmas is emphatic and how 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:39.360
 put a very strong map in yours 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:41.850
 minecraft them it really is very 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.910
 a lot of construction took place many 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.360
 so many of you will come to avoid 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.620
 things to avoid other discussions 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:55.640
 we say we prefer to let you see it immediately 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.640
 above all else as well 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:06.030
 five hundred, however, showcase 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:09.690
 you think of the map appdata per percent 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:14.369
 landed in percent than from this range 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:17.640
 which will open will succeed this thing 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.039
 groening we press you this I go when 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.899
 below but instead you immediately the folder 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:26.399
 if you have windows 7 15 it has suffered one 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:30.330
 very simple question point folder 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:32.929
 minecraft you open so much here guys 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.209
 we only lost once anyway 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:38.459
 you will find we lost it because of 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:42.270
 computer place is the usual we don't have 

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:45.239
 still the maps folder you definitely 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.670
 There have I'll show 

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:49.950
 you have a folder built maps open 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.099
 the app laughs and there will be all ours 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.149
 worlds made in hammering then format 

00:01:53.099 --> 00:02:00.080
 you will simply have to open the file 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.239
 this is a simple fashion demonstration 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.510
 the file we put into it 

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:10.080
 you will find a folder 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.300
 that corresponds to our world 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.250
 transport it wherever you want I don't know in 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.410
 this case I moan here and there 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.870
 simply in maps in the middle of the 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.750
 other worlds firmly to kidnap the 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.790
 fortissimo minecraft also present the 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:30.600
 our mother knew the map says the 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.250
 map probably could not happen 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.380
 are tied to the top positions because 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.420
 the first positions are only that 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:41.100
 let's say recently click then 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.320
 you will probably find it among the latest 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.650
 therefore we say positions do not exist 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.960
 immediately take the impact down below 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.940
 if you have a lot of furniture this vase 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.360
 we remove water because it has nothing to do with 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.300
 dick 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.700
 we also hope maps has nothing to do with it 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.370
 nothing 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.020
 we ask ourselves to come down this era nor do we try 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.880
 percent screw weighted percent 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:10.140
