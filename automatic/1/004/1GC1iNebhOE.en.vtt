CHASING THE SUNSET

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.540
[Terknoovland]

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.920
In one small but beautiful plasticine country,

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.000
in one bright plasticine house

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.640
lived two wonderful plasticine creatures â€” Terk and Noovl.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.720
True, there was also Eye with them,

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.910
but he was always on the last floor and never went out.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.060
So, one fine evening,

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.600
Noovl and Terk were resting in the living room.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.550
Noovl,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.370
it's your move!

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.050
d1-d2.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.010
Oh, I didn't think that you'd do that move.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.290
What time is it?

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.090
Twenty-five minutes past nine.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.160
So, the sunset is in half a minute!

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.100
Come quickly!

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.750
Wait for me!

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.130
Ah... What a sunset!

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.110
This sunset was a good one!

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.620
Terk, am I not in time?

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.980
Almost.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.550
But it's...

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.140
unfair.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.250
You move faster than me.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.610
Ah...

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.670
But over the last three years

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.000
I have never missed either a sunset or sunrise!

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.140
What should we do?

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.380
You know, Noovl,

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.430
if you could now climb higher, you might be able to see it.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.210
And, when you first see it, it would be like a sunrise,

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.130
and few people could watch the sunrise at this time.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.560
Yes, that would be wonderful!

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.470
But, how can I climb to such a height? 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.260
The roof of our house is not high enough, is it?

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.160
No, you need to climb higher.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.480
Oh, how clever you are, Terk!

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.460
Hmm. And it'll be able to fly?

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.870
Hold it a minute.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.410
Put it on.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.070
But... Isn't hydrogen dangerous?

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.950
Ah. Yes, but it's not a problem.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.830
That's much better!

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.830
Come on.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.890
Whoopie!

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.450
Ah! Wow!

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.430
Bye!

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.940
Bye, I'll be back before supper!

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.870
Here's the sun! Hooray!

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.280
The end
