00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.140
 devil while while I recover 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.840

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.960
 willy share what with ricky depends on 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.180
 what I can and good little by little I go 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.460
 I'm not expert learning the 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.710
 role-playing games far from it and what I've 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.170
 learned is that some of the most 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.080
 important is the equipment not the 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.850
 equipment that you see here and good little 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.710
 little by little I learned more and I learned that 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.780
 the points you have to be boiling 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.600
 strength dexterity vitality and so on 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.000
 each character has its strengths 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.180
 and in the case of the monk who is what I am 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.920
 I a bald monk then what better 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.680
 you have to have is the skill already 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.140
 secondarily vitality write 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.090
 the attributes 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.240
 it is certainly understood is quite 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.430
 simple and if I have 618 vitality 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.580
 means that I have six thousand and a half 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.560
 life and I knew that until recently 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.350
 as I understand it thank you very much to him 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.560
 Thanks to that, I'm a little more 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.080
 strong and another advice that I can give you is 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.110
 that western houses the house auctions 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.230
 it's something you ought to pasaros 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.300
 it's the best thing I say in the auction house 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.730
 what do you buy and let's go you stay 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.880
 in face as it kills the buffet when 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.800
 you have three incredible glasses 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.690
 in the background that the triple that has what 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.590
 yours 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.040
 does not do an analysis but here everything 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.430
 what 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.719
 is that his gaming vices 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.719
 they add 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.300
 and you know that if I'm absent it's because 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:35.610
 that was vital and as soon as I 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.610
 recover to have videos of all 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.880
 3 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.780
 because he can not make movements 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.700
 brusque as it was 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.330
 so what I said kids that I'm in 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.490
 Devil 3 playing streaming that 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.000
 as soon as I recover, you will have 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.000
 videos 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.060
