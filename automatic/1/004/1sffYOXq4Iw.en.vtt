Hello this is Chef John from Foodwishes.com
with a homemade french fries

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:13.200
do not try this at home unless you have a giant dutch oven
full of oil leftover from a donut video

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.019
so I had some oill left over from my pinchy video

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:18.789
and i decided to show you how

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.279
those really crispy restaurant fries are made
again I don't expect you to do this

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.580
this is like an fyi

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.640
so what we're going to do

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.480
i mean what i'm going to do you really
should not do this

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.690
I'm going to hand cut some russet potatoes
into some french fry like

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.820
geometric shapes so i'm gonna cut this
into like three thick slices actually four

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.180
and then just cutting your traditional
french fry shape if you are going to hand cut

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.190
fries which i do not suggest you do you
got to make sure they're fairly evenly

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.000
sized otherwise when they fry they
won't fry evenly

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
right also the potato,  russet works the
best potatoes is call the kennebec it's

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.309
a special potato I believe it's from Maine, it has the
perfect ratio of starch and water to

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.230
make french fries

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.820
we're going to rinse those off really well in coldwater, soak
them for about half hour

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.220
you can change the water a couple times

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.710
all right we're going to dry those off
really well

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.880
I'm no exploding oil expert

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.620
but you'd never want to put wet food

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.980
into hot oil

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.190
right the secret to crispy restaurant
style fries is blanching they're

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.310
cooked twice

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.900
so the first cooking is at a lower
temperature

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.100
I'm going to use 275 degrees farenheit and we're
just going to cook those for about five

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.940
minutes they're not going to be cooked
crispy by any means it's just going to

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.710
kind of cooked the starch and potato a little
bit and they're going to be

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.500
once chilled, prepared and set up for crispy
fries so that's the first stage to crispy

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.679
restaurant fries is the oil blanching in
a lower temperature

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.450
you're going to let those cool completely I put
mine in an open window

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.619
I didn't want to put them in the fridge all hot

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.430
but you can definitely refrigerate these
before your fry them

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.130
then you crank up the oil to 350 degrees farenheit

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.600
and then they get fried for real so this
is the second frying this is what gives

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.859
them the crisp coating, the first frying just
kinda prepared the french fry

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:13.689
they're sort of cooked right they were
just partially cooked

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:17.199
the second frying is what really crisps
them up

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:21.319
crisps is a hard word to say I just
pulled a cheek muscle

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.369
so what you're going to do is you're going to fry these
for five or six minutes

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:29.059
you can actually feel with your spider
which is that little deep fry strainer there

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:32.399
you can actually feel with the
spider

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:34.089
the crispiness

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:38.150
right the bubbles get a little smaller
meaning there's less moisture coming out of

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.620
the fry

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.539
and you know what

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:44.329
you can tell they get golden brown and
crispy

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.709
so once those have developed the

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.940
desired level of exterior crispiness

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.069
you're going to fish them out, I like to blot them on a
paper towel just real briefly

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.290
and of course, make sure you touch them when they
first come out of the oil because they're really hot and you'll burn

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.519
your fingertips so that always feels
good

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.969
dust them with some salt, what I like to
serve these with is

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:09.709
ketchup and I've been serving ketchup with fries since
I can remember, it's one of my signature pairings

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.689
and you can hear

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:15.359
that crispiness

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.879
so that's how you achieve the ideal
french fry in my opinion

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:25.259
the really light fluffy in the inside and
that really thin crispy exterior

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:26.310
really nice

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.220
alright - check out the site all the info is
there and all the ingredients let's see

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.939
there was, well actually... it's potato so check it out

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:35.269
and as always Enjoy!
