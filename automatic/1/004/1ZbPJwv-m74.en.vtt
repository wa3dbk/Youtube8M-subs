on<00:00:17.400> any<00:00:17.910> version<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.420> Minecraft<00:00:18.990> basically

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
on any version of Minecraft basically

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.980 
on any version of Minecraft basically
the<00:00:19.859> way<00:00:19.980> this<00:00:20.160> works<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.609> they<00:00:20.939> are<00:00:21.210> basically

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
the way this works is they are basically

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.840 
the way this works is they are basically
they<00:00:22.560> have<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.890> listen<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.220> what<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.400> say<00:00:23.670> or

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
they have to listen to what I say or

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.640 
they have to listen to what I say or
else<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:24.180> can<00:00:24.390> kill<00:00:24.630> them<00:00:24.869> but<00:00:25.320> at<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.500> same

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
else I can kill them but at the same

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.750 
else I can kill them but at the same
time<00:00:25.830> since<00:00:26.070> there's<00:00:26.220> two<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.490> them<00:00:26.609> it's

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
time since there's two of them it's

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.429 
time since there's two of them it's
gonna<00:00:26.849> be<00:00:26.970> hard<00:00:27.150> for<00:00:27.269> me<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.449> keep<00:00:27.660> track<00:00:28.199> of
