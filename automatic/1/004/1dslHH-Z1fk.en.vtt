00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.250 
to actually look at what you're typing
so<00:04:05.550> in<00:04:05.970> this<00:04:06.120> situation<00:04:06.630> I've<00:04:06.750> set<00:04:06.959> one<00:04:07.110> two

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
so in this situation I've set one two

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.979 
so in this situation I've set one two
three<00:04:07.500> four<00:04:07.769> so<00:04:08.040> one<00:04:08.220> two<00:04:08.430> three<00:04:08.459> four<00:04:09.060> is<00:04:09.840> the

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
three four so one two three four is the

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.660 
three four so one two three four is the
password<00:04:10.170> that<00:04:10.380> automatically<00:04:10.920> unlocks<00:04:11.340> gets

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
password that automatically unlocks gets

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.030 
password that automatically unlocks gets
me<00:04:11.790> back<00:04:11.940> into<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.360> application<00:04:13.040> where

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
me back into the application where

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.410 
me back into the application where
people<00:04:14.370> sometimes<00:04:14.519> can<00:04:14.910> see<00:04:15.090> over<00:04:15.269> your

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
people sometimes can see over your

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.520 
people sometimes can see over your
shoulder<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:15.900> you<00:04:16.019> know<00:04:16.140> if<00:04:16.230> you're<00:04:16.380> putting

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
shoulder and you know if you're putting

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.810 
shoulder and you know if you're putting
one<00:04:16.709> two<00:04:16.830> three<00:04:17.040> four<00:04:17.310> and<00:04:17.430> they're<00:04:17.549> like<00:04:17.730> oh<00:04:17.790> I

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
one two three four and they're like oh I

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.920 
one two three four and they're like oh I
know<00:04:18.030> what<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.299> password<00:04:18.480> is

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
know what the password is

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.810 
know what the password is
so<00:04:19.320> this<00:04:19.650> prevents<00:04:20.130> that<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:20.520> gives<00:04:20.640> you<00:04:20.729> the

so this prevents that and gives you the

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.659 
so this prevents that and gives you the
ability<00:04:20.910> to<00:04:21.180> control<00:04:21.419> it<00:04:21.630> very<00:04:21.870> nicely<00:04:22.669> when

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
ability to control it very nicely when

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.070 
ability to control it very nicely when
you<00:04:23.760> exit<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.330> application<00:04:24.450> trying<00:04:24.960> to

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
you exit the application trying to

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.899 
you exit the application trying to
back<00:04:25.259> into<00:04:25.560> it<00:04:25.710> it<00:04:25.889> does<00:04:26.069> the<00:04:26.220> same<00:04:26.400> thing<00:04:26.669> if

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:26.909 
back into it it does the same thing if

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:28.879 
back into it it does the same thing if
you<00:04:27.270> just<00:04:27.479> press<00:04:27.659> okay<00:04:27.990> which<00:04:28.139> is<00:04:28.289> what<00:04:28.500> most

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
random keyboard I find that very

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:17.240 
random keyboard I find that very
particularly<00:05:15.270> helpful<00:05:15.690> for<00:05:16.139> a<00:05:16.409> lot<00:05:17.009> of<00:05:17.069> times

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
particularly helpful for a lot of times

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.409 
particularly helpful for a lot of times
when<00:05:17.370> you<00:05:17.460> put<00:05:17.610> in<00:05:17.699> passwords<00:05:18.060> on<00:05:18.150> your<00:05:18.270> phone

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
when you put in passwords on your phone

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:19.850 
when you put in passwords on your phone
a<00:05:18.449> lot<00:05:18.690> of<00:05:18.779> people<00:05:18.990> lock<00:05:19.169> our<00:05:19.349> phones<00:05:19.560> and<00:05:19.770> so

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
a lot of people lock our phones and so

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.320 
a lot of people lock our phones and so
on<00:05:19.919> but<00:05:20.129> you're<00:05:20.279> still<00:05:20.460> unlocking<00:05:21.029> them<00:05:21.150> in<00:05:21.240> a

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
on but you're still unlocking them in a

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.010 
on but you're still unlocking them in a
public<00:05:21.690> setting

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
public setting

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.050 
public setting
so<00:05:22.500> you're<00:05:22.860> going<00:05:23.159> in<00:05:23.279> you're<00:05:23.460> unlocking<00:05:23.909> and

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
so you're going in you're unlocking and

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.129 
so you're going in you're unlocking and
there's<00:05:24.300> a<00:05:24.360> good<00:05:24.509> chance<00:05:24.719> somebody's

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
there's a good chance somebody's

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.600 
there's a good chance somebody's
probably<00:05:25.409> gonna<00:05:25.500> see<00:05:25.770> you<00:05:25.979> trying<00:05:26.340> to<00:05:26.400> put<00:05:26.520> in

probably gonna see you trying to put in

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.100 
probably gonna see you trying to put in
the<00:05:26.729> code<00:05:27.240> and<00:05:27.479> they<00:05:27.629> might<00:05:27.779> be<00:05:27.900> able<00:05:27.990> to

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
the code and they might be able to

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.779 
the code and they might be able to
figure<00:05:28.289> out<00:05:28.529> depending<00:05:28.919> on<00:05:29.009> how<00:05:29.129> complex<00:05:29.520> your
