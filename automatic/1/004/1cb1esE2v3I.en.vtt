next we first season is a Philadelphia

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.049 
next we first season is a Philadelphia
Philadelphia<00:00:35.309> at<00:00:35.820> Lambeau<00:00:36.270> now<00:00:37.140> Philadelphia

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
Philadelphia at Lambeau now Philadelphia

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.330 
Philadelphia at Lambeau now Philadelphia
that'll<00:00:39.059> be<00:00:39.149> Donell<00:00:39.510> mcnabbs<00:00:40.110> first<00:00:41.070> full

game<00:00:41.579> back<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:42.210> your<00:00:43.200> Westbrook<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.270> think<00:00:45.270> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
game back on your Westbrook I think the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.479 
game back on your Westbrook I think the
role<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.690> kind<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.020> not<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:47.100> good<00:00:47.340> i<00:00:47.370> think

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
role is kind of not that good i think

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.979 
role is kind of not that good i think
they'll<00:00:47.850> be<00:00:47.940> evenly<00:00:48.239> matched<00:00:48.329> verse<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
they'll be evenly matched verse the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.939 
they'll be evenly matched verse the
packers<00:00:49.800> d<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.930> they've<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.530> guys<00:00:52.710> have<00:00:52.860> an

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
packers d and they've you guys have an

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.810 
packers d and they've you guys have an
okay<00:00:53.250> d<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.850> think<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.660> Packers<00:00:55.140> um<00:00:55.670> well<00:00:56.670> they

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
okay d I think the Packers um well they

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.090 
okay d I think the Packers um well they
had<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.390> really<00:00:57.930> good<00:00:58.260> playoff<00:00:58.500> game<00:00:58.680> that

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.889 
had that really good playoff game that
one<00:00:59.250> year<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.300> thought<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.600> was<00:01:00.719> really

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
path 32 okay all right now we have the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.490 
path 32 okay all right now we have the
Washington<00:02:39.510> Redskins<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:42.230> think<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.319> pack

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
Washington Redskins I think the pack

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.440 
Washington Redskins I think the pack
might<00:02:43.680> be<00:02:43.830> kind<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.069> tired<00:02:44.340> after<00:02:44.549> that<00:02:44.760> I'm

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
might be kind of tired after that I'm

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.150 
might be kind of tired after that I'm
going<00:02:45.599> to<00:02:45.660> take<00:02:45.840> Redskins<00:02:46.349> there<00:02:46.560> Redskins

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
going to take Redskins there Redskins

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.220 
going to take Redskins there Redskins
you<00:02:47.220> know<00:02:47.400> they're<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.090> good<00:02:48.360> team<00:02:48.390> good<00:02:49.019> that's

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
you know they're a good team good that's

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.990 
you know they're a good team good that's
all<00:02:49.440> good<00:02:50.040> team<00:02:50.480> so<00:02:51.480> three<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:51.870> three<00:02:52.940> now<00:02:53.940> we

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
all good team so three and three now we

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.120 
all good team so three and three now we
have<00:02:54.269> a<00:02:54.299> bye<00:02:54.569> so<00:02:55.049> I<00:02:55.080> think<00:02:55.530> that'll<00:02:55.769> be<00:02:55.890> good

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
have a bye so I think that'll be good

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.339 
have a bye so I think that'll be good
and<00:02:56.340> they're<00:02:56.880> at<00:02:57.000> denver<00:02:57.420> denver<00:02:57.660> is<00:02:58.019> a<00:02:58.049> better

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
and they're at denver denver is a better

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.830 
and they're at denver denver is a better
team<00:02:58.620> denver<00:02:59.010> i<00:02:59.040> think<00:02:59.370> it<00:03:00.090> might<00:03:00.239> actually<00:03:00.510> is

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
team denver i think it might actually is

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.440 
team denver i think it might actually is
that<00:03:01.230> there'll<00:03:01.739> be<00:03:01.769> a<00:03:01.860> good<00:03:02.340> competitor<00:03:02.700> ice

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
that there'll be a good competitor ice

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.789 
that there'll be a good competitor ice

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
now we got on three and four all right

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.220 
now we got on three and four all right
