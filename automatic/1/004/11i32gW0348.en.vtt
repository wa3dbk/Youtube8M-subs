00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
to pull it out you think Korea can can

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.350 
to pull it out you think Korea can can
finish<00:04:24.650> this<00:04:24.890> game<00:04:25.130> or<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.430> next<00:04:25.580> I<00:04:25.880> actually

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
finish this game or the next I actually

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.120 
finish this game or the next I actually
thought<00:04:26.720> that<00:04:26.900> it<00:04:27.080> would<00:04:27.229> be<00:04:27.290> China<00:04:27.979> was

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
thought that it would be China was

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.409 
thought that it would be China was
taking<00:04:28.460> it<00:04:28.550> like<00:04:28.669> home<00:04:28.820> field<00:04:28.940> advantage<00:04:29.390> like

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
taking it like home field advantage like

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:29.860 
taking it like home field advantage like
that

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
that

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.230 
that
thought<00:04:30.050> they<00:04:30.140> could<00:04:30.290> pull<00:04:30.650> it<00:04:30.680> out<00:04:30.830> but<00:04:31.240> like

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
thought they could pull it out but like
