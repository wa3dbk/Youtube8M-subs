00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
guitar at once and you strum all the

00:00:49.309 --> 00:01:02.310 
guitar at once and you strum all the
strings<00:00:49.489> like<00:00:50.059> this<00:00:50.269> for<00:00:50.479> example

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.380 

so<00:01:02.980> that<00:01:03.100> was<00:01:03.220> just<00:01:03.370> a<00:01:03.520> few<00:01:03.700> examples<00:01:04.210> of<00:01:04.330> some

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
so that was just a few examples of some

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.990 
so that was just a few examples of some
different<00:01:04.930> chords<00:01:05.260> and<00:01:05.470> of<00:01:05.650> course<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.850> more

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
different chords and of course the more

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.120 
different chords and of course the more
chords<00:01:07.390> you<00:01:07.480> know<00:01:07.690> the<00:01:08.140> more<00:01:08.350> flexibility

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
chords you know the more flexibility

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.440 
chords you know the more flexibility
you're<00:01:09.340> going<00:01:09.490> to<00:01:09.550> have<00:01:09.700> to<00:01:09.940> be<00:01:10.060> able<00:01:10.210> to<00:01:10.270> play

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
you're going to have to be able to play

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.450 
you're going to have to be able to play
a<00:01:10.480> variety<00:01:11.050> of<00:01:11.080> different<00:01:11.320> songs<00:01:11.740> so<00:01:12.040> I<00:01:12.220> think

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
a variety of different songs so I think

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.190 
a variety of different songs so I think
it<00:01:12.730> goes<00:01:12.850> without<00:01:13.000> saying<00:01:13.180> that<00:01:13.660> it's<00:01:14.020> better

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
it goes without saying that it's better

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.350 
it goes without saying that it's better
to<00:01:14.320> learn<00:01:14.590> as<00:01:14.740> many<00:01:15.070> chords<00:01:15.520> as<00:01:15.610> possible<00:01:16.150> and

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
to learn as many chords as possible and

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.000 
to learn as many chords as possible and
and<00:01:16.900> then<00:01:17.050> you<00:01:17.200> really<00:01:17.500> have<00:01:17.620> got<00:01:17.800> the<00:01:17.920> ability

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
and then you really have got the ability

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.610 
and then you really have got the ability
to<00:01:18.340> play<00:01:18.700> more<00:01:19.000> things<00:01:19.360> and<00:01:19.660> especially<00:01:20.230> if

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
to play more things and especially if

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.930 
to play more things and especially if
you're<00:01:20.800> the<00:01:20.830> sort<00:01:21.130> of<00:01:21.250> person<00:01:21.580> who<00:01:21.640> enjoys

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
you're the sort of person who enjoys

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.330 
you're the sort of person who enjoys
singing<00:01:22.300> as<00:01:22.660> well<00:01:22.690> as<00:01:22.990> playing<00:01:23.229> then<00:01:23.830> chords

singing as well as playing then chords

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
singing as well as playing then chords

what I consider to be the most useful

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.520 
what I consider to be the most useful
the<00:01:45.400> most<00:01:45.880> widely<00:01:46.390> used<00:01:46.420> chords<00:01:47.050> so<00:01:47.170> once<00:01:47.380> you

you<00:01:57.310> know<00:01:57.430> we<00:01:58.180> can<00:01:58.330> go<00:01:58.450> from<00:01:58.630> there<00:01:58.900> but<00:01:59.229> let's

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
you know we can go from there but let's

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.139 
you know we can go from there but let's
start<00:01:59.710> simple<00:01:59.920> so<00:02:00.399> I<00:02:00.430> want<00:02:00.790> to<00:02:00.820> begin<00:02:01.090> by

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
start simple so I want to begin by

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.690 
start simple so I want to begin by
showing<00:02:01.450> you<00:02:01.660> the<00:02:01.780> e<00:02:01.810> chord<00:02:02.290> so<00:02:02.979> if<00:02:03.280> you<00:02:03.460> take

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
showing you the e chord so if you take

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.609 
showing you the e chord so if you take
your<00:02:03.820> first<00:02:04.060> finger<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.810> put<00:02:05.170> it<00:02:05.259> onto<00:02:05.380> the

your first finger and put it onto the
third<00:02:05.830> string<00:02:06.250> at<00:02:06.550> fret<00:02:06.610> one<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:07.360> then<00:02:08.080> take

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
third string at fret one and then take

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:09.719 
third string at fret one and then take
your<00:02:08.380> middle<00:02:08.619> finger<00:02:09.010> and<00:02:09.160> put<00:02:09.280> it<00:02:09.310> onto<00:02:09.489> the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
fourth string at fret two now if you

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.020 
fourth string at fret two now if you
look<00:02:17.560> at<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.769> chord<00:02:18.010> box<00:02:18.250> next<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.760> me<00:02:18.850> you'll

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
look at the chord box next to me you'll

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.670 
look at the chord box next to me you'll
see<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.390> diagram<00:02:19.930> you<00:02:20.230> know<00:02:20.380> if<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.650> just

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
see the diagram you know if you just

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.680 
see the diagram you know if you just
need<00:02:20.950> to<00:02:21.100> clarify<00:02:21.340> exactly<00:02:22.239> where<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.510> notes

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
need to clarify exactly where the notes

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.570 
need to clarify exactly where the notes
go<00:02:22.959> now<00:02:23.590> what<00:02:23.799> I'm<00:02:23.860> going<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.040> ask<00:02:24.160> you<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.400> do

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
go now what I'm going to ask you to do

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.670 
go now what I'm going to ask you to do
is<00:02:24.760> hold<00:02:24.970> down<00:02:25.180> with<00:02:25.540> plenty<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:25.959> pressure<00:02:26.230> and

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
is hold down with plenty of pressure and

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.580 
is hold down with plenty of pressure and
strum<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.580> strings

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.800 

and<00:02:30.980> ideally<00:02:31.489> all<00:02:31.819> of<00:02:32.030> those<00:02:32.180> notes<00:02:32.450> were<00:02:32.629> so

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
and ideally all of those notes were so

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.420 
and ideally all of those notes were so
nice<00:02:33.050> and<00:02:33.080> clear<00:02:33.560> like<00:02:33.769> that<00:02:33.980> but<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.400> be

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
nice and clear like that but to be

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.309 
nice and clear like that but to be
honest<00:02:34.790> I'd<00:02:34.970> be<00:02:35.180> surprised<00:02:35.660> if<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:36.019> get<00:02:36.170> it

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
honest I'd be surprised if you get it

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.710 
honest I'd be surprised if you get it
signed<00:02:36.500> in<00:02:36.620> perfect<00:02:37.099> straight<00:02:37.370> away<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:38.569> would

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
signed in perfect straight away it would

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.479 
signed in perfect straight away it would
be<00:02:38.840> it'd<00:02:39.349> be<00:02:39.379> perfectly<00:02:39.950> normal<00:02:40.310> if<00:02:40.400> it

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
be it'd be perfectly normal if it

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.800 
be it'd be perfectly normal if it
sounded<00:02:40.849> more<00:02:40.940> like<00:02:41.000> this<00:02:42.310> at<00:02:43.310> first<00:02:43.700> now<00:02:44.599> let

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
sounded more like this at first now let

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.110 
sounded more like this at first now let
me<00:02:44.900> explain<00:02:45.349> some<00:02:46.190> common<00:02:46.580> mistakes<00:02:46.670> that

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
me explain some common mistakes that

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.970 
me explain some common mistakes that
people<00:02:47.239> make<00:02:47.660> when<00:02:47.840> learning<00:02:48.080> chords<00:02:48.560> what

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
people make when learning chords what

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.289 
people make when learning chords what
you<00:02:49.099> need<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.340> do<00:02:49.519> is<00:02:49.640> make<00:02:49.849> sure<00:02:49.879> you're

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
you need to do is make sure you're

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:51.970 
you need to do is make sure you're
holding<00:02:50.660> down<00:02:50.810> with<00:02:50.989> the<00:02:51.080> tip<00:02:51.260> of<00:02:51.470> your<00:02:51.500> finger

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
holding down with the tip of your finger

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.979 
holding down with the tip of your finger
with<00:02:52.129> plenty<00:02:52.519> of<00:02:52.549> pressure<00:02:52.819> and<00:02:53.239> you<00:02:53.299> need<00:02:53.840> to

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
with plenty of pressure and you need to

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.080 
with plenty of pressure and you need to
arch<00:02:54.230> these<00:02:54.650> fingers<00:02:55.129> up<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.519> the<00:02:55.670> reason<00:02:56.060> for

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
arch these fingers up and the reason for

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.479 
arch these fingers up and the reason for
that<00:02:56.360> is<00:02:56.629> because<00:02:56.900> you<00:02:57.290> want<00:02:57.620> plenty<00:02:57.950> of<00:02:58.160> space

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
that is because you want plenty of space

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.460 
that is because you want plenty of space
underneath<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.239> fingers<00:02:59.690> what<00:03:00.230> we<00:03:00.319> don't

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
underneath the fingers what we don't

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.229 
underneath the fingers what we don't
want<00:03:00.739> to<00:03:00.799> happen<00:03:00.950> is<00:03:01.310> for<00:03:01.519> the<00:03:01.760> back<00:03:01.940> of<00:03:02.090> these

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
want to happen is for the back of these

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.539 
want to happen is for the back of these
fingers<00:03:02.630> accidentally<00:03:03.440> to<00:03:03.650> touch<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.310> next

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
fingers accidentally to touch the next

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.509 
fingers accidentally to touch the next
string<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.180> obstruct<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:05.959> note<00:03:06.280> so<00:03:07.280> when<00:03:07.430> you

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
string and obstruct the note so when you

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:08.770 
string and obstruct the note so when you
pluck<00:03:07.760> each<00:03:07.940> of<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.239> strings<00:03:08.540> with<00:03:08.720> the

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
pluck each of the strings with the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.170 
pluck each of the strings with the
plectrum

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.569 

it<00:03:13.810> should<00:03:14.109> say<00:03:14.260> nice<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.890> clear<00:03:15.129> like<00:03:15.310> that

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
it should say nice and clear like that

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.699 
it should say nice and clear like that
so<00:03:16.209> if<00:03:16.299> any<00:03:16.450> of<00:03:16.569> these<00:03:16.659> notes<00:03:16.959> I'll<00:03:17.200> incorrect

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
so if any of these notes I'll incorrect

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.170 
so if any of these notes I'll incorrect
is<00:03:17.890> probably<00:03:18.250> because<00:03:18.430> you're<00:03:18.549> accidentally

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
is probably because you're accidentally

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.720 
is probably because you're accidentally
touching<00:03:19.840> one<00:03:20.769> of<00:03:20.799> the<00:03:21.040> strings<00:03:21.400> with<00:03:21.700> the

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
touching one of the strings with the

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.059 
touching one of the strings with the
back<00:03:22.000> of<00:03:22.180> your<00:03:22.209> fingers<00:03:22.719> accidentally<00:03:23.560> okay

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
back of your fingers accidentally okay

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:25.770 
back of your fingers accidentally okay
so<00:03:24.519> it<00:03:24.670> might<00:03:24.790> take<00:03:25.060> a<00:03:25.090> little<00:03:25.269> bit<00:03:25.420> of<00:03:25.599> work

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
so it might take a little bit of work

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.360 
so it might take a little bit of work
and<00:03:26.049> you'll<00:03:26.170> need<00:03:26.319> to<00:03:26.439> shuffle<00:03:26.709> your<00:03:27.010> fingers

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
and you'll need to shuffle your fingers

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.580 
and you'll need to shuffle your fingers
around<00:03:27.459> and<00:03:27.790> get<00:03:27.939> used<00:03:28.209> to<00:03:28.329> how<00:03:28.989> to<00:03:29.049> hold<00:03:29.379> down

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
around and get used to how to hold down

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.199 
around and get used to how to hold down
the<00:03:29.739> cord<00:03:30.010> but<00:03:30.189> eventually<00:03:30.790> you'll<00:03:30.969> get<00:03:31.090> it

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
the cord but eventually you'll get it

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.020 
the cord but eventually you'll get it
signing<00:03:31.540> nice<00:03:31.659> and<00:03:31.900> clear

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
signing nice and clear

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.420 
signing nice and clear
so<00:03:34.690> that's<00:03:34.870> something<00:03:35.050> to<00:03:35.260> work<00:03:35.410> towards<00:03:36.070> so

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
so that's something to work towards so

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.920 
so that's something to work towards so
next<00:03:36.640> chord<00:03:36.940> I<00:03:37.000> want<00:03:37.150> to<00:03:37.240> show<00:03:37.360> you<00:03:37.420> is<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:37.750> AE

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
next chord I want to show you is the AE

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.110 
next chord I want to show you is the AE
chord<00:03:38.290> and<00:03:38.500> it<00:03:38.590> looks<00:03:38.800> like<00:03:39.040> this<00:03:39.250> so<00:03:39.910> what<00:03:40.060> I'm

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
chord and it looks like this so what I'm

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.610 
chord and it looks like this so what I'm
going<00:03:40.210> to<00:03:40.270> ask<00:03:40.390> you<00:03:40.540> to<00:03:40.660> do<00:03:40.870> is<00:03:41.110> to<00:03:41.320> put<00:03:41.500> your

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
going to ask you to do is to put your

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.470 
going to ask you to do is to put your
first<00:03:41.830> finger<00:03:41.980> on<00:03:42.520> the<00:03:42.580> fourth<00:03:43.060> string<00:03:43.150> at

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
first finger on the fourth string at

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.600 
first finger on the fourth string at
fret<00:03:43.510> 2<00:03:43.900> and<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.860> middle<00:03:45.100> finger<00:03:45.310> on<00:03:45.460> the

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
fret 2 and the middle finger on the

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.660 
fret 2 and the middle finger on the
third<00:03:45.940> string<00:03:45.970> at<00:03:46.630> fret<00:03:46.690> 2<00:03:47.170> and<00:03:47.440> then<00:03:48.160> the

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
third string at fret 2 and then the

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.430 
third string at fret 2 and then the
third<00:03:49.150> finger<00:03:49.390> on<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.630> second<00:03:50.080> string<00:03:50.110> at

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
third finger on the second string at

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.370 
third finger on the second string at
fret<00:03:50.470> 2<00:03:51.010> so<00:03:51.580> they're<00:03:52.030> all<00:03:52.240> at<00:03:52.450> fret<00:03:52.690> 2<00:03:52.959> but

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
fret 2 so they're all at fret 2 but

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.960 
fret 2 so they're all at fret 2 but
unfortunately<00:03:54.070> there's<00:03:54.280> not<00:03:54.400> quite<00:03:54.730> enough

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
unfortunately there's not quite enough

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.570 
unfortunately there's not quite enough
room<00:03:55.030> really<00:03:55.630> to<00:03:55.780> fit<00:03:56.050> them<00:03:56.230> all<00:03:56.350> in<00:03:56.590> ideally

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
room really to fit them all in ideally

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.100 
room really to fit them all in ideally
we'd<00:03:57.790> like<00:03:57.820> to<00:03:58.090> get<00:03:58.240> them<00:03:58.420> right<00:03:58.570> next<00:03:58.900> to<00:03:59.020> the

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
we'd like to get them right next to the

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.530 
we'd like to get them right next to the
fret<00:03:59.380> but<00:03:59.680> in<00:03:59.950> reality<00:04:00.250> what<00:04:00.760> happens<00:04:01.180> is<00:04:01.330> we

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
fret but in reality what happens is we

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.210 
fret but in reality what happens is we
end<00:04:01.570> up<00:04:01.870> using<00:04:02.170> them<00:04:02.410> at<00:04:02.500> an<00:04:02.620> angle<00:04:02.740> like<00:04:03.190> this

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
end up using them at an angle like this

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.920 
end up using them at an angle like this
because<00:04:03.790> that's<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.209> only<00:04:04.300> way<00:04:04.510> really<00:04:04.750> to

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
because that's the only way really to

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.140 
because that's the only way really to
squash<00:04:05.680> them<00:04:05.920> in<00:04:06.070> there<00:04:06.310> and<00:04:06.790> of<00:04:07.090> course

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
squash them in there and of course

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.850 
squash them in there and of course
everyone's<00:04:07.750> hands<00:04:08.110> are<00:04:08.200> different<00:04:08.350> you<00:04:08.739> know

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
everyone's hands are different you know

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.560 
everyone's hands are different you know
if<00:04:09.040> you've<00:04:09.190> got<00:04:09.340> skinny<00:04:09.700> little<00:04:09.880> fingers<00:04:10.120> then

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
if you've got skinny little fingers then

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.020 
if you've got skinny little fingers then
you'll<00:04:10.840> probably<00:04:11.020> find<00:04:11.260> it<00:04:11.410> easier<00:04:11.800> so<00:04:12.459> look

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
you'll probably find it easier so look

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.610 
you'll probably find it easier so look
at<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.239> chord<00:04:13.450> chart<00:04:13.750> next<00:04:13.900> to<00:04:14.110> me<00:04:14.230> just<00:04:14.530> to

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
at the chord chart next to me just to

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.840 
at the chord chart next to me just to
clarify<00:04:14.830> what<00:04:15.430> notes

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
clarify what notes

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.180 
clarify what notes
we're<00:04:16.419> holding<00:04:16.720> down<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:17.440> with<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:17.620> a<00:04:17.650> chord

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
we're holding down and with the a chord

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.610 
we're holding down and with the a chord
we're<00:04:18.459> just<00:04:18.880> going<00:04:19.030> to<00:04:19.090> use<00:04:19.239> five<00:04:19.510> strings<00:04:20.019> and

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
we're just going to use five strings and

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.350 
we're just going to use five strings and
what<00:04:20.859> I<00:04:20.890> mean<00:04:21.100> by<00:04:21.160> that<00:04:21.370> is<00:04:21.760> we're<00:04:21.970> not<00:04:22.150> going

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
what I mean by that is we're not going

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.610 
what I mean by that is we're not going
to<00:04:22.390> pluck<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.690> sixth<00:04:22.990> string<00:04:23.230> we're<00:04:23.440> just

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
to pluck the sixth string we're just

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
to pluck the sixth string we're just
going<00:04:23.800> to<00:04:23.860> pluck<00:04:24.010> the<00:04:24.130> fifth<00:04:24.400> string

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
going to pluck the fifth string

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.990 
going to pluck the fifth string
downwards<00:04:25.150> like<00:04:25.330> this

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.260 

okay<00:04:30.080> now<00:04:30.380> of<00:04:30.650> course<00:04:30.680> like<00:04:31.100> I<00:04:31.370> said<00:04:31.400> before<00:04:31.790> it

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
okay now of course like I said before it

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.030 
okay now of course like I said before it
would<00:04:32.360> be<00:04:32.420> unusual<00:04:33.170> if<00:04:33.290> you<00:04:33.380> got<00:04:33.560> it<00:04:33.680> signing

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
would be unusual if you got it signing

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.210 
would be unusual if you got it signing
perfect<00:04:34.580> straight<00:04:34.880> away<00:04:35.290> you<00:04:36.290> know<00:04:36.440> what

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
perfect straight away you know what

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.280 
perfect straight away you know what
usually<00:04:37.460> happens<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.180> back<00:04:38.390> of<00:04:38.600> this<00:04:38.750> finger

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
usually happens the back of this finger

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.860 
usually happens the back of this finger
on<00:04:39.500> a<00:04:40.010> cord<00:04:40.370> accidentally<00:04:41.150> touches<00:04:41.510> the<00:04:41.630> first

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
on a cord accidentally touches the first

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.660 
on a cord accidentally touches the first
string<00:04:42.230> so<00:04:42.650> what<00:04:42.800> I<00:04:42.830> want<00:04:43.010> you<00:04:43.070> to<00:04:43.220> do<00:04:43.340> is<00:04:43.460> make

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
sure that the first string is open

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.880 
sure that the first string is open
correctly<00:04:45.740> as<00:04:46.100> it<00:04:46.250> should<00:04:46.490> be<00:04:47.590> and<00:04:48.590> if<00:04:48.680> it<00:04:48.800> is

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
correctly as it should be and if it is

okay<00:04:55.780> good<00:04:56.050> so<00:04:56.620> now<00:04:56.770> let's<00:04:56.980> move<00:04:57.130> on<00:04:57.310> to<00:04:57.340> the

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
okay good so now let's move on to the

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.190 
okay good so now let's move on to the
third<00:04:57.970> chord<00:04:58.270> I'm<00:04:58.419> going<00:04:58.570> to<00:04:58.630> show<00:04:58.780> you<00:04:58.840> which

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
third chord I'm going to show you which

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.129 
third chord I'm going to show you which
is<00:04:59.230> the<00:04:59.590> D<00:04:59.800> chord<00:05:00.100> so<00:05:00.820> if<00:05:01.150> you<00:05:01.389> put<00:05:01.780> your<00:05:01.930> first

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
is the D chord so if you put your first

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.159 
is the D chord so if you put your first
finger<00:05:02.650> on<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:02.889> third<00:05:03.310> string<00:05:03.610> at<00:05:04.300> fret<00:05:04.630> two

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
finger on the third string at fret two

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.110 
finger on the third string at fret two
now<00:05:05.770> listen<00:05:06.070> carefully<00:05:06.250> to<00:05:06.700> this<00:05:06.850> because

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
now listen carefully to this because

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.730 
now listen carefully to this because
some<00:05:07.330> people<00:05:07.360> get<00:05:07.750> muddled<00:05:08.080> up<00:05:08.200> with<00:05:08.350> this<00:05:08.470> one

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
some people get muddled up with this one

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.890 
some people get muddled up with this one
the<00:05:09.190> middle<00:05:09.550> finger<00:05:09.910> goes<00:05:10.120> on<00:05:10.330> to<00:05:10.480> the<00:05:10.600> first

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
the middle finger goes on to the first

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.680 
the middle finger goes on to the first
string<00:05:11.230> of<00:05:11.470> fret<00:05:11.860> 2<00:05:12.100> and<00:05:12.370> then<00:05:13.210> this<00:05:13.360> third

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
string of fret 2 and then this third

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
don't have to keep rewinding the video

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.360 
don't have to keep rewinding the video
and<00:05:58.750> practice<00:05:59.229> them<00:05:59.620> and<00:05:59.650> practice<00:05:59.890> them<00:06:00.160> and

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
and practice them and practice them and

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.240 
and practice them and practice them and
get<00:06:00.520> them<00:06:00.640> signing<00:06:00.850> nice<00:06:01.090> and<00:06:01.360> clear

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.260 

now<00:06:05.250> there's<00:06:05.490> something<00:06:05.670> else<00:06:05.910> I<00:06:06.060> want<00:06:06.240> to

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
now there's something else I want to

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.420 
now there's something else I want to
tell<00:06:06.480> you<00:06:06.690> you<00:06:06.900> may<00:06:07.110> have<00:06:07.260> noticed<00:06:07.770> my<00:06:07.860> thumb

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
tell you you may have noticed my thumb

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.640 
tell you you may have noticed my thumb
sort<00:06:09.150> of<00:06:09.240> kind<00:06:09.510> of<00:06:09.600> hanging<00:06:09.900> around<00:06:09.960> here<00:06:10.440> over

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
sort of kind of hanging around here over

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:11.870 
sort of kind of hanging around here over
the<00:06:10.740> top<00:06:10.770> of<00:06:10.950> the<00:06:11.130> guitar<00:06:11.250> and<00:06:11.460> there<00:06:11.730> is<00:06:11.850> a

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 
the top of the guitar and there is a

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.180 
the top of the guitar and there is a
reason<00:06:12.360> for<00:06:12.390> this<00:06:12.660> when<00:06:13.530> we<00:06:13.650> strum<00:06:13.890> the<00:06:14.040> a

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
reason for this when we strum the a

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.910 
reason for this when we strum the a
chord<00:06:14.640> for<00:06:15.540> example<00:06:15.570> we<00:06:16.200> don't<00:06:16.380> want<00:06:16.740> the

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:16.920 
chord for example we don't want the

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.620 
chord for example we don't want the
sixth<00:06:17.250> string<00:06:17.490> to<00:06:17.730> accidentally<00:06:18.420> make<00:06:18.600> a

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
sixth string to accidentally make a

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.870 
sixth string to accidentally make a
noise<00:06:18.870> so<00:06:19.530> what<00:06:19.680> I'm<00:06:19.800> doing<00:06:19.860> is<00:06:20.250> gently

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
noise so what I'm doing is gently

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.180 
noise so what I'm doing is gently
touching<00:06:21.330> it<00:06:21.480> just<00:06:21.510> a<00:06:21.840> little<00:06:22.140> bit<00:06:22.350> with<00:06:22.950> the

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
touching it just a little bit with the

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.700 
touching it just a little bit with the
thumb<00:06:23.430> and<00:06:23.940> that's<00:06:24.210> enough<00:06:24.840> just<00:06:25.140> to<00:06:25.200> mute<00:06:25.530> the

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
thumb and that's enough just to mute the

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.460 
thumb and that's enough just to mute the
note<00:06:25.920> so<00:06:26.250> it<00:06:26.370> it<00:06:27.270> stops<00:06:27.870> the<00:06:28.080> sixth<00:06:28.350> string

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.470 
note so it it stops the sixth string

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.140 
note so it it stops the sixth string
from<00:06:28.650> accidentally<00:06:29.190> making<00:06:29.520> a<00:06:29.610> noise<00:06:29.730> and

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
from accidentally making a noise and

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.610 
from accidentally making a noise and
then<00:06:30.570> when<00:06:30.780> you<00:06:30.870> strum<00:06:31.200> all<00:06:31.350> the<00:06:31.410> five<00:06:31.740> strings

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
then when you strum all the five strings

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.350 
then when you strum all the five strings
and<00:06:34.190> you<00:06:34.340> know<00:06:34.490> you're<00:06:34.700> only<00:06:34.820> just<00:06:35.210> getting

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
and you know you're only just getting

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.150 
and you know you're only just getting
the<00:06:35.510> correct<00:06:35.780> notes<00:06:36.080> that<00:06:36.320> you<00:06:36.410> want<00:06:36.620> so

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 
the correct notes that you want so

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.130 
the correct notes that you want so
that's<00:06:37.310> the<00:06:37.490> reason<00:06:37.640> for<00:06:37.850> that<00:06:38.120> so<00:06:38.480> what<00:06:38.990> you

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:39.140 
that's the reason for that so what you

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.960 
that's the reason for that so what you
can<00:06:39.320> do<00:06:39.560> once<00:06:39.920> you've<00:06:40.070> learned<00:06:40.310> these<00:06:40.490> chords

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
can do once you've learned these chords

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.360 
can do once you've learned these chords
is<00:06:41.210> put<00:06:42.050> them<00:06:42.170> into<00:06:42.320> a<00:06:42.410> bit<00:06:42.590> of<00:06:42.620> a<00:06:42.740> sequence<00:06:43.190> for

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.370 
is put them into a bit of a sequence for

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.800 
is put them into a bit of a sequence for
example<00:06:43.400> you<00:06:44.030> could<00:06:44.270> play<00:06:44.450> the<00:06:44.630> a<00:06:44.810> chord

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.870 

four<00:06:48.440> times<00:06:48.800> and<00:06:49.130> then<00:06:49.220> you<00:06:49.310> could<00:06:49.430> play<00:06:49.520> the<00:06:49.700> D

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 
four times and then you could play the D

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.469 
four times and then you could play the D
chord

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:55.650 

back<00:06:53.020> to<00:06:53.199> the<00:06:53.319> a

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:55.660 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.029 

and<00:06:56.230> then<00:06:56.380> the<00:06:56.500> e<00:06:56.530> chord

00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:10.240 

and<00:06:59.430> you<00:06:59.520> can<00:06:59.639> do<00:06:59.759> that<00:06:59.909> again

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:10.250 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:12.790 

so<00:07:11.090> you<00:07:11.150> can<00:07:11.330> begin<00:07:11.480> practicing<00:07:12.260> changing

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 
so you can begin practicing changing

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.200 
so you can begin practicing changing
from<00:07:12.980> one<00:07:13.160> core<00:07:13.400> to<00:07:13.430> the<00:07:13.670> other<00:07:13.820> and<00:07:14.120> you'll
