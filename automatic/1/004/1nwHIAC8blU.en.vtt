00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.109
 Hello everyone, well, now that the 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.269
 motorcycle engine gp starts to be 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.230
 available I will analyze an accessory 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.019
 that the truth is quite interesting 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.160
 well here I have the box this is a 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.470
 tuner 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.840
 to finish is android that has the 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.510
 function or knit as is the case of the motor 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.610
 or the motorcycle g in this case when 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.259
 unpack this box what we 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.710
 we find is with this little 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:34.219
 adapter and an antenna 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.160
 so you can see the whole process 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:39.870
 so it's simple I'm going to do it here 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.289
 live with you 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.520
 to give you a little idea 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:46.950
 so basically we have here the 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.880
 antenna 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.880
 that we connect 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.989
 and then we have to install a 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.989
 application in the terminal 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.960
 I already have here selected the play 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.989
 store and here I show you the application 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.989
 call 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:15.720
 of TV does not focus the camera well but 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.720
 well then we just installed it 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.520
 but it would simply be execute 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.930
 together with the device 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.610
 connected then let's see 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.610
 that is finished installing 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.900
 there he is installing 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.090
 and it's already installed 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.189
 now we are simply going to connect 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.720
 the adapter but well before we go to 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.380
 extend it 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.380
 flag 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.280
 since we see 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.860
 there is 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.920
 I was connected and call me a 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.050
 message 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.270
 and you ask me if I want to open the 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.590
 application automatically when connecting 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:20.050
 this usb device 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.050
 well in this case I do not want 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.580
 and simply 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.450
 and executed the application 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.430
 and here is 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.860
 then we see that it makes good welcome 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.050
 to installation and there is a guide a 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.640
 assistant that we go during the 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.640
 process then we give you next 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.580
 go then it seems that you have to give him the 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.990
 permission that was previously rejected 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.860
 then we go 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.860
 and do it again 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.480
 we give you to accept 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.050
 now it seems that we are already in 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.800
 terms 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.460
 the next one now they ask us to select 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:15.069
 the location I guess it will be for 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:17.710
 help channel tuning 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.890
 so in this case he told me 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.640
 United Kingdom and there you are scanning 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.500
 the channels good as I did not want to bore 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.820
 with the scan I shortened the video and 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:33.240
 well here we can see that it has already 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.240
 finished and I've already found 73 channels 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.100
 then we give made 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:42.880
 and here the guide already appears 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.330
 are the localized channels and not adjustments 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.520
 Well, we can 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.010
 order according to our preferences the 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.060
 different channels then it also counts 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:57.030
 with the function 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.030
 pg that is to see the schedule 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.690
 of each channel every hour 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.250
 or the truth is that it is quite 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.970
 complete the program 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:11.290
 and well let's do a test 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.290
 of a channel for example 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.570
 and there we see 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.160
 the tuner in high definition 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:35.320
 perfect and clarified that this does not pull 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.970
 data connection is to say no need 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.530
 Internet connection is simply with 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.530
 the adapter and the antenna 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.289
 I'm going to lower my voice a little 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.030
 and here, it gives us the option of even 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.670
 record a good program expand the 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:57.060
 screen take a catch and then 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.710
 adjustments to be able to put subtitles or 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.110
 change the audio track if it is 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.930
 in several languages and then good has 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.240
 here also a menu to be able 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.710
 download changing the channel by 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.710
 example let's change the bbc 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.180
 and there it is 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.200
 as you can appreciate the quality is very 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.840
 good and the signal also 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.580
 that is to say to the receiver I thought I was going to 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:34.009
 have difficulties in taking a signal but 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.510
 the truth is that he is wrong he is very 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:39.760
 all right 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.760
 let's make another channel change 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.640
 and there it is 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:53.849
 good as you see the truth is a 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:55.969
 a pretty interesting accessory given 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:57.889

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:00.529
 that you can store in any bag in 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:01.729

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:07.459
 program or a match or good 

00:06:04.369 --> 00:06:09.229
 just to kill the time if you 

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:13.249
 you connect to your terminal and you can 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:15.610
