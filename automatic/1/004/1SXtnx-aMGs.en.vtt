i<00:00:33.750> mean<00:00:33.960> it's<00:00:34.500> pretty<00:00:34.710> much<00:00:34.950> already<00:00:35.370> sent

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
i mean it's pretty much already sent

together<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.480> know<00:00:36.950> so<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.100> should<00:00:38.309> be<00:00:38.340> good

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
together you know so it should be good
