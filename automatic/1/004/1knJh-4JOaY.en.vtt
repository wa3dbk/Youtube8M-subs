00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.420
 all wrong to open it the insertion of 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:26.729

 coma kitsch you saw the ball here 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:12.030
 then of Cassano the optimal insertion from 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.860
 part of the building is the goal of one to one 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.520
 an action from inter and you get to equalize 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.520
 these with jokes 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:27.250

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.100
 Juve brand 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.970
 consequently you saw the parade of 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.830
 samir handanovic still there from the limit 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.190
 of the vidal area puts it in for 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.430
 the ball was out of the ball 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.430
 goes out 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.940
 but the ball out no boys 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.569

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.459
 action is not seemed the ball was out 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.580

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.310
 little or nothing here is breakfast 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.329
 there is no offside and so far 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.170
 we understand 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:38.260
 let's see the ball the goal is 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.260
