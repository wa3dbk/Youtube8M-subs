00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
out where we found the viral videos that

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.259 
out where we found the viral videos that
are<00:00:11.040> popular<00:00:11.400> on<00:00:11.459> the<00:00:11.490> Internet<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.059> show

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
are popular on the Internet and show

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.669 
are popular on the Internet and show
them<00:00:12.509> here<00:00:12.749> we're<00:00:12.900> talking<00:00:13.019> about<00:00:13.139> mass<00:00:13.410> and

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
them here we're talking about mass and

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.100 
them here we're talking about mass and
gas<00:00:13.830> because<00:00:14.190> we<00:00:14.309> know<00:00:14.400> that<00:00:14.429> smoking<00:00:15.240> emits

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.110 
gas because we know that smoking emits

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.350 
gas because we know that smoking emits
some<00:00:16.440> really<00:00:16.680> dangerous<00:00:16.950> toxic<00:00:17.640> air<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.150> the

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:18.360 
some really dangerous toxic air in the

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.420 
some really dangerous toxic air in the
atmosphere<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.560> think<00:00:19.770> smokers<00:00:20.130> are

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
atmosphere and I think smokers are

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.010 
atmosphere and I think smokers are
getting<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.700> big<00:00:20.940> problem<00:00:21.450> getting<00:00:21.690> away<00:00:21.810> from

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
getting a big problem getting away from

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.510 
getting a big problem getting away from
those<00:00:22.140> who<00:00:22.200> just<00:00:22.530> don't<00:00:22.560> smoke<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.040> can<00:00:23.340> ask

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520 
those who just don't smoke you can ask

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.310 
those who just don't smoke you can ask
our<00:00:23.760> control<00:00:24.510> room<00:00:24.660> if<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:24.930> don't<00:00:25.080> believe<00:00:25.200> me
