00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.059
 mock lego castle so here it is with 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.249

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.800
 so I came back from 17 and so I 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:32.099

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.579
 there and I note I expected 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.780
 really notebook so that's a 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.109
 keyword your pans 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.570
 so it's on a really green plate 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:51.449
 little mairat rather well done I 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.179
 so here we have some boots of 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.019
 straw with a peasant who is trying 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:01:00.030
 to pick them up a child who is watching from 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.070

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.470

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.180
 castle is rather well done so 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.100
 I put some stones as safe 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.650
 to show me a little that it's a 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.930
 old castle 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:18.930
 so here is a small window 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.990
 here so it's a triangle whose 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:27.890
 angles know it's a little I do not know 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.890

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:18.880
 delerm below so that's enough 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:21.010
 simple I find it not bad so here 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.380
 crenels here I have at the beginning I 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.820
 planned to do a roof I do them and I 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.010
 realized that it was 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:33.220

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.910
 inside I put two of the plates 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.700

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.440
