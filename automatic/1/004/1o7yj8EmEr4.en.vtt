out<00:02:41.080> fraudulent<00:02:41.470> clicks<00:02:41.860> already<00:02:42.250> how<00:02:43.150> many

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
out fraudulent clicks already how many

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.680 
out fraudulent clicks already how many
people<00:02:43.690> throughout<00:02:43.810> they're<00:02:44.440> not<00:02:44.560> saying

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
people throughout they're not saying

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.180 
people throughout they're not saying
whether<00:02:46.690> this<00:02:46.870> bows<00:02:47.140> good<00:02:47.530> or<00:02:47.650> bad<00:02:47.860> for<00:02:48.100> you

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
whether this bows good or bad for you

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.100 
whether this bows good or bad for you
two<00:02:48.370> it's<00:02:49.090> still<00:02:49.300> somewhat<00:02:49.630> in<00:02:49.660> question

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
two it's still somewhat in question

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.210 
two it's still somewhat in question
though<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:50.290> think<00:02:50.580> ultimately<00:02:51.580> it<00:02:51.940> bodes<00:02:52.209> well

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
though I think ultimately it bodes well

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.500 
though I think ultimately it bodes well
since<00:02:54.220> it's<00:02:54.400> such<00:02:54.550> a<00:02:54.580> common<00:02:54.940> occurrence<00:02:55.270> I

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
since it's such a common occurrence I

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.190 
since it's such a common occurrence I
said<00:02:55.690> google<00:02:56.140> has<00:02:56.320> so<00:02:56.709> much<00:02:56.860> experience<00:02:58.200> with

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
said google has so much experience with

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.850 
said google has so much experience with
this<00:03:00.209> eventually<00:03:01.209> they'll<00:03:01.390> be<00:03:01.480> all<00:03:01.630> right

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
this eventually they'll be all right

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.900 
this eventually they'll be all right
with<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:03.010> problem<00:03:03.959> with<00:03:04.959> this<00:03:05.200> for<00:03:06.190> me<00:03:06.400> is

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
with the problem with this for me is

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
with the problem with this for me is
their<00:03:07.180> lack<00:03:07.360> of<00:03:07.390> acknowledgement

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
their lack of acknowledgement

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.390 
their lack of acknowledgement
and<00:03:09.439> like<00:03:09.590> I<00:03:09.650> said<00:03:09.799> it<00:03:09.920> from<00:03:10.069> a<00:03:10.099> corporate

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
and like I said it from a corporate

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.030 
and like I said it from a corporate
standpoint<00:03:10.670> I<00:03:11.030> totally<00:03:11.209> get<00:03:11.510> it<00:03:11.739> but<00:03:12.739> from<00:03:12.950> a

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
standpoint I totally get it but from a

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.209 
standpoint I totally get it but from a
community<00:03:13.340> standpoint<00:03:14.239> I<00:03:15.010> liked<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:17.840> that<00:03:18.219> is

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:19.219 
community standpoint I liked and that is

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:23.520 
community standpoint I liked and that is
the<00:03:19.670> trick<00:03:20.000> for<00:03:20.680> YouTube<00:03:21.680> to<00:03:22.370> balance<00:03:22.909> that

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
the trick for YouTube to balance that

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.379 
the trick for YouTube to balance that
community<00:03:24.530> aspect<00:03:25.099> with<00:03:25.849> their<00:03:26.000> corporate

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
community aspect with their corporate

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:33.039 
community aspect with their corporate
needs<00:03:28.239> and<00:03:29.680> for<00:03:30.680> my<00:03:30.829> money<00:03:31.069> right<00:03:31.549> now<00:03:32.049> they're

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
needs and for my money right now they're

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.559 
needs and for my money right now they're
not<00:03:33.200> doing<00:03:33.349> the<00:03:33.469> best<00:03:33.620> job

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.069 

and<00:03:37.530> that<00:03:37.739> is<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.280> crux<00:03:38.489> of<00:03:38.700> that<00:03:39.450> this<00:03:39.810> is

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
and that is the crux of that this is

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.489 
and that is the crux of that this is
ultimately<00:03:40.560> a<00:03:40.709> business<00:03:41.219> and<00:03:41.959> even<00:03:42.959> though<00:03:43.109> we

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:43.499 
ultimately a business and even though we

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:46.550 
ultimately a business and even though we
have<00:03:44.219> made<00:03:45.060> this<00:03:45.239> a<00:03:45.359> community<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:45.989> are

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
have made this a community and are

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.619 
have made this a community and are
trying<00:03:46.799> to<00:03:46.889> make<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.099> a<00:03:47.159> community<00:03:47.549> it<00:03:47.760> is

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
trying to make it a community it is

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.920 
trying to make it a community it is
ultimately<00:03:49.260> corporates<00:03:49.829> and<00:03:50.719> while<00:03:51.719> deep

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
ultimately corporates and while deep

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.220 
ultimately corporates and while deep
down<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.379> side<00:03:52.560> I<00:03:52.590> knew<00:03:52.980> that<00:03:53.810> it's<00:03:54.810> easy<00:03:55.019> to

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
down the side I knew that it's easy to

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.069 
down the side I knew that it's easy to
forget<00:03:55.819> now<00:03:56.819> when<00:03:57.000> confronted<00:03:57.569> with<00:03:57.599> a<00:03:57.719> cold

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
forget now when confronted with a cold

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.819 
forget now when confronted with a cold
hard<00:03:58.530> corporate<00:03:59.430> truth<00:04:00.379> it's<00:04:01.379> just<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.680> little

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
hard corporate truth it's just a little

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.589 
hard corporate truth it's just a little
disappointing<00:04:03.859> until<00:04:04.859> next<00:04:04.980> time<00:04:05.540> thanks<00:04:06.540> for
