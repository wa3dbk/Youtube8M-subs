packed<00:03:33.050> peanut<00:03:33.560> butter<00:03:33.680> jars<00:03:33.920> filled<00:03:34.300> which

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
packed peanut butter jars filled which

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:42.430 
packed peanut butter jars filled which
total<00:03:38.980> 314<00:03:39.980> grams<00:03:40.370> worth<00:03:40.810> both<00:03:41.810> jars<00:03:42.080> together

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
total 314 grams worth both jars together

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.980 
total 314 grams worth both jars together
had<00:03:42.650> a<00:03:42.680> mass<00:03:42.980> of<00:03:43.190> 389<00:03:43.880> grams<00:03:44.360> and<00:03:44.720> then<00:03:44.810> you

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
had a mass of 389 grams and then you

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.050 
had a mass of 389 grams and then you
subtract<00:03:45.410> the<00:03:45.590> tare<00:03:45.860> weight<00:03:45.890> of<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.580> plastic

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
jars and you get a total of 314 and I am

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.990 
jars and you get a total of 314 and I am
