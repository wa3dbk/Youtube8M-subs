00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.419
 and welcome to this new comment 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:27.849
 harry pokemon in this episode 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:28.379
 I'm going to talk about pokemon 0 not 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.020
 him 

00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:33.780
 I was talking about missing you I'm going to 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.969
 pronounce like that even if theoretically 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.079
 his name should be pronounced messing 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:42.339
 number which means missing numbers 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.190
 but all the French people I heard 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:47.920
 pronounce the name of this thing May 10 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.780
 signals so the pronoun would be like that 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.120
 for the sake of simplicity 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.059
 to note that the confusion comes from the fact 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.319
 that in pokémon red and blue we had 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.890
 the impression that his name was written 

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:03.909
 like that when in fact it is written v 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.190
 like these he even has a Japanese name 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.770
 katsuba who actually means 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.600
 missing numbers 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.090
 granny Senio is simply a putt 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.770
 due to a coding error that has never 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.080
 been corrected from the first pokemon games 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.940
 not even sometimes that emanates yellow version 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.710
 even if one makes an effort to try 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.750
 to ensure that the renter does not 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.250
 not meet in this comment and I 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.890
 will you talk about the mysteries that 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.410
 surround this bug which will take us to 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.340
 dig up on it recreating puy from the 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.760
 first generation 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.350
 but first of all let's talk about the bugue there 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.800
 appears in the game as a pokemon 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.900
 wild 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.330
 there are several methods for the 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.730
 make appear the best known being the 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.910
 crimson troy shore bug 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.290
 in this case you had to jade yale you 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.330
 talk to the man who teaches you to 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.650
 capture pokemon you tell him that 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.250
 you do not know how to capture a 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.470
 pokemon 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.550
 then after the cutscene you come 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:01.400
 at cramoisy you use surf on the 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.890
 right bank and seeking thereby you 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.500
 could meet higher pokemon 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.170
 again without their species being determined 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.760
 by your name in the game and with the 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.950
 chance you could meet the 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.310
 seniors but if you do not have any 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.870
 luck 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.010
 at the moment we sign is supposed 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:22.040
 appear the game bugs and you do not 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.870
 could that and between if you could 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.940
 meet the signals you can the 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.680
 capture and if you capture him the 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.280
 sixth item in your inventory was 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.910
 become available in 128 example 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.590
 traditionally the player gets 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.540
 used this trick to have 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.470
 a lot of great good words there were 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.390
 also consequences 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.010
 after defeating the league you 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.830
 note in your pc that your 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.390
 pantheon and corrupt or disorganized and 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.420
 that's because you provoked 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.459
 the appearance of blood sugar at the same if you 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.680
 try to meet him and that his beautiful 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:55.130
 only at the moment of his appearance like me 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.780
 the pantheon will be agreed however in 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.540
 pokemon yellow version without 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.860
 get rid half signals they have 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.050
 made sure we could 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.790
 met pokemon in the right bank 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.410
 so this technique had become 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.989
 unusable in pokemon gold version 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.300
 now here are some things that 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.340
 many people still do not know 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.959
 some cases if you know the 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.250
 case of me signals you should know 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:21.860
 who via another but signals called m 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:25.459
 and if this one niocan level he evolves 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.250
 and guess what's going on ex in this 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.560
 case there me signals becomes proof that 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.680
 Ben and Bécancour ex who basically had to 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.230
 to be this was planned in the game but 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.910
 because this pokemon had to be 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.370
 his story up front live in the 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.100
 first generation resulted in 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.130
 complications that made that bp when 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.940
 coex has been like and from the reality of 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.940
 playable pokemon 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.100
 I could not test it myself but 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.460
 it seems that it only works on 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.160
 the mysterious called m and laid 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.080
 signals called m is everything 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.520
 simply a demis signals that is 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.900
 different from the other me signals there you 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.209
 you ask what I'm talking about 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.430
 indeed there are several me signals 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.340
 different and even if some get 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.260
 differentiates for example sign me om the me 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.470
 signing with the skeleton spy of 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.200
 terra ours kabuto skeleton and 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.630
 the spectrum of the pokemon tower every 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.450
 others are almost identical to 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.190
 clouds of pixels and despite this 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.750
 resemblance all the miss ignorons 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.570
 a different database 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.340
 in fact it's not just me signals all 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.800
 pokemon have a database 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.510
 different in the pokemon game and in 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.060
 gathering all the disputes myself 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.070
 signals we discover that 39 to love each other 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.840
 signals have a database that 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:52.330
 corresponds to second pokemon tea 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.330
 generation the following 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.770
 yes at the base there must have been 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:06.110
 about 190 pokemon in the first 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.950
 generation but the memory of the games 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.650
 was weak 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.320
 so we had to redirect and order 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.550
 point they become miss is ripe 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.720
 of course you will make me 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.200
 remarks to contradict me 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:21.680
 it's anything in the game there is 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.630
 pokemon piss at the base it was not 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.070
 grandfathers of pokemon but just tea 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.510
 wild pokemon but as we 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.950
 did not expect pokemon 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.620
 meets a colossal success 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:33.310
 we preferred to keep their evolution not 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.500
 for the first generation 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.410
 there had stirred up narrative zion qs but this 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.120
 are ten houses spend it I 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.510
 remind you that in blue pokemon and 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.610
 red 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.880
 magneti and magne and we were only 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.130
 electric type and if it is the 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.750
 wall tunes and if it exists today do not 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.070
 are that improved versions of this 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.770
 which was planned for the first 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.110
 generation at the base can be that 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.820
 physically as much as its etymology tunes 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.150
 wall had no connection with the type 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.400
 steel and I also have others 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.580
 remarks to make in the lot we have them 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.720
 legendary felines or legendary dogs 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.390
 since March 2013 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.130
 to my knowledge the rumor is raging 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.050
 like what pokemon have been 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.120
 resurrected in the form of felines 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.620
 legendary share in the waters would be the 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.780
 three evolutions to evolve in the 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.660
 first generation but I have a 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:26.000
 other proposal to make and if in fact 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.890
 at the base the facts a legendary 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.630
 were not legendary pokemon 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.250
 but the evolutions of the three 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.070
 main forms evolved and evolve 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.080
 so basically it was maybe planned 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:39.380
 that this weekend the wharf by rains 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.900
 Dax is changing the lee entei 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:45.080
 lion of volcanoes is the evolution of 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:47.210
 pyrolysis and riku the shooting of thunder be 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.120
 evolution dewalt ali this is not good 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:52.520
 sure you're so potez and again a 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.360
 Once the design could have been different 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.110
 the time 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.750
 I would also like to draw your 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:00.520
 attention to others the fact that this 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.500
 pokemon was planned for the first 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.080
 generation could be the key to 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.880
 mystery why a pokemon from the 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.590
 second generation appears whose 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.810
 first episode of the cartoon 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:13.449
 whereas based on cartoon 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.919
 had to end after the league followed 

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:17.440
 an epilogue in a movie 

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:19.300
 please note that two memories is 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.160
 the only time I see a euro of 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.960
 this color which proves that the 

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.539
 pokemon designs provided in the 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.909
 first generation could be 

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:29.370
 different before their integration into 

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:31.960
 the second generation 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:34.720
 I would like to finish with a fact that you 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.949
 will not hurt and louga no it's just 

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.509
 to say that their data 

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:39.940
 correspond to the mit signals that have 

00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:43.289
 took the shape of the skeletons of cabu top 

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:46.180
 and tera and mit signals spectrum 

00:07:43.289 --> 00:07:48.310
 as well as a bug but signals 

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.409
 containing him secrets uncovered 

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:52.479
 by computer scientists who analyzed 

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:54.520
 and cartridges the first games and 

00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:56.919
 perhaps that will reveal yet more 

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.690
 mysteries unknown but in the meantime I 

00:07:56.919 --> 00:08:01.680
 you say stay connected and at very 

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.680
 soon on eternia
