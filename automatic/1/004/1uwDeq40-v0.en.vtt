glance<00:01:50.289> normally<00:01:51.289> when<00:01:51.439> I<00:01:51.469> lay<00:01:51.890> down<00:01:51.920> the

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
glance normally when I lay down the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.550 
glance normally when I lay down the
irises<00:01:52.759> I<00:01:53.000> start<00:01:53.299> them<00:01:53.420> out<00:01:53.539> in<00:01:53.810> white

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
irises I start them out in white

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.830 
irises I start them out in white
but<00:01:55.310> because<00:01:55.609> of<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.819> camera<00:01:56.299> angle<00:01:56.689> I

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
but because of the camera angle I

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.029 
but because of the camera angle I
realized<00:01:57.140> you<00:01:57.289> couldn't<00:01:57.530> see<00:01:57.709> what<00:01:57.829> I<00:01:57.860> was

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.360 

as<00:02:18.959> far<00:02:19.959> as<00:02:20.079> the<00:02:20.200> kind<00:02:20.290> of<00:02:20.409> paints<00:02:20.739> I<00:02:20.859> use<00:02:21.129> I

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
as far as the kind of paints I use I

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.259 
as far as the kind of paints I use I
like<00:02:21.549> liquitex

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269

you can use any paints you want I just

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.610 
you can use any paints you want I just
choose<00:02:25.269> liquitex<00:02:25.719> because<00:02:26.079> it<00:02:26.200> has<00:02:26.349> a<00:02:26.379> nice

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
choose liquitex because it has a nice

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.720 
choose liquitex because it has a nice
high<00:02:26.920> pigment<00:02:28.409> also<00:02:29.409> it's<00:02:30.040> like<00:02:30.250> rubber<00:02:30.519> when

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
high pigment also it's like rubber when

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.589 
high pigment also it's like rubber when
it<00:02:30.819> dries<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.540> it's<00:02:31.959> affordable<00:02:32.379> pretty<00:02:33.010> much

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.240 

this<00:02:37.599> is<00:02:37.659> when<00:02:37.930> I<00:02:37.959> start<00:02:38.349> laying<00:02:38.560> down<00:02:38.709> color

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
this is when I start laying down color

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.879 
this is when I start laying down color
so<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:40.120> always<00:02:40.569> start<00:02:40.750> from<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.079> darkest<00:02:41.590> color

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:41.889 
so I always start from the darkest color

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:43.649 
so I always start from the darkest color
and<00:02:42.219> bring<00:02:42.489> it<00:02:42.639> up<00:02:42.819> to<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.150> lightest<00:02:43.540> color

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
and bring it up to the lightest color

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.379 
and bring it up to the lightest color
and<00:02:43.959> I<00:02:44.170> do<00:02:44.230> this<00:02:44.409> in<00:02:44.470> layers<00:02:44.859> so<00:02:45.790> for<00:02:46.269> this

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:46.389 
and I do this in layers so for this

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:47.819 
and I do this in layers so for this
because<00:02:46.689> we're<00:02:46.840> doing<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:47.109> zombie<00:02:47.290> white<00:02:47.650> eye

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
because we're doing a zombie white eye

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.000 
because we're doing a zombie white eye
there's<00:02:48.579> gonna<00:02:48.790> be<00:02:49.209> gray<00:02:49.870> undertones<00:02:50.530> so<00:02:50.889> I'm

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
there's gonna be gray undertones so I'm

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.530 
there's gonna be gray undertones so I'm
gonna<00:02:51.099> start<00:02:51.430> down<00:02:51.669> putting<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.090> darkest

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
gonna start down putting the darkest

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.690

gray<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.079> then<00:02:53.650> I'm<00:02:53.739> gonna<00:02:53.889> work<00:02:54.159> my<00:02:54.370> way<00:02:54.519> up

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
gray and then I'm gonna work my way up

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.000 
gray and then I'm gonna work my way up
to<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.970> lightest<00:02:55.540> gray<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:56.019> don't<00:02:56.769> know<00:02:56.859> how

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
to the lightest gray I don't know how

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.089 
to the lightest gray I don't know how
other<00:02:57.250> doll<00:02:57.669> artists<00:02:58.180> do<00:02:58.329> their<00:02:58.540> work<00:02:59.099> but

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
other doll artists do their work but

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.039 
other doll artists do their work but
this<00:03:00.430> is<00:03:00.579> how<00:03:00.669> I<00:03:00.700> you<00:03:01.299> know<00:03:01.419> discover<00:03:01.780> that

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
this is how I you know discover that

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:14.860 
this is how I you know discover that
well<00:03:02.739> I<00:03:02.859> like<00:03:03.099> this<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.489> best<00:03:03.609> anyway

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.420 

pretty<00:03:15.870> much<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.349> animation<00:03:17.040> is<00:03:17.159> going<00:03:17.340> to

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
pretty much the animation is going to

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.960 
pretty much the animation is going to
show<00:03:17.640> you<00:03:17.700> how<00:03:18.540> I<00:03:18.569> do<00:03:18.810> this<00:03:19.730> instead<00:03:20.730> of<00:03:20.790> me

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
show you how I do this instead of me

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.699 
show you how I do this instead of me
going<00:03:21.150> on<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.599> on<00:03:21.690> about<00:03:21.750> it

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
going on and on about it

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.059 
going on and on about it
tediously<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:24.079> boring<00:03:25.079> you<00:03:25.200> have<00:03:25.349> to<00:03:25.560> death

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
tediously and boring you have to death

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.920 
tediously and boring you have to death
I<00:03:26.099> think<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.670> animation<00:03:27.150> even<00:03:27.599> though<00:03:27.720> their

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
I think the animation even though their

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.800 
I think the animation even though their
crummy<00:03:28.170> animations<00:03:28.829> are<00:03:29.640> gonna<00:03:30.060> do<00:03:30.269> a<00:03:30.540> pretty

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
crummy animations are gonna do a pretty

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:40.460 
crummy animations are gonna do a pretty
good<00:03:30.900> job<00:03:31.019> of<00:03:31.200> showing<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:38.299> and<00:03:39.319> after<00:03:40.319> I<00:03:40.349> do

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
good job of showing you and after I do

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.250 
good job of showing you and after I do
the<00:03:40.769> irises<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:41.760> go<00:03:42.209> in<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:42.660> I<00:03:42.720> lay<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.079> white

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
the irises I go in and I lay the white

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.150 
the irises I go in and I lay the white
down<00:03:43.500> for<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.220> actual<00:03:44.700> eyeball<00:03:45.650> I<00:03:46.650> do<00:03:46.920> it

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
down for the actual eyeball I do it

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.250 
down for the actual eyeball I do it
after<00:03:47.549> and<00:03:47.700> I<00:03:47.730> do<00:03:47.819> it<00:03:48.090> very<00:03:48.120> thinly<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:49.140> then

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
after and I do it very thinly and then

00:03:49.260 --> 00:04:38.150 
after and I do it very thinly and then
build<00:03:49.620> up<00:03:49.920> to<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.459> color<00:03:50.640> that<00:03:50.879> I<00:03:50.910> want

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.780 

and<00:04:39.390> this<00:04:40.390> concludes<00:04:40.690> this<00:04:41.380> portion<00:04:41.800> of<00:04:42.310> how<00:04:42.760> I

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
and this concludes this portion of how I

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.560 
and this concludes this portion of how I
do<00:04:42.940> my<00:04:43.150> repaint<00:04:43.540> I<00:04:44.730> hope<00:04:45.730> this<00:04:45.910> was<00:04:46.090> at<00:04:46.240> least<00:04:46.270> a

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
do my repaint I hope this was at least a

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.630 
do my repaint I hope this was at least a
