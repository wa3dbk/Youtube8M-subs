00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:03.920
BODICE - VEST WITH PEPLUM OR WITHOUT

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.960
Based on the following pattern of
bodice

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.569
we can construct

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:11.440
dresses (the upper part), blouses

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.400
tops

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.409
shirts

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:14.629
vests

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:15.829
jackets

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:17.990
coats etc.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.410
How do you like it? I think that is
very classy and cute at the same time

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.999
This pattern is based on my
measurements..........

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:31.970
Front waist length 46cm

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.480
Bust point 29cm

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.560
Bust 96 cm.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.620
Waist 86 cm.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.230
Hips 104 cm.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.690
Back length 44 cm.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.160
Back width 44 cm.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.740
Bust separation 20 cm.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.740
Let's start
FRONT

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.890
Let's recall how we can start sketching
our pattern for the bodice.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.409
we design on the right side

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.180
a vertical line from point 1 to point
2

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.290
equal to the front waist length

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.980
From the point 1

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.830
draw a horizontal line 30 cm to the  left and mark it as point  3.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.360

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.740
To form the front neckline

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.430
we measure 8cm from the
point 1

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.140
to the left (marked as point 5) and
again from point 1

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.729
go down another 8cm
(mark as point 4)

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.400
Join them with a curve ruler.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.050
From point 1,

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.060
we go down towards the bust point and mark as 6.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.960
From point 6 design a horizontal line equal to ¼ of the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.810
circumference of the bus and mark as 7.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.650
From point 5

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.480
we go left 4cm and mark that
point as 8

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.700
From this new point 8

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.539
we go 9 cm more to the left and we mark it as point 9.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.679
From point 1 we go 26 cm  again to the left  and mark

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:16.909
the point as 10.

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.459
In the bust line from point 6,

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.159
we measure 11 cm to the left and mark it as point 11.

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:31.449
Joining point 11 to points 8 and 9 we form the shoulder dart.

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:32.789
From point 2,

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:38.909
we design the waistline, which is equal to ¼ of waist circumference and

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.469
mark it as point 12.

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:47.609
From the point 11 we draw a vertical line to the waistline 2-12.

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.559
Left and right at the base of the vertical line,

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:57.499
we measure 1cm and mark the points 11a &amp; 11b.

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:02.299
Joining these points with point 11 we form  the breast dart.

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:08.559
From point 10 we go down 7 cm and we mark point 13.

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:14.729
We close (flip flop)  the shoulder dart and join the points 5-13.

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:16.349
From point  7,

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:21.199
we go upwards 2 cm and mark point 14.

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:26.099
Joining points 13 &amp; 14 with the curve ruler we form the

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.769
armpit.

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:34.069
we cut the breast dark until the last
line and the dark opens by itself

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.119
Our pattern now has this shape.

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:40.189
We cut all around our pattern.

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:42.719
Our half front it's ready.

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:46.229
We continue to design the back pattern.

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:49.369
We start with the right left angle.

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:53.939
The line 1-3 is equal to the back length.

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:55.599
From point 1

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:01.049
descending 1 cm down and 8 cm to the right and mark the

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.799
points 4 and 5 respectively.

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:10.529
We join these points with the curve ruler and we form the back neckline.

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:15.679
From point 1 descending below 25cm and we mark

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:16.930
as point 7

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:23.250
from this point to the right we draw a
horizontal line and mark as point 8

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:30.009
From point 2 also we draw a horizontal line to the right and mark as 6.

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.229
From point 1 we measure 21cm to the right and

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.770
from this point going down 4m and mark point 9.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.869
Joining point 6 to point 8.

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:46.749
From point 2 we go to the right 1 cm and join the new point

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:48.629
to point 7.

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:54.819
From point 2 we go to the right 11 cm and mark as 12.

00:04:54.819 --> 00:05:00.630
From point 12 we go up 15 cm and mark 13.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.610
We mark two new

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.840
points 1cm each left and right to point 12.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.189
Joining point 13 to the new two points we form the back dart.

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:17.689
With a straight line we join the points 5-9 and points 8-9

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:19.509
with a curve ruler,

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:22.020
forming the back armpit

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.360
Cut around and our half back pattern is ready.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.840
VEST.......

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:34.130
Add to the right 6 cm for crossing and 8 cm for  facing.

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.990
We correct the neckline as the draft,

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.009
thus to have a deep neckline in our vest.

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:46.100
We fold the facing inward
We round off the waistline.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.900
Cut all around our pattern.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.969
We open the facing,

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:55.250
place the pattern onto our folded fabric and cut.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.419
VEST WITH PEPLUM......

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.970
If we want to add a peplum,

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.119
we extend our pattern downward.

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:05.610
Do the same on the back

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.660
Cut at the waist line and distinguish the peplum.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.050
We clip them from the bottom upwards to 6 -7 points.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.169
We open the cuts and we copy them to a new pattern paper.

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:24.779
Now it's up to you how much you would like to open the cuts.

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:29.290
It depends on how rich you want your peplum to be.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.810
Bye and good luck in whatever you sew.
