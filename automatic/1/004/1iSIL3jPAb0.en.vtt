so<00:00:37.559> why<00:00:37.920> don't<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.070> go<00:00:38.220> back<00:00:38.339> to<00:00:38.489> my<00:00:38.580> office<00:00:38.690> I

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
so why don't we go back to my office I

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.410 
so why don't we go back to my office I
can<00:00:40.530> show<00:00:40.650> you<00:00:40.710> some<00:00:40.920> examples<00:00:40.979> of<00:00:41.460> but<00:00:42.150> done

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
can show you some examples of but done

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.420 
can show you some examples of but done
here<00:00:43.019> as<00:00:44.629> so<00:00:45.629> we're<00:00:46.500> back<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.860> office<00:00:46.979> and

typically when i get to work I check my

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.359 
typically when i get to work I check my
email<00:00:50.909> and<00:00:51.839> then<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.379> can<00:00:53.280> get<00:00:53.879> back<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.210> work<00:00:54.390> so

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:55.369 
email and then I can get back to work so

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:58.130 
email and then I can get back to work so
here's<00:00:56.369> an<00:00:56.519> example<00:00:56.549> of<00:00:56.970> a<00:00:57.510> package

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
here's an example of a package

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.680 
here's an example of a package
characterization<00:00:58.920> plan<00:00:59.159> that<00:00:59.879> I<00:00:59.909> helped

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
characterization plan that I helped

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.960 
characterization plan that I helped
develop<00:01:01.680> with<00:01:01.920> my<00:01:02.339> manager<00:01:04.700> this<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.850> really

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
develop with my manager this is really

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.910 
develop with my manager this is really
quick<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:08.660> this<00:01:09.660> is<00:01:09.840> another<00:01:10.490> package
