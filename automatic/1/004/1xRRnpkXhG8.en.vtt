 It is a dvd that introduces tips on counter technology , new ways, etc. 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:34.480
 The counter itself is a very difficult technology, so how do you find a stable counter? 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.130
 Is it 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:43.670
 Simple to those who want to remember the counter in the body without the de Ri difficult 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:47.880
 If you want to increase the variation even with the same counter drive 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:52.310
 It is a must-see if you want to learn the counter at an early timing 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.310

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:01.160
 Even in the front row, the fast counter of Sonoda store is now for the future of art with rising 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.210
 Is quite 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.720
 The income is a case example In the past , I put in a good body and attracted and reflected 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.210

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.570
 But also 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:18.409
 Such early 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:22.130
 It seems small at the timing, but it's really in front of the body but in the middle of a real platform 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.610
 I think all the pop players are going in the sense of hitting 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.050
 Forehand chestnut yes 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.219
 Player who is good at back is involved 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:37.579
 I aimed at your back 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:39.990
 I think it will be a grip for people who get caught, so with both in the fore grip 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:43.890
 Fore counter 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:48.510
 Wear well after the masterpiece 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.860
 I think let's do the fore counter back counter in the form of a grip 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.270
 After all 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.810
 With the back hand grip at the high counter and the fore counter in the fore edition grip 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.160

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.730
 If you take a large backswing 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.190
 Because it's a game that means you're late 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.680
 Out from where the Bucks were poised not take 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.410

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.900
 tan 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.650
 How was the play video 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:38.569
 The importance of the counter has been rising year by year 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.440
 It can not be avoided in order to improve table tennis 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:48.410
 It is a difficult technology 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:54.800
 Do not use the difficult technology on a single shot counter, but use bones and ideas firmly 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:56.840
 How to kill your opponent's soul by looking at this dvd to make it a big tactical game 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.819
 How to use 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:06.730

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.510
 Can 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:19.470
 You don't have to be scared anymore to counter 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:25.290
 Multiple variations of both hands against a ball with strong players and young players 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:31.270
 It will be said Rutte can dominate the game that the counter can be 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:37.480
 This dvd does not talk in very hard deep content 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:39.520
 Make this kind of mind coach easy to understand and put it into practice immediately for everyone 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:44.990
 There is 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:50.320
 Simple but the main point is has become a firmly grabbed contents 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:54.840
 Actually I also watch this dvd and have some tips on how to counter 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:05:01.139
 Because it was easy to practice because the easy-to-understand I felt greatly 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:04.440
 And the idea that I'm not the only way of counter also hit back just 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:06.910
 You can now have a wide range of counters in the actual game 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:11.770
 For example, if expressed in play 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:18.520
 Doing the back of the house you are patiently put up with the position of the jar back in the back want back of the cross 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:24.100
 When the other party shakes to the fore at an early timing, it is shaken to the fore at that time 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:27.529
 There is no time to go to the fore grip grip the grip from the backhand grip when the 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:31.180
 As it is when such 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:35.259
 When doing counter with backhand grip 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:39.400
 You will be able to have an early-time counter cut off the side 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:42.400
 Such a back hand grip as it is when it does the counter 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:49.330
 There is a merit and I do not give time to the other party 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:51.200
 It is not necessary to change hand grips that can play table tennis quickly, and such ideas are enriched and flexible 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.900
 It becomes easy to change how to strike 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:58.389
 Was 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:06:02.020
 This is a great way for everyone to play with greater confidence in the technology of the counter. 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:06.060
 Look at dvd and try 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:09.910
