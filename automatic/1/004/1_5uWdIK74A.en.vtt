00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
let me just clarify this isn't it the

let me just clarify this isn't it the
even<00:01:03.570> week<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.019> there'll<00:01:04.229> be<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.379> month<00:01:04.650> there

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
even week and there'll be a month there

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.719 
even week and there'll be a month there
will<00:01:05.010> be<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.159> video<00:01:05.460> out<00:01:05.519> every<00:01:06.060> single<00:01:06.210> day<00:01:06.570> um

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
will be a video out every single day um

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.670 
will be a video out every single day um
of<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:09.479> week<00:01:09.659> um<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:11.810> probably<00:01:12.810> there's<00:01:13.530> no

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
of that week um and probably there's no

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.289 
of that week um and probably there's no
guarantees<00:01:14.100> i'll<00:01:14.280> be<00:01:14.369> video<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.970> weekdays

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
guarantees i'll be video in the weekdays

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.570 
guarantees i'll be video in the weekdays
but<00:01:16.200> there's<00:01:16.409> like<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> eighty<00:01:16.920> percent<00:01:17.189> chance

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
but there's like a eighty percent chance

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.780 
but there's like a eighty percent chance
so<00:01:18.299> it's<00:01:18.509> more<00:01:19.020> than<00:01:19.470> like<00:01:19.740> more<00:01:20.250> than<00:01:20.520> likely

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
so it's more than like more than likely

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.810 
so it's more than like more than likely
they'll<00:01:21.450> be<00:01:21.630> BR<00:01:21.930> every<00:01:22.170> day<00:01:22.290> next<00:01:22.500> week<00:01:22.820> this

site<00:03:45.830> on<00:03:46.040> a<00:03:46.130> new<00:03:46.280> spawn<00:03:46.610> and<00:03:46.820> then<00:03:47.390> they'll

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
site on a new spawn and then they'll

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.420 
site on a new spawn and then they'll
take<00:03:47.810> control<00:03:48.019> of<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.230> middle<00:03:48.500> so<00:03:49.070> you<00:03:49.130> have

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
take control of the middle so you have

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.070 
take control of the middle so you have
to<00:03:49.549> coordinate<00:03:49.970> with<00:03:50.030> your<00:03:50.150> team<00:03:50.450> or<00:03:50.690> do<00:03:50.900> on

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
to coordinate with your team or do on

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.949 
to coordinate with your team or do on
your<00:03:51.260> own<00:03:51.290> but<00:03:51.950> whatever<00:03:52.280> you<00:03:52.340> do<00:03:52.750> you<00:03:53.750> have<00:03:53.780> to

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
your own but whatever you do you have to

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.539 
your own but whatever you do you have to
keep<00:03:54.320> control<00:03:54.680> of<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:54.890> middle<00:03:55.160> because<00:03:55.340> the

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
keep control of the middle because the

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:57.970 
keep control of the middle because the
middle<00:03:55.940> means<00:03:56.540> you<00:03:56.690> have<00:03:56.870> momentum<00:03:57.230> and<00:03:57.620> as

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
middle means you have momentum and as

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.410 
middle means you have momentum and as
you<00:03:58.100> can<00:03:58.250> see<00:03:58.280> we<00:03:58.640> control<00:03:58.970> the<00:03:59.090> middle<00:03:59.330> and

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
you can see we control the middle and

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.940 
you can see we control the middle and
every<00:03:59.600> time<00:03:59.720> they<00:03:59.870> switch<00:04:00.049> spawns<00:04:00.350> we<00:04:00.530> control

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
every time they switch spawns we control

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.009 
every time they switch spawns we control
their<00:04:01.700> area<00:04:02.030> that<00:04:02.299> they<00:04:02.390> can<00:04:02.510> go<00:04:02.570> past<00:04:02.810> and

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
their area that they can go past and

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.729 
their area that they can go past and
that's<00:04:03.080> why<00:04:03.320> it's<00:04:03.470> 20<00:04:03.830> to<00:04:04.010> 25<00:04:04.400> a<00:04:05.140> nice<00:04:06.140> a<00:04:06.170> big

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
that's why it's 20 to 25 a nice a big

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.930 
that's why it's 20 to 25 a nice a big
big<00:04:07.730> school<00:04:08.239> difference<00:04:09.519> with<00:04:10.519> two<00:04:10.760> minutes

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
big school difference with two minutes

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.810 
big school difference with two minutes
left<00:04:11.120> of<00:04:11.390> a<00:04:11.510> game<00:04:11.720> a<00:04:12.070> twenty<00:04:13.070> kill<00:04:13.340> difference

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820

as you can see we've got 33 kills before

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.969 
as you can see we've got 33 kills before
they<00:04:16.850> got<00:04:16.970> one<00:04:17.180> because<00:04:17.750> another<00:04:18.590> thing<00:04:18.709> is

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979

is record gameplay and then look over
the<00:04:40.640> game<00:04:40.790> flavor<00:04:40.940> it's<00:04:41.120> a<00:04:41.180> bad<00:04:41.330> game<00:04:41.560> and<00:04:42.560> if

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
don't forget they have HIV too so if

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.700 
don't forget they have HIV too so if
you're<00:06:01.880> standing<00:06:02.270> in<00:06:02.330> a<00:06:02.420> corner<00:06:02.600> they<00:06:03.530> will

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
you're standing in a corner they will

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.740 
you're standing in a corner they will
know<00:06:03.890> it<00:06:04.700> is<00:06:04.850> basically<00:06:05.360> the<00:06:05.600> anti<00:06:05.930> camper<00:06:06.350> and

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
know it is basically the anti camper and

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.910 
know it is basically the anti camper and
so<00:06:08.750> camping<00:06:09.110> doesn't<00:06:09.410> work<00:06:09.500> in<00:06:09.650> this<00:06:09.710> game

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:09.920
