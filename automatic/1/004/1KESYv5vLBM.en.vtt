transportation<00:03:17.329> also<00:03:18.329> I<00:03:18.359> live<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:19.049> little<00:03:19.319> bit

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
transportation also I live a little bit

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.900 
transportation also I live a little bit
further<00:03:19.799> than<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.160> subway<00:03:20.489> that<00:03:20.670> I<00:03:20.760> would

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
further than the subway that I would

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.379 
further than the subway that I would
like<00:03:21.090> it's<00:03:21.600> about<00:03:22.170> an<00:03:22.799> eight<00:03:23.100> minute<00:03:23.639> walk<00:03:24.030> to

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
like it's about an eight minute walk to

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.990 
like it's about an eight minute walk to
the<00:03:24.480> subway<00:03:24.630> which<00:03:24.959> is<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.200> long<00:03:25.470> time<00:03:26.000> because

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
the subway which is a long time because

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.629 
the subway which is a long time because
that<00:03:27.239> adds<00:03:27.450> basically<00:03:28.290> 10<00:03:28.500> minutes<00:03:28.799> here<00:03:29.010> to

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
that adds basically 10 minutes here to

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.150 
that adds basically 10 minutes here to
your<00:03:29.819> potential<00:03:30.269> commute<00:03:30.720> so<00:03:31.380> something<00:03:31.980> that

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
your potential commute so something that

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.509 
your potential commute so something that
could<00:03:32.819> just<00:03:33.000> be<00:03:33.590> ten<00:03:34.590> minute<00:03:34.950> commute<00:03:35.130> could

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
could just be ten minute commute could

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.090 
could just be ten minute commute could
be<00:03:35.579> twenty<00:03:36.060> minutes<00:03:36.329> or<00:03:36.510> a<00:03:37.049> 20-minute<00:03:38.010> commute

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
be twenty minutes or a 20-minute commute

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.309 
be twenty minutes or a 20-minute commute
would<00:03:38.489> be<00:03:38.549> thirty<00:03:38.940> minutes<00:03:39.299> so<00:03:39.540> you<00:03:40.049> need<00:03:40.200> to

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
would be thirty minutes so you need to

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.160 
would be thirty minutes so you need to
think<00:03:40.500> about<00:03:40.590> all<00:03:40.889> of<00:03:41.040> that<00:03:41.069> I<00:03:41.840> really<00:03:42.840> like<00:03:42.989> it

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
think about all of that I really like it

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.750 
think about all of that I really like it
because<00:03:43.260> I'm<00:03:43.680> experiencing<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.489> Upper<00:03:44.700> East

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
because I'm experiencing the Upper East

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.420 
because I'm experiencing the Upper East
Side<00:03:44.910> like<00:03:45.269> I<00:03:45.359> would<00:03:45.510> never<00:03:45.660> any<00:03:46.139> other<00:03:46.980> time

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
Side like I would never any other time

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.379 
Side like I would never any other time
so<00:03:48.150> I<00:03:48.660> like<00:03:49.380> it<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:49.829> I'm<00:03:50.790> sure<00:03:50.850> during<00:03:51.209> the

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
so I like it and I'm sure during the

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.780 
so I like it and I'm sure during the
summer<00:03:51.569> time<00:03:51.780> I<00:03:51.840> can<00:03:52.230> walk<00:03:52.409> to<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:53.220> you<00:03:53.670> know
