00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
would fix it in the mix but they didn't

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.520 
would fix it in the mix but they didn't
because<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.649> sounds<00:01:47.130> cool<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.820> works<00:01:48.060> so

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
because it sounds cool and it works so

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.020 
because it sounds cool and it works so

what I'll do is I'll just play the notes

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.880 
what I'll do is I'll just play the notes
for<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.960> you'll<00:01:52.110> be<00:01:52.170> playing<00:01:52.530> with<00:01:52.740> your

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
for you that you'll be playing with your

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.410 
for you that you'll be playing with your
right<00:01:53.130> hand<00:01:53.430> when<00:01:53.759> you're<00:01:53.880> doing<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.210> tapping

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
right hand when you're doing the tapping

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.749 
right hand when you're doing the tapping
technique<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:55.320> we'll<00:01:55.590> see<00:01:55.770> if<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.159> can<00:01:56.369> hear

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
technique and we'll see if you can hear

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.170 
technique and we'll see if you can hear
how<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.149> mistake<00:01:57.689> comes<00:01:58.110> in<00:01:58.409> okay<00:01:59.189> so<00:01:59.820> it

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
how the mistake comes in okay so it

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:21.410 
how the mistake comes in okay so it
sounds<00:02:00.450> like<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:01.079> with<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.500> C<00:02:01.680> major<00:02:01.890> scale

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.480 

and<00:02:22.280> that's<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.550> it's<00:02:24.090> pretty<00:02:24.450> simple<00:02:24.900> the

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
and that's it it's pretty simple the

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.670 
and that's it it's pretty simple the
rest<00:02:26.490> of<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.790> technique<00:02:27.330> again<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.080> recorded

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
rest of the technique again the recorded

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.850 
rest of the technique again the recorded
version<00:02:29.300> involves<00:02:30.300> as<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.750> said<00:02:30.990> triplets<00:02:31.650> so

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
version involves as I said triplets so

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.570 
version involves as I said triplets so
you<00:02:32.250> start<00:02:32.670> out<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:33.030> solo<00:02:33.450> doing<00:02:33.870> pull<00:02:34.230> offs

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
you start out the solo doing pull offs

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.070 
you start out the solo doing pull offs
going<00:02:35.580> from<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.560> eighth<00:02:37.560> fret<00:02:38.690> to<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.810> fifth

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
going from the eighth fret to the fifth

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.560 
going from the eighth fret to the fifth
fret<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:40.980> open<00:02:41.520> string<00:02:41.880> and<00:02:42.150> then

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
fret to the open string and then

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.300 
fret to the open string and then
bouncing<00:02:43.080> back<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.500> forth<00:02:43.740> between<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.280> E

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
bouncing back and forth between the E

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.390 
bouncing back and forth between the E
string<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.720> B<00:02:45.870> string<00:02:46.260> now<00:02:46.920> I'll<00:02:47.040> try<00:02:47.250> and

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
string and the B string now I'll try and

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.550 
string and the B string now I'll try and
play<00:02:47.550> this<00:02:47.760> slowly<00:02:48.150> for<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:49.080> sounds<00:02:49.500> a

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
play this slowly for you it sounds a

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.170 
play this slowly for you it sounds a
little<00:02:49.770> bit<00:02:49.890> sloppy<00:02:50.250> when<00:02:50.640> you're<00:02:50.790> doing<00:02:51.060> it

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
little bit sloppy when you're doing it

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.600 
little bit sloppy when you're doing it
slowly<00:02:51.480> but<00:02:52.200> I'll<00:02:52.290> play<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.709> then<00:02:53.160> you<00:02:53.310> get<00:02:53.459> the

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
slowly but I'll play it then you get the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.340 
slowly but I'll play it then you get the
idea<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.330> then<00:02:54.510> I'll<00:02:54.690> play<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:54.989> up<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.170> speed

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
idea and then I'll play it up to speed

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.040 
idea and then I'll play it up to speed
for<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:56.040> with<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.459> effects<00:02:56.880> pedals<00:02:57.300> which<00:02:57.870> by

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
for you with the effects pedals which by

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.650 
for you with the effects pedals which by
the<00:02:58.110> way<00:02:58.260> is<00:02:58.500> just<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.860> delay<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.550> a<00:02:59.850> chorus<00:03:00.300> to

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
the way is just a delay and a chorus to

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.479 
the way is just a delay and a chorus to
thicken<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:01.080> up<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.380> little<00:03:01.500> bit<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:02.040> that's

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
thicken it up a little bit and that's

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.759 
thicken it up a little bit and that's
all<00:03:02.670> you're<00:03:02.880> hearing<00:03:03.180> on<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.570> recording<00:03:04.110> so

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.100 
all you're hearing on the recording so
this<00:03:04.980> is<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.370> portion<00:03:05.700> of<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.150> solo<00:03:06.780> played

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
this is that portion of the solo played

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:14.580 
this is that portion of the solo played
slowly

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:33.809 

yeah

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.000 

you

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:47.300

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.430 

okay<00:03:58.400> so<00:03:59.000> that's<00:03:59.269> all<00:03:59.510> that<00:03:59.540> portion<00:04:00.290> of<00:04:00.379> the

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
okay so that's all that portion of the

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.660 
okay so that's all that portion of the
solo<00:04:00.920> is<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:02.450> tapping<00:04:02.930> run<00:04:03.200> again<00:04:04.190> the

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
solo is the tapping run again the

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.390 
solo is the tapping run again the
mistake<00:04:05.150> is<00:04:05.390> that<00:04:05.690> ace<00:04:05.989> hits<00:04:06.319> a<00:04:06.470> b-flat

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
mistake is that ace hits a b-flat

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.530 
mistake is that ace hits a b-flat
on<00:04:08.390> the<00:04:09.290> descending<00:04:09.739> portion<00:04:10.220> of<00:04:10.670> the<00:04:11.120> tapping

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
on the descending portion of the tapping

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.509 
on the descending portion of the tapping
run<00:04:11.720> there's<00:04:12.140> nothing<00:04:12.650> more<00:04:12.860> to<00:04:13.099> it<00:04:13.280> than<00:04:13.459> that

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
run there's nothing more to it than that

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.610 
run there's nothing more to it than that
