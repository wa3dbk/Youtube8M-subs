last two seasons to grow and learn from

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.810 
last two seasons to grow and learn from
some<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.290> nation's<00:01:49.439> best<00:01:49.920> well<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.729> think

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
some of the nation's best well I think

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.969 
some of the nation's best well I think
it's<00:01:51.060> an<00:01:51.149> opportunity<00:01:51.360> number<00:01:52.140> one<00:01:52.500> for<00:01:52.829> him

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
it's an opportunity number one for him

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.100 
it's an opportunity number one for him
to<00:01:53.130> fulfill<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.520> goal<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.149> an<00:01:54.240> aspiration<00:01:54.990> to

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
to fulfill a goal and an aspiration to

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.200 
to fulfill a goal and an aspiration to
be<00:01:55.229> able<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.680> represent<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.700> United<00:01:56.939> States

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
be able to represent the United States

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.209 
be able to represent the United States
of<00:01:57.360> America<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:57.899> international<00:01:58.530> competition

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
of America and international competition

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.280 
of America and international competition
so<00:01:59.729> that's<00:01:59.909> a<00:02:00.030> personal<00:02:00.450> fulfillment<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.049> he

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
so that's a personal fulfillment that he

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.530 
so that's a personal fulfillment that he
has<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.799> also<00:02:02.250> think<00:02:02.579> it's<00:02:02.790> an<00:02:02.909> opportunity<00:02:03.149> for

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
has I also think it's an opportunity for

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.289 
has I also think it's an opportunity for
him<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.840> continue<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.469> grow<00:02:04.710> as<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.979> player

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
him to continue to grow as a player

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.510 
him to continue to grow as a player
against<00:02:06.299> very<00:02:06.990> competitive<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:07.979> talented

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
against very competitive and talented

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.400 
against very competitive and talented
players<00:02:08.789> where<00:02:09.479> he<00:02:09.690> has<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> chance<00:02:10.170> to

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
players where he has a chance to

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.290 
players where he has a chance to
demonstrate<00:02:11.069> some<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.670> his<00:02:11.879> skill<00:02:12.180> and

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
demonstrate some of his skill and

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.370 
demonstrate some of his skill and
ability<00:02:12.390> at

national and elite level and I also

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.390

think that will see a great deal of

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.130 
think that will see a great deal of
growth<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.030> maturation<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.750> comes<00:02:18.990> from

championship contention not only is this
a<00:02:30.060> big<00:02:30.360> look<00:02:30.570> for<00:02:30.780> Lehigh's<00:02:31.050> program<00:02:31.560> but<00:02:31.740> it's

a big look for Lehigh's program but it's

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.440 
a big look for Lehigh's program but it's
a<00:02:31.950> big<00:02:32.160> moment<00:02:32.310> for<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.700> patriot<00:02:33.120> league<00:02:33.240> as

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
a big moment for the patriot league as
