the bat but he doesn't do that I go for

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.119 
the bat but he doesn't do that I go for
earthquake<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.600> break<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.989> sturdy<00:00:43.290> he<00:00:43.829> sets

switch out into my Solomons here cuz you
know<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.329> thought<00:00:48.629> he<00:00:48.690> would<00:00:48.899> go<00:00:49.050> for

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230

from<00:00:57.239> Stealth<00:00:57.480> Rock<00:00:57.660> uh<00:00:57.780> whenever<00:00:58.680> my

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
from Stealth Rock uh whenever my

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.580 
from Stealth Rock uh whenever my
electrode<00:00:59.850> comes<00:01:00.059> back<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.809> I'm<00:01:01.320> pretty

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
electrode comes back in and I'm pretty

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.080 
electrode comes back in and I'm pretty
you<00:01:01.829> know<00:01:01.859> I'm<00:01:02.070> ok<00:01:02.309> with<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.520> but<00:01:02.879> at<00:01:03.030> this

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
you know I'm ok with that but at this

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.939 
you know I'm ok with that but at this
point<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.420> was<00:01:03.539> debating<00:01:03.840> whether<00:01:04.110> or<00:01:04.350> not<00:01:04.470> he

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
point I was debating whether or not he

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.859 
point I was debating whether or not he
has<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.549> earthquake<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.479> seems<00:01:06.659> like<00:01:06.780> it

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
has the earthquake it seems like it

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.030 
has the earthquake it seems like it
doesn't<00:01:07.020> have<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.380> because<00:01:07.619> otherwise<00:01:07.830> he

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
doesn't have it because otherwise he

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.700 
doesn't have it because otherwise he
wouldn't<00:01:08.250> have<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.520> switch<00:01:08.909> right<00:01:09.210> there<00:01:09.390> so

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
wouldn't have to switch right there so

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.990 
wouldn't have to switch right there so
I'm<00:01:10.710> actually<00:01:10.890> going<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.310> go<00:01:11.430> for<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.760> super

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
I'm actually going to go for that super

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.149 
I'm actually going to go for that super
effective<00:01:12.330> earthquake<00:01:12.810> choice<00:01:13.470> banded<00:01:13.770> and

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
effective earthquake choice banded and

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.370 
effective earthquake choice banded and
it's<00:01:15.150> actually<00:01:15.479> going<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.869> end<00:01:16.080> up<00:01:16.229> hitting

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
it's actually going to end up hitting

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.410 
it's actually going to end up hitting
the<00:01:16.530> trevenant<00:01:17.040> which<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.729> totally<00:01:18.030> fine<00:01:18.240> by

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
the trevenant which is totally fine by

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.670 
the trevenant which is totally fine by
me<00:01:18.570> it's<00:01:18.689> gonna<00:01:18.840> do<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> little<00:01:19.259> bit<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.500> damage

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
me it's gonna do a little bit of damage

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.530 
me it's gonna do a little bit of damage
not<00:01:20.100> gonna<00:01:20.310> do<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.549> much<00:01:20.759> obviously<00:01:21.240> because

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
not gonna do that much obviously because

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.630 
not gonna do that much obviously because
it's<00:01:21.720> resistant<00:01:22.350> I'm<00:01:22.860> going<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.250> switch<00:01:23.430> out

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
it's resistant I'm going to switch out

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.890 
it's resistant I'm going to switch out
obviously<00:01:24.060> because<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.330> don't<00:01:24.540> want<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.720> take<00:01:24.869> a

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
obviously because I don't want to take a

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.420 
obviously because I don't want to take a

faster I don't know I'm just going to

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.640 
faster I don't know I'm just going to
risk<00:03:59.500> it<00:03:59.680> because<00:03:59.980> I<00:04:00.069> don't<00:04:00.220> seem<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:01.540> be<00:04:02.440> able

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.020 
risk it because I don't seem to be able
to<00:04:02.799> use<00:04:03.129> my<00:04:03.370> anger<00:04:03.790> anymore<00:04:04.030> after

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
to use my anger anymore after

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.940 
to use my anger anymore after
you<00:04:05.600> still<00:04:05.810> throats<00:04:06.110> damage<00:04:06.500> every<00:04:06.709> time<00:04:06.860> I

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
you still throats damage every time I

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.800 
you still throats damage every time I
switch<00:04:07.069> them<00:04:07.310> out<00:04:07.400> so<00:04:08.120> I<00:04:08.150> decided<00:04:08.540> to<00:04:08.630> just

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
switch them out so I decided to just

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:09.850 
switch them out so I decided to just
stay<00:04:08.990> in<00:04:09.050> and<00:04:09.200> go<00:04:09.290> for<00:04:09.319> the<00:04:09.470> Shadow<00:04:09.680> Ball

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
surprisingly I'm faster and I'm taking I

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.930 
surprisingly I'm faster and I'm taking I

absolutely faster than my Gengar that's

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.770 
absolutely faster than my Gengar that's

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
special I mean a very high speed and it

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.990 
special I mean a very high speed and it
takes<00:04:23.510> me<00:04:23.630> able<00:04:23.810> to<00:04:23.870> flamethrower<00:04:24.580> so<00:04:25.580> Gengar

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
takes me able to flamethrower so Gengar

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.320 
takes me able to flamethrower so Gengar
goes<00:04:26.120> down<00:04:26.300> us<00:04:26.450> to<00:04:26.540> bring<00:04:26.690> out<00:04:26.840> my<00:04:27.020> talonflame

goes down us to bring out my talonflame
obviously<00:04:29.330> is<00:04:29.510> going<00:04:29.690> to<00:04:29.780> predict<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.200> brave

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
obviously is going to predict the brave

you<00:04:39.890> wanted<00:04:40.130> to<00:04:40.190> off<00:04:40.370> predict<00:04:40.790> so<00:04:41.000> i<00:04:41.030> just<00:04:41.270> went

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
you wanted to off predict so i just went

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.820

miss blade my talonflame right there

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.250 
miss blade my talonflame right there
should<00:05:29.180> have<00:05:29.210> gone<00:05:29.360> for<00:05:29.570> the<00:05:29.630> flare<00:05:29.870> blades<00:05:30.140> or

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
should have gone for the flare blades or

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.710 
should have gone for the flare blades or
something<00:05:30.560> like<00:05:30.650> that<00:05:30.940> but<00:05:31.940> I<00:05:32.000> did<00:05:32.180> I<00:05:32.510> didn't

something like that but I did I didn't
do<00:05:32.870> that<00:05:32.900> so<00:05:33.169> I<00:05:33.470> pretty<00:05:33.800> much<00:05:33.860> lost<00:05:34.100> it<00:05:34.340> and<00:05:34.580> I

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
do that so I pretty much lost it and I

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:41.050 
for why I went for the wild Church years
