is<00:00:38.910> like<00:00:39.149> on<00:00:39.450> an<00:00:39.809> automatic<00:00:40.170> pilot<00:00:40.530> things<00:00:41.399> go

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
is like on an automatic pilot things go

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.000 
is like on an automatic pilot things go
and<00:00:42.149> was<00:00:42.329> on<00:00:42.510> an<00:00:42.629> automatic<00:00:42.960> pilot<00:00:43.469> now<00:00:43.800> it's

must<00:00:46.350> be<00:00:46.530> activated<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.640> can<00:00:47.879> only<00:00:48.149> be

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
must be activated that can only be

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.529 
must be activated that can only be
through<00:00:49.230> fever<00:00:49.500> there's<00:00:50.190> no<00:00:50.460> other<00:00:50.730> way<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.090> my

through fever there's no other way to my

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.529 
through fever there's no other way to my
knowledge<00:00:51.750> where<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.920> can<00:00:53.370> activate<00:00:54.059> William

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
knowledge where you can activate William

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.510 
knowledge where you can activate William
so<00:00:54.809> wake<00:00:55.020> up<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.440> immune<00:00:55.620> system<00:00:55.980> and

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
so wake up the immune system and

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.189 
so wake up the immune system and
therefore<00:00:56.760> also<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.930> brain

a<00:02:17.160> fever<00:02:17.400> but<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.510> then<00:02:19.080> they<00:02:19.200> understand

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
a fever but and then they understand

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.910 
a fever but and then they understand
through<00:02:20.040> how<00:02:20.640> we<00:02:20.700> work<00:02:21.540> here<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:22.230> FIFA<00:02:22.560> is

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
through how we work here that FIFA is

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.510 
say well these pen epidemics of the flu
going<00:02:36.720> around<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.230> world<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:38.070> maybe<00:02:38.250> you're

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
going around the world and maybe you're

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.430 
going around the world and maybe you're
sick<00:02:38.730> but<00:02:39.000> not<00:02:39.120> everybody<00:02:39.570> gets<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.930> flu<00:02:40.080> but

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
sick but not everybody gets the flu but

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.140 
sick but not everybody gets the flu but
if<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:40.710> get<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.950> flu<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.160> couple<00:02:41.640> of<00:02:41.700> days<00:02:41.910> you

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
if you get the flu a couple of days you

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.750 
if you get the flu a couple of days you
have<00:02:42.330> a<00:02:42.360> fever<00:02:43.050> that's<00:02:43.650> good<00:02:43.920> for<00:02:44.130> you<00:02:44.250> that

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
have a fever that's good for you that

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.500 
have a fever that's good for you that
might<00:02:45.080> decrease<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.470> chance<00:02:46.770> to<00:02:46.980> get<00:02:47.160> cancer

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
might decrease the chance to get cancer

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.030 
might decrease the chance to get cancer
of<00:02:48.510> course<00:02:48.780> there<00:02:48.930> may<00:02:49.050> be<00:02:49.080> people<00:02:49.350> high<00:02:49.709> risk

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
of course there may be people high risk

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.250 
of course there may be people high risk
for<00:02:50.459> complications<00:02:50.820> with<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.690> flu<00:02:51.900> that

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
for complications with the flu that

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.900 
for complications with the flu that
maybe<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:52.680> should<00:02:52.860> prevent<00:02:53.220> that<00:02:53.430> but<00:02:53.850> I

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
maybe you should prevent that but I

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.230 
maybe you should prevent that but I
think<00:02:54.950> 95%<00:02:55.950> of<00:02:56.040> all<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.310> us<00:02:56.459> would<00:02:56.880> actually

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
think 95% of all of us would actually

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.570 
think 95% of all of us would actually
benefit<00:02:57.750> if<00:02:57.990> we<00:02:58.230> every<00:02:58.650> 5<00:02:58.860> years<00:02:58.890> or<00:02:59.400> so

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
benefit if we every 5 years or so

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.420 
benefit if we every 5 years or so
everyone's<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.300> couple<00:03:00.600> of<00:03:00.660> days<00:03:01.130> fever<00:03:02.130> maybe
