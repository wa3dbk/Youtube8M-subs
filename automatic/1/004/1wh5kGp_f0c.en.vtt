just get the time there so we'll light

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.430 
just get the time there so we'll light
it<00:00:53.309> up<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.329> bring<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.780> back<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.379> the

ambien a bit might be a little more
visible<00:01:46.890> there<00:01:47.180> so<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.210> that's<00:01:48.540> what<00:01:48.869> it

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960

looks like an ambient you can see

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.719 
looks like an ambient you can see
sometimes<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.409> tap<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.979> wake<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.189> set<00:01:53.579> it

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
sensitive the display I don't know if I

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.870 
sensitive the display I don't know if I
guess<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.740> assume<00:01:59.009> it's<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.219> software<00:01:59.579> thing

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
guess I assume it's a software thing

guess I assume it's a software thing
there's<00:02:00.479> another<00:02:00.689> watch<00:02:00.960> face<00:02:01.259> here<00:02:01.640> kind<00:02:02.640> of

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
like a dial of some kind that just

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.280 
like a dial of some kind that just
rotates
