particularly well in that first half and

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.410 
particularly well in that first half and

that today's playing with a smile on his
face<00:02:22.880> made<00:02:23.660> good<00:02:23.900> runs<00:02:24.140> had<00:02:24.560> opportunities

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
face made good runs had opportunities

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.610 
face made good runs had opportunities
and<00:02:25.489> took<00:02:26.390> his<00:02:26.570> goal<00:02:26.780> very<00:02:27.049> very<00:02:27.350> well<00:02:27.500> and

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
and took his goal very very well and

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.140 
and took his goal very very well and
it's<00:02:27.769> always<00:02:27.890> important<00:02:28.489> for<00:02:28.519> a<00:02:28.670> striker<00:02:28.940> to

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
it's always important for a striker to

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.729 
it's always important for a striker to
get<00:02:29.299> off<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.570> mark<00:02:29.720> in<00:02:29.959> your<00:02:30.109> first<00:02:30.290> game<00:02:30.500> just

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
get off the mark in your first game just

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.500 
get off the mark in your first game just
takes<00:02:31.280> that<00:02:31.370> pressure<00:02:31.640> off<00:02:31.940> a<00:02:31.970> little<00:02:32.180> bit<00:02:32.359> and

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
takes that pressure off a little bit and

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.110 
takes that pressure off a little bit and
I<00:02:33.230> think<00:02:33.620> he'll<00:02:33.980> be<00:02:34.220> much<00:02:34.609> the<00:02:34.670> better<00:02:34.970> for

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
I think he'll be much the better for

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.109 
I think he'll be much the better for
that<00:02:35.269> after<00:02:35.780> today's<00:02:36.079> performance
