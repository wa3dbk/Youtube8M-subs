00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 what is the most impressive car 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.130
 that you have ever driven such a question that 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.469
 I regularly get after vacant light I 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.940
 then the porsche carrera gt 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.130
 already ten years old but still standing 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.630
 always very high on my list 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.630
 this is also a very special moment 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.890
 because this is in fact his successor the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.890
 porsche 918 spyder 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.450
 and that is electric at least I drive now 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.450
 away 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.970
 look this is the supercar 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.379
 new style the new era of the 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.379
 super each other now goes in 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.820
 887 hp 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.130
 only 600 in total comes from him 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.690
 v8 behind my back and the rest of the two 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.760
 electric motors 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.370
 yes sport this car for consumption 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.710
 from an average of 3 liters per 100 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.190
 kilometer and so I give with fourteen 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.570
 cent girl and just drive 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.320
 what is of course not true today 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.320
 on the go because 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.700
 I want to know how it feels and how 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.260
 performs well if I tell you he 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.659
 a 6.1 seconds to the 200 kilometers 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.920
 per hour auctioneer 0 to 200 in six and 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.020
 and a little bit 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.759
 always 300 in less than 20 seconds 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.990
 yes then we just go out there 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.090
 of course not for consumption and the 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.129
 emissions and whether or not you have 4 tips 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.399
 and to run but it's about it 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.399
 feeling 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.430
 well you hear 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.170
 the engine is in the midst 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.590
 all systems work together has time to spare 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.590
 to gas 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.260
 to drive cars in 4 positions 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.580
 one of electric and came with one 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.780
 pat on the steering very simple 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.120
 Set up 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.040
 the hair of hybrid for in the city or 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.570
 if you are just touring but 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.819
 automatically toggles up and down between 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:55.120
 electric driving up to 150 kilometers 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.950
 and hybrid combined and then well me 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.299
 am here on the speeders i think i am 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.560
 just rsz 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.109
 you know what I put also a lot 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.520
 it race 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:06.890
 characters 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.100
 more aerodynamics faster 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:13.720
 have gearbox everywhere 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.720
 a lot of board stretches a lot of power 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.980
 No 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.240
 Well you really forget that you have an e-reader 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.650
 because then this car just feels like 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.150
 a hardcore 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.150
 pureza that is really crazy 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.439
 he one clock left here that is the 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.880
 red button 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:52.640
 that the rotary knob for the roteb 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.230
 then get a limited time all 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.360
 power all brothers who have it 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.700
 those electric motors that can give there 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.150
 be released and car is the maximum 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.790
 sharp and then yes with that 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.590
 flying watch the nÃ¼rburgring put that 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.590
 lap record of less than seven minutes 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.900
 but despite all that broke power and that 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.260
 violent sound of that v8 because one 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.090
 sounds really euro and heart really 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.740
 fantastic 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.680
 perhaps the most impressive is 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.320
 however, the handling of this car runs there 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.060
 a portia turbo and close for me 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.330
 the test rider maximum when pedaling 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.370
 van van portion is in it 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.470
 and i can also just almost with one hand 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.900
 at the wheel I can follow without 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.080
 issues 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.790
 especially notice the bend in you so incredibly 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.040
 lot very quickly take 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.580
 what happens because people are sold 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.960
 then the rear wheels go 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.180
 are helped by factoring 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.060
 bringing out the incredibly beautiful plate 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.580
 broken 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.310
 very very stable it is remarkable that 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.470
 he 's getting the most out of it and that 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.610
 despite all your technique that you do best 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.139
 houses throat 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.360
 can and must pack in what a real 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:10.990
 brake hard in the corner 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.789
 and airbase take stairs and home to the 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.580
 one side very accessible but only 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.840
 wants to use a potential than must 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.280
 you also really go for it someone 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.560
 real pussy 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.539
 if you like goats relax and rest 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.250
 relax there is a little bit 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:25.150
 under silence keratin 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.949
 four wheel drive 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.990
 electric motors on the previous notes that 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:29.680
 he somewhat explored the corner 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.599
 attracts 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.879
 unless it is really just a lot harder 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:38.229
 and then makes them a hobby horse 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:39.639
 what a great car yes 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:43.419
 if the question may have been set to me 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:45.699
 is then start what i said what is the 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:48.279
 most sensational 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:49.539
 have driven a violent car that belongs 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:52.539
 I do n't have to worry about you anymore 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:56.379
 doubt that is this porsche 918 spyder 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:59.610
 am very curious what ferrari and with 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:59.610
 claire and opposite sit down
