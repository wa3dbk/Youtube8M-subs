 gas trabal with the particularity that 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.680
 they are pre-cooked and the only thing 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.050
 they are missing is to regenerate them for that 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.300
 we are going to use these legs that are 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.220
 specials of a ration and we're going to 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.170
 use this oven that is designed 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.400
 especially so that these rices 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.400

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.740
 a Valencian paella this is a recipe 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.360
 which is made from the 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.430
 more traditional ingredients of the 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.820
 Valencian rice cuisine where 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.740
 we have chicken and we have vegetables the 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.020
 green bean and the red ga which is a 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.820
 Typical Valencian vegetable with the typical 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.900
 stir a little olive oil 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.410
 virgin we caught the paella we opened the 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.410
 container 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:09.410
 we provoke on the paella we add the 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:12.980
 water, it is convenient that we do everything 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.990
 that has stuck here in the 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.550
 container so that we take advantage of all 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.740
 oil that has a flavor and very 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.720
 important so that it goes well what 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.720
 we dump inside the paella 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.280

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.560
 ingredients to our taste that is 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.049

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.130

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.100
 once we have it in the oven already 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.530
 we know that around 170 degrees 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.080
 more or less during a space that can 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.150
 vary between 10 12 13 minutes depends 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.550
 of the type of kiln we will know that it is 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.000
 when you have absorbed all the liquid from 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.000
