00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
then I have the bending screw or the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.620 
then I have the bending screw or the
bending<00:01:12.450> boat<00:01:12.750> we<00:01:13.049> call<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.590> there<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.220> I

block is welded firm and that is what

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.780 
block is welded firm and that is what
the<00:01:20.640> tooth<00:01:20.880> gets<00:01:21.119> bent<00:01:21.479> over<00:01:21.659> we're<00:01:22.380> measuring

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
the tooth gets bent over we're measuring

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.850 
the tooth gets bent over we're measuring
anything<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:24.060> protrudes<00:01:24.630> beyond<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.530> flat

doubt<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.259> can<00:01:31.439> see<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:31.860> but<00:01:32.100> there's

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
doubt that you can see this but there's

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.460 
doubt that you can see this but there's
a<00:01:32.310> spring-loaded<00:01:32.909> bar<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.960> spring-loaded

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
a spring-loaded bar the spring-loaded

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.310 
a spring-loaded bar the spring-loaded
bar<00:01:34.770> catches<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.549> blade<00:01:35.850> about<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.659> quarter<00:01:37.229> of

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
bar catches the blade about a quarter of

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.440 
bar catches the blade about a quarter of
an<00:01:37.409> inch<00:01:37.530> below<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.979> gullet<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.270> it

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
an inch below the gullet and so it

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.990 
an inch below the gullet and so it
measures<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.110> upper<00:01:40.740> portion<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.549> blade

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
measures the upper portion of the blade

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.850 
measures the upper portion of the blade
sometimes<00:01:42.390> blades<00:01:42.720> have<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> curvature<00:01:43.560> you

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
sometimes blades have a curvature you

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.889 
sometimes blades have a curvature you
all<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:44.759> heard<00:01:44.850> me<00:01:45.030> talk<00:01:45.240> about<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.750> in

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
all have heard me talk about that in

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.100 
all have heard me talk about that in
other<00:01:46.020> videos<00:01:46.340> and<00:01:47.340> other<00:01:47.520> writings<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:49.079> I

other videos and other writings and so I

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.710 
other videos and other writings and so I
take<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.280> factor<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.970> curvature<00:01:51.360> out

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
take the the factor of the curvature out

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.389 
take the the factor of the curvature out
of<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.049> blade<00:01:52.320> when<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:52.979> press<00:01:53.369> that

to just snow then you notice it kind of
lot<00:02:25.090> there's<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.480> locking<00:02:25.960> mechanism<00:02:25.990> just

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
lot there's a locking mechanism just

lot there's a locking mechanism just
barely<00:02:27.760> locks<00:02:28.210> and<00:02:28.480> then<00:02:28.570> I<00:02:28.690> can<00:02:28.870> ease<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:29.260> out

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
barely locks and then I can ease it out

barely locks and then I can ease it out
but<00:02:30.130> I<00:02:30.160> don't<00:02:30.280> want<00:02:30.730> that<00:02:30.910> hard<00:02:31.330> to<00:02:31.540> push<00:02:31.750> I

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
but I don't want that hard to push I

don't<00:02:32.170> want<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.440> fight<00:02:32.650> this<00:02:32.920> thing<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.370> just

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
don't want to fight this thing I just

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.540

want it to go easy and just snug and if

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.950 
want it to go easy and just snug and if
it's<00:02:36.730> not<00:02:36.880> snug<00:02:37.240> and<00:02:37.450> I'll<00:02:37.570> make<00:02:37.810> an

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
it's not snug and I'll make an

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.980 
it's not snug and I'll make an
adjustment<00:02:38.080> there<00:02:38.740> to<00:02:39.310> make<00:02:39.970> that<00:02:40.150> snug<00:02:40.510> and

bending<00:03:31.960> back<00:03:32.170> out<00:03:32.440> of<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.680> blade<00:03:32.920> if<00:03:33.460> you'll

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
bending back out of the blade if you'll

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.430 
bending back out of the blade if you'll
notice<00:03:34.180> we<00:03:34.360> have<00:03:34.390> to<00:03:34.660> bend<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:34.990> tooth<00:03:35.170> way

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
notice we have to bend the tooth way

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.340 
notice we have to bend the tooth way
over<00:03:35.920> 20,000<00:03:36.730> beyond<00:03:37.090> approximately<00:03:37.900> to

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
over 20,000 beyond approximately to

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.400 
over 20,000 beyond approximately to
spring<00:03:38.770> back<00:03:39.040> to<00:03:39.370> see<00:03:39.610> what<00:03:39.820> kind<00:03:40.120> of<00:03:40.410> what

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
spring back to see what kind of what

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.830 
spring back to see what kind of what
kind<00:03:41.680> of<00:03:41.770> set<00:03:42.070> we<00:03:42.280> are<00:03:42.430> of<00:03:42.550> obtaining<00:03:43.240> so<00:03:43.780> you

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
kind of set we are of obtaining so you

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.390 
kind of set we are of obtaining so you
have<00:03:44.020> to<00:03:44.140> bend<00:03:44.350> it<00:03:44.410> way<00:03:44.560> over<00:03:44.830> there's<00:03:44.980> nothing

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
have to bend it way over there's nothing

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.310 
have to bend it way over there's nothing

less<00:03:51.910> set<00:03:52.270> now<00:03:52.840> I<00:03:52.870> will<00:03:53.170> say<00:03:53.470> that<00:03:53.740> when<00:03:54.250> you

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
less set now I will say that when you

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.970 
less set now I will say that when you
bend<00:03:54.610> the<00:03:54.700> spring<00:03:54.940> steel<00:03:55.360> over<00:03:56.020> and<00:03:56.230> it<00:03:56.680> comes

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
bend the spring steel over and it comes

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.280 
bend the spring steel over and it comes
back<00:03:57.100> it<00:03:57.550> might<00:03:57.730> relax<00:03:58.180> back<00:03:58.480> a<00:03:58.510> thousand<00:03:59.140> or

of steel it is I do realize that can

of steel it is I do realize that can

happen but I just want you to know you
can't<00:04:05.710> bend<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.220> tip<00:04:06.460> and<00:04:06.730> if<00:04:06.850> you<00:04:06.970> do<00:04:07.210> it<00:04:07.480> will

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
can't bend the tip and if you do it will

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.840 
can't bend the tip and if you do it will
snap<00:04:08.260> that<00:04:08.560> tip<00:04:08.800> off<00:04:09.040> with<00:04:09.280> these<00:04:09.430> hardened

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
snap that tip off with these hardened

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.920 
snap that tip off with these hardened
blades<00:04:10.320> one<00:04:11.320> of<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.500> first<00:04:11.740> things<00:04:12.040> I<00:04:12.250> do<00:04:12.630> if<00:04:13.630> I

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
blades one of the first things I do if I

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.199 
blades one of the first things I do if I
sharpen<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:14.560> blade<00:04:14.740> first<00:04:15.070> is<00:04:15.310> I<00:04:15.520> Deibert<00:04:16.000> and

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
sharpen the blade first is I Deibert and

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.270 
sharpen the blade first is I Deibert and
I<00:04:16.299> will<00:04:16.570> recommend<00:04:17.020> to<00:04:17.290> you<00:04:17.590> if<00:04:17.739> you're

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
I will recommend to you if you're

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.910 
I will recommend to you if you're
sharpening<00:04:18.700> your<00:04:18.970> own<00:04:19.090> blades<00:04:19.420> set<00:04:20.260> it<00:04:20.410> first

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:20.920 
sharpening your own blades set it first

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.890 
sharpening your own blades set it first
sharpen<00:04:21.549> second<00:04:22.060> that<00:04:22.210> is<00:04:22.360> my<00:04:22.540> recommendation

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
sharpen second that is my recommendation

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.920 
sharpen second that is my recommendation
it<00:04:23.560> will<00:04:23.740> cut<00:04:23.979> better<00:04:24.270> if<00:04:25.270> your<00:04:25.510> sharpening

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
it will cut better if your sharpening

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:26.540 
it will cut better if your sharpening
for<00:04:26.169> other

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
for other

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.850 
for other
people<00:04:26.819> we<00:04:27.210> said<00:04:27.659> we<00:04:27.900> sharpened<00:04:28.409> first<00:04:28.620> and

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
people we said we sharpened first and

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.800 
people we said we sharpened first and
then<00:04:29.009> set<00:04:29.280> because<00:04:29.639> people<00:04:30.000> are<00:04:30.120> so<00:04:30.419> finicky

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
then set because people are so finicky

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.170 
then set because people are so finicky
about<00:04:31.169> the<00:04:31.319> set<00:04:31.590> I'm<00:04:32.220> not<00:04:32.520> as<00:04:32.669> finicky<00:04:33.150> about

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
about the set I'm not as finicky about

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.719 
about the set I'm not as finicky about
said<00:04:33.659> as<00:04:33.810> most<00:04:34.080> people<00:04:34.440> I<00:04:34.620> believe<00:04:35.009> that<00:04:35.610> the

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
said as most people I believe that the

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.640 
said as most people I believe that the
set<00:04:36.030> must<00:04:36.330> be<00:04:36.569> wide<00:04:36.780> enough<00:04:36.990> to<00:04:37.139> clear<00:04:37.470> the

set must be wide enough to clear the
body<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:38.190> without<00:04:38.789> friction<00:04:39.360> and<00:04:39.539> that's<00:04:39.690> its

body and without friction and that's its

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.290 
body and without friction and that's its
job<00:04:39.990> I've<00:04:40.800> actually<00:04:41.129> tested<00:04:41.520> blades<00:04:42.000> where

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
job I've actually tested blades where

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.450 
job I've actually tested blades where
you<00:04:42.449> could<00:04:42.659> put<00:04:43.110> five<00:04:43.379> thousands<00:04:43.919> more<00:04:44.129> on<00:04:44.250> one

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
you could put five thousands more on one

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.430 
you could put five thousands more on one
side<00:04:44.729> than<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.000> other<00:04:45.120> didn't<00:04:46.080> matter<00:04:46.229> the

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
side than the other didn't matter the

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.469 
side than the other didn't matter the
blades<00:04:46.650> solid<00:04:47.069> then<00:04:47.190> the<00:04:47.280> key<00:04:47.430> factor<00:04:47.849> was<00:04:48.060> was
