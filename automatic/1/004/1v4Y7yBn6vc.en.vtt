 However, industrial tourism is still a successful formula if you 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.690
 believe this example of a cutlery and to train on it she who 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.969
 organizes free tours in July a conclusive experience 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.120
 since the operation should be extended to five or six months in 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.960
 next year's report by pascal phoenix and bÃ©atrice muller 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:21.859
 it's a country of cutlery 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:23.339
 almost a third of the workforce 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:27.299
 for 87 years in this family business has been making knives since 

00:00:27.299 --> 00:00:30.339
 three weeks she invites the public to visit her workshops 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:33.100
 here about 5000 all the pictures of the chef m 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.100
 mainly allies 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.170
 not me 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.970
 companies unless the reputation of cultivating 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.260
 almost know-how 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
 and the technological complexity collision 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.540
 it's a job that has made the flexibility wonder and France has also 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.050
 made account always within reach of visitors 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.740
 Quebec people were delighted and delighted by what is left of 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.020
 good things and guards 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.750
 it's a very typical craft 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.750
 a strong north way 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.330
 in the French capital 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.930
 the purpose of this visit for most girls is also 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.610
 convince the tourists were at loggerheads me is not everything to 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.610
 makes the same footing as that produces a second time chains 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.740
 it would not allow to resorb 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.690
 the man who was the theater of Rouen opera 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.690
 I am in Marseille the industrial draftsman 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.580
 ghannouchi of the lot of earth 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.510
 a production 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.510
 manufacturing analysis 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.670
 and that I preferred her anyway 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.860
 spokesperson of the instance did reform 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.860
 ch today is not to displease me 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.850
 110 cutlery customers to open to the general public 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.630
 is not a real diversification even if it may represent a small 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.499
 market 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:12.569
 not the ambition of the death penalty to promote notoriety and finesse 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.499
 of these products
