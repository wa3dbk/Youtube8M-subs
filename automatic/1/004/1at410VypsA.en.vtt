00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
score that's to save right there I think

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.580 
score that's to save right there I think
it's<00:02:08.160> just<00:02:08.280> positioning<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.630> poised<00:02:09.929> on<00:02:10.170> shots

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590
