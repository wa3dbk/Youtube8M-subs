 hello friends from youtube here alex mix 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.029
 bringing you a new video tutorial 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.489
 about how to download minecraft 1.7 point 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.830
 2 for PC with optics and forge installed 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.320
 how they see the links are not mine 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.559
 borrowed good they download the file of 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.559
 mega 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.360
 I do not do it because I already have it 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:55.810
 and 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.810
 this is the channel of the creator of the file 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:04.129
 Once downloaded they will leave a file 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.829
 point you right click and extract there 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.170
 when it is removed they will have one 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:11.600
 folder so we go into it and copy 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.479
 the second folder 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.460
 we enter at the beginning we give to execute and 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.680
 we put percent appdata percent and 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.680
 there we paste the mini craft dot folder 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.329
 no no 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.400
 then we take out the launcher and we put it 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.400
 at the desk we open it 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.460
 ah 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.299
 wait when they open they give to play and they 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.299
 will open the game normally 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.460
 i 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.259

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.259
