over the front end and the back apart

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.330 
over the front end and the back apart
this<00:01:46.690> is<00:01:46.840> a<00:01:46.870> good<00:01:47.470> seating<00:01:47.770> arrangement<00:01:48.250> on

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
this is a good seating arrangement on

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.980 
this is a good seating arrangement on
this<00:01:48.490> point<00:01:49.050> all<00:01:50.050> our<00:01:50.320> bikes<00:01:51.180> come<00:01:52.180> with<00:01:52.360> the

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
this point all our bikes come with the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.930 
this point all our bikes come with the
winter<00:01:53.230> you<00:01:53.320> start<00:01:53.620> turn<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.550> morning<00:01:54.850> you

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
winter you start turn the morning you

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.900 
winter you start turn the morning you
can<00:01:55.060> just<00:01:55.270> bang<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:56.850> reliability<00:01:57.850> is

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
can just bang the reliability is

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.069 
can just bang the reliability is
probably<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:58.270> best<00:01:58.450> thing<00:01:58.570> as<00:01:58.780> well

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079
