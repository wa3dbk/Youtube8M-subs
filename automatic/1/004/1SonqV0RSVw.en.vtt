get<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.450> started<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.079> then<00:01:43.619> afterwards<00:01:44.159> you

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
get it started and then afterwards you

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.149 
get it started and then afterwards you
can<00:01:44.430> use<00:01:44.640> wood<00:01:44.970> chips<00:01:45.079> sawdust<00:01:46.079> any<00:01:46.799> dry

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
can use wood chips sawdust any dry

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.429 
can use wood chips sawdust any dry
organic<00:01:47.759> material<00:01:48.299> really<00:01:48.540> will<00:01:48.810> work<00:01:48.840> leaves

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
organic material really will work leaves

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.620 
organic material really will work leaves
from<00:01:49.920> your<00:01:50.100> backyard<00:01:50.280> we'll<00:01:51.180> keep<00:01:51.390> this

fits in and out of really nice system

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.790 
fits in and out of really nice system
you<00:02:12.569> can<00:02:12.690> put<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.870> couple<00:02:13.080> wheels

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
you can put a couple wheels

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.980 
you can put a couple wheels

down in the bottom down there on either

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.780 
down in the bottom down there on either
side<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:16.380> hold<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.860> barrel<00:02:17.130> up<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.430> rotate<00:02:17.730> a

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
side to hold the barrel up and rotate a

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.820 
side to hold the barrel up and rotate a
little<00:02:17.880> bit<00:02:18.210> smoother<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:19.290> don't<00:02:19.470> have<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.620> lot

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
little bit smoother you don't have a lot

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.380 
little bit smoother you don't have a lot
of<00:02:19.950> friction<00:02:20.160> points<00:02:20.670> on<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.820> barrel<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.270> got

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
of friction points on a barrel you got

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.660 
of friction points on a barrel you got
to<00:02:21.510> think<00:02:21.660> it's<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:21.960> domed<00:02:22.320> design<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:23.640> you

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
to think it's a domed design so you

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.920 
to think it's a domed design so you
really<00:02:24.030> only<00:02:24.180> have<00:02:24.270> a<00:02:24.390> friction<00:02:24.900> point

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
really only have a friction point

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.560 
really only have a friction point
probably<00:02:25.440> about<00:02:25.560> an<00:02:25.740> inch<00:02:25.950> long<00:02:26.070> so<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:27.300> thought

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
probably about an inch long so I thought

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.780 
probably about an inch long so I thought
I'd<00:02:27.720> show<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:27.990> that<00:02:28.200> now<00:02:28.410> on<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.710> dump<00:02:29.010> if<00:02:29.580> you

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
I'd show you that now on the dump if you

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.400 
I'd show you that now on the dump if you
wanted<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.180> dump<00:02:30.420> this<00:02:30.570> material<00:02:31.110> say<00:02:31.260> the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
wanted to dump this material say the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.100 
wanted to dump this material say the
full<00:02:31.620> toilet<00:02:32.040> was<00:02:32.160> full<00:02:32.480> after<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.510> year's<00:02:33.840> time

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
full toilet was full after a year's time

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.960 
full toilet was full after a year's time
you<00:02:34.350> actually<00:02:34.560> rotated<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.400> opposite

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
you actually rotated the opposite

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.180 
you actually rotated the opposite
direction<00:02:36.330> then<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:37.470> would<00:02:37.680> during<00:02:37.920> your

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
direction then you would during your

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.540 
direction then you would during your
normal<00:02:38.660> just<00:02:39.660> cyclic<00:02:40.140> rotation<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:41.340> keeps

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
normal just cyclic rotation and it keeps

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.670 
normal just cyclic rotation and it keeps
the<00:02:41.700> door<00:02:41.910> open<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:42.390> material<00:02:43.110> will<00:02:43.260> come<00:02:43.290> out

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
the door open so material will come out

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.890 
the door open so material will come out
so<00:02:44.400> that's<00:02:44.520> why<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:44.970> make<00:02:45.270> your<00:02:45.420> door<00:02:45.630> like

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
so that's why you make your door like

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.870 
so that's why you make your door like
that<00:02:46.110> one<00:02:46.380> direction<00:02:46.590> is<00:02:47.070> for<00:02:47.280> dumping<00:02:47.670> when

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
that one direction is for dumping when

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.950 
that one direction is for dumping when
it's<00:02:48.030> full<00:02:48.300> in<00:02:48.720> this<00:02:49.290> direction<00:02:50.540> shut<00:02:51.540> so<00:02:51.930> you

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
it's full in this direction shut so you

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.380 
it's full in this direction shut so you
can<00:02:52.200> rotate<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:52.770> six<00:02:53.070> times<00:02:53.340> once<00:02:53.850> a<00:02:54.000> week<00:02:54.180> you

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
can rotate it six times once a week you

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.080 
can rotate it six times once a week you
just<00:02:54.420> fold<00:02:55.200> six<00:02:55.560> rotations<00:02:56.280> once<00:02:56.550> a<00:02:56.730> week<00:02:56.880> is

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
just fold six rotations once a week is

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.510 
just fold six rotations once a week is
all<00:02:57.210> you<00:02:57.390> need<00:02:57.600> not<00:02:57.810> every<00:02:58.140> day<00:02:58.320> so<00:02:59.220> there<00:02:59.400> you

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
all you need not every day so there you

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.690 
all you need not every day so there you
go<00:02:59.670> that's<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.030> easy<00:03:00.480> way<00:03:01.070> to<00:03:02.070> put<00:03:02.220> together<00:03:02.400> a

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
go that's the easy way to put together a

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.780 
go that's the easy way to put together a
composting<00:03:03.480> toilet<00:03:03.510> this<00:03:04.500> 30<00:03:04.860> gallon<00:03:05.310> toilet

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
composting toilet this 30 gallon toilet

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.880 
composting toilet this 30 gallon toilet
will<00:03:06.240> do<00:03:06.390> a<00:03:06.420> family<00:03:06.990> of<00:03:07.140> three<00:03:07.440> year-round

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
will do a family of three year-round

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.850 
will do a family of three year-round
this<00:03:08.760> is<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:08.970> rather<00:03:09.210> large<00:03:09.570> system<00:03:10.290> much

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
this is a rather large system much

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.380 
this is a rather large system much
bigger<00:03:11.130> than<00:03:11.340> most<00:03:11.490> of<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.760> composting

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
bigger than most of the composting

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.000 
bigger than most of the composting
toilets<00:03:12.780> you'll<00:03:12.930> pay<00:03:13.050> sixteen<00:03:13.530> seventeen

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
toilets you'll pay sixteen seventeen

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.310 
toilets you'll pay sixteen seventeen
hundred<00:03:14.370> dollars<00:03:14.700> for<00:03:14.970> so<00:03:15.720> this<00:03:15.960> will<00:03:16.140> cost

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
hundred dollars for so this will cost

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.750 
hundred dollars for so this will cost
you<00:03:16.500> of<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.710> price<00:03:16.920> of<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.190> barrel<00:03:17.550> some

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
you of the price of the barrel some

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.449 
you of the price of the barrel some
