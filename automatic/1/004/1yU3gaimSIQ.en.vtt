00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.639 

so<00:00:05.130> on<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.310> Dyson<00:00:05.640> 360<00:00:06.210> I<00:00:06.240> Robot<00:00:06.569> we<00:00:07.020> chose<00:00:07.319> to

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
so on the Dyson 360 I Robot we chose to

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.110 
so on the Dyson 360 I Robot we chose to
use<00:00:07.680> vision<00:00:08.220> because<00:00:08.580> it<00:00:08.730> means<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:08.970> robot

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
use vision because it means the robot

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.879 
use vision because it means the robot
can<00:00:09.420> know<00:00:09.570> exactly<00:00:10.080> where<00:00:10.320> it<00:00:10.410> is<00:00:10.440> within<00:00:10.830> a

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
can know exactly where it is within a

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.249 
can know exactly where it is within a
room<00:00:11.040> very<00:00:11.370> accurately<00:00:11.849> in<00:00:12.540> turn<00:00:12.870> that<00:00:13.019> means

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
room very accurately in turn that means

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.539 
room very accurately in turn that means
that<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.440> machine<00:00:13.740> can<00:00:13.920> clean<00:00:14.250> very

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
that the machine can clean very

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.120 
that the machine can clean very
efficiently<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.299> systematically<00:00:15.980> so<00:00:16.980> when

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
efficiently and systematically so when

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.040 
efficiently and systematically so when
we<00:00:17.220> were<00:00:17.369> developing<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.910> camera<00:00:18.240> systems<00:00:18.660> it

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
we were developing the camera systems it

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.810 
we were developing the camera systems it
was<00:00:19.260> very<00:00:19.590> clear<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.250> there<00:00:20.460> wasn't<00:00:20.609> an

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
was very clear that there wasn't an

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.910 
was very clear that there wasn't an
existing<00:00:21.300> system<00:00:21.630> we<00:00:21.750> could<00:00:21.869> just<00:00:22.080> use<00:00:22.289> we

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
existing system we could just use we

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.800 
existing system we could just use we
very<00:00:23.160> quickly<00:00:23.340> decided<00:00:23.820> not<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.210> use<00:00:24.359> afford

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
very quickly decided not to use afford

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.050 
very quickly decided not to use afford
facing<00:00:25.199> standard<00:00:25.590> camera<00:00:26.010> what<00:00:26.699> was<00:00:26.849> needed

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
facing standard camera what was needed

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.939 
facing standard camera what was needed
was<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.420> system<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:28.050> see<00:00:28.260> all<00:00:28.500> around<00:00:28.859> the

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
was a system that can see all around the

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.160 
was a system that can see all around the
machine<00:00:29.250> all<00:00:29.519> at<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.880> same<00:00:30.029> time<00:00:30.170> the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
machine all at the same time the

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.810 
machine all at the same time the
advantage<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.710> such<00:00:31.890> systems<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.430> don't

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
advantage of such systems is you don't

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.310 
advantage of such systems is you don't
need<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:32.969> physically<00:00:33.420> turn<00:00:33.719> around<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.290> look

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
need to physically turn around to look

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.229 
need to physically turn around to look
to<00:00:34.620> see<00:00:34.770> where<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.040> are<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.850> other<00:00:36.000> thing

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
to see where you are and the other thing

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.119 
to see where you are and the other thing
is<00:00:36.390> anything<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.050> comes<00:00:37.200> into<00:00:37.410> view<00:00:37.530> doesn't

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
is anything that comes into view doesn't

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.860 
is anything that comes into view doesn't
obscure<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.760> whole<00:00:38.910> image<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.600> robot

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
obscure the whole image so the robot

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.319 
obscure the whole image so the robot
isn't<00:00:40.170> easily<00:00:40.320> blinded<00:00:40.940> so<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.210> an

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
isn't easily blinded so this is an

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.330 
isn't easily blinded so this is an
example<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> panoramic<00:00:43.590> image<00:00:43.860> used<00:00:44.190> by

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
example of the panoramic image used by

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.580 
example of the panoramic image used by
the<00:00:44.399> robot<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.879> navigate<00:00:45.270> by<00:00:45.450> what<00:00:46.440> are<00:00:46.530> the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
the robot to navigate by what are the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.590 
the robot to navigate by what are the
main<00:00:46.770> advantages<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:47.579> all<00:00:47.879> four<00:00:48.149> sides<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
main advantages is all four sides of the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.690 
main advantages is all four sides of the
room<00:00:48.809> are<00:00:49.020> visible<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.739> single<00:00:50.070> shot<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
room are visible in a single shot so the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.069 
room are visible in a single shot so the
robot<00:00:50.969> doesn't<00:00:51.210> have<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.390> continually<00:00:51.809> turn

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
robot doesn't have to continually turn

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.540 
robot doesn't have to continually turn
itself<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.620> actually<00:00:52.890> see<00:00:53.070> where<00:00:53.219> it's<00:00:53.340> going

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
itself to actually see where it's going

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.060 
itself to actually see where it's going
it<00:00:54.449> will<00:00:54.629> take<00:00:54.840> high<00:00:55.170> contrast<00:00:55.680> features

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
it will take high contrast features

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.709 
it will take high contrast features
throughout<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.699> image<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.180> use<00:00:57.570> those

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
throughout the image and use those

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.590 
throughout the image and use those
triangulate<00:00:58.410> its<00:00:58.590> position<00:00:58.649> as<00:00:59.250> the<00:01:00.090> robot

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
triangulate its position as the robot

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.869 
triangulate its position as the robot
begins<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:01.050> move<00:01:01.260> one<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.129> advantages<00:01:02.670> is

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
begins to move one of the advantages is

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.880 
begins to move one of the advantages is
those<00:01:03.359> features<00:01:03.780> can<00:01:03.930> be<00:01:03.960> tracked<00:01:04.379> throughout

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
those features can be tracked throughout

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.840 
those features can be tracked throughout
the<00:01:05.189> image<00:01:05.489> without<00:01:06.150> ever<00:01:06.479> going<00:01:06.810> out<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.049> shop

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
the image without ever going out of shop

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.429 
the image without ever going out of shop
so<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.939> navigation<00:01:09.090> system<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:09.930> very<00:01:10.110> clever

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
so the navigation system is very clever

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.010 
so the navigation system is very clever
whilst<00:01:11.250> it's<00:01:11.430> actually<00:01:11.820> using<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.270> map<00:01:12.540> to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
whilst it's actually using a map to

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.710 
whilst it's actually using a map to
localize<00:01:13.500> itself<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.670> also<00:01:14.850> has<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.390> create

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
localize itself it also has to create

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.289 
localize itself it also has to create
that<00:01:15.900> map<00:01:16.170> at<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.040> same<00:01:17.280> time<00:01:17.580> infrared

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
that map at the same time infrared

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.240 
that map at the same time infrared
sensors<00:01:18.810> detect<00:01:19.200> where<00:01:19.470> objects<00:01:19.920> are<00:01:20.070> and

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
sensors detect where objects are and

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.280 
sensors detect where objects are and
place<00:01:20.909> those<00:01:21.119> on<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> map<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
place those on the map so that the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.039 
place those on the map so that the
machine<00:01:22.619> can<00:01:22.799> avoid<00:01:23.189> objects<00:01:23.700> and

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
machine can avoid objects and

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.090 
machine can avoid objects and
systematically<00:01:25.049> plan<00:01:25.409> its<00:01:25.590> way<00:01:25.710> around<00:01:25.830> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
systematically plan its way around the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.390 
systematically plan its way around the
room<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.759> ensure<00:01:26.909> methodical<00:01:27.720> cleaning<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:29.340> in

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
room to ensure methodical cleaning so in

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.340 
room to ensure methodical cleaning so in
the<00:01:29.460> cleaning<00:01:29.700> pattern<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.299> very<00:01:30.329> simple<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
the cleaning pattern is very simple the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.530 
the cleaning pattern is very simple the
robot<00:01:31.650> only<00:01:31.979> ever<00:01:32.100> wants<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.460> travel<00:01:32.729> within

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
robot only ever wants to travel within

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.969 
robot only ever wants to travel within
one<00:01:33.869> robots<00:01:34.200> width<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.590> where<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:34.829> been

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
one robots width of where it's been

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.940 
one robots width of where it's been
before<00:01:35.540> what<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.689> means<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.170> as<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.680> robot

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
before what that means is as the robot

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.859 
before what that means is as the robot
moves<00:01:37.979> around<00:01:38.310> when<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.150> gets<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.420> location

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
moves around when it gets to a location

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.870 
moves around when it gets to a location
such<00:01:40.079> as<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.770> doesn't<00:01:41.100> go<00:01:41.189> forward<00:01:41.520> it

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
such as this it doesn't go forward it

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.580 
such as this it doesn't go forward it
