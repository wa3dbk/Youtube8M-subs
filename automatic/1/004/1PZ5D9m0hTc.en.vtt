00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello everyone with you feelings and today we 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.220
 let's talk about a wonderful piece of equipment like 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.170
 pmp 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.000
 and either of those whom you like as opposed to 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.070
 tanks and bmp has enhanced 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.599
 maneuverability and speed that allows 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.119
 drive more aggressive than yours 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.949
 tank is worth considering that BMW armor 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.369
 weaker than tanks so not worth it 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.100
 to take 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.430
 forehead on the enemy that bmp inflicts on you 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.869
 Certain cases are better than tank 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.109
 for example against infantry or the same 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.309
 tank itself if you went to him from behind 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.750
 until he figure out what's driving him 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.730
 fire on his wife to avoid him half 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.059
 There is one small flaw at bmp it 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.559
 viewing angle of your gun when attacking 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.360
 you helicopter or plane 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.270
 I advise you to use the shelter area 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.010
 Now let's talk about the modules so let's start 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.210
 in order 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.890
 twenty five millimeter shells 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.500
 main armament bmp 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.300
 minimum damage 2 units maximum 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.539
 you have four projectile units and apps 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.860
 dst high speed projectile minimum 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.770
 water specialist is 3 units 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.810
 the maximum is 5 units these 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.820
 shells more sharpened on technique but 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.979
 against infantry they are also very effective 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.500
 one two hits under infantryman 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.820
 and you make him cannon fodder 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.570
 they need straight 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.659
 canister not considered like this 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.250
 anti-personnel measure some potter to 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.410
 minimum damage is 23 units 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.660
 maximum 45 units 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:35.380
 Driving is so easy 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:38.410
 if you get there you will not regret the rocket 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.390
 the minimum damage zone is 4 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.000
 maximum units of 5 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.040
 I recommend to put more units 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.470
 against infantry rather than against technology 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.479
 since the zone has splash damage on 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.000
 areas to protect 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.160
 At first I advise you to put and smoke 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.259
 when to open active protection put 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.030
 Mandatory active protection from optics 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.090
 I advise you to cure but optics or 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.009
 the imager here is already an improvement for your taste 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.080
 we put only active armor because 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.430
 there is no camouflage maintenance 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.770
 you also do not need if you play 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.470
 Auto charge engineer he is also not particularly 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.440
 handy on paint any to choose 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.330
 optics link at your discretion not 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.250
 It is worth the imager and improving their 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.459
 Beauty puts incendiary or 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.120
 nozzles well with the modules finished now 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.709
 let's talk about the nuances and priorities 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.890
 I advise priority to put infantry first 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.530
 then light BMP antiaircraft gun technique and then 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.290
 so go on are so here only then 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.930
 when confident in their abilities 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.120
 I also want to say about the PRC if 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.920
 masterfully master this type of weapon 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.010
 display is not something that ground storm 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.000
 technicians can also keep all 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.489
 air under control 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.250
 pitch and helicopter it pretty 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.040
 cool and ending i would say 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.410
 guys if you see bmp do not pass by 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.019
 her is a great kind of technique capable 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.230
 keep all sulfur at bay for some reason in 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.750
 bf4 they all forgot while bf3 i 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.280
 you like hot cakes on this 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.019
 thank you all for your attention 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.239
