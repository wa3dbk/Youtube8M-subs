we're<00:00:04.170> gonna<00:00:04.259> be<00:00:04.410> looking<00:00:04.650> at<00:00:04.710> something<00:00:05.130> I

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
we're gonna be looking at something I

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.639 
we're gonna be looking at something I
have<00:00:05.850> tentatively<00:00:06.299> called<00:00:06.899> open<00:00:07.350> string

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
have tentatively called open string

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.669 
have tentatively called open string
bending<00:00:07.919> but<00:00:08.280> there's<00:00:08.519> technically<00:00:09.240> not

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:09.679 
bending but there's technically not

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:11.810 
bending but there's technically not
bending<00:00:10.679> involved<00:00:11.309> in<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.519> sense<00:00:11.759> that

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
bending involved in the sense that

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.879 
bending involved in the sense that
you're<00:00:12.059> probably<00:00:12.300> thinking<00:00:12.630> about<00:00:12.900> it<00:00:13.200> open

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
you're probably thinking about it open

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.919 
you're probably thinking about it open
string<00:00:14.219> bending<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:14.730> my<00:00:14.880> opinion<00:00:15.330> works<00:00:15.540> best

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
string bending in my opinion works best

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.010 
string bending in my opinion works best
as<00:00:16.199> as<00:00:16.800> much<00:00:17.130> as<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.369> tend<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.910> bash<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:18.779> in<00:00:18.930> a

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
as as much as I tend to bash this in a

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.070 
as as much as I tend to bash this in a
couple<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.500> videos<00:00:20.029> binary<00:00:21.029> riffing<00:00:21.420> but

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
couple of the videos binary riffing but

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.290 
couple of the videos binary riffing but
instead<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.529> bouncing<00:00:23.340> between<00:00:23.460> 1<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.090> 0

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.229 

you<00:00:29.900> know<00:00:30.019> you're<00:00:30.800> gonna<00:00:30.949> just<00:00:31.220> pick<00:00:31.519> really

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
you know you're gonna just pick really

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:40.630 
you know you're gonna just pick really
really<00:00:33.050> hard<00:00:33.350> on<00:00:33.649> your<00:00:34.010> open<00:00:34.280> string

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.099 

here<00:00:41.420> that

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.109 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:49.079 

you're<00:00:47.649> picking<00:00:47.829> so<00:00:48.159> hard<00:00:48.399> that<00:00:48.579> it<00:00:48.670> actually

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 
you're picking so hard that it actually

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:59.170 
you're picking so hard that it actually
bends<00:00:49.329> the<00:00:49.570> starting<00:00:49.929> note<00:00:50.140> up<00:00:50.379> a<00:00:50.499> half-step

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.160 

as<00:01:00.140> a<00:01:00.710> very<00:01:01.160> distinct<00:01:01.700> sound<00:01:01.930> extremely<00:01:02.930> heavy

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
as a very distinct sound extremely heavy

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.840 
as a very distinct sound extremely heavy
michiga<00:01:04.129> does<00:01:04.489> this<00:01:04.640> a<00:01:04.820> lot<00:01:05.890> as<00:01:06.890> do<00:01:07.310> a<00:01:07.340> lot<00:01:07.460> of

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
michiga does this a lot as do a lot of

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.520 
michiga does this a lot as do a lot of
current<00:01:08.210> djent<00:01:08.510> bands<00:01:08.750> I<00:01:09.050> think<00:01:09.290> I've<00:01:09.410> heard

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
current djent bands I think I've heard

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.219 
current djent bands I think I've heard
Veil<00:01:09.740> of<00:01:09.770> Maya<00:01:09.950> do<00:01:10.340> it<00:01:10.490> quite<00:01:10.910> a<00:01:10.940> bit<00:01:11.060> I<00:01:11.420> could

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
Veil of Maya do it quite a bit I could

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.650 
Veil of Maya do it quite a bit I could
be<00:01:12.380> mistaken<00:01:12.760> I've<00:01:13.760> heard<00:01:13.970> someone<00:01:14.420> do<00:01:14.540> it

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
be mistaken I've heard someone do it

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.140 
be mistaken I've heard someone do it
quite<00:01:14.840> a<00:01:14.870> bit

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
quite a bit

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.390 
quite a bit
alright<00:01:17.150> anyway<00:01:17.479> what<00:01:18.200> you<00:01:18.380> can<00:01:18.560> do<00:01:18.770> here<00:01:19.190> and

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
alright anyway what you can do here and

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.310 
alright anyway what you can do here and
what's<00:01:19.670> so<00:01:19.850> special<00:01:20.210> about<00:01:20.510> this<00:01:20.810> technique

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
what's so special about this technique

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.700 
what's so special about this technique
is<00:01:21.880> it<00:01:22.880> lends<00:01:23.300> itself<00:01:23.479> very<00:01:24.050> naturally<00:01:24.680> to

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
is it lends itself very naturally to

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.000 
is it lends itself very naturally to
weirdly<00:01:25.250> syncopated<00:01:25.880> rhythms<00:01:26.180> because<00:01:27.010> you

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
weirdly syncopated rhythms because you

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.690 
weirdly syncopated rhythms because you
can<00:01:28.460> almost<00:01:28.640> wait<00:01:29.180> for<00:01:30.080> the<00:01:30.290> duration<00:01:30.650> of<00:01:31.010> your

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
can almost wait for the duration of your

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.030 
can almost wait for the duration of your
bend<00:01:32.180> to<00:01:32.600> wear<00:01:32.840> off<00:01:33.020> as<00:01:33.320> soon<00:01:33.530> as<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:33.770> hear<00:01:34.009> it

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
bend to wear off as soon as you hear it

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.999 
bend to wear off as soon as you hear it
start<00:01:34.369> to<00:01:34.399> glide<00:01:34.759> down<00:01:34.810> back<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:36.170> your<00:01:36.680> lowest

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
start to glide down back to your lowest

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.060 
start to glide down back to your lowest
note<00:01:37.220> that's<00:01:38.180> when<00:01:38.600> you<00:01:38.930> cut<00:01:39.470> it<00:01:39.590> off<00:01:39.740> and

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
note that's when you cut it off and

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:54.950 
note that's when you cut it off and
syncopate<00:01:40.640> it

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.330 

so<00:01:55.960> these<00:01:56.080> these<00:01:56.470> rifts<00:01:56.770> almost<00:01:57.130> build

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
so these these rifts almost build

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.830 
so these these rifts almost build
themselves<00:01:57.520> and<00:01:58.120> I<00:01:58.240> wouldn't<00:01:58.570> recommend

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
themselves and I wouldn't recommend

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.050 
themselves and I wouldn't recommend
relying<00:01:59.229> on<00:01:59.409> it<00:01:59.560> too<00:01:59.740> much<00:01:59.920> but<00:02:00.700> it<00:02:00.820> can<00:02:00.940> be

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
relying on it too much but it can be

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.460 
relying on it too much but it can be
really<00:02:01.180> fun<00:02:01.479> once<00:02:01.750> in<00:02:01.840> a<00:02:01.900> while<00:02:02.050> it's<00:02:02.380> just

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
really fun once in a while it's just

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.430 
really fun once in a while it's just
kind<00:02:02.770> of<00:02:02.860> a<00:02:03.300> way<00:02:04.300> to<00:02:04.330> shake<00:02:04.690> things<00:02:04.900> up<00:02:05.110> shake

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
kind of a way to shake things up shake

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.680 
kind of a way to shake things up shake
up<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.710> general<00:02:06.040> sound<00:02:06.369> because<00:02:07.240> it's<00:02:07.420> it

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
up the general sound because it's it

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.389 
up the general sound because it's it
does<00:02:07.900> sound<00:02:08.140> incredibly<00:02:08.920> heavy<00:02:09.100> because

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
does sound incredibly heavy because

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.340 
does sound incredibly heavy because
you're<00:02:09.670> picking<00:02:10.000> so<00:02:10.450> damn<00:02:10.690> hard<00:02:10.990> that<00:02:11.260> it

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
you're picking so damn hard that it

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.690 
you're picking so damn hard that it
actually<00:02:11.530> bends<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.160> open<00:02:12.370> note<00:02:12.520> of<00:02:12.640> the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
actually bends the open note of the

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.060 
actually bends the open note of the
string<00:02:13.000> another<00:02:13.780> really<00:02:14.560> interesting<00:02:14.590> thing

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
string another really interesting thing

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.860 
string another really interesting thing
you<00:02:15.310> can<00:02:15.459> do<00:02:15.580> with<00:02:15.760> this<00:02:15.910> is<00:02:16.150> actually<00:02:16.690> let

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
you can do with this is actually let

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.930 
you can do with this is actually let
your<00:02:17.020> pick<00:02:17.260> rest<00:02:17.680> back<00:02:18.010> onto<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.700> string

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
your pick rest back onto the string

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:27.449 
your pick rest back onto the string
while<00:02:19.150> it's<00:02:19.360> still<00:02:19.540> ringing<00:02:25.200> here<00:02:26.200> that<00:02:26.459> it

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
while it's still ringing here that it

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.430 
while it's still ringing here that it
creates<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.880> harmonic<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.570> because<00:02:29.320> you're

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
creates a harmonic and because you're

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.920 
creates a harmonic and because you're
still<00:02:29.709> bending<00:02:30.220> it<00:02:30.750> sounds<00:02:31.750> like<00:02:31.840> the

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
still bending it sounds like the

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.509 
still bending it sounds like the
harmonic<00:02:32.350> itself<00:02:32.680> is<00:02:32.800> being<00:02:32.980> bent<00:02:33.220> up<00:02:33.400> a

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
harmonic itself is being bent up a

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:53.930 
harmonic itself is being bent up a
little

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.920 

just<00:02:54.940> mess<00:02:55.090> around<00:02:55.120> with<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:55.600> it<00:02:55.690> can<00:02:55.780> be
