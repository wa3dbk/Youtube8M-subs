well what's the point this I need to get

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.140 
well what's the point this I need to get
rid<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.280> because<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.610> keeps<00:01:41.700> logging<00:01:42.000> me

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
rid of it because it keeps logging me

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.700

into<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.509> default<00:01:42.930> account<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.470> want<00:01:43.680> to

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
into this default account and I want to

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.130

make this account my default account
instead<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.430> thought<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.850> might<00:01:48.060> also

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
instead and I thought that might also

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.179 
instead and I thought that might also
solve<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.869> problem<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.320> not<00:01:49.680> being<00:01:49.950> able<00:01:50.040> to

the same clue scroll which kind of sucks

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.600 
the same clue scroll which kind of sucks
dick<00:05:32.990> because<00:05:33.350> this<00:05:33.890> could<00:05:34.040> be<00:05:34.220> a<00:05:34.250> zamorak

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
dick because this could be a zamorak

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.580 
dick because this could be a zamorak
page<00:05:35.000> and<00:05:35.330> it<00:05:35.420> could<00:05:35.600> be<00:05:35.630> like<00:05:35.840> as<00:05:35.990> in<00:05:36.140> a<00:05:36.170> coif

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
page and it could be like as in a coif

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.230 
page and it could be like as in a coif
which<00:05:37.040> would<00:05:37.280> be<00:05:37.430> a<00:05:37.460> lot<00:05:37.730> worth<00:05:37.970> a<00:05:38.090> lot<00:05:38.210> more

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
which would be a lot worth a lot more

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.880 
which would be a lot worth a lot more
but<00:05:38.570> I<00:05:38.720> guess<00:05:38.870> I<00:05:38.990> can't<00:05:39.200> complain<00:05:39.260> because<00:05:39.740> i

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
but I guess I can't complain because i

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.200 
but I guess I can't complain because i
did<00:05:40.130> get<00:05:40.280> these<00:05:40.430> items<00:05:40.640> but<00:05:40.940> they're<00:05:41.090> only

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
did get these items but they're only

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.480 
did get these items but they're only
like<00:05:41.390> 100k<00:05:41.810> each<00:05:42.080> so<00:05:42.380> it's<00:05:42.680> not<00:05:42.800> really<00:05:42.860> worth

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
like 100k each so it's not really worth

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.910 
like 100k each so it's not really worth
much<00:05:43.790> and<00:05:44.360> i<00:05:44.690> also<00:05:44.870> had<00:05:45.110> to<00:05:45.260> buy<00:05:45.380> this<00:05:45.440> ancient
