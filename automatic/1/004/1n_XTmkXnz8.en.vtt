tanks and for you to be able to

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.640 
tanks and for you to be able to
understand<00:00:14.940> how<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.179> play<00:00:15.450> them<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.929> if<00:00:16.529> you

understand how to play them and if you
actually<00:00:16.830> want<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.250> go<00:00:17.340> for<00:00:17.580> them<00:00:17.670> so<00:00:18.359> today<00:00:18.810> we

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
actually want to go for them so today we

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.010 
actually want to go for them so today we
have<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.170> mt<00:00:19.740> 25<00:00:20.310> now<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.910> mt<00:00:21.240> 25<00:00:21.720> was

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
have the mt 25 now the mt 25 was

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.439 
have the mt 25 now the mt 25 was
actually<00:00:22.380> derivative<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.609> t-50<00:00:24.029> dash<00:00:24.210> 2

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
actually derivative of the t-50 dash 2

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.109 
actually derivative of the t-50 dash 2
which<00:00:24.600> was<00:00:24.779> introduced<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.609> few<00:00:26.609> patches<00:00:26.760> go

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
which was introduced a few patches go

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.779 
which was introduced a few patches go
but<00:00:27.630> was<00:00:27.779> also<00:00:27.960> removed<00:00:28.400> because<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.640> its

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
but was also removed because of its

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.220 
but was also removed because of its
inbounds<00:00:30.359> compared<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.990> real<00:00:31.199> life

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
inbounds compared to real life

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.680 
inbounds compared to real life
situations<00:00:31.710> teach<00:00:32.610> 50<00:00:32.940> dash<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.300> was<00:00:33.390> actually

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
situations teach 50 dash to was actually

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.970 
situations teach 50 dash to was actually
not<00:00:33.780> as<00:00:33.899> powerful<00:00:34.079> as<00:00:34.530> what<00:00:35.280> was<00:00:35.610> /<00:00:36.649> put<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
not as powerful as what was / put in the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.240 
not as powerful as what was / put in the
game<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.940> instead<00:00:39.420> they<00:00:39.480> gave<00:00:40.260> us<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.770> very<00:00:40.950> much

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
game so instead they gave us a very much

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.660 
game so instead they gave us a very much
slower<00:00:41.700> tank<00:00:42.120> which<00:00:42.840> had<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.590> same<00:00:44.100> gun<00:00:44.370> but

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
slower tank which had the same gun but

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.860 
slower tank which had the same gun but
very<00:00:44.910> much<00:00:45.090> slower<00:00:45.739> but<00:00:46.739> now<00:00:47.039> sin<00:00:47.610> 9.1<00:00:48.329> this

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
very much slower but now sin 9.1 this

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.590 
very much slower but now sin 9.1 this
tank<00:00:49.170> has<00:00:49.260> been<00:00:49.410> severely<00:00:50.280> upgraded<00:00:51.059> this

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
tank has been severely upgraded this

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.139 
tank has been severely upgraded this
tank<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.930> now<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.410> much<00:00:52.590> faster<00:00:52.860> now<00:00:53.280> just<00:00:54.030> a

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
tank is now so much faster now just a

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.360 
tank is now so much faster now just a
few<00:00:54.180> specs<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.899> currently<00:00:55.379> put<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.129> gun

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.140 
also put the machine gun on armed but I
prefer<00:01:07.439> not<00:01:07.590> doing<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.830> or<00:01:08.490> maybe<00:01:08.820> even<00:01:08.880> the

I've<00:01:20.189> elite<00:01:20.549> at<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.820> tank<00:01:21.060> at<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.360> point

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
I've elite at this tank at this point

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.359 
I've elite at this tank at this point
you<00:01:22.320> have<00:01:22.380> two<00:01:22.560> different<00:01:22.650> turrets<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
you have two different turrets the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.730 
you have two different turrets the
engine<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.820> 700<00:01:24.299> 700<00:01:24.930> horsepower<00:01:25.170> which<00:01:25.590> is

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
engine is 700 700 horsepower which is

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.170 
engine is 700 700 horsepower which is
way<00:01:25.979> better<00:01:26.130> than<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.549> city<00:01:27.560> tracks<00:01:29.180> have

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
way better than you city tracks have

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.300 
way better than you city tracks have
been<00:01:30.210> increased<00:01:31.020> also<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.710> single<00:01:32.040> range

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
been increased also in the single range

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.289 
been increased also in the single range
of<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.579> radio<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:32.970> good<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.360> have<00:01:33.930> fence<00:01:34.350> and

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
of the radio is good I have fence and

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.640 
of the radio is good I have fence and
enhanced<00:01:36.299> gun<00:01:36.390> laying<00:01:36.450> drive<00:01:36.900> because<00:01:37.530> I

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
enhanced gun laying drive because I

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.170 
enhanced gun laying drive because I
believe<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.189> tank<00:01:38.460> really<00:01:38.850> needs<00:01:39.030> to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
believe that this tank really needs to

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.450 
believe that this tank really needs to
have<00:01:39.360> as<00:01:39.540> many<00:01:39.810> shots<00:01:40.110> fast<00:01:40.560> as<00:01:40.799> possible<00:01:41.040> it

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
have as many shots fast as possible it

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.760 
have as many shots fast as possible it
is<00:01:41.700> not<00:01:41.939> an<00:01:42.060> American<00:01:42.509> shafi<00:01:42.990> though<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.350> its

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
is not an American shafi though in its

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.719 
is not an American shafi though in its
accuracy<00:01:44.100> on<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.399> run<00:01:45.350> shells<00:01:46.350> do<00:01:47.100> decent

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
accuracy on the run shells do decent

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.109 
accuracy on the run shells do decent
stuff<00:01:48.350> and<00:01:51.200> different<00:01:52.200> details<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:53.520> turret

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
stuff and different details the turret

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.690 
stuff and different details the turret
is<00:01:54.329> 48<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.560> very<00:01:55.740> rapid<00:01:56.100> now<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.460> can<00:01:56.579> see

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
is 48 so this very rapid now you can see

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.429 
is 48 so this very rapid now you can see
my<00:01:56.820> crew<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.060> pretty<00:01:57.390> up<00:01:57.540> there<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:57.990> we're<00:01:58.409> just

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
all right this is variously matched I

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.250 
all right this is variously matched I
should<00:02:09.039> beat<00:02:09.190> a<00:02:09.729> lot<00:02:09.940> of<00:02:10.179> points<00:02:10.720> in<00:02:10.929> this

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
should beat a lot of points in this

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.500

ever since 9.1 the speed has incredibly
upgraded<00:02:30.310> typically<00:02:31.150> I<00:02:31.180> would<00:02:31.240> take<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:31.840> little

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
upgraded typically I would take a little

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.680 
upgraded typically I would take a little
bit<00:02:32.440> of<00:02:32.500> while<00:02:32.740> to<00:02:33.010> get<00:02:33.130> to<00:02:33.190> 50<00:02:33.670> now<00:02:34.180> takes<00:02:34.510> me

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
bit of while to get to 50 now takes me

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.800 
bit of while to get to 50 now takes me
almost<00:02:34.840> no<00:02:35.140> time<00:02:35.320> to<00:02:35.530> get<00:02:35.620> 60<00:02:36.100> and<00:02:36.250> 70<00:02:36.780> also<00:02:37.780> i

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
almost no time to get 60 and 70 also i

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.720 
almost no time to get 60 and 70 also i
can<00:02:38.050> turn<00:02:38.230> so<00:02:38.680> much<00:02:38.920> better<00:02:39.160> than<00:02:39.340> I<00:02:39.459> could<00:02:39.610> be

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
can turn so much better than I could be

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:46.260 
can turn so much better than I could be
for<00:02:42.510> now<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.570> mt<00:02:44.050> 25<00:02:44.620> is<00:02:45.070> how<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:46.060> should<00:02:46.209> be

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
for now the mt 25 is how it should be

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.949 
for now the mt 25 is how it should be
played<00:02:46.360> is<00:02:47.050> it<00:02:47.320> is<00:02:47.830> a<00:02:47.860> scout<00:02:48.370> so<00:02:49.360> it<00:02:49.510> can<00:02:49.660> really

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
played is it is a scout so it can really

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.680 
played is it is a scout so it can really

scout very well yet at the same time the
gun<00:02:53.020> just<00:02:53.260> does<00:02:53.650> so<00:02:53.980> much<00:02:54.220> it<00:02:54.489> has<00:02:54.640> such<00:02:54.880> great

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090
