that<00:01:24.299> pushes<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.319> usually<00:01:25.649> comes<00:01:25.799> out<00:01:25.889> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
that pushes it and usually comes out the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.980 
that pushes it and usually comes out the
back<00:01:26.189> well<00:01:26.729> for<00:01:26.969> the<00:01:27.030> MP<00:01:27.329> 10<00:01:27.569> it<00:01:27.749> actually

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
back well for the MP 10 it actually

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.269 
back well for the MP 10 it actually
comes<00:01:28.170> through<00:01:28.319> the<00:01:28.409> bottom<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:28.979> instead<00:01:29.219> of

00:01:29.269 --> 00:01:29.279 
comes through the bottom so instead of

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:33.050 
comes through the bottom so instead of
just<00:01:29.490> having<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.569> spring<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:30.990> for<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:32.060> you
