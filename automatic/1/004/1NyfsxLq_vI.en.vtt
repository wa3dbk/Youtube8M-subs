00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.789
 Hello and welcome to 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.580
 to roll short tips video to dota 2 of 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.279
 my name is bond buy back to the 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.710
 keyboard and as I said in this case 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.970
 is about 32 and a short video 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.880
 or 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.800
 something not necessarily the short one 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.149
 video is because the word wants to talk is 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.290
 way too big for it in a single one 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.899
 Video clip 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.200
 it is only so-called print and what 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.390
 that is more difficult 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.370
 I'll show you the best 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.719
 right there and we can 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.100
 keep on working so that is here 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.000
 drugs or 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.420
 We look at the whole situation 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.739
 At the clicks on here I see if I 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.210
 I was bound to become here 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.399
 I would like to be like this 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.550
 greedy little Bastard I have the sau 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:07.020
 Now I am in the following situations 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.049
 where the bathroom flies a nato if 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.220
 trainer and magnus of pasture kill me 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.689
 if I can do that, I'll dodge it 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.460
 because shot only a single line 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.610
 goes and I have through the game and 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.380
 that she is quite simple in the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.240
 head now I have the following 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.710
 possibilities of the next shot there 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.420
 sitting is the chic short 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.310
 as soon as we have cancer, that's me 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.479
 I'll die one hundred percent 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.430
 I am still here 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.400
 also has magnus same from a 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.049
 shockwave my cancer come and me 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.579
 then either be asked and with 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.650
 checkmate killed or shaken and 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.130
 then killed with porsche or should i 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.229
 with dead 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.329
 that means I should not be here at all 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.280
 fall, she should not go here either 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.950
 my only option for this 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.680
 dream pattinson com is here to 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.229
 go and this is ruben designate 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.350
 that one can not see an opponent 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.140
 if he is in the forest the perfect 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.540
 example of this is a tree here 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.380
 the opponent here is ours 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.689
 exists here 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.409
 you can not see him there because you only 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.660
 so can see this tree 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.460
 cast a shadow for yourself 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.060
 You look like that and you 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.010
 nothing is here because of that in the 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.530
 dark half, so to speak, has nothing left 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.640
 dark side of power to do 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.110
 so now we can do it perfectly 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.210
 Watch her and her perfect way 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.880
 watch me do that I go here 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:31.450
 now and then I just put here 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.650
 to go on really long myself 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.650
 here 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.540
 now both of them can not see me 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.920
 even if both are here and actually 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.140
 the magnus would have the greatest possible vision 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.940
 can not see me here me 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.130
 can see that because or 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.070
 magnus in which a trip but are 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.250
 he can not see me he can me 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.210
 I can not see I am here and make it 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.160
 to escape from him 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.600
 and both have no idea where I am 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.730
 she thinks I am here 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.780
 he thinks I ran out of here 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.280
 and I can escape so perfectly what 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.740
 I should be the best example of that 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.170
 may have for soups but it is a 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.970
 example to show you what it is 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.490
 and how it can work 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.470
 I have no idea how to get one 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.610
 Videoguard should build three 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.830
 I 've really dealt with that 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.500
 No plan because there are so many 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.840
 positions the best position for jogging 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.490
 if I still personally what is 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.010
 just so many possibilities 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.100
 is hardly someone tower as radeon can 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.880
 you let off steam here stupid and stupid 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.340
 There are also many beautiful ones here 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.410
 possibilities here also in the forest 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.600
 What do you mean, how she ate here? 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.100
 are so you understand you come here 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.780
 can walk around everywhere 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.790
 this tree here is pretty 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.370
 interesting these trees here 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.910
 There are really countless possibilities 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.610
 and to print to alien opponents to come 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.170
 to do that with the game engine 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.490
 plays like a direction 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.960
 walking on the road can understand one another 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.030
 few trees the enemy can not see 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.860
 that a very very nice it was zickt 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.990
 taken from warcraft 3 engine that is 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.760
 Everything with intention so to additional 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.980
 to build skill into the game 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.900
 in this sense, you guys need to be 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.520
 Write more for yourself now 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.750
 I want to see with me now 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.460
 weight this video knows now 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.050
 understood or should I try 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.610
 to make several videos where I have them 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.799
 again explained in replays or 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.690
 maybe also in the singleplayer 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.150
 go in and watch the singleplayer 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.400
 alone in the test mode go in to 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.389
 look where these are what you are 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.460
 can do with them 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.530
 can achieve that and so on and so on 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.449
 away he is in demand then for all 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.039
 To be honest I am overwhelmed with what 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.289
 that concerns myself a possibility 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:37.479
 to think 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:39.099
 to do this guide or whether it at 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.979
 should stay this guide now and 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:43.960
 as we all know, 499 minds 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.060
 better than a head especially if yours 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.039
 head is empty these must be the boys 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.639
 So let me know and see you next 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:50.939
 times 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.939
 ciao
