00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
here if I were to unravel it would go

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.150 
here if I were to unravel it would go
from<00:00:39.030> Canada<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.780> Gulf<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.170> Mexico<00:00:40.620> yes

from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico yes

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.119 
from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico yes
crazy<00:00:41.579> right<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.329> true<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.379> woven<00:00:43.590> that

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
crazy right it's true it is woven that

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.639 
crazy right it's true it is woven that
dense<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.270> dense<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:46.289> one<00:00:46.850> hair<00:00:47.850> chopped<00:00:48.649> 200

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
dense so dense that one hair chopped 200

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.819 
dense so dense that one hair chopped 200
times<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.670> density<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:52.050> cloth<00:00:52.320> so

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
times is the density of this cloth so

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.380 
times is the density of this cloth so
your<00:00:52.980> regular<00:00:53.280> microfiber<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.910> get<00:00:54.120> at

Walmart or Costco whatever that's woven
one-sixth<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.989> hair<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.829> makes<00:00:58.980> a

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
one-sixth of a hair so that makes a

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.279 
one-sixth of a hair so that makes a
really<00:00:59.370> huge<00:00:59.969> difference<00:01:00.600> because<00:01:01.079> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
really huge difference because the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.319 
really huge difference because the
tighter<00:01:01.620> its<00:01:01.920> woven<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.760> more<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.239> pick

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
tighter its woven the more it can pick

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.270 
tighter its woven the more it can pick
up<00:01:03.449> off<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> surface<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.710> cloth<00:01:05.010> can

earth Norwich's didn't invent the silver

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.340 
earth Norwich's didn't invent the silver
but<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:55.950> known<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.460> anti-vaccine

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
that yup gets picked up in here it comes

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.290 
that yup gets picked up in here it comes
into<00:02:03.950> contact<00:02:04.160> with<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.640> silver<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.210> it

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
into contact with the silver and it

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.660 
into contact with the silver and it
suffocates<00:02:05.720> it<00:02:06.140> it<00:02:06.560> activates<00:02:07.220> it<00:02:07.370> so<00:02:07.550> it

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
suffocates it it activates it so it

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.700 
suffocates it it activates it so it
can't<00:02:07.880> duplicate<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:08.690> grow<00:02:08.840> did<00:02:09.350> you<00:02:09.500> know

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
can't duplicate and grow did you know

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.410 
can't duplicate and grow did you know
the<00:02:10.250> reason<00:02:10.550> that<00:02:10.640> your<00:02:10.820> clots<00:02:11.090> in<00:02:11.330> your

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
the reason that your clots in your

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.540 
the reason that your clots in your
kitchen<00:02:11.690> are<00:02:11.780> stinky<00:02:12.350> is<00:02:12.770> because<00:02:13.220> one

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
kitchen are stinky is because one

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.210 
kitchen are stinky is because one
bacteria<00:02:14.300> in<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.540> 24-hour<00:02:15.050> period<00:02:15.290> duplicates

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
bacteria in a 24-hour period duplicates

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.430 
bacteria in a 24-hour period duplicates
into<00:02:16.490> eight<00:02:16.880> million<00:02:17.330> they<00:02:17.870> just<00:02:18.140> breathe

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
into eight million they just breathe

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.590 
into eight million they just breathe
like<00:02:18.680> rapid-fire<00:02:19.310> so<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.150> silver<00:02:20.480> in<00:02:20.570> the

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
like rapid-fire so the silver in the

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.080 
like rapid-fire so the silver in the
cloth<00:02:20.930> stops<00:02:21.560> that<00:02:21.890> process<00:02:22.400> from<00:02:22.580> happening

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
cloth stops that process from happening

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.410 
cloth stops that process from happening
so<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.810> club<00:02:24.020> actually<00:02:24.260> purifies<00:02:25.220> itself<00:02:25.430> so
