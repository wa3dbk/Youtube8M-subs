00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.270 

we<00:05:43.280> are<00:05:43.400> putting<00:05:43.759> up<00:05:44.440> the<00:05:45.440> beginnings<00:05:45.919> of<00:05:46.130> the

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
we are putting up the beginnings of the

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:58.749 
we are putting up the beginnings of the
roof<00:05:54.160> like<00:05:55.160> Ron<00:05:55.400> is<00:05:55.520> symbol<00:05:56.979> I'm<00:05:57.979> a<00:05:58.039> sailor<00:05:58.400> I

00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 
roof like Ron is symbol I'm a sailor I

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:10.659 
roof like Ron is symbol I'm a sailor I
sail<00:06:07.449> so<00:06:08.449> here<00:06:08.750> it<00:06:08.930> is<00:06:09.199> where<00:06:10.190> we<00:06:10.280> know<00:06:10.400> if<00:06:10.520> we

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:10.669 
sail so here it is where we know if we

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:20.219 
sail so here it is where we know if we
calculate

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:20.229 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:30.260 

yeah<00:06:21.229> looks<00:06:22.070> good

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.879 

so<00:06:31.099> break<00:06:32.099> it<00:06:32.130> got<00:06:32.940> most<00:06:33.120> the<00:06:33.240> walls<00:06:33.419> are<00:06:33.599> just

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:33.889 
so break it got most the walls are just

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:36.589 
so break it got most the walls are just
got<00:06:34.889> one<00:06:35.009> last<00:06:35.160> window<00:06:35.460> to<00:06:35.699> cut<00:06:35.849> out<00:06:36.000> so<00:06:36.270> what
