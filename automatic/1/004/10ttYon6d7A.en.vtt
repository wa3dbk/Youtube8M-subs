earlier<00:04:01.650> we<00:04:01.740> did<00:04:01.890> this<00:04:02.040> as<00:04:02.250> well<00:04:02.370> just<00:04:02.670> to<00:04:02.760> make

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
earlier we did this as well just to make

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.140 
earlier we did this as well just to make
sure<00:04:03.710> just<00:04:04.710> to<00:04:04.800> kind<00:04:04.980> of<00:04:05.010> see<00:04:05.160> how<00:04:05.340> long<00:04:05.550> how

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
sure just to kind of see how long how

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.150

much it removed it removed about three

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.730 
much it removed it removed about three
and<00:04:08.190> a<00:04:08.520> half<00:04:08.550> cakes<00:04:09.150> earlier<00:04:09.720> so<00:04:10.530> it

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
and a half cakes earlier so it

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:11.900 
and a half cakes earlier so it
definitely<00:04:10.980> does<00:04:11.280> its<00:04:11.460> job<00:04:11.640> in<00:04:11.790> this

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
definitely does its job in this

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.220 
definitely does its job in this
computer's<00:04:12.270> right<00:04:12.450> and<00:04:12.570> significantly

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
computer's right and significantly

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.180 
computer's right and significantly
faster<00:04:13.410> because<00:04:13.800> of<00:04:14.070> it<00:04:14.750> so<00:04:15.750> base<00:04:16.710> that's<00:04:16.980> done

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
faster because of it so base that's done

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.349 
faster because of it so base that's done
there<00:04:17.430> we'll<00:04:17.609> go<00:04:17.700> ahead<00:04:17.760> and<00:04:17.880> close<00:04:18.090> out<00:04:18.299> of

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
there we'll go ahead and close out of

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.740 
there we'll go ahead and close out of
that<00:04:18.480> and<00:04:19.760> one<00:04:20.760> of<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:20.910> last<00:04:21.090> things<00:04:21.270> we<00:04:21.510> want

that and one of the last things we want

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.450 
that and one of the last things we want
to<00:04:21.780> do<00:04:21.930> is<00:04:22.200> we'll<00:04:22.380> go<00:04:22.500> back<00:04:22.680> into<00:04:22.950> the<00:04:23.130> settings

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460
