00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:04.240
 like pan mantra ratchet band uneven groningen already 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.510
 it's not that hard 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.399
 it has three positions 

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:11.399
 and I can put it in another position and put it in the other position 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:16.590
 with this you slide what he sits he would be in a ratchet position would the 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:18.570
 curator 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.570
 packers 5 4 in the lot put a bus in a different position 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.759
 can close completely 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.560
 it's locked 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.399
 tickets warning 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.229
 you can rattle you 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:31.949
 both discs j 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.949
 and then completely open 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.730
 and now he is in his free freestyle now could pull into a puddle night watch 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.360
 what's here is that the band slot officially says food 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.740
 takes the basket 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.580
 what do you do with it 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.900
 a customer 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.810
 only the term actually returns 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.810
 is the easiest 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.510
 I got that thing too 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.300
 nl film from there would be in the shed 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.040
 and win behind the keys 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.040
 from that other chance 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.810
 but once a lot out 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.050
 Now the products number is as tight as possible by hand before you go 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.480
 the council all 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.090
 the tighter dynamics in advance state formation with dpi is on the 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.960
 band slot 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.080
 and the thicker that store is for difficult you can get loose nac 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.380
 well and hold on tight and it did 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.800
 ticks retract 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.310
 close completely 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.270
 and then it is locked 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.200
 but will taste 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.420
 sliding the ek in 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.590
 and you can reverse it enormously 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.570
 and then it comes loose 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.570
 manager 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.700
 that we still go along 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.649
 occasionally a bit of a greasy 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.849
 but with your move is better so late 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.019
 that action was thus the union 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.629
 let it dry before you play a leading role 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.029
 don't leave them clear 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:21.719
 Goodluck
