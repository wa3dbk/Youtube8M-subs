00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.010 
hey guys here's a quick look at the arc

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.640 
hey guys here's a quick look at the arc
eh<00:00:03.430> upgraded<00:00:04.300> carbon<00:00:05.170> fiber<00:00:05.380> and<00:00:05.620> aluminum

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:05.650 
eh upgraded carbon fiber and aluminum

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.879 
eh upgraded carbon fiber and aluminum
landing<00:00:06.310> gear<00:00:06.460> for<00:00:06.759> the<00:00:06.790> nano<00:00:07.029> CPX<00:00:07.440> so<00:00:08.440> this<00:00:08.860> is

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:08.889 
landing gear for the nano CPX so this is

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:10.980 
landing gear for the nano CPX so this is
the<00:00:09.039> style<00:00:09.490> number<00:00:09.909> three<00:00:10.240> which<00:00:10.419> is<00:00:10.539> pretty

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:10.990 
the style number three which is pretty

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.560 
the style number three which is pretty
much<00:00:11.110> like<00:00:11.289> a<00:00:11.499> TDR<00:00:12.099> style<00:00:12.459> landing<00:00:13.150> gear<00:00:13.269> set

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:13.570

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.289 
much like a TDR style landing gear set
its<00:00:14.230> silver<00:00:14.679> and<00:00:14.889> it<00:00:14.980> comes<00:00:15.190> with<00:00:15.309> a<00:00:15.730> battery

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
its silver and it comes with a battery

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.100 
its silver and it comes with a battery
mouth<00:00:16.630> for<00:00:16.990> the<00:00:17.650> stock<00:00:17.920> size<00:00:18.180> batteries<00:00:19.180> so

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.110 
mouth for the stock size batteries so

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.560 
mouth for the stock size batteries so
let<00:00:20.200> me<00:00:20.230> open<00:00:20.350> up<00:00:20.590> and<00:00:20.770> show<00:00:20.830> you<00:00:20.920> guys<00:00:20.980> how<00:00:21.570> the

let me open up and show you guys how the

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.340 
let me open up and show you guys how the
contents<00:00:23.350> look<00:00:23.590> inside<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:25.840> it<00:00:25.930> comes<00:00:26.110> in<00:00:26.289> a

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.350 
contents look inside so it comes in a

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.370 
contents look inside so it comes in a
ziplock<00:00:26.830> bag<00:00:27.070> which<00:00:27.490> is<00:00:27.640> very<00:00:27.880> easy<00:00:28.030> to<00:00:28.150> open

mouth but here you go two mounts once
for<00:00:44.199> the<00:00:44.469> rear<00:00:44.710> and<00:00:45.010> once<00:00:45.249> for<00:00:45.519> the<00:00:45.670> front<00:00:45.940> you

00:00:46.169 --> 00:00:46.179 
for the rear and once for the front you

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:48.180 
for the rear and once for the front you
really<00:00:46.510> can't<00:00:46.780> go<00:00:46.960> wrong<00:00:46.989> no<00:00:47.620> manual<00:00:48.069> is

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
really can't go wrong no manual is

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.459 
really can't go wrong no manual is
really<00:00:48.429> needed<00:00:48.729> for<00:00:48.940> this<00:00:49.059> because<00:00:49.510> the<00:00:50.260> back

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
really needed for this because the back

battery will be this one with the

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:58.110 
battery will be this one with the
plastic<00:00:56.889> battery<00:00:57.399> mount<00:00:57.609> so<00:00:57.729> you<00:00:57.819> can<00:00:57.940> see

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
plastic battery mount so you can see

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.629 
plastic battery mount so you can see
there's<00:00:58.299> two<00:00:58.799> battery<00:00:59.799> mounts<00:01:00.129> wanted<00:01:00.519> you

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:00.639 
there's two battery mounts wanted you

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:04.320 
there's two battery mounts wanted you
decide<00:01:01.949> give<00:01:02.949> you<00:01:03.039> guys<00:01:03.159> a<00:01:03.190> closer<00:01:03.670> look<00:01:04.030> let

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
decide give you guys a closer look let

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.200 
decide give you guys a closer look let
me<00:01:04.420> focus<00:01:04.750> on<00:01:05.050> that<00:01:05.140> one<00:01:05.260> for<00:01:05.410> you<00:01:05.500> guys<00:01:06.210> there

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
me focus on that one for you guys there

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.620 
me focus on that one for you guys there
you<00:01:07.330> go<00:01:07.480> very<00:01:08.470> cool<00:01:08.950> very<00:01:09.190> feels<00:01:10.150> very<00:01:10.420> light

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
you go very cool very feels very light

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.480 
you go very cool very feels very light
so<00:01:10.810> it's<00:01:10.900> not<00:01:10.960> too<00:01:11.110> heavy<00:01:11.260> at<00:01:11.500> all<00:01:11.590> let<00:01:12.310> me<00:01:12.400> open

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
so it's not too heavy at all let me open

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:19.550 
so it's not too heavy at all let me open
up<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:12.910> carbon<00:01:13.300> fiber<00:01:13.570> one<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.950> here<00:01:18.220> we<00:01:18.400> go

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
up the carbon fiber one so here we go

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.740 
up the carbon fiber one so here we go
slide<00:01:20.560> them<00:01:20.710> out<00:01:20.890> you<00:01:21.190> get<00:01:21.370> two<00:01:21.730> nice<00:01:22.120> carbon

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
slide them out you get two nice carbon

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.980 
slide them out you get two nice carbon
fiber<00:01:23.020> so<00:01:23.680> usually<00:01:24.550> when<00:01:24.730> i<00:01:24.790> get<00:01:25.060> any<00:01:25.270> carbon

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
fiber so usually when i get any carbon

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.960 
fiber so usually when i get any carbon
fiber<00:01:26.230> you<00:01:26.650> know<00:01:26.800> aftermarket<00:01:27.520> upgrades<00:01:27.580> i

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
fiber you know aftermarket upgrades i

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.640 
fiber you know aftermarket upgrades i
like<00:01:28.120> to<00:01:28.270> check<00:01:28.540> the<00:01:28.690> carbon<00:01:28.930> fiber<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.380> see<00:01:29.560> if

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
like to check the carbon fiber to see if

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.010 
like to check the carbon fiber to see if
it's<00:01:29.800> sharp<00:01:30.190> because<00:01:30.820> usually<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.510> cheaper

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
it's sharp because usually the cheaper

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.750 
it's sharp because usually the cheaper
ones<00:01:32.290> you<00:01:32.530> know<00:01:32.650> the<00:01:32.770> cheaper<00:01:33.100> upgrades<00:01:33.490> when

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
ones you know the cheaper upgrades when

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.730 
ones you know the cheaper upgrades when
you<00:01:33.880> get<00:01:34.090> them<00:01:34.240> it's<00:01:34.690> very<00:01:35.110> it's<00:01:35.290> like<00:01:35.380> a<00:01:35.410> very

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
you get them it's very it's like a very

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.590 
you get them it's very it's like a very
rough<00:01:36.040> cut<00:01:36.340> this<00:01:36.520> one<00:01:36.640> actually<00:01:36.790> feels<00:01:37.210> very

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
rough cut this one actually feels very

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.600 
rough cut this one actually feels very
smooth<00:01:38.080> so<00:01:38.110> there's<00:01:38.470> no<00:01:38.680> fiber<00:01:39.010> sticking<00:01:39.490> out

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
smooth so there's no fiber sticking out

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.090 
smooth so there's no fiber sticking out
which<00:01:40.210> is<00:01:40.240> very<00:01:40.600> good<00:01:40.690> so<00:01:41.140> we<00:01:41.290> all<00:01:41.440> know<00:01:41.650> well<00:01:41.950> i

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
which is very good so we all know well i

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.280 
which is very good so we all know well i
know<00:01:42.220> that<00:01:42.460> RK<00:01:43.360> did<00:01:43.540> a<00:01:43.600> really<00:01:43.780> good<00:01:43.930> job<00:01:43.990> you

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
know that RK did a really good job you

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.600 
know that RK did a really good job you
can<00:01:44.410> see<00:01:44.560> I<00:01:44.590> can<00:01:44.650> put<00:01:44.860> my<00:01:44.890> finger<00:01:44.980> along<00:01:45.460> it

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
can see I can put my finger along it

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.960 
can see I can put my finger along it
without<00:01:46.090> getting<00:01:46.150> cut<00:01:46.690> or<00:01:46.870> about<00:01:47.050> getting<00:01:47.110> any

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
without getting cut or about getting any

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.580 
without getting cut or about getting any
rough<00:01:48.970> surfaces<00:01:49.450> catching<00:01:49.870> on<00:01:49.960> my<00:01:50.050> fingertips

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
rough surfaces catching on my fingertips

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.400 
rough surfaces catching on my fingertips
so<00:01:51.280> very<00:01:52.120> nice<00:01:52.390> if<00:01:52.960> you<00:01:53.110> look<00:01:53.200> on<00:01:53.320> the<00:01:53.380> outside

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
so very nice if you look on the outside

rear<00:05:28.229> fits<00:05:28.440> a<00:05:28.530> little<00:05:29.009> tight<00:05:29.220> which<00:05:29.639> is<00:05:29.819> good

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
rear fits a little tight which is good

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.129 
rear fits a little tight which is good
so<00:05:30.300> that<00:05:30.449> way<00:05:30.569> I<00:05:30.599> know<00:05:30.750> it's<00:05:30.870> not<00:05:30.930> going<00:05:31.050> to

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
so that way I know it's not going to

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:33.740 
so that way I know it's not going to
fall<00:05:31.319> off<00:05:31.349> in<00:05:31.650> the<00:05:31.969> fall<00:05:32.969> off<00:05:33.090> in<00:05:33.240> flight<00:05:33.419> if

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
fall off in the fall off in flight if

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.390 
fall off in the fall off in flight if
you<00:05:34.139> guys<00:05:34.259> are<00:05:34.409> having<00:05:34.650> a<00:05:34.740> tight<00:05:34.949> fit<00:05:35.219> which

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
you guys are having a tight fit which

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.740 
you guys are having a tight fit which
you<00:05:35.490> could<00:05:35.669> do<00:05:35.789> is<00:05:35.909> just<00:05:36.060> stand<00:05:36.330> down<00:05:36.509> the

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
you could do is just stand down the

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.300 
you could do is just stand down the
sides<00:05:36.990> a<00:05:37.139> little<00:05:37.169> bit<00:05:37.500> so<00:05:37.680> it<00:05:37.770> fits<00:05:38.130> a<00:05:38.219> little

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
sides a little bit so it fits a little

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.070 
sides a little bit so it fits a little
bit<00:05:38.490> easier<00:05:38.610> on<00:05:38.909> the<00:05:39.000> Mount<00:05:39.210> so<00:05:39.750> we<00:05:39.840> got<00:05:39.960> the

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
bit easier on the Mount so we got the

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.399 
bit easier on the Mount so we got the
rear<00:05:40.259> mounted<00:05:41.150> the<00:05:42.150> mount<00:05:42.659> the<00:05:42.780> front<00:05:43.110> until

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:43.409 
rear mounted the mount the front until

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:47.149 
rear mounted the mount the front until
the<00:05:43.530> plastic<00:05:44.009> right<00:05:44.190> here<00:05:44.610> so<00:05:45.360> now<00:05:45.630> we<00:05:46.199> mount

00:05:47.149 --> 00:05:47.159 
the plastic right here so now we mount

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:49.310 
the plastic right here so now we mount
the<00:05:47.250> frame<00:05:47.610> give<00:05:48.300> it<00:05:48.449> a<00:05:48.509> nice<00:05:48.690> little<00:05:48.719> make

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
the frame give it a nice little make

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.659 
the frame give it a nice little make
sure<00:05:49.469> of<00:05:49.530> it<00:05:49.650> make<00:05:49.830> sure<00:05:49.949> all<00:05:50.070> the<00:05:50.099> skids<00:05:50.520> are

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
sure of it make sure all the skids are

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:55.790 
sure of it make sure all the skids are
straight<00:05:51.150> and<00:05:51.530> level<00:05:52.669> so<00:05:53.669> here<00:05:54.150> we<00:05:54.330> go<00:05:54.710> takes<00:05:55.710> a

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
straight and level so here we go takes a

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.620 
straight and level so here we go takes a
little<00:05:55.979> bit<00:05:56.130> there<00:05:56.580> we<00:05:56.699> go<00:05:56.819> sometimes<00:05:57.509> you<00:05:57.569> got

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
little bit there we go sometimes you got

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.930 
little bit there we go sometimes you got
to<00:05:57.750> twist<00:05:57.930> it<00:05:58.110> to<00:05:58.229> get<00:05:58.380> it<00:05:58.500> straight<00:05:58.800> now<00:05:58.979> once

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
to twist it to get it straight now once

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.570 
to twist it to get it straight now once
they're<00:06:00.120> straight<00:06:00.469> now<00:06:01.469> it's<00:06:01.680> time<00:06:01.889> to<00:06:02.099> fully
