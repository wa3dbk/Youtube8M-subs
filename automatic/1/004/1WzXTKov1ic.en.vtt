too<00:01:53.520> low<00:01:53.700> there<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.119> go<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.619> suppose<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.740> could

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
too low there we go I suppose you could

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.330 
too low there we go I suppose you could
make<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.250> bit<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.549> an<00:01:56.670> oval<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.180> take<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.509> and

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
make it a bit of an oval so take it and

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.630 
make it a bit of an oval so take it and
squeeze<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.630> open<00:02:00.630> up<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.140> left<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.619> make<00:02:02.490> it

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
squeeze it open up and left and make it

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.580 
squeeze it open up and left and make it
a<00:02:02.700> bit<00:02:02.850> bigger<00:02:03.119> like<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.540> leave<00:02:04.200> some<00:02:04.229> gray

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
a bit bigger like so leave some gray

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.789 
a bit bigger like so leave some gray
around<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.979> edges<00:02:05.100> because<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.520> just<00:02:05.640> looks<00:02:05.909> a

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
around the edges because it just looks a

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.979 
around the edges because it just looks a
bit<00:02:07.799> more<00:02:07.950> little<00:02:08.220> bit<00:02:08.369> more<00:02:08.429> depth<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.149> what

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
bit more little bit more depth and what

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.750 
bit more little bit more depth and what
you<00:02:10.050> want<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.229> do<00:02:10.319> duplicate<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:10.890> white

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
you want to do duplicate that white

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.460 
you want to do duplicate that white
circle<00:02:12.150> change<00:02:12.300> your<00:02:12.480> black

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
circle change your black

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.170 
circle change your black
put<00:02:13.710> it<00:02:13.800> back<00:02:13.920> down<00:02:13.980> underneath<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.820> white

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
put it back down underneath the white

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.630 
put it back down underneath the white
and<00:02:15.540> make<00:02:16.020> it<00:02:16.170> look<00:02:16.290> bigger<00:02:16.440> just<00:02:16.770> so<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.520> get

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
and make it look bigger just so you get

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.600 
and make it look bigger just so you get
a<00:02:17.700> bit<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:17.970> an<00:02:18.060> outline<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:19.100> that's<00:02:20.100> that<00:02:20.310> sets

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
a bit of an outline and that's that sets

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.150 
a bit of an outline and that's that sets
move<00:02:21.570> these<00:02:21.750> hairy<00:02:22.530> fucking<00:02:23.280> things<00:02:23.700> up<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:24.180> bit

move these hairy fucking things up a bit

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.200 
move these hairy fucking things up a bit
just<00:02:26.160> so<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.730> don't<00:02:26.880> have<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.060> keep

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
just so that you don't have to keep

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.140 
just so that you don't have to keep
dragging<00:02:27.600> things<00:02:27.750> down<00:02:28.640> underneath<00:02:29.640> them<00:02:30.030> you

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
dragging things down underneath them you

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.910 
dragging things down underneath them you
can<00:02:30.300> just<00:02:30.480> easily<00:02:30.630> have<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.260> load<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.710> layers

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
can just easily have a load of layers

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.170 
can just easily have a load of layers
they're<00:02:32.250> ready<00:02:34.460> Jesus<00:02:35.460> Christ<00:02:35.700> has<00:02:35.850> taken

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.699 
grab a black circle make this a little
bit<00:03:05.520> of<00:03:05.550> an<00:03:05.700> overall<00:03:05.940> not<00:03:06.180> too<00:03:06.390> much<00:03:07.380> of<00:03:07.620> an

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
bit of an overall not too much of an

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.520 
bit of an overall not too much of an
oval<00:03:07.950> or<00:03:08.040> not<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.340> egg<00:03:08.550> ish<00:03:08.870> make<00:03:09.870> it<00:03:10.050> a<00:03:10.200> bit

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
oval or not to egg ish make it a bit

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.740 
oval or not to egg ish make it a bit
bigger<00:03:11.000> alright<00:03:12.000> so<00:03:12.209> this<00:03:12.330> is<00:03:12.480> going<00:03:12.570> to<00:03:12.630> be

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
bigger alright so this is going to be

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.540 
bigger alright so this is going to be
the<00:03:12.810> outline<00:03:13.760> so<00:03:14.760> then<00:03:15.090> we<00:03:15.330> grub<00:03:15.959> it's

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
the outline so then we grub it's

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.890 
the outline so then we grub it's
actually<00:03:17.550> let's<00:03:17.730> make<00:03:17.790> that<00:03:18.030> one<00:03:18.090> grey<00:03:18.450> so<00:03:18.780> the

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
actually let's make that one grey so the

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.050 
actually let's make that one grey so the
bottom<00:03:19.170> one<00:03:19.350> mate<00:03:19.620> grey<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.640> then<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.880> black

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
bottom one mate grey and then the black

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.020 
bottom one mate grey and then the black
one<00:03:21.360> would<00:03:21.540> make<00:03:21.690> it<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:21.959> bit<00:03:22.140> smaller<00:03:23.030> just

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
one would make it a bit smaller just

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.820 
one would make it a bit smaller just
like<00:03:24.239> so<00:03:24.480> so<00:03:25.050> you've<00:03:25.290> got<00:03:25.320> a<00:03:25.410> gray<00:03:25.650> outline

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
like so so you've got a gray outline

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.400 
like so so you've got a gray outline
around<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.610> outside<00:03:27.060> of<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.269> black<00:03:27.480> and

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
around the outside of the black and

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.500 
around the outside of the black and
we're<00:03:28.590> going<00:03:28.709> to<00:03:28.769> grab<00:03:29.010> that<00:03:29.489> next<00:03:30.330> one

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
we're going to grab that next one

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.350 
we're going to grab that next one
duplicate<00:03:30.780> it<00:03:31.230> again<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:31.830> change<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:32.970> red<00:03:33.150> now

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
duplicate it again and change it red now

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.790 
duplicate it again and change it red now
you<00:03:33.420> can<00:03:33.600> have<00:03:33.720> this<00:03:33.840> any<00:03:34.110> color<00:03:34.380> you<00:03:34.470> like<00:03:34.500> I

you can have this any color you like I

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.350 
you can have this any color you like I
chose<00:03:35.040> red<00:03:35.250> because<00:03:35.459> obviously<00:03:35.610> red<00:03:36.000> stands

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
chose red because obviously red stands

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.070 
chose red because obviously red stands

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
you're just going to keep taking circles

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.090 
you're just going to keep taking circles
duplicating<00:03:43.170> them<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:43.500> making<00:03:43.680> them<00:03:43.830> smaller

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
duplicating them and making them smaller

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.500 
duplicating them and making them smaller
and<00:03:44.370> smaller<00:03:44.640> and<00:03:44.880> smaller<00:03:45.090> until<00:03:47.209> you<00:03:48.209> get<00:03:48.360> to

and<00:03:54.000> move<00:03:54.330> it<00:03:54.510> so<00:03:54.720> it's<00:03:54.870> more<00:03:55.080> of<00:03:55.200> a<00:03:55.290> overly<00:03:56.220> egg

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
and move it so it's more of a overly egg

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.250 
and move it so it's more of a overly egg
shape<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:57.690> what<00:03:57.870> you're<00:03:57.959> gonna<00:03:58.049> do<00:03:58.170> is<00:03:58.230> you're

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
shape and what you're gonna do is you're

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.430 
shape and what you're gonna do is you're
going<00:03:58.410> to<00:03:58.500> turn<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.100> opacity<00:03:59.400> down<00:04:00.110> to<00:04:01.110> about

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
going to turn the opacity down to about

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.170 
going to turn the opacity down to about
all<00:04:02.190> that<00:04:02.370> went<00:04:02.549> too<00:04:02.670> low<00:04:02.880> ah<00:04:03.739> stop<00:04:04.739> it<00:04:05.180> there

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
all that went too low ah stop it there

we go to about forty percent forty five
percent<00:04:08.299> and<00:04:09.299> then<00:04:10.230> duplicate<00:04:10.709> it<00:04:10.860> again

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
percent and then duplicate it again

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.960 
percent and then duplicate it again

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
we're going to just make it a bit

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.850 
we're going to just make it a bit
smaller<00:05:15.919> bring<00:05:16.919> it<00:05:17.039> down<00:05:17.070> below<00:05:18.590> the<00:05:19.590> white<00:05:19.830> of

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
smaller bring it down below the white of

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.200 
smaller bring it down below the white of
the<00:05:20.070> eye<00:05:20.190> but<00:05:20.520> above<00:05:20.820> the<00:05:21.180> red<00:05:21.449> and<00:05:22.729> then<00:05:23.729> we're

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
the eye but above the red and then we're

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.490 
the eye but above the red and then we're
going<00:05:24.300> to<00:05:24.389> turn<00:05:24.509> the<00:05:24.659> opacity<00:05:24.870> down<00:05:25.110> on<00:05:25.380> these

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
going to turn the opacity down on these

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.730 
going to turn the opacity down on these
as<00:05:25.680> well<00:05:25.830> to<00:05:26.009> about<00:05:26.330> fifty<00:05:27.330> percent<00:05:30.740> that

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
as well to about fifty percent that

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.689 
as well to about fifty percent that
would<00:05:31.889> do<00:05:32.810> duplicate<00:05:33.810> them<00:05:34.020> and<00:05:34.490> put<00:05:35.490> it<00:05:35.580> on

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 
would do duplicate them and put it on

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:40.249 
would do duplicate them and put it on
the<00:05:36.090> other<00:05:36.360> side<00:05:38.509> so<00:05:39.509> now<00:05:39.630> you've<00:05:39.750> got<00:05:39.870> one<00:05:40.080> on

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:40.259 
the other side so now you've got one on

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:42.230 
the other side so now you've got one on
each<00:05:40.470> side<00:05:40.500> and<00:05:41.070> that's<00:05:41.669> going<00:05:41.789> to<00:05:41.849> act<00:05:42.030> as

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
each side and that's going to act as

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.029 
each side and that's going to act as
like<00:05:42.419> you<00:05:43.020> know<00:05:43.050> the<00:05:43.289> collared<00:05:43.590> bit<00:05:43.740> of<00:05:43.860> your

white<00:05:50.190> one<00:05:50.370> as<00:05:50.520> well<00:05:50.729> and<00:05:52.759> you<00:05:53.759> want<00:05:53.940> to<00:05:54.030> move

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
white one as well and you want to move

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.760 
white one as well and you want to move
this<00:05:54.990> above<00:05:56.539> the<00:05:57.539> other<00:05:57.719> two<00:05:57.870> black<00:05:58.139> ones<00:05:58.320> and

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
this above the other two black ones and

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.040 
this above the other two black ones and
flip<00:05:59.310> it<00:05:59.340> and<00:05:59.639> rotate<00:06:00.570> it<00:06:00.750> so<00:06:00.870> it's<00:06:01.020> a

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
flip it and rotate it so it's a

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.560 
flip it and rotate it so it's a
different<00:06:01.250> angle<00:06:02.250> to<00:06:02.460> what<00:06:02.699> you<00:06:02.880> can<00:06:03.060> see<00:06:03.360> of

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
different angle to what you can see of

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.110 
different angle to what you can see of
the<00:06:03.840> black<00:06:04.050> one<00:06:04.490> you<00:06:05.490> see<00:06:05.669> what<00:06:05.789> i<00:06:05.820> mean<00:06:05.880> the

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
the black one you see what i mean the

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.439 
the black one you see what i mean the
black<00:06:06.270> one<00:06:06.449> sticks<00:06:06.690> out<00:06:06.870> more<00:06:06.900> there<00:06:08.449> and

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
black one sticks out more there and

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:12.700 
black one sticks out more there and
there<00:06:09.630> you<00:06:09.719> go<00:06:09.750> that<00:06:10.110> is<00:06:10.280> that<00:06:11.280> sorted<00:06:11.820> there

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
there you go that is that sorted there

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.830 
there you go that is that sorted there
that<00:06:13.710> is<00:06:13.830> pretty<00:06:14.070> much<00:06:14.310> the<00:06:14.370> entire<00:06:14.909> I<00:06:15.389> now

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
that is pretty much the entire I now

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.420 
that is pretty much the entire I now
what<00:06:16.020> you<00:06:16.110> can<00:06:16.139> do<00:06:16.440> on<00:06:16.469> top<00:06:16.830> of<00:06:17.009> that<00:06:17.099> as<00:06:17.250> well

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
what you can do on top of that as well

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.320 
what you can do on top of that as well
is<00:06:18.440> take<00:06:19.440> these<00:06:19.620> screw<00:06:20.039> all<00:06:20.099> the<00:06:20.490> scribble<00:06:21.090> to

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
is take these screw all the scribble to

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.950 
is take these screw all the scribble to
change<00:06:21.659> it<00:06:21.810> black<00:06:22.250> turn<00:06:23.250> the<00:06:23.370> opacity<00:06:23.639> down<00:06:23.960> so

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
change it black turn the opacity down so

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.279 
change it black turn the opacity down so
it's<00:06:25.080> more<00:06:25.289> than<00:06:25.469> see<00:06:25.949> free<00:06:26.219> grey<00:06:27.080> skewer<00:06:28.080> them

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:28.289 
it's more than see free grey skewer them

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:33.260 
it's more than see free grey skewer them
mess<00:06:28.650> around<00:06:28.770> with<00:06:29.130> them<00:06:29.310> and<00:06:29.580> just<00:06:32.000> make<00:06:33.000> sort

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
mess around with them and just make sort

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.050 
mess around with them and just make sort
of<00:06:33.330> like<00:06:33.449> a<00:06:33.479> shading<00:06:33.960> in<00:06:34.080> the<00:06:34.199> bottom<00:06:34.440> right

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060 
of like a shading in the bottom right

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.430 
of like a shading in the bottom right
get<00:06:36.060> you<00:06:36.150> gives<00:06:36.330> it<00:06:36.449> a<00:06:36.510> bit<00:06:36.539> more<00:06:36.719> depth<00:06:37.199> it

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
get you gives it a bit more depth it

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.829 
get you gives it a bit more depth it
gives<00:06:37.650> it<00:06:37.830> just<00:06:38.130> makes<00:06:39.000> it<00:06:39.120> look<00:06:39.330> a<00:06:39.360> little<00:06:39.630> bit

00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:39.839 
gives it just makes it look a little bit
