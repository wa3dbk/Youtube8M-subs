what<00:00:47.370> I've<00:00:47.490> done<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:47.940> basically<00:00:48.390> made<00:00:48.690> a

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
what I've done is I basically made a

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.710 
what I've done is I basically made a
pocket<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.730> I<00:00:50.730> have<00:00:50.910> just<00:00:51.090> wired<00:00:51.380> the<00:00:52.380> ends

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
pocket and I have just wired the ends

here it has a little bit of the planting
mix<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.120> here<00:00:57.420> because<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:57.870> going<00:00:58.080> to<00:00:58.140> need

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
mix in here because it's going to need

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.680 
mix in here because it's going to need
something<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.220> here<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.150> then<00:01:01.050> I've<00:01:01.230> just

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
something in here and then I've just

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.679 
something in here and then I've just
nestled<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.810> into<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:05.159> piece<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.880> driftwood<00:01:06.509> I

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
nestled it into the piece of driftwood I

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.960 
nestled it into the piece of driftwood I
collected<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.439> some<00:01:08.100> fishing<00:01:08.460> line<00:01:08.490> over

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
collected I have some fishing line over

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.899 
collected I have some fishing line over
here<00:01:09.500> and<00:01:10.500> I'm<00:01:10.650> just<00:01:10.890> going<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.070> go<00:01:11.220> along<00:01:11.400> and

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
here and I'm just going to go along and

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.440 
here and I'm just going to go along and
I<00:01:12.359> will<00:01:12.659> eventually<00:01:12.990> tie<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.499> off<00:01:13.799> there<00:01:14.460> so

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
I will eventually tie it off there so

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.109 
I will eventually tie it off there so
that<00:01:15.630> makes<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:16.020> nice<00:01:16.259> piece<00:01:16.619> there<00:01:16.950> uumm<00:01:17.880> if

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.090 
you can't find the sheet the Coco Kwan
sheet<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.390> can<00:01:21.539> always<00:01:21.719> just<00:01:22.049> wrap<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.679> root

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
sheet you can always just wrap the root

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.889 
sheet you can always just wrap the root
ball<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.329> Spanish<00:01:24.780> moss<00:01:24.990> here<00:01:25.469> and

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
ball in the Spanish moss here and

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.559 
ball in the Spanish moss here and
there's<00:01:27.899> flat<00:01:28.679> driftwood<00:01:29.670> also<00:01:30.210> because

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:30.569 
there's flat driftwood also because

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:31.669 
there's flat driftwood also because
you'll<00:01:30.719> find<00:01:30.899> it<00:01:31.109> this<00:01:31.200> way<00:01:31.409> too

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 
you'll find it this way too

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:33.289 
you'll find it this way too
just<00:01:32.069> be<00:01:32.189> sure<00:01:32.219> to<00:01:32.369> soak<00:01:32.700> your<00:01:32.729> driftwood

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
just be sure to soak your driftwood

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.090 
just be sure to soak your driftwood
because<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.929> has<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> lot<00:01:34.319> of<00:01:34.350> salt<00:01:34.649> in<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.950> and

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
because it has a lot of salt in it and

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.099 
because it has a lot of salt in it and
if<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.880> were<00:01:36.030> going<00:01:36.149> to<00:01:36.210> use<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.569> I<00:01:36.780> would<00:01:36.960> do

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.109 
if I were going to use this I would do

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:40.520 
if I were going to use this I would do
four<00:01:37.380> holes<00:01:37.969> drill<00:01:38.969> four<00:01:39.270> holes<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.869> then<00:01:40.499> I

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
four holes drill four holes and then I

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.039 
four holes drill four holes and then I
would<00:01:40.950> put<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.399> bromeliad<00:01:42.119> right<00:01:42.450> here<00:01:42.869> and

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
would put the bromeliad right here and

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.139 
would put the bromeliad right here and
then<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.259> would<00:01:43.409> attach<00:01:43.859> the<00:01:44.189> fishing<00:01:44.700> line<00:01:44.909> in

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
then I would attach the fishing line in

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.270 
then I would attach the fishing line in
a<00:01:45.569> crisscross<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.649> secure<00:01:47.069> it<00:01:47.189> on<00:01:47.369> there<00:01:48.359> I<00:01:49.280> can

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
a crisscross to secure it on there I can

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.760 
a crisscross to secure it on there I can
hang<00:01:50.939> this<00:01:51.179> piece<00:01:51.479> or<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.869> can<00:01:52.289> use<00:01:52.469> it<00:01:52.619> as<00:01:52.740> a
