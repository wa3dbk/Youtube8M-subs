woo I do appreciate that I feel like the
game<00:01:16.810> itself<00:01:16.960> abused<00:01:17.710> this<00:01:17.890> feature<00:01:18.159> yeah

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
game itself abused this feature yeah

game itself abused this feature yeah
exactly<00:01:18.760> the<00:01:19.450> reason<00:01:19.690> why<00:01:19.720> you<00:01:19.869> have<00:01:20.140> to<00:01:20.290> go

fast<00:01:20.710> right<00:01:20.950> now<00:01:21.130> is<00:01:21.340> because<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.909> game

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
fast right now is because the game

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.670 
fast right now is because the game
thinks<00:01:22.600> like<00:01:22.780> it's<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.110> very<00:01:23.229> beginning

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
thinks like it's the very beginning

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.109 
thinks like it's the very beginning
still<00:01:23.920> in<00:01:24.040> your<00:01:24.159> original<00:01:24.369> village<00:01:24.909> but

you're not so you have to fly past the
owl<00:01:28.030> because<00:01:28.509> of<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.689> owl<00:01:28.869> stops<00:01:29.380> you<00:01:29.710> it'll

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
owl because of the owl stops you it'll

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.490 
owl because of the owl stops you it'll
crash<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.789> game<00:01:31.000> so<00:01:31.630> you<00:01:31.689> see<00:01:31.899> the<00:01:32.020> owl<00:01:32.140> right

shoot past it without stopping

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.179 
shoot past it without stopping
otherwise<00:01:37.030> we<00:01:37.329> crash<00:01:37.659> the<00:01:37.930> game<00:01:38.109> bus<00:01:38.679> pass<00:01:38.979> the

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
otherwise we crash the game bus pass the

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:46.370 
otherwise we crash the game bus pass the
sound<00:01:39.460> of<00:01:39.609> a<00:01:39.700> bit<00:01:39.939> no<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:43.630> didn't<00:01:43.960> do<00:01:44.109> it<00:01:44.229> right

could be a million rupees boom that's a

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.360 
could be a million rupees boom that's a
metaphor<00:02:53.389> for<00:02:53.659> the<00:02:53.719> beta<00:02:53.959> quest<00:02:54.349> it's<00:02:55.040> also<00:02:55.219> a

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
metaphor for the beta quest it's also a

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:04.289 
metaphor for the beta quest it's also a
metaphor<00:02:55.519> for<00:02:55.939> student<00:02:56.359> loans<00:02:56.629> yes<00:02:57.290> exactly

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.970 

it's<00:03:05.299> theorized<00:03:06.049> that<00:03:06.079> that<00:03:06.709> particular

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
it's theorized that that particular

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.089 
it's theorized that that particular
rupee<00:03:07.840> maybe<00:03:08.840> it's<00:03:09.049> just<00:03:09.169> a<00:03:09.290> glitch<00:03:09.319> maybe<00:03:09.949> it

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
rupee maybe it's just a glitch maybe it

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.390 
rupee maybe it's just a glitch maybe it
is<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.519> beta<00:03:10.939> item<00:03:11.659> uh<00:03:11.980> people<00:03:12.980> think<00:03:13.159> that<00:03:13.280> it

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
is a beta item uh people think that it

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.849 
is a beta item uh people think that it
might<00:03:13.639> have<00:03:13.819> been<00:03:13.849> like<00:03:14.209> a<00:03:14.359> trap<00:03:14.750> for<00:03:15.349> link<00:03:15.620> to

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
might have been like a trap for link to

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:17.259 
might have been like a trap for link to
go<00:03:15.980> into<00:03:16.340> you<00:03:16.519> know<00:03:16.609> you<00:03:16.669> think<00:03:17.150> you're

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
go into you know you think you're

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.640 
go into you know you think you're
getting<00:03:17.329> a<00:03:17.509> huge<00:03:17.720> roofie<00:03:18.199> and<00:03:18.290> then<00:03:18.379> you<00:03:18.439> blow

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
getting a huge roofie and then you blow

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.949 
getting a huge roofie and then you blow
up<00:03:18.859> other<00:03:19.099> people<00:03:19.669> think<00:03:19.939> that<00:03:20.060> it's<00:03:20.239> a<00:03:20.449> trap

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
up other people think that it's a trap

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.020 
up other people think that it's a trap
that<00:03:21.199> maybe<00:03:21.439> link<00:03:21.739> might<00:03:22.189> have<00:03:22.310> left<00:03:22.549> for<00:03:22.939> his

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
that maybe link might have left for his

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.330 
that maybe link might have left for his
enemies<00:03:23.359> kind<00:03:23.569> of<00:03:23.629> like<00:03:23.720> a<00:03:23.750> landmine<00:03:24.340> who

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
enemies kind of like a landmine who

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.280 
enemies kind of like a landmine who
knows<00:03:25.549> who<00:03:26.120> knows<00:03:26.150> what<00:03:26.599> it<00:03:26.689> was<00:03:26.780> but<00:03:26.900> richly

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.390 
cartridge it's version 1.0 and this is
the<00:03:47.030> code<00:03:47.269> if<00:03:47.599> you<00:03:47.750> want<00:03:47.989> the<00:03:48.169> exploding<00:03:48.859> Ruby

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
the code if you want the exploding Ruby

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.089 
the code if you want the exploding Ruby
so<00:03:50.389> what<00:03:50.750> we're<00:03:50.900> going<00:03:51.019> to<00:03:51.079> be<00:03:51.229> doing<00:03:51.379> now<00:03:51.709> is

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
so what we're going to be doing now is

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.219 
so what we're going to be doing now is
showing<00:03:52.729> you<00:03:52.970> some<00:03:53.180> of<00:03:53.269> the<00:03:53.329> cosmetic<00:03:53.509> changes

here's<00:04:12.229> the<00:04:12.349> code<00:04:12.560> to<00:04:12.739> do<00:04:12.919> that<00:04:13.000> generally

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
here's the code to do that generally

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.330 
here's the code to do that generally
