00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 water with a rubilian goal wins by the 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.779
 minimum difference of 2 minute what good 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.550
 soul pulls us up the center releases it the 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.849
 doorman for you to you there was nobody from 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.559
 Olympia to take advantage of that ball 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.570
 sent by portinatx and two more minutes 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.060
 late here he wins 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.420
 here is see what ball he sends you 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.699
 to wilmer crisanto vacilla hesitates 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.279
 goalkeeper donis escober the goalie has 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.130
 that going out there has to leave the goalkeeper 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.050
 donis escober does not leave donis stays 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.059
 stopped and then makes the decision to 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.820
 leaving is already very late totally from 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.100
 perfect agreement the production team 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.530
 thank you very much for the pass the pass is 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.290
 phenomenal of wilmer crisanto abílio 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.239
 castle but the doubt seems to me weighs by 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.489
 part of donis escober for the annotation 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.649
 motagüense so one of the coconuts of 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.270
 olimpia Rubilio Castillo marked on the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.230
 goalie donis escober here a shot 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.840
 soft from disk to minute 16 started what 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.090
 clean attack comes stupiñán before the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.920
 figueroa brand that I made a huge 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.239
 work in this first part is a 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.260
 battle in which they have these two 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.200
 players 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.840
 against javier estupiñán this move 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.300
 where byron méndez de manta finds 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.880
 lozano looks for stupiñán but he has left 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.230
 long to the Colombian that ball stays 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.180
 very short 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.120
 when he just scrapes the ball the choco 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.270
 lush minute 18 there have been several Chinese 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.250
 discua rubilio's header was very 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.630
 close to making the second goal in his 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.300
 personal account in the first time 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.940
 dangerous the head of rubidium 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.160
 we see lucas gómez key for the sector 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.290
 left we do not see the center of the Chinese 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.850
 disc someone shot first of 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.250
 rubilius castle where he could have 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.870
 the 2-0 was slow to defend the 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.240
 olympics are slow movements of 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.060
 johnny palaces and in this case of ever 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.770
 alvarado carlos wild center header 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.710
 stupiñán 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.829
 ends up winning the ball before the brand 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.780
 that made him figueroa brute 33 rommel 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.600
 Quioto Robinson for the Flea Mendez 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.929
 wall combination evolution paste 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.579
 horrible the ball byron méndez yes it 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.049
 encouraged the shot in the previous play 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.610
 it seems to me that this had could have 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.769
 done something else in that header 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.510
 we have this corner kick here I do not know 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.890
 how our ball is very much 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.060
 indecision to hit him I think the 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.220
 first he had to see the stuck of the 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.470
 rivera alvarado will be true yes but 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.769
 that level is encouraged to water and I think that 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.760
 he will see there there they are and he does not hit him 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:28.980
 difficult here in the land and in palaces and 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.790
 better sportsmanship and also time 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.090
 that achieves more closely 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.060
 very close and is like the choco the fight 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.450
 ever alvarado then I nor palace that 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.489
 was going to be a good rough goal 37 again 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.219
 with the long passes of this one already has 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.470
 olympic rubilius election 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:49.599
 strangely rubilian here let escape 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.220
 the second goal again stays very 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.109
 slow and onís palace loses a bit the 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.239
 orientation the Olympia has problems 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:58.689
 serious in the defense if it is not coordinated 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:01.299
 there are no movements on the part of the line 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:03.700
 defensive olympia here figueroa made 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:06.090
 a saving headbutt because it arrived 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.660
 clear stupiñán to score 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.629
 there is minute 45 another of olympics 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.400
 center top goalie for you already have 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.560
 two times to keep the ball 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.209
 and we see how it ends up beating 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.550
 Javier Estupiñán finished the first 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.010
 part of the party with triumph of 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:27.230
 motagua 1 to 0 before the olimpia breed of 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.230
 hong club in the administrative part 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.560
 yes, I think we can write down that 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.560
 goal 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.820
 I believe that I believe that nobody wants it 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.800
 lose and you have to be focused to 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:51.980
 the second half the goal a pass 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.980
 diagonal 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.879
 and saints and you can change the back of 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.970
 back and cinnamon back thanks nice 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:59.970
 goal
