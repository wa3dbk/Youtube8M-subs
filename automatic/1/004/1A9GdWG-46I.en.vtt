has a short nap and if I just roll my
fingers<00:00:19.400> along<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:21.260> surface<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.680> fabric

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
fingers along the surface of the fabric

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.250 
fingers along the surface of the fabric
you<00:00:23.369> can<00:00:24.180> see<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.930> movement<00:00:25.380> of<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.830> piles

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
you can see the movement of the piles

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.050 
you can see the movement of the piles
now<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.439> order<00:00:28.800> for<00:00:28.949> us<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.070> find<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.580> NAP<00:00:29.820> on

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
now in order for us to find the NAP on

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.990 
now in order for us to find the NAP on
velvet<00:00:30.420> we<00:00:31.080> need<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.500> run<00:00:31.980> our<00:00:32.009> hands<00:00:32.460> along

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
velvet we need to run our hands along

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.299 
velvet we need to run our hands along
the<00:00:33.210> surface<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.809> fabric<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.410> as<00:00:35.130> I'm

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
the surface of the fabric and as I'm

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.760 
the surface of the fabric and as I'm
going<00:00:35.460> down<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:35.969> feels<00:00:36.149> rough<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:37.260> when<00:00:37.559> you

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
going down it feels rough and when you

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.799 
going down it feels rough and when you
go<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.309> opposite<00:00:38.790> direction<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.540> feels

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
go the opposite direction it feels

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.319 
go the opposite direction it feels
smooth<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.219> need<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.520> make<00:00:41.670> sure<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:42.149> we

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
smooth so we need to make sure that we

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.060 
smooth so we need to make sure that we
are<00:00:42.450> going<00:00:42.600> with<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.960> NAP<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.680> fabric

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
are going with the NAP of the fabric

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.029 
are going with the NAP of the fabric
which<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.489> down<00:00:45.059> where<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.140> smooth<00:00:46.440> as<00:00:46.980> you

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
which is down where it is smooth as you

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.470 
which is down where it is smooth as you
can<00:00:47.190> see<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.520> fabric<00:00:47.670> looks<00:00:48.000> dull<00:00:48.270> at<00:00:48.420> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
can see the fabric looks dull at the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.540 
can see the fabric looks dull at the
moment<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.500> wouldn't<00:00:49.860> lay<00:00:50.010> my<00:00:50.160> patterns

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
moment so I wouldn't lay my patterns

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.000 
moment so I wouldn't lay my patterns
this<00:00:50.730> way<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.780> I'll<00:00:51.930> turn<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.410> velvet<00:00:52.800> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
this way so I'll turn the velvet the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.650 
this way so I'll turn the velvet the
other<00:00:53.219> way<00:00:53.570> and<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:55.530> should<00:00:55.739> seem<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:57.030> lot<00:00:57.600> more

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
other way and it should seem a lot more

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.410 
other way and it should seem a lot more
luxurious<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.680> deeper<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.219> color<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.760> then

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
luxurious and deeper in color and then

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.410 
luxurious and deeper in color and then
that<00:01:00.629> feels<00:01:01.020> nice<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.469> smooth<00:01:04.909> lay<00:01:05.909> planning

on top this will make sure that the

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.440 
on top this will make sure that the
piles<00:02:04.810> are<00:02:05.050> not<00:02:05.230> flattened<00:02:06.090> then<00:02:07.090> get<00:02:07.300> your

piles are not flattened then get your

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.070 
piles are not flattened then get your
iron<00:02:07.750> and<00:02:08.460> then<00:02:09.460> press<00:02:09.850> an<00:02:10.360> up<00:02:10.600> and<00:02:10.899> down

iron and then press an up and down

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:19.170 
iron and then press an up and down
motion<00:02:15.540> when<00:02:16.540> pinning<00:02:16.900> seams<00:02:17.310> make<00:02:18.310> sure<00:02:18.640> that

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
motion when pinning seams make sure that

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.680 
motion when pinning seams make sure that
they<00:02:20.050> match<00:02:20.380> exactly<00:02:20.970> because<00:02:21.970> they<00:02:22.270> can<00:02:22.510> be

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
they match exactly because they can be

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.060 
they match exactly because they can be
movement<00:02:22.900> because<00:02:23.350> you've<00:02:23.470> got<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.650> surface

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
movement because you've got the surface

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.100 
movement because you've got the surface
the<00:02:24.400> surface<00:02:24.550> will<00:02:24.940> create<00:02:25.270> black<00:02:25.930> and

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
the surface will create black and

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.530 
the surface will create black and
friction<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:26.740> it<00:02:27.250> means<00:02:27.430> it<00:02:27.700> will<00:02:27.790> move<00:02:28.000> so

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
friction and it means it will move so

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.590 
friction and it means it will move so
make<00:02:28.840> sure<00:02:28.870> that<00:02:29.350> you<00:02:29.560> put<00:02:29.860> as<00:02:30.490> many<00:02:30.970> pins<00:02:31.270> as

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
make sure that you put as many pins as

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.600 
make sure that you put as many pins as
possible<00:02:32.170> pin<00:02:32.980> through<00:02:34.410> pin<00:02:35.410> and<00:02:35.920> then<00:02:36.040> move

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
possible pin through pin and then move

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.120 
possible pin through pin and then move
down<00:02:36.880> so<00:02:37.600> do<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:37.840> like<00:02:37.990> you<00:02:38.290> would<00:02:38.440> normally<00:02:38.980> do

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
down so do it like you would normally do

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
and more pins the better and make sure

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.960 
and more pins the better and make sure
your<00:02:50.739> pins<00:02:51.130> are<00:02:52.020> parallel<00:02:53.020> to<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.320> edge<00:02:53.970> and
