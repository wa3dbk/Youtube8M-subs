00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.469
 hello how about youtube friends I am 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.790
 project 46 with another video and in this 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.290
 video I'm going to show you is a very video 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.420
 I'm going to show you something very 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.250
 simple that is this I have been asked 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.430
 out there I've also seen that many do not 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.630
 they know how to change account in the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.270
 device 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:30.050
 how to use another account or how 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:33.020
 or how to use your same account in another 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.450
 device the truth is that it is something very 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.890
 simple many do not know what you can 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.360
 do 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.670
 and that's why I'm doing this 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.610
 good video first thing I'm going to do 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.290
 for example I have two accounts this 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.730
 which is the most advanced one that I use and 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.620
 other 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.140
 with which I barely start to be able to 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.960
 make this video 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.620
 The first thing I'm going to do is get out 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.340
 of the game 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.480
 let's continue the game then what 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:05.790
 consequently will be 2 to multitasking 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.790
 we go to game center 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:14.110
 let's wait for it to load and once 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:17.710
 have loaded we are going to close the session 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.560
 also remember when they have already 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.570
 followed by the game also close it 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.960
 because it stays paused then we go to 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.960
 Sign off 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.620
 well already once we have started 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.390
 session with the other account here we can 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.150
 see what is another account we are going to go to 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.000
 games 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.570
 and in games they will select the game 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.570
 flash class 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.689
 obviously 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.350
 and once it's loaded we're going to 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.350
 give in play 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.090
 let's wait for it to load 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.440
 I do this because many still do not know 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.599
 that can change devices by 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.050
 example there are those who have just bought a 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.940
 ipad and this and have always played in a 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.960
 iphone and then they can charge themselves 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.880
 count as or equal to when they restore 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.760
 well here already loaded in the next 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.760
 account and ask us what 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.500
 let's confirm that I'm playing with the 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.160
 another game center account we're going to give 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.010
 OK 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.670
 and we will write confirm with 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.670
 capital letters 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.740
 if they realize, the button is turned on 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:06.040
 green 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.040
 Then we give you to confirm 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.690
 and we have loaded the other account 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.370
 here is my other account that barely 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.170
 I just started it 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.690
 and well I hope you served them 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.950
 video you already know this when you want to do 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.230
 the same if I want to return to my account 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.250
 earlier I do the same thing I leave the 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:37.519
 game I close it inside the game center 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:41.750
 with my with my with my other account and 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.370
 we play from the game center and 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.590
 it will seem the same practically what 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.970
 same good so it was just that friends 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.280
 I hope you liked the video 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.140
 above all that it serves them a lot had the 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.060
 doubt how to do it in my case or 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.849
 I was afraid to restore the 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.500
 cellular because he is about to lose the account 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.609
 I had read it before in a 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.989
 forum that there is a companion to him 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.730
 lost the account but that's why 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.400
 remember first always close your 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.280
 game center account even if they play 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.109
 on a device that is not yours 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.930
 also close the game center so that 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:16.430
 do not eliminate them and well then just 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.049
 It was from your friends and I hope you have them 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.380
 liked the video do not forget to subscribe 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:25.300
 and like the truth that helps a lot and 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.300
 see you in a next video bay
