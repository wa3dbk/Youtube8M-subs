00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
wide by three inches long so I started

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.569 
wide by three inches long so I started
with<00:00:45.690> cutting<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.530> strip<00:00:46.829> two<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> half

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
with cutting a strip two and a half

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.760 
with cutting a strip two and a half
inches<00:00:47.910> wide<00:00:47.969> by<00:00:48.539> 12<00:00:48.870> inches<00:00:49.230> long

inches wide by 12 inches long

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.819 
inches wide by 12 inches long
that<00:00:50.399> way<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.640> can<00:00:51.270> make<00:00:51.510> two<00:00:51.840> six-inch<00:00:52.379> tabs

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
that way I can make two six-inch tabs

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.520 
that way I can make two six-inch tabs
that<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:54.149> fold<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.629> half<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
that I can fold in half to have a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.459 
that I can fold in half to have a
finished<00:00:55.980> tab<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.520> three<00:00:57.000> inches<00:00:57.539> long<00:00:58.079> you

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
finished tab of three inches long you

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.910 
finished tab of three inches long you
will<00:00:59.430> need<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.879> multiply<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:01.170> by<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.710> amount

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
will need to multiply that by the amount

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.310 
will need to multiply that by the amount
of<00:01:02.219> tabs<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.120> need<00:01:05.510> so<00:01:06.510> here<00:01:06.840> are<00:01:07.020> my<00:01:07.080> two
