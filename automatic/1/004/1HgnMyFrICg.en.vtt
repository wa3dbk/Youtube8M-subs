00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.099
 hello friends today i am under your 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.250
 I'll be cooking cupcake 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.040
 banana flavor and yogurt a taste for 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.690
 cupcake i can talk a lot just 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.850
 banana memory how we do a little 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.510
 later the simplest thing you can and need 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.420
 to make 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.160
 but not to put a live fruit in a cupcake 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.010
 or just put bought in 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.310
 hypermarket fast-paced nonsense up 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.270
 to the feeling of a cupcake must contain some 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.380
 raisin bananas in it and take 3 chicken 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.140
 eggs 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.450
 we separate the yolks from proteins in one 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.950
 the cup we put the yolks in another squirrel 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.780
 I no longer use my pastry 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.879
 margarine since firstly it contains 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.980
 increased trans fat 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.289
 secondly flavors so take 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.480
 slightly less than creamy fingers 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.090
 butter and melt it 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.570
 and in the meantime we start beating 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.379
 yolks and add 1 cup of drinking 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.110
 yogurt 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.479
 according to my idea , the text will have two 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.610
 basic tastes first must give 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.340
 flavors the main taste and the second like 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.560
 complements and softens it so that 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.810
 main flavor as banana filled 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.990
 soft yogurt with strawberry flavor 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.390
 in principle, banana yogurt could 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.750
 blend easily the blender would work 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.130
 even better 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.250
 because his mouth has a sweet and 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.920
 add to the dough just one and a half cups 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.840
 sugar and at the moment add 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.939
 melted butter 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.130
 Well, of course, do not forget to mix 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.869
 our mix after adding each 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.409
 ingredients add the remaining half 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.409
 cup of sugar 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.730
 add a pinch of salt it 's like 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.600
 flavor enhancer and of course 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:58.680
 stir add some cocoa 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:03.720
 powder it will give coffee taste and of course 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:06.300
 the same color of our cupcake and the time has come 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.930
 bananas we initially broke with you three 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.000
 a banana 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.240
 Well, add just 2 2 cups of flour 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.060
 sift 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.370
 they say that thanks to this baking 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.100
 it comes came as flour takes 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.640
 oxygen itself but the main thing for me is to 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.970
 there was no trash further a teaspoon of soda 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:30.750
 we quench lemon vinegar I never 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:35.250
 gashu as vinegar gives unpleasant 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.530
 tart taste and lemon is what you need 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.280
 meanwhile we start beating whites 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.140
 and beat them until thick foam 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.730
 next we pour the whipped protein into 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.740
 the total mixture was stirred between spoon 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.740
 portico molds we grease with sunflower 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.620
 oil and pour the mixture 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:58.950
 the form meanwhile the oven is already preheated 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:03.330
 up to 160 degrees and at 180 degrees we 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:06.170
 bake a cupcake with you for about 50 minutes but 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.390
 time of course depends on your oven 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.410
 the form I use is detachable so the cupcake 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:16.370
 jumps out of it easily 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.370
 have a nice tea party friends
