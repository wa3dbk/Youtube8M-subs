cement and some steel actually they're
creating<00:01:25.560> water<00:01:25.740> for<00:01:26.040> themselves<00:01:26.369> out<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.729> the

water is captured beneath this sand
that<00:02:14.190> means<00:02:14.460> that<00:02:14.730> little<00:02:14.970> ones<00:02:15.210> like<00:02:15.480> Malika

that means that little ones like Malika

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.770 
that means that little ones like Malika
here<00:02:16.470> have<00:02:17.100> plenty<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:17.670> water<00:02:17.940> nearby<00:02:18.240> and

for<00:04:33.729> it<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:34.840> microclimate<00:04:35.590> here<00:04:35.770> has<00:04:35.979> changed

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
for it the microclimate here has changed

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.700 
for it the microclimate here has changed
a<00:04:36.490> great<00:04:36.520> deal<00:04:36.759> I<00:04:37.210> has<00:04:37.870> changed<00:04:38.319> because<00:04:38.469> of

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
a great deal I has changed because of

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.249 
a great deal I has changed because of
the<00:04:39.069> following<00:04:39.460> reasons<00:04:39.879> first<00:04:40.210> of<00:04:40.360> all<00:04:40.539> trees

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
the following reasons first of all trees

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:45.450 
the following reasons first of all trees
have<00:04:41.530> been<00:04:41.560> planted<00:04:41.710> and<00:04:43.860> normally<00:04:44.860> this<00:04:45.039> area

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
have been planted and normally this area

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.570 
have been planted and normally this area
would<00:04:45.729> have<00:04:45.969> acacia<00:04:46.449> and<00:04:46.840> grass<00:04:47.500> but<00:04:48.490> the

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
would have acacia and grass but the

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.429 
would have acacia and grass but the
community<00:04:49.030> here<00:04:49.300> over<00:04:49.599> the<00:04:49.629> last<00:04:49.840> 25<00:04:50.409> years

00:04:50.429 --> 00:04:50.439 
community here over the last 25 years

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:52.980 
community here over the last 25 years
have<00:04:50.860> planted<00:04:51.189> lots<00:04:51.430> of<00:04:51.610> trees<00:04:51.909> what<00:04:52.689> this<00:04:52.810> has

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
have planted lots of trees what this has

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.179 
have planted lots of trees what this has
meant<00:04:53.050> is<00:04:53.530> that<00:04:53.590> there<00:04:53.919> is<00:04:53.979> more

00:04:54.179 --> 00:04:54.189 
meant is that there is more

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:57.990 
meant is that there is more
precipitation<00:04:54.990> because<00:04:56.189> of<00:04:57.189> the<00:04:57.400> they<00:04:57.699> are

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
precipitation because of the they are

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.999 
precipitation because of the they are
arresting<00:04:58.419> the<00:04:58.509> crew<00:04:58.719> the<00:04:58.900> clouds<00:04:59.169> there<00:04:59.919> is

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
arresting the crew the clouds there is

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.360 
arresting the crew the clouds there is
much<00:05:00.460> more<00:05:00.490> do<00:05:00.909> you<00:05:00.939> now<00:05:01.240> here<00:05:02.020> and<00:05:02.169> also<00:05:02.800> the

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
much more do you now here and also the

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.809 
much more do you now here and also the
birds<00:05:03.669> and<00:05:04.169> the<00:05:05.169> insects<00:05:06.069> and<00:05:06.279> the<00:05:06.340> wind<00:05:06.580> are

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:06.819 
birds and the insects and the wind are

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:08.850 
birds and the insects and the wind are
bringing<00:05:07.210> more<00:05:07.419> seed<00:05:07.719> here<00:05:08.110> so<00:05:08.680> what<00:05:08.830> is

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
bringing more seed here so what is

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.820 
bringing more seed here so what is
happening<00:05:09.069> here<00:05:09.550> is<00:05:10.150> that<00:05:10.180> over<00:05:11.080> the<00:05:11.169> last<00:05:11.289> 25

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
happening here is that over the last 25

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.760 
happening here is that over the last 25
years<00:05:11.909> this<00:05:12.909> climatic<00:05:13.449> zone<00:05:13.870> has<00:05:14.199> shifted

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
years this climatic zone has shifted

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.070 
years this climatic zone has shifted
from<00:05:15.069> fairly<00:05:15.879> semi<00:05:16.090> arid<00:05:16.330> zone<00:05:16.719> 5

to be spread across the board would

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.059 
to be spread across the board would
