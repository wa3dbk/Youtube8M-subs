00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
to see somebody that I could drift build

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.530 
to see somebody that I could drift build
of<00:04:53.230> a<00:04:53.320> Ford<00:04:53.590> cat<00:04:54.060> and<00:04:55.060> that<00:04:55.300> would<00:04:55.420> be

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
of a Ford cat and that would be

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.030 
of a Ford cat and that would be
absolutely<00:04:56.080> insane<00:04:56.380> you<00:04:56.500> know<00:04:56.560> I<00:04:56.590> might<00:04:56.800> try

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
absolutely insane you know I might try

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.130 
absolutely insane you know I might try
that<00:04:57.070> myself<00:04:57.550> about<00:04:57.940> tightly<00:04:58.930> doubts

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
that myself about tightly doubts

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.500 
that myself about tightly doubts
possible<00:04:59.650> in<00:04:59.770> Gran<00:05:00.070> Turismo<00:05:00.280> I<00:05:00.820> mean

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
possible in Gran Turismo I mean

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.930 
possible in Gran Turismo I mean
something<00:05:01.840> more<00:05:02.080> like<00:05:02.460> arcade<00:05:03.460> would

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
something more like arcade would

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.280 
something more like arcade would
probably<00:05:04.360> be<00:05:04.920> ridiculously<00:05:05.920> funny<00:05:06.480> if<00:05:07.480> there

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
probably be ridiculously funny if there

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.490 
probably be ridiculously funny if there
if<00:05:08.620> you<00:05:08.830> could<00:05:09.040> drift<00:05:09.760> the<00:05:09.970> Ford<00:05:10.240> car<00:05:10.570> but

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
if you could drift the Ford car but

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.420 
if you could drift the Ford car but
absolutely<00:05:11.800> have<00:05:12.010> to<00:05:12.160> be<00:05:12.250> something

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
absolutely have to be something

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.400 
absolutely have to be something
ridiculously<00:05:13.330> arcade<00:05:13.750> for<00:05:13.990> a<00:05:14.020> bit<00:05:14.200> to<00:05:14.290> be<00:05:14.380> able

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
ridiculously arcade for a bit to be able

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.570 
ridiculously arcade for a bit to be able
to<00:05:14.560> do<00:05:14.650> that<00:05:15.510> obvious<00:05:16.510> reasons<00:05:17.080> I<00:05:17.470> think<00:05:18.310> kind

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
to do that obvious reasons I think kind

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.190 
to do that obvious reasons I think kind
of<00:05:18.640> makes<00:05:18.820> sense<00:05:19.090> and<00:05:19.270> these<00:05:19.450> rearview<00:05:19.780> mirror

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
of makes sense and these rearview mirror

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.930 
of makes sense and these rearview mirror
is<00:05:20.290> absolutely<00:05:20.860> terrible<00:05:21.130> like<00:05:21.340> the<00:05:21.460> textures

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
is absolutely terrible like the textures

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.020 
is absolutely terrible like the textures
of<00:05:21.970> the<00:05:22.120> world<00:05:22.390> is<00:05:22.570> completely<00:05:23.140> different

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
of the world is completely different
