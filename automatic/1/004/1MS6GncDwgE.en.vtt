00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:47.459 
it's really really good series I took a

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:49.160 
it's really really good series I took a
dystopian<00:01:47.880> series<00:01:48.149> but<00:01:48.539> it<00:01:48.630> definitely<00:01:49.020> falls

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
dystopian series but it definitely falls

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.169 
dystopian series but it definitely falls
heavy<00:01:49.830> on<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.130> romance<00:01:50.550> side<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.789> would<00:01:51.000> say

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
heavy on the romance side I would say

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:52.910 
heavy on the romance side I would say
this<00:01:51.539> is<00:01:51.690> even<00:01:51.929> more<00:01:52.050> heavy<00:01:52.259> romance<00:01:52.619> than<00:01:52.800> the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
this is even more heavy romance than the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.889 
this is even more heavy romance than the
divergent<00:01:53.580> trilogy<00:01:53.640> maybe<00:01:54.090> just<00:01:54.660> because

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
divergent trilogy maybe just because

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.300 
divergent trilogy maybe just because
