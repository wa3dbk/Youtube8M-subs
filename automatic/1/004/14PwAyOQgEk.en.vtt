00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
growing up kayaking a very tall

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.289 
growing up kayaking a very tall
waterfall<00:01:04.860> was<00:01:05.040> 70<00:01:05.460> 80<00:01:05.670> feet<00:01:05.970> tall

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.010 
waterfall was 70 80 feet tall
I<00:01:06.680> ran<00:01:07.880> 107<00:01:08.880> feet<00:01:09.150> tall<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.510> was<00:01:09.630> my<00:01:09.750> biggest

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
I ran 107 feet tall that was my biggest

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.890 
I ran 107 feet tall that was my biggest
one<00:01:10.380> previous<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.860> Palouse<00:01:11.479> and<00:01:12.479> when<00:01:12.869> I

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
one previous to Palouse and when I

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.690 
one previous to Palouse and when I
looked<00:01:13.170> at<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.350> put<00:01:13.560> at<00:01:13.799> Palouse<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.340> wasn't

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
looked at the put at Palouse it wasn't

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.640 
looked at the put at Palouse it wasn't
the<00:01:14.790> height<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.540> was<00:01:15.900> thinking<00:01:16.259> about<00:01:16.350> it

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
the height that I was thinking about it

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.740 
the height that I was thinking about it
was<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> style<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.369> waterfall<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.180> could<00:01:18.360> look

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
was the style of waterfall I could look

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.570 
was the style of waterfall I could look
at<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.320> could<00:01:19.500> see<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.430> was

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
at it and I could see that it was

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.830 
at it and I could see that it was
possibly<00:01:21.060> run<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.259> think<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.310> I

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
possibly run it and so I think that I

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.870 
possibly run it and so I think that I
meant<00:01:24.840> more<00:01:25.290> because<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.189> thought<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.460> could<00:01:26.850> I

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
meant more because I thought I could I

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.300 
meant more because I thought I could I
saw<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.600> saw<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.409> had<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.829> within<00:01:29.009> myself

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
saw it I saw that I had it within myself

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.100 
saw it I saw that I had it within myself
to<00:01:29.640> run<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.060> waterfall<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.810> run<00:01:30.990> it

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
to run this waterfall to run it

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.550 
to run this waterfall to run it
successfully<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:31.979> safely<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:33.439> luckily<00:01:34.439> it

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
successfully and safely and luckily it

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.859 
successfully and safely and luckily it
went<00:01:34.770> exactly<00:01:34.979> as<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:35.759> hoped<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.630> dream<00:01:36.840> that

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
went exactly as we hoped and dream that

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.179 
went exactly as we hoped and dream that
it<00:01:37.110> would<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.590> think<00:01:37.619> we're<00:01:37.860> looking<00:01:38.100> at

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
it would and I think we're looking at

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.300 
it would and I think we're looking at
some<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.490> video<00:01:38.729> just<00:01:39.030> just<00:01:39.960> now<00:01:40.310> you

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.980 
into the water
didn't<00:01:46.680> come<00:01:46.860> up<00:01:46.890> for<00:01:47.130> 20<00:01:47.430> seconds<00:01:47.909> what<00:01:48.810> do

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
didn't come up for 20 seconds what do

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.389 
didn't come up for 20 seconds what do
you<00:01:49.229> mean<00:01:49.350> what<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.590> were<00:01:49.649> experiencing<00:01:50.189> that

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
you mean what you were experiencing that

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.740 
you mean what you were experiencing that
point<00:01:50.549> obviously<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.939> were<00:01:51.030> falling<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.689> you

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
point obviously you were falling so you

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.620 
point obviously you were falling so you
were<00:01:51.869> experiencing<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:53.420> how<00:01:54.420> did<00:01:54.540> you

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
were experiencing that but how did you

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.539 
were experiencing that but how did you
not<00:01:54.780> like<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.530> know<00:01:55.619> fall<00:01:55.920> out<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.280> kayak

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
not like you know fall out of the kayak

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.520 
not like you know fall out of the kayak
just<00:01:56.700> from<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.119> from<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.509> momentum<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.259> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
just from the from the momentum and the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.789 
just from the from the momentum and the
impact<00:01:58.890> right<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.790> invented<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.930> system<00:02:01.259> that

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
impact right I invented a system that

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.899 
impact right I invented a system that
literally<00:02:02.579> clamped<00:02:03.270> me<00:02:03.390> into<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.810> kayak<00:02:04.229> when

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
literally clamped me into the kayak when

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.580 
literally clamped me into the kayak when
breaking<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.969> record<00:02:06.180> it's<00:02:06.570> necessary<00:02:07.469> that

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
breaking a record it's necessary that

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.960 
breaking a record it's necessary that
you<00:02:07.649> stay<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.129> boat<00:02:08.280> if<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.580> come<00:02:08.789> out<00:02:08.819> of

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
you stay in the boat if you come out of

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.990 
you stay in the boat if you come out of
the<00:02:09.119> kayak<00:02:09.330> then<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.289> doesn't<00:02:10.679> count<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.310> it

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
the kayak then it doesn't count so it

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.480 
the kayak then it doesn't count so it
was<00:02:12.180> full<00:02:12.390> commitment<00:02:12.959> for<00:02:13.170> me

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
was full commitment for me

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.450 
was full commitment for me
I<00:02:13.550> was<00:02:14.230> committed<00:02:15.230> on<00:02:15.500> staying<00:02:15.890> in<00:02:16.070> my<00:02:16.220> boat<00:02:16.430> I

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
I was committed on staying in my boat I

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.790 
I was committed on staying in my boat I
had<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:17.120> system<00:02:17.660> that<00:02:17.870> clamped<00:02:18.320> my<00:02:18.380> spray

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
had the system that clamped my spray

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.770 
had the system that clamped my spray
skirt<00:02:19.160> on<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:19.580> cockpit<00:02:19.820> of<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.150> kayak<00:02:20.570> to

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
skirt on to the cockpit of the kayak to

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.760 
skirt on to the cockpit of the kayak to
hold<00:02:20.960> me<00:02:21.140> in<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:22.810> upon<00:02:23.810> impact<00:02:24.200> I<00:02:24.440> was

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
hold me in it and upon impact I was

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.460 
hold me in it and upon impact I was
pretty<00:02:24.980> dazed<00:02:25.840> through<00:02:26.840> three<00:02:27.200> fall

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
pretty dazed through three fall

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.260 
pretty dazed through three fall
everything<00:02:27.980> was<00:02:28.100> going<00:02:28.400> good<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:28.700> remember<00:02:29.240> a

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
everything was going good I remember a

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.300 
everything was going good I remember a
very<00:02:29.630> conscious<00:02:30.320> positive<00:02:30.830> thought<00:02:31.070> go

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
very conscious positive thought go

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.160 
very conscious positive thought go
through<00:02:31.550> my<00:02:31.670> head<00:02:31.910> that<00:02:32.600> this<00:02:32.750> is<00:02:32.870> going<00:02:33.140> great

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
through my head that this is going great

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.870 
through my head that this is going great
I'm<00:02:33.710> exactly<00:02:34.220> where<00:02:34.280> I<00:02:34.430> want<00:02:34.490> to<00:02:34.760> be

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
I'm exactly where I want to be

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.710 
I'm exactly where I want to be
microphone

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
microphone

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.390 
microphone
yeah<00:02:35.810> well<00:02:35.990> I'm<00:02:36.110> following<00:02:36.470> my<00:02:36.620> boat<00:02:36.890> angle<00:02:37.310> is

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
yeah well I'm following my boat angle is

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.010 
yeah well I'm following my boat angle is
right<00:02:37.700> which<00:02:37.910> is<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.150> most<00:02:38.300> important<00:02:38.840> thing

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
right which is the most important thing

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.690 
right which is the most important thing
what<00:02:39.380> is<00:02:39.500> that<00:02:39.680> is<00:02:39.770> it<00:02:39.920> just<00:02:39.950> straight<00:02:40.400> down

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
what is that is it just straight down

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.910 
what is that is it just straight down
straight<00:02:40.940> down<00:02:41.330> it's<00:02:41.900> a<00:02:41.990> lot<00:02:42.170> like<00:02:42.380> jumping

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
straight down it's a lot like jumping

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.710 
straight down it's a lot like jumping
off<00:02:43.070> a<00:02:43.100> bridge<00:02:43.460> or<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:43.850> rock<00:02:44.120> you<00:02:44.300> want<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:44.510> land

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
off a bridge or a rock you want to land

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.180 
off a bridge or a rock you want to land
feet<00:02:45.080> first<00:02:45.110> you<00:02:45.560> don't<00:02:45.650> want<00:02:45.830> to<00:02:45.890> land<00:02:46.070> on

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
feet first you don't want to land on

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.980 
feet first you don't want to land on
your<00:02:46.310> belly<00:02:46.610> or<00:02:46.850> off<00:02:47.000> to<00:02:47.120> one<00:02:47.300> side<00:02:47.600> you<00:02:47.630> want

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
your belly or off to one side you want

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.280 
your belly or off to one side you want
to<00:02:48.020> penetrate<00:02:48.590> into<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.010> water<00:02:49.310> and

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
to penetrate into the water and

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.990 
to penetrate into the water and
decelerate<00:02:51.290> over<00:02:51.770> as<00:02:51.980> long<00:02:52.280> a<00:02:52.340> period<00:02:52.760> of<00:02:52.820> time

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
decelerate over as long a period of time

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.660 
decelerate over as long a period of time
as<00:02:53.180> possible<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:53.960> reduces<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.070> g-force<00:02:55.610> is

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
as possible that reduces the g-force is

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.420 
as possible that reduces the g-force is
acting<00:02:56.060> upon<00:02:56.180> you<00:02:56.600> and<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:57.830> that's<00:02:58.040> what

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
acting upon you and and that's what

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.550 
acting upon you and and that's what
keeps<00:02:59.120> you<00:02:59.360> okay<00:02:59.720> and<00:02:59.960> so<00:03:00.080> instead<00:03:00.350> of<00:03:00.440> just

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
keeps you okay and so instead of just

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.130 
keeps you okay and so instead of just
stopping<00:03:00.860> suddenly<00:03:01.280> yours<00:03:01.640> -<00:03:02.090> you<00:03:02.810> want<00:03:02.960> to<00:03:03.020> go

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
stopping suddenly yours - you want to go

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.770 
stopping suddenly yours - you want to go
as<00:03:03.290> deep<00:03:03.650> as<00:03:03.860> possible<00:03:04.210> slow<00:03:05.210> down<00:03:05.420> over<00:03:05.600> as

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
as deep as possible slow down over as

long a period of time as possible it's

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.720 
long a period of time as possible it's
still<00:03:08.450> a<00:03:08.870> ferocious<00:03:09.740> impact<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:10.340> biggest

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
still a ferocious impact the biggest

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.900 
still a ferocious impact the biggest
impact<00:03:11.300> of<00:03:11.450> my<00:03:11.570> life<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:12.200> I<00:03:12.710> was<00:03:13.040> completely

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
impact of my life and I was completely

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.080 
impact of my life and I was completely
dazed<00:03:14.330> right<00:03:15.020> upon<00:03:15.290> impact<00:03:15.880> was<00:03:16.880> that<00:03:17.000> the

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
dazed right upon impact was that the

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.610 
dazed right upon impact was that the
scariest<00:03:17.660> one<00:03:17.810> of<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:17.960> scariest<00:03:18.230> moments<00:03:18.320> or

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
scariest one of the scariest moments or

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.670 
scariest one of the scariest moments or
if<00:03:18.920> not<00:03:19.070> what<00:03:19.250> was<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:20.660> scariest<00:03:21.020> moment<00:03:21.230> is

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
if not what was the scariest moment is

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.380 
if not what was the scariest moment is
always<00:03:22.190> when<00:03:22.400> you're<00:03:22.490> making<00:03:22.850> the<00:03:22.940> decision
