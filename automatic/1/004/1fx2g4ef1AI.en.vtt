pretty important in dec because you
really<00:01:57.570> need<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.810> beat<00:01:57.930> over<00:01:58.140> things<00:01:58.350> with

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
really need to beat over things with

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.050 
really need to beat over things with
your<00:01:58.590> fibers<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.219> also<00:01:59.520> protecting<00:01:59.939> your

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
your fibers and also protecting your

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.270 
your fibers and also protecting your
logging<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.390> really<00:02:00.570> important<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.590> that's

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
logging is really important so that's

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.340 
logging is really important so that's
why<00:02:02.460> they're<00:02:02.640> there<00:02:02.670> on<00:02:03.540> our<00:02:03.719> own<00:02:03.750> trim<00:02:04.079> steep

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
why they're there on our own trim steep

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.310 
why they're there on our own trim steep
because<00:02:05.280> I'm<00:02:05.520> running<00:02:05.820> two<00:02:05.939> months

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
because I'm running two months

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.219 
because I'm running two months
essentially<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.530> reason

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.530 

and<00:02:11.009> then<00:02:11.129> lost<00:02:11.580> power<00:02:11.819> planes<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.420> do

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
and then lost power planes to do

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.320 
and then lost power planes to do

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
at under King sometimes but you have to

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.740

morning one macrocosmos one wire top I

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.039 
morning one macrocosmos one wire top I
like<00:02:29.790> wiretap<00:02:30.000> because<00:02:30.299> it<00:02:30.420> just<00:02:30.510> puts<00:02:30.810> the

like wiretap because it just puts the

tread back into the deck and then just

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.780 
tread back into the deck and then just
not<00:02:34.049> just<00:02:34.860> lets<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.099> not<00:02:35.250> worry<00:02:35.430> about<00:02:35.519> the

not just lets you not worry about the

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
guard and a few wound up warning it's

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:38.960

because<00:02:39.480> then<00:02:39.720> just<00:02:40.019> be<00:02:40.140> taking<00:02:40.739> too<00:02:41.010> much

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
because then just be taking too much

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.130 
because then just be taking too much
life<00:02:41.430> ones<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:42.390> then<00:02:42.480> my<00:02:42.569> present<00:02:42.900> because<00:02:42.989> it

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.809 
gravy few detachment or two of traps
were<00:03:07.470> running<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:07.950> brighter<00:03:08.190> skills<00:03:08.549> to<00:03:08.700> get

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
were running to brighter skills to get

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.270 
were running to brighter skills to get
around<00:03:09.000> things<00:03:09.420> like<00:03:09.510> window<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:10.920> also<00:03:11.160> just

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
around things like window and also just

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.430 
around things like window and also just
to<00:03:11.640> disrupt<00:03:12.090> their<00:03:12.209> phones<00:03:12.359> place<00:03:12.629> and<00:03:12.900> then

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
to disrupt their phones place and then

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.530 
to disrupt their phones place and then
to<00:03:13.950> van<00:03:14.220> Dee's<00:03:14.400> emptiness<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:15.030> stick<00:03:15.239> does

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
to van Dee's emptiness the stick does

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.390 
to van Dee's emptiness the stick does
need<00:03:15.810> an<00:03:15.930> out<00:03:16.109> to<00:03:16.470> all<00:03:16.560> fusion<00:03:17.010> sometimes

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
need an out to all fusion sometimes

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.710 
need an out to all fusion sometimes
so<00:03:17.819> this<00:03:18.239> is<00:03:18.450> just<00:03:18.690> why<00:03:19.109> it's<00:03:19.260> there<00:03:20.450> also<00:03:21.450> this

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
so this is just why it's there also this

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.839 
so this is just why it's there also this

so<00:03:36.989> you're<00:03:37.440> going<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.620> need<00:03:37.769> some<00:03:37.799> way<00:03:38.130> to

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
so you're going to need some way to

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.099 
so you're going to need some way to
protect<00:03:38.430> your<00:03:38.760> little<00:03:38.910> weenie<00:03:39.389> monsters<00:03:39.780> that

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
protect your little weenie monsters that

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.830 
protect your little weenie monsters that
just<00:03:40.410> needs<00:03:41.340> one<00:03:41.579> turn<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.269> resolve<00:03:42.569> so<00:03:42.750> you

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
just needs one turn to resolve so you

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.690 
just needs one turn to resolve so you
can<00:03:42.989> summon<00:03:43.139> another<00:03:43.349> one<00:03:43.530> from<00:03:43.620> hand<00:03:43.799> so

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
can summon another one from hand so

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.920 
can summon another one from hand so
that's<00:03:44.880> why<00:03:45.000> deeper<00:03:45.660> isn't<00:03:45.840> there

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
that's why deeper isn't there

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.470 
that's why deeper isn't there
essentially<00:03:47.870> extract<00:03:49.250> nothing's<00:03:50.480> really

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
essentially extract nothing's really

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.229 
essentially extract nothing's really
important<00:03:52.109> other<00:03:52.290> than<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:53.430> three<00:03:53.700> copies<00:03:53.940> of
