00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.189
 moment absurd as the young man would say 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.680

 So go ahead and enjoy it, guys. 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.390
 did you hear the introduction how we 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.730
 You know the way it is online has infinites 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.320
 possibilities of day 5 in fact the 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.299
 game was done in a way that the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.310
 rockstar can put absolutely 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.810
 anything they want they can 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.400
 also change whatever they want to 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.619
 any time we saw this 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.680
 already in the last 18 months of the 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.689
 gt online a year and a half from gt online it 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.220
 always change always put new things 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.170
 things that we did not expect 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.210
 they came and something really big 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.280
 complex as was the delight of the blows 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.350
 for example that was by far the largest 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.060
 theirs is the online way they got 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.829
 put that into the game anyway 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.509
 although it has had some problems, it is 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.579
 Of course but the truth is that the rockstar 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.329
 can transform on one side what they 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.250
 want 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.170
 through them should be free if they 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.360
 launching and one of the delights that is 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.920
 a lot of time people say it's a 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.899
 and that has to do with the players 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.399
 can have animals on twitter online 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.770
 for example you can buy your 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.810
 animal gta online can take in pet shop 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.119
 you can take along with the 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.640
 other your friends or be and become one of 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.530
 swan and see that one of them and pets the side 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.420
 sims after all today has 1 year to 4 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.670
 said jorge so much you can 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.740
 do in the game and the truth is that this tlc 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.020
 seems so far away for those who have 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.819
 possible it can actually be real 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.319
 after all some jokers of 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.950
 rockstar has already told 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.470
 tested putting animals 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.150
 online mode to see how it worked 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.099
 it would work more or less defeat 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.959
 frank's choice when he walks with the 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.459
 shopping there in story mode you can 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.260
 take your dog to walk you 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.180
 can leave in his apartment he will 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.090
 have a corner for him and the coolest 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.260
 you could use the application 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.640
 wilfried we have on the cell phone 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.349
 the same way we go there and 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.019
 plays with the mall teaches tricks 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.590
 For him the food from the water leads to 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.090
 walk 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.250
 we could do it with the 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.810
 our character in online mode 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.000
 maybe rockstar would also put more 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.680
 breed options for now up to 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.280
 current generation has even faster than 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.870
 the old one 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.910
 but you could buy for example a 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.769
 labrador a pit bull or the rottweiler 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.870
 as is the shopping you own the way 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.730
 franklin's story imagines he can 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.530
 Being that you can use this can 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.099
 imagine one of them and so much 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.180
 cool 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.250
 of course I have some problems 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.720
 for example other players come there to 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.670
 kill your dog while you are 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.230
 in a free session with them 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.610
 so I think maybe something that just had 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.860
 to invent something to try 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.170
 prevent this from happening for example 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.610
 passive mode for the dogs and I 'm not 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.620
 dog I'm not talking about dogs 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.569
 as an example but also cats by 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.579
 example in ct next to the current generation 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.260
 There are cats too so you could 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.150
 buy other animals for you to have 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.519
 as if it were a pet and 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.530
 This is really amazing, so how do I 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.060
 I said I'll be until already tested put 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.829
 these animals in online mode to see 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.930
 How were some drainers? 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.700
 information said this and more they 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.280
 also said they could have the 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.389
 possibility of putting animal actors 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.590
 there in the breeder 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.630
 for example when you create a 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.579
 kills these things some hackers 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.769
 who have access to game codes 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.630
 They said they hid the 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.880
 possibility of a day to rockstar 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.700
 put activate this option on you 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.500
 put CNPC in case animals or 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.190
 actors as he calls there the creators of 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.019
 service 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.639
 Imagine being able to put animals there to 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.530
 interact during the missions as well 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.900
 It would be very amazing how I told you. 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.090
 could buy her pets and walk with 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.590
 they in town strolling you could 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.660
 put there inside your car takes 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.180
 to walk around in some places and of course 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.919
 if one of them came and so the animal arc 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.049
 that a long time ago everybody said that 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:16.720
 one day could be open in the game has 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.820
 that coming from this dlc the animal here is 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.660
 one of the few pet shops you can find 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.950
 by map 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.479
 It's just like it's a scenario. 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.750
 It has no way to enter it has no way 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.610
 do nothing but it exists in the game 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.280
 the brand is a store that exists in 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.140
 universe of gta 5 beyond the saints call 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.490
 Animal here is a pet shop. 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.200
 then what could only construct the 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.610
 Inside put this pet shop and maybe 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.410
 in other places because the place he 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.100
 is now half out of town. 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.780
 I know why 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.090
 And then you could take her to the pet shop. 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.670
 could place customizations to your 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.650
 animals and everything expensive has a lot of idea has 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.150
 a lot you could do 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.480
 in one of them if they really have 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.190
 a lot of idea would undoubtedly be after the 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.110
 scams one of the best of the 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.880
 rockstar could put in the game and this 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.770
 something really impressive but it's the 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.300
 Next galera pro video of today was just 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.100
 these theories that wanted to put this 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.960
 video for you guys to think a little bit like 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.740
 It would be a must with animals in your 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.940
 online time 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.470
 Of course I'm not confirming anything. 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.110
 like I said at the beginning of the video are 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.180
 speculation but it really would be 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.669
 the question of the video is the 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.650
 next if you could choose some 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:18.450
 animal of the real life are putting 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.360
 gta5 to be your pet 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.430
 What animal would you put in your gt? 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.600
 serious online any animal even if 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.130
 exist on the planet 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.990
 only that it could add new 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.610
 animals also what animal you wanted 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.680
 that they put to be your bug 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.470
 pet puts us comments 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.660
 the best response between one of the 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.580
 videos in the previous video I asked 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.160
 you leave comments about which 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.890
 music band or artist would put us 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.390
 GTA5 in your pc and I chose the 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.400
 comment by joão vitor 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.860
 he said that it can not be 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.090
 dj snake true clear yet format 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.680
 more and start to play for 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.080
 coincidence after you did 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.000
 something very epoch already if really fuck 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.890
 undoubtedly making the format one of the 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.240
 songs that can not be missing and good 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.130
 I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.590
 theories if you also speculate 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.030
 have ideas like other ideas that 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.590
 could fit in with these large and 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.430
