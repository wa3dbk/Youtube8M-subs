00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.290 
played on the twelfth fret on the a
string<00:00:15.890> then<00:00:16.890> it's<00:00:17.010> going<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.220> go<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.609> mean<00:00:17.850> the

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
is going to be 14th fret on the D string

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.490 
is going to be 14th fret on the D string
so<00:00:28.949> it's<00:00:29.070> going<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.220> go<00:00:29.960> and<00:00:30.960> it's<00:00:31.140> going<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.289> be

so it's going to go and it's going to be
the<00:00:32.309> 14th<00:00:32.790> fret<00:00:33.090> on<00:00:33.410> the<00:00:34.410> g<00:00:34.800> string<00:00:35.690> so<00:00:40.820> like

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
the 14th fret on the g string so like

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.690 
the 14th fret on the g string so like
that<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:44.300> and<00:00:45.300> then<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.539> would<00:00:45.719> be<00:00:45.780> 13<00:00:46.140> front

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
that so and then it would be 13 front

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.000 
that so and then it would be 13 front
would<00:00:47.700> be<00:00:47.850> straight<00:00:48.260> then<00:00:49.260> 12th<00:00:49.649> fret<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
would be straight then 12th fret on the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.619 
would be straight then 12th fret on the
E<00:00:50.070> string<00:00:51.170> 17th<00:00:52.170> fret<00:00:52.289> e<00:00:52.620> string<00:00:53.510> and<00:00:54.510> then

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
E string 17th fret e string and then

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.000 
E string 17th fret e string and then
descending<00:00:55.079> arpeggio<00:00:57.199> and<00:00:58.199> now<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.680> film's

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
descending arpeggio and now the film's

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.229 
descending arpeggio and now the film's
comes<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.550> LA<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.000> legato<00:01:00.329> technique<00:01:02.120> at<00:01:03.120> the
