 even 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.540
 in other countries, not only in Kharkov 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.890

 Four puppies are like a harker

 on the spot, similar evolved and for the first time 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:50.270
 seemingly standing and calling a European place i 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:53.490
 Itâ€™s already time Kharkiv somewhere about five years ago 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.610
 back then such a short trip 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.799
 I will remember something here 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.890
 now after three over for work this 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.320
 Of course the change is big-big this 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.770
 the material part is of course the street is 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.810
 the building is just nice to watch it 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.550

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.510
 the application and tourists will find the essence actively 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.390
 See Kharkov prices both knowledge 100 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.060
 stereotypes my experience suggests that 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.599
 today just interest in the east 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.680
 Ukraine grew from Europeans and so much 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.870
 reasons on the one hand maybe your 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.000
 time underestimating the importance of this region 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.319
 for the integrity of Ukraine integrity 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.260
 Europe on the other hand 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.900
 the discovery that beautiful people live here 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.400
 European people and with whom you can 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.880
 to dialogue and make wonderful 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.390
 projects and despite the concerns that 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.010
 more degree 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.600
 but as if on myths when we are German 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.459
 colleagues come to Kharkov separating 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.490
 very quickly destroyed they fall in love 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.340
 to the city and we believe in what we succeed 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.800
 through joint efforts to give up 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.000
