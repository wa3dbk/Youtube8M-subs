00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.229

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.290
 compositions 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.450
 if with one partner you dance 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.820

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.430

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.689
 vary in mood to musical 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.920
 the size and range of movements that 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.259
 dancers perform 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.689
 tango waltz and milonga are also different 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.759
 in its mood the tango itself can 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.549
 be as sad or river 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.740
 passionate or tender or even flirtatious 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.900
 and the mischievous fighter is usually lighter in 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.880
 it more turns less astana 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.260
 now I want to spin spinning spin 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.270

 dance for when you want to light 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.770
 partner very cheerful fast and 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.170
 naughty in order to successfully dance 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.270
 and tango and waltz milongu with different 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.850
 partners can own major 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.240
 technical laws that exist 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.190
 in argentinian tango 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.770
 My name is Alex and slang before 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.720
 we will go to the exercises I will tell you 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.000
 about a few more details about tanks in 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.620
 first in milonga at a party who 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.510
 dance tango couples move always 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.670
 counterclockwise and secondly 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.230
 since tango is improvisation then only 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.180
 partner knows what will happen 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.250
 happen the next moment he leads 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.320
 partner follows partner not 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.290
 must try to predict the movement 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.360
 partner should rather listen to partner 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.780
 and respond to his vision so in 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.209
 dance 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.550
 if the girl is wrong or if the partner 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.200
 that situation is wrong only corrects 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.900
 partner if partner tries 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.030
 fix then another error will occur 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.400
 one more mistake in the end you 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.800
 step on each other come across so 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.780
 that girls relax and get 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.530
 the pleasure of dancing is responsible for everything 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.530
 only partner
