00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
things to start inducing fear and

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.560 
things to start inducing fear and
everything<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.149> looks<00:01:45.299> like<00:01:45.360> it's

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
everything and it looks like it's

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.389

bit<00:01:47.640> until<00:01:48.360> at<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.509> very<00:01:48.570> end<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.049> looks<00:01:49.140> like

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
bit until at the very end it looks like

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.289 
bit until at the very end it looks like
she's<00:01:49.560> about<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.860> turn<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.430> tables<00:01:50.880> on<00:01:51.030> as

she's about to turn the tables on as
naught<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.780> begins<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.500> bring<00:01:52.710> up<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.950> fact

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
naught and begins to bring up the fact

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.819 
naught and begins to bring up the fact
that<00:01:53.340> what<00:01:53.520> his<00:01:53.759> fear<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:55.200> his<00:01:55.380> powers

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
that what his fear is is that his powers

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.289 
that what his fear is is that his powers
are<00:01:56.009> not<00:01:56.130> going<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.490> be<00:01:56.640> able<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.850> work<00:01:57.090> on

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:37.289 
bleach which I think was a lot of fun it
was<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.590> little<00:02:35.980> slow<00:02:36.400> in<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.849> beginning

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
was a little slow in the beginning

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:38.940 
was a little slow in the beginning
especially<00:02:37.480> with<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:37.989> stuff<00:02:38.200> with<00:02:38.319> Renji<00:02:38.769> and

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
there were some things they probably

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.399 
there were some things they probably
could<00:02:40.450> have<00:02:40.510> gone<00:02:40.689> through<00:02:40.900> a<00:02:40.959> lot<00:02:41.169> quicker

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 
could have gone through a lot quicker

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:42.929 
could have gone through a lot quicker
