everyone today we'll look at the end

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:10.320 
everyone today we'll look at the end
your<00:00:07.029> condenser<00:00:07.710> hi<00:00:08.710> guys<00:00:08.950> yeah<00:00:09.880> so<00:00:10.180> what

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.330 
your condenser hi guys yeah so what

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.009 
your condenser hi guys yeah so what
we're<00:00:10.450> making<00:00:10.660> is<00:00:10.990> energy<00:00:11.350> condenser<00:00:12.930> so<00:00:13.930> I'm

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.019 
we're making is energy condenser so I'm

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.009 
we're making is energy condenser so I'm
going<00:00:14.170> to<00:00:14.200> produce<00:00:14.350> some<00:00:14.710> items<00:00:15.070> from<00:00:15.309> it<00:00:16.019> term

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:17.019 
going to produce some items from it term

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:20.730 
going to produce some items from it term
alter<00:00:17.560> the<00:00:17.769> equivalent<00:00:18.220> exchange<00:00:19.169> it<00:00:20.169> at<00:00:20.439> this

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
alter the equivalent exchange it at this

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.779 
alter the equivalent exchange it at this
park<00:00:22.289> yeah<00:00:23.289> just<00:00:23.409> like<00:00:23.619> a<00:00:23.679> near<00:00:24.009> covalence

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
park yeah just like a near covalence

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.729 
park yeah just like a near covalence
dust<00:00:26.189> I'm<00:00:27.189> so<00:00:28.050> weak<00:00:29.050> I<00:00:29.199> should<00:00:29.380> do<00:00:29.499> with<00:00:29.589> this

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
dust I'm so weak I should do with this

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.180 
dust I'm so weak I should do with this
is<00:00:30.039> if<00:00:30.489> you've<00:00:30.669> got<00:00:30.880> a<00:00:30.909> mystery<00:00:31.839> why<00:00:32.169> was<00:00:33.040> it

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
is if you've got a mystery why was it

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.420 
is if you've got a mystery why was it
meter<00:00:33.370> relay<00:00:33.820> it's<00:00:34.660> one<00:00:34.780> of<00:00:34.870> them<00:00:35.250> I'll<00:00:36.250> get

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
meter relay it's one of them I'll get

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.290 
meter relay it's one of them I'll get
right<00:00:36.580> hang<00:00:36.880> on<00:00:37.020> yeah<00:00:38.020> a<00:00:38.230> meter<00:00:38.440> relay<00:00:38.920> or<00:00:39.790> an

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
right hang on yeah a meter relay or an

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.390 
right hang on yeah a meter relay or an
energy<00:00:40.720> collector<00:00:41.230> you<00:00:41.500> can<00:00:41.680> actually<00:00:41.830> use

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
energy collector you can actually use

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.340 
energy collector you can actually use
them<00:00:42.730> to<00:00:43.030> a<00:00:43.060> pair<00:00:43.930> of<00:00:44.050> this<00:00:45.930> but<00:00:46.930> we're<00:00:47.080> using

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
them to a pair of this but we're using

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.550 
them to a pair of this but we're using
items<00:00:47.590> see<00:00:48.280> with<00:00:48.580> this<00:00:48.700> bit<00:00:49.420> of<00:00:49.540> the<00:00:49.630> mod<00:00:49.810> each

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.560 
items see with this bit of the mod each

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
item in Minecraft has given a emc school

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.410 
item in Minecraft has given a emc school
kind<00:00:55.240> of<00:00:55.360> it's<00:00:56.140> a<00:00:56.470> stands<00:00:57.040> for<00:00:57.210> energy<00:00:58.210> mater

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
kind of it's a stands for energy mater

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.460 
kind of it's a stands for energy mater
currency<00:00:59.880> dirt<00:01:00.880> and<00:01:01.300> that<00:01:01.660> has<00:01:01.900> got<00:01:02.079> like<00:01:02.230> one

the bar at the top that's that's where

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.080 
the bar at the top that's that's where
the<00:02:00.909> AMC<00:02:01.299> comes<00:02:01.600> to<00:02:01.950> if<00:02:02.950> you<00:02:03.159> add<00:02:03.430> this<00:02:03.580> next<00:02:03.909> to

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
the AMC comes to if you add this next to

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.219 
the AMC comes to if you add this next to
a<00:02:04.119> meter<00:02:05.049> relay<00:02:05.560> or<00:02:06.420> an<00:02:07.420> energy<00:02:07.810> collector

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
a meter relay or an energy collector

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.650 
a meter relay or an energy collector
that<00:02:08.259> would<00:02:08.500> achieve<00:02:08.619> fellow<00:02:09.190> from<00:02:10.060> them<00:02:10.390> too

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
that would achieve fellow from them too

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.309 
that would achieve fellow from them too
so<00:02:10.959> that<00:02:11.140> I<00:02:11.170> love<00:02:11.380> swimming<00:02:11.590> in<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:11.890> bar

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
so that I love swimming in the bar

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.739 
so that I love swimming in the bar
and<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.549> got<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.700> little<00:02:13.819> tug<00:02:14.090> slot<00:02:14.390> there<00:02:14.599> with

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:14.749 
and you got a little tug slot there with

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:17.140 
and you got a little tug slot there with
us<00:02:14.870> with<00:02:15.109> the<00:02:15.200> diamond<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:16.489> then<00:02:16.819> one<00:02:16.969> going

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
us with the diamond and then one going

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.089 
us with the diamond and then one going
to<00:02:17.209> show<00:02:17.359> you<00:02:17.420> is<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.810> best<00:02:18.230> items<00:02:18.799> to

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
to show you is the best items to

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.229 
to show you is the best items to
actually<00:02:19.519> use<00:02:20.209> to<00:02:20.540> create<00:02:20.749> diamond<00:02:21.319> out<00:02:21.499> of

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
actually use to create diamond out of

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.629 
actually use to create diamond out of
well<00:02:23.239> energy<00:02:23.840> kind<00:02:24.170> of<00:02:24.349> so<00:02:24.920> we're<00:02:25.459> going<00:02:25.549> to

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:25.639 
well energy kind of so we're going to

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:28.449 
well energy kind of so we're going to
use<00:02:25.670> a<00:02:25.760> 64<00:02:26.359> stack<00:02:26.629> of<00:02:26.749> coal<00:02:26.989> that<00:02:27.680> actually

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
use a 64 stack of coal that actually
