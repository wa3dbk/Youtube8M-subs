00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:17.279
 so today we're going to answer the third part of the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.279
 verification of the criterion of responsiveness of the bike 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:24.300
 this third part consists of the study of the overall equilibrium 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.779
 triangle and spa and wheel 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.430
 the objective of this part and find the action in fold of the ground on the wheel 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.010
 my country from the ground on the wheel 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.930
 when the position 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.930
 of this together both the open position 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.960
 how do we see that we are in the open position 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.960
 reference must be made to the document dtc 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.170
 summer source 7 we see 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.200
 a schematization 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.600
 mechanism in two positions 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.310
 here we are in the open position the damper is fully open 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.280
 here we have the wheel that went up 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.710
 and the damper is returned to the subject with the following 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.710
 a question 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.730
 where are you referring to 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.380
 to the technical document 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.420
 and at the end 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.420
 start to comment comic 8 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.950
 a curve of evolution of a fishing effort 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.310
 according to the depression of the damper 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.660
 you are asked to find on this document the value of afd 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.800
 for the open position 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.130
 then 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.229
 the next question you will be asked to apply the fundamental principle on 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.590
 the system that I presented earlier 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.590
 to deduce the forks 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.780
 taking 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.650
 at the question 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.760
 research effort 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.760
 according to the position 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.959
 the position being open we will consider 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.409
 that the damper 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.239
 but not at all depressed 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.729
 so it means that the sink here at a value of 0 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:20.239
 p 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.249
 of the effort they had given safe and healthy place roughly approximated 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:25.709
 minutes 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.940
 in the question asks you to postpone it on the document of the areas of 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.569
 games 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.639
 so I postpone on the documentary the value of 1000 tons 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:44.700
 and thanks to the implication of the scale we will be able to deduce from it immediately 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:50.269
 representation 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.830
 knowing that 1 centimeter represents 100 thousand tons here we will have a 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.829
 dodik representation 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:01.899
 so we answered that first question 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:05.509
 who was the one to find the value 

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.059
 2 the fps of sure and certain
