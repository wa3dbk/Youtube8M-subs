 Well, there are some countries that do not 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:30.060
 they know it but it's pretty much a red and 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.180
 like the tomato and well then the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:38.210
 mirror like that 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.210
 the materials is a spoon 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.360
 water and a container where are you going to put 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.750

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.880
 you want a brush but you can support 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.560
 from the same spoon I'm going to support 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.340
 from the same spoon because I lost my 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:14.990
 brush and everything me and where is the water 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:20.860
 where are you going to put it then alberto martÃ­n 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:23.270
 oxidize and with the spoon you will take 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.740
 about half a tablespoon of the 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:31.760
 Swiss and you're going to submerge 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:34.670

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:45.590
 without pulling without leaving and sticking it 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:48.560
 container and already in the low and returns it 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.140
 something like that since you have your caldito 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.230
 chicken that will turn it into caldito 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.470
 of tomato with your spoon the brush with 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.370
 what you have chosen can take 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.519
 Red paint 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.060
 and is that if you go to soak in the 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.060
 Red paint 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.780
 the brush and the spoon because you're going to 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:18.680
 put the little red container of the 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:22.129
 red paint to the spoon and that you have left 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:28.239
 a color more or less like that or very strong 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:28.239
 not very clear something like mine 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:47.110

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:53.410
 good touching of tomato 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:55.890
 this lasts a day without a refrigerator and 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.300
 two to three days with different 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.430
 refrigerator since you put it in 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.710
 office and well that's food and it's not going to 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.540
 bring conservative so I'll 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:10.040

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:13.159
