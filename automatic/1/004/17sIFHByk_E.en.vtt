00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.720 
of other vehicles to be aware of motor
well<00:02:12.930> it's<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.410> utmost<00:02:14.590> importance<00:02:15.340> however

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
well it's the utmost importance however

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.070 
well it's the utmost importance however
when<00:02:15.940> we<00:02:15.970> train<00:02:16.270> people<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.570> ride<00:02:16.810> bikes

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
when we train people to ride bikes

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.260 
when we train people to ride bikes
that's<00:02:17.650> almost<00:02:17.880> not<00:02:18.880> a<00:02:18.910> consideration

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
that's almost not a consideration

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.780 
that's almost not a consideration
because<00:02:20.110> when<00:02:20.680> they<00:02:20.800> get<00:02:21.010> their<00:02:21.160> car<00:02:21.370> license

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
because when they get their car license

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.670 
because when they get their car license
nobody's<00:02:22.330> training<00:02:22.600> them<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:22.870> look<00:02:23.350> for<00:02:23.530> more

with them a few years ago if you crash
your<00:04:50.830> bike<00:04:51.069> there<00:04:51.280> will<00:04:51.520> go<00:04:51.669> out<00:04:51.819> and<00:04:52.330> off

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
your bike there will go out and off

the bike up for you and do they work
well<00:04:55.300> here<00:04:55.509> it<00:04:55.870> only<00:04:55.990> works<00:04:56.259> in<00:04:56.409> one<00:04:56.530> scenario

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
well here it only works in one scenario

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.640 
well here it only works in one scenario
right<00:04:57.460> right<00:04:58.150> that's<00:04:58.419> still<00:04:58.750> a<00:04:58.780> scenario<00:04:59.440> is<00:04:59.620> a

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
right right that's still a scenario is a

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.490 
right right that's still a scenario is a
good<00:05:00.039> idea<00:05:00.180> but<00:05:01.180> a<00:05:01.240> bike<00:05:01.810> like<00:05:01.990> that<00:05:02.050> are<00:05:02.349> there

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
good idea but a bike like that are there

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.070 
good idea but a bike like that are there
advanced<00:05:03.039> and<00:05:03.310> intermediate<00:05:03.810> like<00:05:04.810> big

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
advanced and intermediate like big

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.450 
advanced and intermediate like big
cruiser<00:05:05.349> bikes<00:05:05.620> if<00:05:05.830> you're<00:05:05.919> going<00:05:06.039> on<00:05:06.190> trips

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
cruiser bikes if you're going on trips

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.100 
cruiser bikes if you're going on trips
and<00:05:06.639> stuff<00:05:06.849> and<00:05:07.000> fatter<00:05:07.180> yeah<00:05:07.449> it<00:05:07.960> all

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
and stuff and fatter yeah it all

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.779 
and stuff and fatter yeah it all
basically<00:05:08.680> comes<00:05:09.130> down<00:05:09.220> to<00:05:09.460> engine

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
basically comes down to engine

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.149 
basically comes down to engine
displacement<00:05:10.030> if<00:05:10.569> you<00:05:10.990> have<00:05:11.139> a<00:05:11.169> larger<00:05:11.650> engine

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:12.159 
displacement if you have a larger engine

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:14.249 
displacement if you have a larger engine
how<00:05:12.580> it<00:05:12.729> works<00:05:12.909> if<00:05:13.180> you<00:05:13.270> made<00:05:13.419> a<00:05:13.449> whoops<00:05:13.810> with<00:05:14.229> a

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:14.259 
how it works if you made a whoops with a

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:16.770 
how it works if you made a whoops with a
big<00:05:14.770> engine<00:05:14.979> it's<00:05:15.669> a<00:05:15.699> big<00:05:15.849> whoops<00:05:16.090> if<00:05:16.479> you<00:05:16.630> make

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
big engine it's a big whoops if you make

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.300 
big engine it's a big whoops if you make
a<00:05:16.810> whoops<00:05:17.229> or<00:05:17.469> mistake<00:05:17.800> with<00:05:17.949> a<00:05:17.979> smaller

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
a whoops or mistake with a smaller

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.279 
a whoops or mistake with a smaller
engine<00:05:18.699> it's<00:05:18.909> therefore<00:05:19.120> less<00:05:19.539> whoops<00:05:19.810> nice

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.289 
engine it's therefore less whoops nice

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:21.600 
engine it's therefore less whoops nice
so<00:05:20.500> that's<00:05:20.680> kind<00:05:20.919> of<00:05:20.949> how<00:05:21.069> they<00:05:21.219> decide

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
so that's kind of how they decide

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.790 
so that's kind of how they decide
intermediate<00:05:22.300> beginner<00:05:22.449> okay<00:05:22.960> drivers

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
intermediate beginner okay drivers

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.980 
intermediate beginner okay drivers
whoops<00:05:24.129> factor<00:05:24.639> that's<00:05:25.000> okay<00:05:25.419> look<00:05:25.750> at<00:05:25.870> the

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
whoops factor that's okay look at the

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.559 
whoops factor that's okay look at the
next<00:05:26.169> week<00:05:26.530> here<00:05:27.009> what<00:05:27.400> is<00:05:27.550> this<00:05:27.580> guy<00:05:28.030> that's

are beginner rider you want to maybe
start<00:06:14.590> on<00:06:14.740> something<00:06:14.979> a<00:06:15.310> little<00:06:16.240> bit<00:06:16.449> vague

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
start on something a little bit vague

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.649 
start on something a little bit vague
less<00:06:17.319> advanced<00:06:17.710> they<00:06:17.919> have<00:06:18.130> that<00:06:18.400> bike<00:06:18.729> detune

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:19.659 
less advanced they have that bike detune

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:22.680 
less advanced they have that bike detune
