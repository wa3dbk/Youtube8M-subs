it is yeah look at on the the chemistry
I<00:05:46.320> love<00:05:46.650> that<00:05:46.860> gothic<00:05:47.310> moment<00:05:47.670> where<00:05:47.880> science

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
I love that gothic moment where science

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.840 
I love that gothic moment where science
is<00:05:48.780> kind<00:05:49.170> of<00:05:49.260> advancing<00:05:49.770> faster<00:05:50.220> than<00:05:50.400> people

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
is kind of advancing faster than people

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.420 
is kind of advancing faster than people
can<00:05:51.300> understand<00:05:51.840> yeah<00:05:52.050> these<00:05:52.680> fears<00:05:53.160> about

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
can understand yeah these fears about

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.010 
can understand yeah these fears about
chemistry<00:05:53.760> and<00:05:53.910> being<00:05:54.240> able<00:05:54.330> to<00:05:54.540> alter<00:05:54.720> you

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
chemistry and being able to alter you

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.200 
chemistry and being able to alter you
beyond<00:05:55.290> recognition<00:05:55.650> or<00:05:56.100> beyond<00:05:56.430> like<00:05:56.820> the

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
beyond recognition or beyond like the

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.000 
beyond recognition or beyond like the

could make allusions to it people

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.820 
could make allusions to it people
internalize<00:06:17.940> it<00:06:17.970> and<00:06:18.270> it<00:06:18.900> influences<00:06:19.680> their

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
one of my favorite characters in all of

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.990 
one of my favorite characters in all of
literature<00:06:31.710> which<00:06:32.370> is<00:06:32.490> probably<00:06:32.790> a<00:06:32.850> weird

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 
literature which is probably a weird

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.490 
literature which is probably a weird
thing<00:06:33.120> to<00:06:33.270> say<00:06:33.450> they<00:06:33.690> made<00:06:33.810> us<00:06:33.930> read<00:06:34.080> this<00:06:34.260> for

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
thing to say they made us read this for

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.920 
thing to say they made us read this for
our<00:06:34.560> first<00:06:34.919> year<00:06:35.070> obviously<00:06:35.730> for<00:06:35.940> context

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
our first year obviously for context

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.170 
our first year obviously for context
read<00:06:37.080> lots<00:06:37.800> and<00:06:38.039> lots<00:06:38.160> of<00:06:38.250> bits<00:06:38.490> from<00:06:38.850> it<00:06:39.000> but

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
read lots and lots of bits from it but

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.700 
read lots and lots of bits from it but
because<00:06:39.270> of<00:06:39.419> that<00:06:39.570> I<00:06:39.660> don't<00:06:39.780> feel<00:06:40.259> like<00:06:40.410> I<00:06:40.500> have

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
because of that I don't feel like I have

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.350 
because of that I don't feel like I have
any<00:06:40.949> understanding<00:06:41.370> of<00:06:41.880> the<00:06:42.060> kind<00:06:42.210> of<00:06:42.270> the

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
any understanding of the kind of the

any understanding of the kind of the
full-text<00:06:42.930> I<00:06:43.199> mean<00:06:43.380> it's<00:06:43.650> been<00:06:43.830> like<00:06:43.860> eight

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.130 
full-text I mean it's been like eight

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.370 
full-text I mean it's been like eight
years<00:06:44.460> think<00:06:44.970> I<00:06:45.030> could<00:06:45.180> do<00:06:45.300> with<00:06:45.449> a<00:06:45.479> reread<00:06:45.900> the

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 
years think I could do with a reread the

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.400 
years think I could do with a reread the

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.490 
most difficult thing to say for a Dutch

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.370 
most difficult thing to say for a Dutch
person<00:06:50.699> this<00:06:51.180> is<00:06:51.240> why<00:06:51.509> pop<00:06:51.690> lipstick<00:06:52.020> fiction

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:52.380 
person this is why pop lipstick fiction

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.370 
person this is why pop lipstick fiction
course<00:06:52.650> I<00:06:52.949> read<00:06:53.400> half<00:06:54.000> of<00:06:54.300> it<00:06:54.449> probably<00:06:54.690> and

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 
course I read half of it probably and

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.510 
course I read half of it probably and
remember<00:06:55.620> talking<00:06:55.889> about<00:06:56.039> it<00:06:56.130> and<00:06:56.220> like<00:06:56.340> being

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 
remember talking about it and like being

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.310 
remember talking about it and like being
super<00:06:56.850> intrigued<00:06:57.090> as<00:06:57.509> it<00:06:57.750> says<00:06:57.930> the<00:06:58.080> Drowned

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:58.320 
super intrigued as it says the Drowned

super intrigued as it says the Drowned
world<00:06:58.650> I<00:06:58.919> think<00:06:59.160> is<00:06:59.280> just<00:06:59.460> about<00:06:59.639> like<00:06:59.789> a

00:06:59.810 --> 00:06:59.820 
world I think is just about like a

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.580 
world I think is just about like a
massive<00:07:00.300> flood<00:07:00.630> that's<00:07:00.960> happened<00:07:01.320> I<00:07:01.380> think<00:07:01.500> it

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
massive flood that's happened I think it

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.260 
massive flood that's happened I think it
takes<00:07:01.740> ice<00:07:01.919> in<00:07:02.070> London<00:07:02.430> I<00:07:02.580> remember<00:07:03.030> something

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.270 
takes ice in London I remember something

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.570 
takes ice in London I remember something
about<00:07:03.509> them<00:07:04.020> going<00:07:04.229> into<00:07:04.470> like<00:07:04.710> a<00:07:04.740> museum<00:07:05.340> and

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 
about them going into like a museum and

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.310 
about them going into like a museum and
stealing<00:07:06.060> art<00:07:06.330> and<00:07:06.600> there's<00:07:06.750> like<00:07:06.870> cool

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:07.320 
stealing art and there's like cool

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.020

pirates<00:07:08.070> and<00:07:08.430> we<00:07:08.520> had<00:07:08.610> a<00:07:08.639> whole<00:07:08.789> discussion

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:09.030 
pirates and we had a whole discussion

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.029 
pirates and we had a whole discussion
about<00:07:09.360> one<00:07:09.810> of<00:07:09.900> the<00:07:09.990> characters<00:07:10.500> wanting<00:07:10.919> to

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 
about one of the characters wanting to

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:13.100 
about one of the characters wanting to
become<00:07:11.370> the<00:07:11.550> new<00:07:11.729> Adam<00:07:12.210> like<00:07:12.570> the<00:07:12.690> only<00:07:12.810> person

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:13.110 
become the new Adam like the only person

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.110 
become the new Adam like the only person
to<00:07:13.440> survive<00:07:13.770> and<00:07:14.220> like<00:07:14.310> start<00:07:14.699> a<00:07:14.759> new<00:07:14.880> world

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 
to survive and like start a new world

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.689 
to survive and like start a new world
and<00:07:15.599> I<00:07:15.660> think<00:07:15.720> it's<00:07:15.960> a<00:07:16.080> bit<00:07:16.229> crazy<00:07:16.740> as<00:07:17.220> well<00:07:17.430> I

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:17.699 
and I think it's a bit crazy as well I
