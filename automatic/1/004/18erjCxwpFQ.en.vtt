 There were settings without fat and the topic of this 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.600

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.200
 cover i don't like paperback books 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.350
 but it’s convenient to carry with you 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.230
 so heavy here so it looks here 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.540

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.250
