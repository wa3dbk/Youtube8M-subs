00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
interesting and important case sort of

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.830 
interesting and important case sort of
on<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.600> legal<00:00:42.899> end<00:00:43.260> because<00:00:43.710> we<00:00:43.860> know<00:00:44.010> that

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
on the legal end because we know that

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.029 
on the legal end because we know that
the<00:00:45.840> Department<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.440> Child<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:46.950> Family

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
the Department of Child and Family

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.250 
the Department of Child and Family
Services<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.920> CPS<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.780> the<00:00:51.780> medical

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
Services and CPS and the medical

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.779 
Services and CPS and the medical
professional<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.039> they<00:00:53.190> do<00:00:53.250> kind<00:00:53.670> of

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
professional so they do kind of

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.459 
professional so they do kind of
overstepped<00:00:54.149> their<00:00:54.570> boundaries<00:00:55.079> sometimes

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
overstepped their boundaries sometimes

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.520 
overstepped their boundaries sometimes
and<00:00:56.690> sometimes<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.989> think<00:00:58.050> when<00:00:58.260> they<00:00:58.350> make

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
and sometimes I think when they make

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.819 
and sometimes I think when they make
mistakes<00:00:58.850> they<00:00:59.850> would<00:01:00.030> rather<00:01:00.180> continue<00:01:00.829> with

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
mistakes they would rather continue with

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.460 
mistakes they would rather continue with
the<00:01:02.010> mistake<00:01:02.399> even<00:01:03.359> at<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.629> expense<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
the mistake even at the expense of the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.230 
the mistake even at the expense of the
well-being<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.280> people<00:01:05.820> who<00:01:06.090> are<00:01:06.150> on<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
well-being of the people who are on the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.359 
well-being of the people who are on the
receiving<00:01:06.450> end<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.229> rather<00:01:07.920> than<00:01:08.159> admit

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
receiving end of it rather than admit

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.640 
receiving end of it rather than admit
that<00:01:08.670> they've<00:01:08.790> made<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.000> mistake<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:10.110> happens

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
that they've made a mistake it happens

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.880 
that they've made a mistake it happens
and<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.430> huge<00:01:11.700> injustice<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.890> many

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
and it's a huge injustice and many

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.830 
and it's a huge injustice and many
families<00:01:14.369> have<00:01:14.400> suffered<00:01:14.850> because<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.659> this

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
families have suffered because of this

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.450 
families have suffered because of this
so<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> very<00:01:16.439> interesting<00:01:16.950> case<00:01:17.189> and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
so this is a very interesting case and

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.390 
so this is a very interesting case and
you'll<00:01:17.580> see<00:01:17.729> why<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.780> she<00:01:18.840> went<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.680> Boston

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
you'll see why so she went to Boston

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.370 
you'll see why so she went to Boston
Children's<00:01:20.549> Hospital<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.420> when<00:01:22.110> she<00:01:22.140> got

reunification plan made by a DCF and

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.900

heading home it can't happen soon enough

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.440 
heading home it can't happen soon enough
and<00:05:26.660> I<00:05:27.660> just<00:05:28.080> think<00:05:28.860> that<00:05:28.950> this<00:05:29.250> is<00:05:29.310> a<00:05:29.790> good

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
and I just think that this is a good

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.630 
and I just think that this is a good
example<00:05:30.570> of<00:05:31.080> how<00:05:31.290> a<00:05:34.010> people<00:05:35.010> in<00:05:35.100> positions<00:05:35.280> of

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
example of how a people in positions of

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.850 
example of how a people in positions of
power<00:05:36.110> tend<00:05:37.110> to<00:05:37.200> get<00:05:37.290> a<00:05:37.350> god<00:05:37.590> complex

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
power tend to get a god complex

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.790 
power tend to get a god complex
sometimes<00:05:38.580> and<00:05:38.820> abuse<00:05:39.120> their<00:05:39.270> power<00:05:39.530> but<00:05:40.530> that

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
sometimes and abuse their power but that

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.590 
sometimes and abuse their power but that
