stitches<00:01:47.159> off<00:01:47.689> you're<00:01:48.689> just<00:01:48.900> going<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.290> turn

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
stitches off you're just going to turn

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.940 
stitches off you're just going to turn
the<00:01:49.680> work<00:01:49.860> around<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.630> start<00:01:51.630> knitting<00:01:51.869> back

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.410 

now<00:01:55.950> it's<00:01:56.189> possible<00:01:56.460> when<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.119> start

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
now it's possible when you start

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.030 
now it's possible when you start
knitting<00:01:57.659> back<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.290> you'll<00:01:58.439> find<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.890> all

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
knitting back that you'll find that all

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
your stitches are on backwards so you

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.109 
your stitches are on backwards so you
know<00:02:01.830> what<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.130> do<00:02:02.280> when<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.520> stitch<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.970> on

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
know what to do when a stitch is on

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.660 
know what to do when a stitch is on
backwards<00:02:03.439> you<00:02:04.439> just<00:02:04.710> knit<00:02:04.950> through<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.520> back

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
backwards you just knit through the back

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.449 
backwards you just knit through the back
of<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:07.099> that<00:02:08.099> twists<00:02:08.549> it<00:02:08.670> back<00:02:08.909> around

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.130 

so<00:02:11.969> you<00:02:12.030> just<00:02:12.359> continue<00:02:13.019> knitting<00:02:13.349> again<00:02:15.140> for

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
so you just continue knitting again for

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.970 
so you just continue knitting again for
as<00:02:16.260> long<00:02:16.560> as<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:17.099> want<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.519> and<00:02:18.409> then<00:02:19.409> bind<00:02:19.709> off

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
as long as you want to and then bind off

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.000 
as long as you want to and then bind off
again<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.959> hope<00:02:21.959> you<00:02:22.170> haven't<00:02:22.500> made<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.799> same

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
again and hope you haven't made the same

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:32.400 
again and hope you haven't made the same
mistake<00:02:23.400> twice

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.470
