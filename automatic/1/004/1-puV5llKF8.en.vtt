00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.650
 hi everyone is to be drafted 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.589
 by arranging small pipes 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:10.590
 so before I start I have to you 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.679
 thank for the 25 subscribers so I 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.660
 want to say that I will make a video 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:20.760
 special 30 subscribers it's still 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.740
 it's not nothing I think so after what 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.750
 other baths after I passed 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.519
 youtube partners with a network 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.439
 finally I spent partners with Anne 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.850
 edwards rather so so I'm 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.620
 partner with them 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.020
 so I have the features of a 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.360
 partner and youtube so that I want 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.129
 to tell you that the back round 2 is going 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.000
 soon to arrive 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:46.320
 a superb chrome so it's good 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.329
 now we will start the video 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.890
 I think then as you have seen 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:55.949
 in the title it's a way of 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.730
 protect a village in minecraft on 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:03.090
 the servers and / or bp if you hold if 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.840
 you are people at risk because 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.110
 frankly the pdp a server pvp c1 which 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.909
 in an opci cube surrounded by water so 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.890
 that's when she's on the servers 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.939
 harper is a small village like that 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.729
 it's all cute all that 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:26.220
 little community here is the ball 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.720
 black bonus chest so that's it then I 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.189
 let me go there you can do it from 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.140
 any size your wall 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:36.890
 you have your morale I shut up 2.6 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.780
 of height I believe so small is 6 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:45.119
 in two thin layers to m you go 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.820
 see up light I'm starting to make a 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:54.210
 little wall of three like that hop 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.530
 there I add a balcony of 2 I like 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.600
 the technical bear because I find that 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.340
 for harper locks it makes rather 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.820
 not bad during the little wars all 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:08.399
 that's all 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:13.560
 I like it a lot after after 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:16.530
 you take your repeaters flagship is happening 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.510
 here pebbles but also repeaters 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.550
 Repeater buttons are off 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:26.070
 I still prefer that these are 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.930
 put in the course of which they do not work 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:34.770
 here you put the hat sounds like 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:36.440
 that after you start doing not 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.980
 it 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:45.920
 so all expected to have a 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:48.130
 prophet so are your reliait the 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:55.930
 one-button system 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:03:00.310
 here are the powerful overpowered after 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:07.780
 do you do a kind of small 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:07.780
 of protection like that tak tak 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:16.900
 after you make a small major 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.900
 basins his mother 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:35.900
 excuse me for the little hollow up 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:42.250
 you place the dish in the middle so 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.250
 that's after the holidays like this after 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:51.750
 what if not after that will put in 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:55.940
 everywhere must therefore it's a pity that we 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.940
 have small drops but if there I am 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:04.580
 so after there in place of five meters 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.580
 distributors 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.820
 you put arrows in and so 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:22.350
 you will see the fence will make a 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:25.310
 curtain so must with this curtain of 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:28.340
 the avs to the barriers are passable 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.690
 so I think I broke 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:35.250
 yeah well yeah finally I'm a creative 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.920
 whatever if people try to get in 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.340
 they will not be able to offered at the limit 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.340
 like that 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:46.019
 even in fact no 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:55.220
 also I have more than I say there it makes a 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.450
 little rhinolophe like that so I 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.950
 did it unless you did not 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:03.440
 roof with a smell father in Berre 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.660
 two seconds we are here yes otherwise I 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:12.310
 believe that creatures can not be 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:17.060
 use no so wait up 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:20.060
 I was pissed off in sport but 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:23.540
 really I think you do not know how 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.940
 walking another of pins so during 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.830
 the war and all that and there you put 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.110
 arrows to activated all this fact 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.680
 the flaming arrows what your your 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:36.740
 wall are impenetrable normally 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:39.380
 so the TNT has no effect here it's 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.240
 claim the purge will have an effect will have 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:47.090
 no effect either it is against 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:49.690
 if it's not protected will be an effect so 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.690
 a loan 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.110
 so that's after it takes time to 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:58.020
 go down in fact if you do not want to 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:01.290
 cover the repeaters of a better 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:06.150
 anything the pistons commit a 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:09.510
 block but I have faith here it is blocking 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:12.150
 like that but if we pay you tried to 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.790
 to hide all that through arts or 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.740
 things like that it's you who see 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.830
 and I really like this technique 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.180
 on the rp server as there is a small 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.740
 community of villages to the east 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.590
 chips that knew without blades system of 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.090
 defense so after people who are 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:33.980
 in front of there you make other systems 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:35.990
 with big holes oups well here 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:41.130
 so I find it rather nice 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:43.710
 so here I want to tell you that I 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.090
 am going to do several but maybe but 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.210
 next three or four videos 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:51.300
 finally but in any case some 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:54.060
 next videos will be tutorials so 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.500
 here I am good I want to tell you 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:07:00.300
 thanks again for good sakho farms 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:03.090
 and it's super nice continue as 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.430
 crucial like that what so to all those 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.210
 who are not subscribers do not hesitate to 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.920
 leave a little thumb to a 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.260
 comment it's you who see you 

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.330

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:15.170
