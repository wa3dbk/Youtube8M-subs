heated<00:02:09.899> up<00:02:10.020> PVC<00:02:10.530> right<00:02:10.739> here<00:02:10.890> and

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
heated up PVC right here and

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.400 
heated up PVC right here and
just<00:02:12.010> welded<00:02:12.970> it<00:02:13.060> here<00:02:13.480> but<00:02:13.870> not<00:02:14.020> little<00:02:14.230> bit

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
just welded it here but not little bit

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.640 
just welded it here but not little bit
melted<00:02:14.740> it<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.190> just<00:02:16.180> had<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.450> form<00:02:16.720> today

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
melted it and just had it form today

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.550 
melted it and just had it form today
angle<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.100> wanted<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:18.700> I<00:02:18.959> put<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.020> camera<00:02:20.410> up

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
angle I wanted and I put the camera up

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.530 
angle I wanted and I put the camera up
here<00:02:20.980> and<00:02:21.190> test<00:02:21.550> it<00:02:21.670> out<00:02:21.790> if<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:22.120> wasn't<00:02:22.420> the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
here and test it out if it wasn't the

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.900 
here and test it out if it wasn't the
right<00:02:22.660> angle<00:02:23.020> then<00:02:23.650> I'd<00:02:23.920> get<00:02:24.100> back<00:02:24.310> I'd<00:02:24.550> melted

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
right angle then I'd get back I'd melted

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.340 
right angle then I'd get back I'd melted
again<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.780> do<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.830> same<00:02:26.980> thing<00:02:27.160> so<00:02:28.350> it's

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
again and do the same thing so it's

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.340 
again and do the same thing so it's
pretty<00:02:29.500> much<00:02:29.680> it<00:02:29.920> um<00:02:30.720> what<00:02:31.720> I<00:02:31.750> recommend<00:02:32.110> doing

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
pretty much it um what I recommend doing

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.630 
pretty much it um what I recommend doing
is<00:02:32.590> when<00:02:32.740> you're<00:02:32.830> putting<00:02:33.010> it<00:02:33.160> together<00:02:33.280> don't

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
is when you're putting it together don't

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.990 
is when you're putting it together don't
submit<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.150> PVC<00:02:34.600> yet<00:02:34.870> just<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:36.640> know<00:02:36.730> put

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
submit the PVC yet just you know put

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.820 
submit the PVC yet just you know put
some<00:02:37.300> markings<00:02:37.840> for<00:02:38.050> whatever<00:02:38.350> you're<00:02:38.530> doing

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
and if it turns up so that's where

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.740 
and if it turns up so that's where
that's<00:02:41.830> what<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.069> want<00:02:42.280> then<00:02:42.520> submit<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.510> down

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750

want to do is I want to put a elbow
joint<00:02:52.000> up<00:02:52.239> here<00:02:52.600> and<00:02:52.870> I<00:02:52.989> want<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.230> melt<00:02:53.410> it<00:02:53.680> you

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
joint up here and I want to melt it you

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.310 
joint up here and I want to melt it you
cut<00:02:54.700> this<00:02:54.820> part<00:02:55.000> off<00:02:55.239> and<00:02:55.269> it<00:02:55.510> puts<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.840> these

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
cut this part off and it puts the these

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.320 
cut this part off and it puts the these
parts<00:02:56.650> together<00:02:56.769> with<00:02:57.070> the<00:02:57.220> elbow<00:02:57.459> joint<00:02:57.519> and

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
parts together with the elbow joint and

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.360 
parts together with the elbow joint and
then<00:02:58.360> melt<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.810> joint<00:02:59.170> and<00:02:59.500> move<00:02:59.890> it<00:03:00.130> to<00:03:00.160> the

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
then melt the joint and move it to the

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.460 
then melt the joint and move it to the
right<00:03:00.400> angle<00:03:00.880> so<00:03:01.150> that<00:03:01.390> way<00:03:01.690> i<00:03:01.720> can<00:03:01.959> just<00:03:02.230> take

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
right angle so that way i can just take

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.910 
right angle so that way i can just take
the<00:03:02.580> joint<00:03:03.580> apart<00:03:03.880> this<00:03:04.570> part<00:03:04.810> off<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.019> then

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
the joint apart this part off and then

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.440 
the joint apart this part off and then
just<00:03:05.950> slide<00:03:06.340> it<00:03:06.519> out<00:03:06.580> of<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.790> vest<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.330> that

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
just slide it out of the vest and that

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.060 
just slide it out of the vest and that
way<00:03:07.570> i<00:03:07.600> can<00:03:07.690> take<00:03:07.989> it<00:03:08.080> off<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:08.230> on<00:03:08.530> pretty

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
way i can take it off and on pretty

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.100 
way i can take it off and on pretty
easily<00:03:09.220> because<00:03:10.090> sometimes<00:03:10.630> I<00:03:10.870> just<00:03:10.930> don't

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
easily because sometimes I just don't

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.380 
easily because sometimes I just don't
want<00:03:11.350> have<00:03:11.440> to<00:03:11.560> deal<00:03:11.739> with<00:03:11.950> my<00:03:12.850> third<00:03:13.209> arm

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
sticking out from my bag because it does

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.390 
sticking out from my bag because it does
in<00:03:16.750> cqb<00:03:17.260> does<00:03:17.680> tend<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:17.950> get<00:03:18.070> in<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.220> way<00:03:18.370> a

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
in cqb does tend to get in the way a

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.420 
in cqb does tend to get in the way a
little<00:03:18.610> bit<00:03:18.730> but<00:03:19.690> uh<00:03:19.750> it's<00:03:20.230> an<00:03:20.440> awesome<00:03:20.560> angle

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
little bit but uh it's an awesome angle

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.880 
little bit but uh it's an awesome angle
for<00:03:21.700> some<00:03:22.000> footage<00:03:22.299> I<00:03:22.630> want<00:03:23.320> to<00:03:23.350> give<00:03:23.470> credit

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
for some footage I want to give credit

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.640 
for some footage I want to give credit
to<00:03:23.920> where<00:03:24.670> I<00:03:24.700> got<00:03:24.940> this<00:03:25.030> idea<00:03:25.209> from

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
to where I got this idea from

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.780 
to where I got this idea from
corridordigital<00:03:26.650> and<00:03:27.340> their<00:03:27.519> video

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
corridordigital and their video

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.910 
corridordigital and their video
mini-boss<00:03:28.329> they<00:03:29.170> use<00:03:29.350> the<00:03:29.560> third<00:03:29.739> person

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
mini-boss they use the third person

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.560 
mini-boss they use the third person
camera<00:03:30.100> rig<00:03:30.549> and<00:03:30.850> I<00:03:31.060> thought<00:03:31.209> it'd<00:03:31.360> be<00:03:31.450> awesome

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
camera rig and I thought it'd be awesome

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.199 
camera rig and I thought it'd be awesome
used<00:03:31.959> for<00:03:32.110> airsoft<00:03:32.470> I<00:03:32.829> got<00:03:33.250> to<00:03:33.370> use<00:03:33.549> I<00:03:33.760> got<00:03:34.030> the

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
used for airsoft I got to use I got the

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.979 
used for airsoft I got to use I got the
idea<00:03:34.570> to<00:03:34.630> use<00:03:34.840> PVC<00:03:35.200> from<00:03:36.450> think<00:03:37.450> it<00:03:37.570> was<00:03:37.660> their

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
idea to use PVC from think it was their

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.770 
idea to use PVC from think it was their
video<00:03:38.260> laser<00:03:38.620> Academy<00:03:39.220> I<00:03:39.430> saw<00:03:40.150> a<00:03:40.180> piece<00:03:40.480> of<00:03:40.510> PVC

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
video laser Academy I saw a piece of PVC

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.840 
video laser Academy I saw a piece of PVC
sticking<00:03:41.440> out<00:03:41.560> of<00:03:41.709> one<00:03:41.739> of<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.070> guys<00:03:42.160> backs<00:03:42.519> I

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
sticking out of one of the guys backs I

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.660 
sticking out of one of the guys backs I
thought<00:03:43.090> that<00:03:43.840> would<00:03:43.930> be<00:03:44.019> a<00:03:44.140> good<00:03:45.130> material<00:03:45.610> to

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
thought that would be a good material to

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.280 
thought that would be a good material to
use<00:03:45.760> if<00:03:46.600> you're<00:03:46.780> looking<00:03:47.019> for<00:03:47.049> something
