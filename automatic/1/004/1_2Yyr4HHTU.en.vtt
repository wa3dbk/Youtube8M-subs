00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
 and well first of all hello and 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.600
 welcome on the negative 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.429
 today we find ourselves for the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.990
 introductory video that is to say that 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.519
 this video is actually going to 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.259
 explain the content you are 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.120
 likely to find on this string 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.619
 so for the new ones wishes you 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.180
 first of all welcome and I told him 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.369
 then present you the contents of the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.980
 chain firstly the chain splits 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.420
 in three major parts the first this 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.830
 will be the card games so you 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.810
 will find mainly magic 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.510
 karting which is surely one of the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.489
 best card games good after I get 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.770
 say nothing I do not criticize everyone his 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.690
 notice for better cengic then you 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.079
 will find shameful if I can 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.899
 to permit 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.300
 yu-gi-oh and canvas 3 world of warcraft 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.010
 that there is a little forgotten but that remains 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.440
 still an excellent game then 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.809
 second sweat axis that would be what 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.660
 rare or nonexistent but we do not know 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.640
 never it will be jdr that is to say that 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.410
 we risk making videos so 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.600
 son telling us about myself as well 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.190
 than the other members of the team so 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.570
 we risk making videos on the 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.629
 jdr so how to assemble his character 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.470
 who is actually quoting woman 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.780
 filmed the painting and and that's after 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.900
 third axis that may be a little 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.810
 the funniest it will be the video games 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.909
 So while but I might 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.369
 just do some tutorials on 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.869
 the blunders and john could not and I do not 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.750
 do not know at all the opinion of others 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.740
 players so I put it then moved on to 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.520
 December because it's Christmas 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.770
 do europe 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.780
 no it was ridiculous but past the month 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.729
 December 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.860
 so I risk doing videos on 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.270
 3ds that may be much better 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.329
 young man gives particular with a 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.479
 pokemon x or pokemon y so that remains 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.909
 that to be pretty pokemon fun is not 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.470
 a gamer game I want to clarify what 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.049
 I can already see you your last screen 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.659
 but hey it's an introductory video 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.030
 I think I'll get you from the TV movie 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.750
 simply the most simply 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.070
 possible 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.369
 what else can I tell you 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.090
 just go see the chain 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.500
 ratification was already on the scale 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.020
 so without anything to go see her second 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.430
 times go see the other videos for 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.840
 give you a country emptied of what fair 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.069
 from ncr 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.799
 then make you want to stay 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.389
 and especially comment on videos it's this 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.010
 which may actually make China 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:16.629
 is alive and so much so 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.069
 more interesting for you as well as 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.109
 for the same hamel and for the others 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.400
 members this was it's water 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:23.400
 bitterness and I tell you no more
