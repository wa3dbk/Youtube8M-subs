00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:15.210
 good morning Good afternoon Good night 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.949
 today is games day in cushion 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.750
 but it 's not the super mario kart of super 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.480
 nintendo is the last mario kart that 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.480
 I am missing to my collection so I'll 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.789
 show all that I have good 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.710
 are seven games in the series until today is a 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.710
 series that marked my childhood and 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.540
 adolescence especially the conversion 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.680
 of nintendo 64 with multiplayer for up to 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.120
 four players 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.770
 the director on the console is much more 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.960
 fun than playing online 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.700
 you who are in the online age can speak 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.739
 No, but it's much more fun to play. 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.660
 four at the same time at the same location 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.870
 going by finally making a 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.949
 campeonatinho it was a lot of fun is 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.289
 that the first first step of 1993 of the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.359
 super nintendo the art of leading the 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.340
 Handmade drawing was not like 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.290
 all together later I really liked 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.510
 technician that most games were 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.659
 so with handmade art 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.210
 only that the national edition made by 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:17.189
 playtronic that the company that inhabited 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:20.670
 nintendo in brazil is since 1993 was a 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.610
 company that for those who do not know was a 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.439
 a partnership between the star manufacturer 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.310
 of toys and the gradient manufacturers 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.340
 electronics 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.320
 then she left with her grade 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.110
 entertainment 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.930
 This one is super mario, sorry Mario. 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.640
 curious kart r that before was super Mario 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.530
 cardi later thick with mario kart 64 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.329
 which for a time was then called 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.729
 mario kart is and sometimes called may 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.310
 cardin and until today because the previews 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.040
 champion in the magazines were mario kart is 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:58.110
 brand thierry dol this is what i bought 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:01.060
 then the old man still never 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.130
 until it is well maintained 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.090
 so it was the first that allowed four 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.340
 players 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.349
 This was a revolution at the time. 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.290
 thought multi tepco was direct in the 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.880
 Fun island, have you started? 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.620
 even those mini turbos also that 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.690
 some people know do not 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.489
 know that there is but I am champion in the 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.360
 mini turbo is the one you do with the 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:24.099
 r button and a ve appears on the track all 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.380
 the following mario kart will have 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.000
 that 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.519
 then we had the third mario kart 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.200
 that was mario kart super circuit of the game 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:37.150
 boy advance he came back with those 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.970
 charts world style notes monti 7 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.650
 for who in what he calls the super 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.080
 nintendo were no longer people 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.660
 polygonal in the final is the ability of the 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.830
 game may not be more or less there 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.180
 for the super nintendo falcon 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.310
 presentation consoles 32 bit section 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.890
 like most of the others who 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.030
 I have 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.019
 then we had the mario kart double 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.310
 dash 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:05.980
 The great news here was that you had two 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.970
 pilots by car the person who in the ride 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.620
 is who was in charge of playing the items 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.120
 we in the rivals will be enough 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.040
 interesting you could even 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.329
 push a button to switch between 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.100
 driver in the middle of the race I have 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.690
 interest in making a commented gameplay 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.329
 of this video mário gatti that I like 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.950
 even though you still prefer the version of 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.170
 nintendo 64 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.280
 only in lady soul black label on that 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.920
 yellow stripe 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.160
 not that I care that much more 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.160
 there 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.230
 then we had the mario kart ds ea 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.030
 His novelty was then game playgol 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.200
 online multiplayer 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.580
 but it's something I do not use because 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.470
 it requires you to have a router 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:57.739
 configured for security wpp 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.900
 encryption is from pt and this is very 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.239
 outdated and very unsafe today in 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.349
 day we use bpa wpa2 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:08.420
 when I bought it down to it I saw that 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:11.120
 Supported wpa2 I thought I could play 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.780
 mario kart ds online but not the game 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.500
 still asking then wfp nonsense 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.720
 is so much a matter of playing online so 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.810
 now the star of our last boxing 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.449
 Mario kart that I bought was Mario 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.100
 kart wii 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:30.320
 I bought in the damn games that glue 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:35.990
 stickers in the game packaging with the 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:39.010
 This is a positive time and we go there a lot. 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.010
 I can not open it tight 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:46.479
 so 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:49.509
 the famous the steering wheel that neither cause 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.249
 we took a little yes but afraid of 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:53.259
 Even serious shocking has to be a 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:56.229
 control I do not really like the damage 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:58.269
 the steering wheel is not here the game itself 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:01.419
 I always find this turned out to be really tart 

00:04:58.269 --> 00:05:07.809
 You find no thousand left. 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:11.279
 so here then open to see let's go 

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:11.279
 that is easy 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.620
 so the disc was not there yet 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.880
 colorful nintendo disks in 2008 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.880
 collect was released 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:51.739
 here neither the field code nor time and the 

00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:54.469
 manual itself as usual in Spanish 

00:05:51.739 --> 00:05:56.599
 French and English in color 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:59.389
 something that is getting more and more 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:01.759
 hard to find one day and last 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:04.249
 Clear 7 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:06.139
 the seventh launch of the Mario series 

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:09.679
 kart when they announced that it was going to be a 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:11.509
 score of 7 win only 7 is possible 

00:06:09.679 --> 00:06:13.610
 revert more marked there but not 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:17.589
 It really is only seven mario kart 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:19.999
 there were also two versions à afp rama 

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:22.579
 two archers is not to score here 

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:24.589
 I have 1 and 2 but good games that I never 

00:06:22.579 --> 00:06:25.219
 I played at last are not console games 

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:27.349
 table 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:31.550
 there is a game to play 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:34.519
 I also score at home, but that 's good. 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:37.869
 piracy is personal that's it 

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:37.869
 a hug to all thank you
