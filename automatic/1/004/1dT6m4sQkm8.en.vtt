00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:07.100
 hi friends today we are going to learn how to make 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.680
 a recycling zipper container 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:13.460
 plastic bottles the materials are 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:16.570
 two 2 liter plastic bottles 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:20.070
 silicone or hot silicone gun 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:23.010
 zipper and scissors 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.470
 The first thing we are going to do is cut 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.619
 the two bottles at the same height 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.370
 in this case it has to be straight no 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.090
 have to have 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:38.310
 sides round but straight to be able 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.630
 stick the zipper 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.630
 so let's go 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.579
 with the limit of the bottle and remains 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.649
 retro 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.820
 well they are already the two containers have 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:58.040
 that be equal 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.060
 we dry well with a cloth 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.430
 canister liquid 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.250
 and a very important note and the silicone 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.290
 hot do not put it directly on the 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.860
 plastic because you can wrinkle with the 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.480
 heat we will do it directly in the 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.910
 zipper 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.120
 so I'm going to do it that way for 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:23.090
 work better 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.090
 we put silicone and we arrived 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.190
 silicone 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.049
 and we beat unhurriedly 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.890
 we press with our fingers so that 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.890
 adhere well 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.620
 a few seconds we let go and we're going to stick it 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.860
 at the same height 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:15.319
 but let's get closer we open the 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:18.700
 zipper because we will cut the limit 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.700
 let's cut here 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.280
 and now with the scissors 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:51.680
 and we close 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.680
 and we cut 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.750
 the extreme 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.510
 excess 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:12.439
 We are going to stick a silicon droplet 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.439
 here at the end to join the two pieces 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.870
 we push 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.670
 to work better let's open the 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.670
 zipper 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.470
 i 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:43.520
 that way we'll work better 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.520
 and economic 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.750
 that serves us for many things to 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.750
 wear 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.100
 the lunch 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:14.000
 and tightly closed so it does not bother us 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.470
 Well, we already have our packaging 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.140
 wood 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.570
 recycling two bottles if you liked 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:24.730
