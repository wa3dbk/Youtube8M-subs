00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 what minardi girls today are i 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.540
 pencils two kisses of the snow cosmetics there 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.610
 are four colors that have come out 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.800
 just recently and 3 instead 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.440
 they had already gone out before with another 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.690
 collection surely you are interested 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.330
 among new old stones the patents were 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.140
 all of the types of red wine 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.570
 instead now in the new collection 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.240
 some more spring colors have come out 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.260
 summer are practically double pencils 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.670
 aside ie the contour pencil 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.309
 little one on the other there is a morning 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.010
 a little bigger with lipstick so a 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:39.149
 a bit drier as a little texture 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.309
 more creamy as a consistency and in the former 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.719
 three came out of the pencil with the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.370
 lighter slightly lighter 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.500
 compared to the lipstick part will come 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.870
 darker than showing an effect in 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.610
 reality if we kept to the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.530
 directions because the side dish came 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.300
 clear and usually dark inside 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.100
 you know it leaves me a little running 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.670
 i the outside a little lighter inside 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.789
 the price is 8 euros 90 this is 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.339
 masquerade is actually so here 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.409
 similar color that is not noticed 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.820
 difference between the outside inside the 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.619
 pencil or and lipstick 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.710
 this is the second color 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.299
 incognito here the part of the pencil is 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.670
 much clearer you can see hawks 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.380
 here compared to the lipstick part 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.520
 in fact it is better to blend a little 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.759
 resignation because otherwise the effect 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:28.040
 heart type or a light turn is not 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.270
 just fantastic and a pretty color 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.610
 rather brownish so it is not 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.340
 just gave that this third color 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.119
 Conspiracy here too , part of life 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.229
 and not as much as masquerade is 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.140
 slightly lighter but not much 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.630
 you don't notice a lot on the lips though 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.640
 a color that for a while on the violated 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.140
 so this is also a color for 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.020
 all especially not a very color 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.050
 spring the first pencil material 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.880
 of the new collection we have here 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.590
 the opposite with respect to before or 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.330
 we have a darker part of the pencil 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.360
 and the lighter lipstick part in 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.040
 this way we have the classic shadow e 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.870
 on this color I don't mind why 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.550
 as you can see it is not that it is 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.680
 a lot of difference and working a 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.270
 moment the effect is very nice 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.880
 because with us the same is too much 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.400
 clear type exactly salmon page when 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.290
 are very clear that you go almost to 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.850
 confuse me with skin color 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.680
 so don't like a second one 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.300
 have a pencil that is not so much that 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.350
 schools, however, even only to a medium 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.300
 tone a little darker 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.860
 between a bit of contrast and then yes 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.390
 they better notice the lips you pay me for yes 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.010
 then they lose because they are immediately made to 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.380
 stadium in giovanna if you are very dark 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.260
 you don't need this thing here with 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.750
 a pencil like that though if you're like me 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.370
 clear is the risk that the time that 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.840
 I should therefore not be afraid of the fact of 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.260
 have some darker control not 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.310
 I regret this the result compared 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.800
 to the three that I showed before 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.960
 this color does not forgive much 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.130
 lips if you have money here 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.300
 we have a 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:58.250
 the pencil which is a very coral color 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.630
 nice beautiful intense the part of 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.420
 lipstick as you can see is 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.580
 slightly more so it's a little scary 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.070
 we say and here the detachment is noted 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.959
 a lot to me 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.300
 for me it's a bit too strong in color 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.270
 I must say I actually use these two 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.860
 together doing all the lips first 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.630
 with these then adding only one 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.730
 little of this in the middle and color them 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.080
 it gets very nice for i can show 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.940
 in the end how it becomes because there is a limit 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.459
 so used so it doesn't make me crazy 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.260
 because I don't like the song like that 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.570
 intense on the lips so it's a bit 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.590
 too much is too intense and here too 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.340
 let's say the highs compared to the colors 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.340
 reds you notice more 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:43.360
 in the lips or dryness bergen is here 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.130
 then you can see that I really like it 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.030
 more from the pencil because it is 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:51.670
 a species of rosatom flesh-colored inter 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.620
 lipstick is a light brown that is 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.720
 said de rosa but more towards brownish 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.060
 the slices don't really mind me on 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.950
 lips certainly is an effect that more than 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.220
 80s for the collections explains 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.490
 take nanny call 90 years and a little 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.640
 madonna project is that short of u 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.800
 anyway i don't mind the kind of 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.930
 face but I find that it is unique and one 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.510
 ages and 2 is not suitable for all 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.190
 because however it is very difficult to 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.630
 bring there is a large component of 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.390
 viareggio inside as you can see 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:26.080
 and therefore tends a little to turn off the 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:28.060
 face however with a particular mount in 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.590
 actually the contrast when they come together 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.500
 I don't mind two colors though 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.060
 be a larger dose of the pencil and 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.650
 a slightly lower dose of lipstick 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.680
 because it is too light brown lipstick 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.850
 the last power value put that 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.710
 that we are not even on the hand e 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.890
 here too you can see that the experience 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.380
 it's a lot between a pencil and lipstick 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.440
 strong is a bit like the orange one 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.200
 we have a pencil that is a fuchsia 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.230
 more intense cold very beautiful part 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:00.820
 instead of the lipstick is it is very much 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:02.890
 recent hazy then simply used 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.990
 with the outline then the lipstick to 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.910
 center the effect is ugly should be worked 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.220
 a little more what I do 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.020
 contour I work a little inward 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.390
 I put on the lipstick and then I take the 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.910
 pencil and with the pencil I go a little 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.800
 also color these internal parts 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.190
 because otherwise 3 state too not 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.660
 I like it but this effect certainly 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.710
 it must be said that of the four new colors 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.430
 the last two he showed me 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:29.140
 or virgin and we are not colorful 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.430
 power have a less dry effect 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.140
 compared to the first two names did 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.550
 to see that they are curtains take it off a little 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.990
 more lips in my opinion 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.790
 consistency at least some masters 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.530
 I know more and speak a little more 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.060
 the imperfections of the lips 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.640
 one of the main problems I have 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.310
 found posed pencils is in fact that 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.110
 learn them that time of snow 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.380
 I can not say my temper 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.000
 truth I show you see with 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.190
 snow sharpeners what happens to me 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.200
 breaks all the pencils precisely those 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:59.920
 breaks do not know why me respects 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.780
 tip 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.520
 I tried the only one with different sharpeners 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.500
 that how this works here I sing in 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.170
 period I bought I know who knows how many 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.670
 years ago I know I bought it mad 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.340
 but a penknife 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:15.400
 actually for school that is not one of 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.770
 those sharpeners that of oneself can now with 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.160
 velardi that a note with many 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:25.960
 penknives stopped bulls this is the only one 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:27.580
 port see you can prepare the 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.800
 pencil 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.590
 I don't know how you but because I also have 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.140
 searched on the internet because I wanted to understand 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.430
 if in social media nobody has ever tried 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.470
 I can not understand this problem 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.180
 it is I, but the sharpeners of the 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.830
 snow cosmetics and neither 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.230
 they can learn it so I didn't understand 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.840
 how do the other person temper it to 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:49.090
 repair them anyway apart from this 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:53.050
 here my vote for this girls 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:55.780
 product is that of drums 7 minus from 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.820
 week because I don't like product 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.130
 sorry i like it done that there are two 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.830
 paint a pencil and look like it 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.930
 they can match though are slightly 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.479
 dry like 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.520
 as a consistency you do not succeed to others 

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:11.110
 Products are not excessively dry 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.570
 but let's say that I'm definitely not 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.820
 moisturizers with regards to the duration 

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:18.880
 on me the most intense colors like the 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:21.340
 red as hard fuchsia last longer 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.350
 last approximately 37 rather than clear 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.360
 how the coke adhd last last less 

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:28.270
 like an hour and a half when they come 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.509
 they don't keep my lips even though 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.919
 non member also comes in way too 

00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:34.870
 inhomogeneous highs that is not very bad 

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:37.330
 as an effect above all abela in 

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:39.729
 this is therefore preferred 

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:44.410
 you will have fuchsia and what it is called this 

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:46.330
 those not named me my masquerade are i 

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.620
 two preferred ones that masks it 

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.710
 you can see what caused the most 

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:52.630
 also he entirely on the heat or 

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:54.250
 miss watermelon the question of the sharpener 

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:58.949
 because that was a problem for me 

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.949
 find sharpener just bye beauties
