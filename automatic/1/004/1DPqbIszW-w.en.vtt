00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.920
In this season, when the climate has changed, and there is food all around,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.040
the animals get ready to bring their young into the world.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.280
And during the weeks immediately after the first rains,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.320
the different species come into mate and breed.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.160
Among the Kori bustards, the males mark out their territories

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.560
and begin a strange courtship ritual which consists of inflating air sacs

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.680
on their necks while emitting a booming guttural sound.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.760
Their swollen necks and the dull sounds

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.000
are intended to attract the attention of the females,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.880
while warning off other males who, as in this case,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.640
try to take over a territory which is someone else’s domain.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.960
Among the antelopes only the dominant males can mate with the females,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.640
and to occupy that position you have to beat the others in face-to-face combats,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.120
so hopeful males gather together in groups and permanently practice.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.480
These are not real fights.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.480
The young Grant’s gazelles are simply testing out their strength

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.280
and keeping in shape until the time

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.160
when they believe they are capable of challenging the ruler of a harem.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.960
And the process is the same with the impala males.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.640
Not far from where the young males are training,

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.720
a dominant impala stands watch over his group of females;

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.520
there is a possible challenger nearby,

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.240
and it is time to make absolutely clear who is the strongest male.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.400
Under the watchful eye of the females, the males clash.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.440
But the conflict does not have serious consequences.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.560
After the initial confrontation, the challenger realises his time has not yet come and,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.720
before the combat turns serious, he retires uninjured.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.400
Among the oryxes, the groups are mixed and highly structured.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.120
The horns and the strength of these antelopes mean that clashes

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.880
are extremely risky exercises which could cause terrible injuries or even death.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.400
But in the groups of oryxes, where there is a clear hierarchy of males and females,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.800
the dominant position is decided by ritualised combats

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.560
in which they test their strength but avoid serious aggression.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.080
In the herds, mating is also decided by the hierarchy.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.600
Each one knows what it can aspire to,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.000
depending on its status within the group,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.240
so in the same herd different couples can mate without this creating

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.080
any conflict among them.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.040
For the secretary birds, too, the mating season has arrived.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.120
The same couple that was looking for insects

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.120
shortly after the first rains is now preparing its nest.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.720
Though both animals engage in this task,

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.400
it is essentially the male that collects the branches,

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.680
while the female arranges them on the flat top of an acacia,

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.600
creating an enormous circular nest, characteristic of this species.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.360
During this time, the secretary birds are attentive and affectionate

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.800
with their mates, courting them on the ground,

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.240
in flight and in the nest.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.680
And shortly afterwards, in a way ornithologists have still not been able to describe,

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.560
they mate, then lay no more than three, extremely valuable, eggs.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.800
In the same acacia forest in which the secretary birds have built their nest,

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.320
a family of warthogs grazes on the nutritious green grasses

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.160
that have grown since the rains.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.520
The little warthogs are only a few days old,

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.960
but already they are expert savannah dwellers.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.400
They still lack the experience to be able to find food like their elders,

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.160
but they have the mobile food store of their mothers and,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.600
though she doesn’t want to stop to feed them,

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.480
the young warthogs are determined to get at the nutritious milk.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.000
Their only task during these first weeks will be to exercise

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.520
in order to acquire the speed and strength which will enable them to flee from hunters.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.160
And they dedicate themselves to this in body and soul.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.480
Wrestling matches,

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.160
or football with a pat of elephant dung form part of their training.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.080
Anything will do if it serves to make them faster and stronger.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:39.280
Because it will not be long before the savannah puts them to the test.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.080
In the shade of an acacia, a cheetah watches over a nearby group of oryxes.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.040
The oryxes are too strong for him,

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.920
but at this time of year are always young calves,

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.880
just a few days old, and it is one of these that the cheetah has his eye on.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.280
The calf appears to be perfectly healthy,

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.960
and the possibilities of catching it are virtually nil,

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:47.000
but the cheetah has been building up tension and decides to launch a desperate attempt.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.680
The oryx moves off unhurriedly,

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.480
confident of its superiority but without exposing its young to unnecessary risks.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.840
The cheetah has not even had the chance to test out its prodigious speed.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.880
There are many adults in the group and it knows that when it comes to defending its young,

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.160
an oryx is capable of killing even a lion,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.680
so he abandons the attempt,

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:36.440
and returns to his slow wanderings in search of more accessible prey.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.120
During the short rains,

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.720
between December and February,

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.800
there are frequent storms at nightfall.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.440
The climate mellows and the heat of the day gives way to fresh,

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.960
humid air; the temperature the large hunters have been waiting for to go into action.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.440
The evenings and nights of Shaba are extraordinarily beautiful.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:23.040
But, ever loyal to its contrasts, they are also the time when death lurks in the dark.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.040
Night falls over the Ewaso Ngiro.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.200
Along the dark banks, long shadows emerge from the water

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.560
in search of the warmth of the sand heated up during the daytime hours.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.840
The metabolism of the Nile crocodiles depends on their body temperature,

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.560
and this in turn depends on their surroundings,

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:11.000
so at sunset the narrow shores of the Ewaso fill with these dragons.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.680
For the lionesses, the night is an advantage.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.520
Lions have eyes that can see in the dark.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.040
Under cover of the shadows,

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.960
a mother and her young from the previous year lie in wait for the herbivores,

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.120
guided by the sounds coming from the thicket.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.960
Tonight, they are not in luck.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.800
From the forest alongside the river three elephants emerge,

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.480
and no hunter in Shaba would dare disturb them,

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.680
so the lionesses lower their guard and rest,

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.800
waiting for other signs that reveal the presence of possible prey.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.400
The rains have done their work.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.000
In mid January, Shaba is at its most splendid.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.560
There is abundant vegetation, water all around,

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.360
and the savannah teems with hundreds of animals,

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.600
taking advantage of the bonanza.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:42.680
The elephants have returned to the region and remain here longer.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.320
Different, inter-related matriarchal groups

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:59.480
come together by the Ewaso Ngiro to enjoy the end of abstinence.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:11.120
Elephants need between 80 and 160 litres of water a day,

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.920
and the adult males can drink twice this amount,

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.520
so they must always have water sources available.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:21.720
The banks of the Ewaso Ngiro, whose waters are now high and stable,

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.920
every day attract large herds of pachyderms.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.400
The adults can drink and bathe,

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:32.560
and the young can wallow in the mud, protected by a forest of colossal legs.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.720
These clans spend the dry season communicating

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.840
with each other at great distances but physically separated

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:59.240
in order to more efficiently explore and utilise the land devastated by the drought.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:03.800
But now, Shaba is witness to their reunion and can enjoy the spectacle,

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:08.720
once frequent in East Africa, of herds of over two hundred individuals.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.840
Today the region that comprises the reserves of Shaba,

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:28.960
Samburu and Buffalo Springs is home to the largest herds of elephants in East Africa.

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:34.480
And again, there is a paradox: this miracle of abundance in the kingdom of drought.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:47.120
The river bank is the meeting place for the majority of the species of Shaba.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:52.320
In the course of the day, many of the animals of the savannah come here to drink.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:58.080
And that is a risky moment, when they inevitably expose themselves to danger.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:05.600
With the heat of the sun, the large Nile crocodiles have returned to the water.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.400
On one of the banks, a group of Grevy’s zebras are slaking their thirst,

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.400
and the appearance of a young colt attracts the great saurians.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.080
The crocodiles are silent in the current of the Ewaso,

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.920
and when they submerge they become invisible.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.600
But the zebras are on permanent alert,

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.440
and the shallowness of the river is a factor in their favour.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.200
A surprise attack is the crocodile’s only change of claiming

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.680
a victim from the land along the Ewaso Ngiro.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.320
The baboons, too, who have remained in this region all year,

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:15.080
thrive in the shade of the forest along the river banks.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.800
The dominant males never lower their guard.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.600
The hunters also know that sooner or later their prey will come to drink,

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.120
and in the strip of forest there are frequent ambushes.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.720
The risk is worth it.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.000
Few carnivores would dare to challenge a family of baboons,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.840
and the candelabra palms that grow along the banks of the Ewaso

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:53.320
are now heavy with fruit. So while the large males stand watch,

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:58.040
the young climb up into the treetops and throw down the ripe fruit to the rest of the group.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:02.120
Another of the advantages of family life.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.600
Among the shadows of this same forest,

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.960
just a short distance from the baboons,

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.560
two Kirk’s dik-diks nervously keep watch as they eat.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.520
Standing two hands high,

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.600
and weighing around five kilos, they are the smallest antelopes in Shaba,

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.600
and even the large baboons could easily kill them,

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.880
so they nervously graze, never wandering far from the protective undergrowth.

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.400
The nervousness of the dik-diks is fully justified.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.240
Because the forest in which they live is the habitat

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.680
of the most beautiful and elusive hunter in Shaba.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:23.000
The leopards spend most of the day hiding in the boughs of the acacia,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.400
where their mottled skin makes them invisible.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:37.880
But when the sun goes down,

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.480
when the shadows creep over the savannah,

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.720
they come down from the branches to begin their hunting rounds.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.840
The time of the hunters has arrived.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:14.640
The animals retire to their night-time ride away.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:20.480
Life on the savannah offers no truces. And the night of Shaba fills with living shadows,

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.800
prowling around in the eternal game of life and death.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:38.440
By the river, beneath the fallen trunk of an acacia,

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.200
the leopard scans the night in search of prey.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.200
Its hearing and sense of smell receive the information of everything alive

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.720
and moving about under the cover of night.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.120
Another leopard emerges from the shadows,

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.200
and the couple continues its silent round.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.040
From the river come messages of potential prey,

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.640
but the water and the crocodiles place them beyond their reach.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:36.680
Then, the male detects a furtive movement in a tree alongside the Ewaso Ngiro,

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.920
and the hunt begins.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.080
The female waits at a certain distance.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:53.200
Only if the prey is large will she come to the aid of her companion.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.440
Silent as a ghost,

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.560
the leopard approaches the base of the tree in which the prey hides.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:06.920
Its senses are alert, waiting for fresh signs. And then a new sound is heard.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.920
The leopard knows there is something alive in the tree,

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.120
and that there is no escape for it.

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.880
Beneath the branches runs a river full of dangers and to reach the ground

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.560
the prey has to reveal itself.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.040
It is now just a question of time,

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:37.520
and beneath the attentive gaze of his companion, the hunter gets ready to attack.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.120
A last movement reveals a monitor lizard,

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:02.240
provoking a reaction from the leopard. For the terrified lizard,

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.960
this will be its last night on earth.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.000
Beneath the tree, the female waits, disappointed.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.360
The prey is small, and the male will keep it all for himself.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:27.160
In the harsh world of Shaba there is no place for any other attitude

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.760
but ensuring one’s own survival.

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:33.240
And if it had been the female that had caught the monitor lizard,

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.360
she would not have allowed the male to come near.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.440
Having devoured his catch,

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.560
the males comes down from the tree to join his mate.

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.960
And again two shadows melt into the night,

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.680
combining beauty and death beneath the starry sky of Shaba.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.280
Shaba is a fascinating land beyond the influence of man;

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:27.080
a world in which life is a series of stark contrasts;

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:32.560
where hardship gives rise to beauty and survival imposes constant tests.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:46.320
And it is precisely the harshness of its conditions that makes this land a world apart,

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:49.400
an exclusive paradise for its survivors.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.440
With the return of the dry season,

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.800
Shaba goes back to the beginning.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.840
Little by little drought sets in.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:06.040
And again God and the devil alternate until they become one and the same,

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.760
with no beginning or end,

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.160
in the perpetual cycle of life.
