00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.500 
I don't think it was very effective
so<00:02:02.740> yeah<00:02:02.890> this<00:02:03.040> is<00:02:03.100> how<00:02:03.159> the<00:02:03.280> duel<00:02:03.550> goes<00:02:03.790> we

so<00:02:28.360> I<00:02:28.540> don't<00:02:28.690> think<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:29.080> can<00:02:29.290> do<00:02:29.440> anything

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.220 

now<00:02:42.219> I<00:02:42.250> got<00:02:42.579> mine<00:02:42.819> crush<00:02:43.090> over<00:02:43.329> here<00:02:43.689> but<00:02:44.200> I

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
now I got mine crush over here but I

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.929 
now I got mine crush over here but I
didn't<00:02:44.650> really<00:02:44.739> activate<00:02:45.250> it<00:02:45.400> because<00:02:45.670> I<00:02:45.849> am

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:45.939 
didn't really activate it because I am

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:49.110 
didn't really activate it because I am
not<00:02:46.150> familiar<00:02:46.269> with<00:02:46.629> the<00:02:46.750> burn<00:02:46.959> cards<00:02:47.680> just<00:02:48.310> I

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
not familiar with the burn cards just I

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.020 
not familiar with the burn cards just I
don't<00:02:49.689> find<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.530> burn<00:02:50.980> deck<00:02:51.310> very<00:02:51.609> fun

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
don't find the burn deck very fun

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.140 
don't find the burn deck very fun
because<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:53.890> just<00:02:54.129> ruins<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.549> fun<00:02:54.760> out<00:02:54.909> of<00:02:54.939> the

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
because it just ruins the fun out of the

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.730 
because it just ruins the fun out of the
game

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
game

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:04.940
