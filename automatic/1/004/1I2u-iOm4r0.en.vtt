00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 now all welcome to one more video 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.779
 of omega today I bring you a hall and review 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.779
 about security 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.120
 Y 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:20.200
 differentiated live with a physical 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:22.890
 first the bacrims also hydrate and 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.480
 correct the color and they were the first 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.119
 products that must go to market 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.970
 this is believed to be a micro and improved 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.370
 because it hydrates corrects the color and 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.770
 all have the protection factor 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:43.079
 solar is I think the minimum could be 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.079
 25 in this case of which I have tried 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.129
 5 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:51.530
 and up to 50 you have quite different 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:54.710
 brands you can find different then 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.510
 and in many brands already have different 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.309
 tonalities then it 's better because 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.800
 Of course, we are not all super skin 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:04.009
 white or not we are all very dark 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.820
 then it is better to go buy one that 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:09.950
 I came across it 's proven which I 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.780
 I have proven that they are a little 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.850
 more economical like the idea and even the 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.090
 that are a little more expensive than maybe 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.090
 are 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:26.960
 itv I'm going to do I think natura could 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.960
 be the medium so you can say that 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.509
 I have tried more or less several brands 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.369
 several several and clips with and that I 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:38.090
 they seem the truth is that I apply 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.990
 any of these after throwing me 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:45.430
 my moisturizer 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:49.329
 every day because if you are a 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:53.079
 product but if you already have a routine 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:54.789
 that already in classes for years and the 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:59.540
 benches and nothing was practiced 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:04.240
 years then it does not seem bad 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.240
 kick me out late and then apply 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:12.540
 but if you 're in a hurry and well, 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.180
 you have time you do not have that routine so 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.019
 clearly marked this is a product that 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:23.330
 you throw and here would be moisturizing a 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:26.420
 color corrector and your sunblock 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.210
 then they would not need more but in my 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.910
 case the truth that I think that rarely 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.880
 I did not apply a moisturizer because 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.790
 then the voice of always then no no 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.030
 it seems to me that it is an additional step already 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.960
 I do it asleep another thing that they have to 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.450
 know that they are cycling follow many yes 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:51.020
 tend to correct to cover some 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.600
 imperfections is not that you're going to stop 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.210
 use your concealer because it is not 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.030
 two are so powerful and it helps you with a 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.920
 light base that can help you if 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.810
 think of an aging speck 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.490
 first you eat it in the arm because 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.690
 I'm a little nervous lately 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.880
 start scratching 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.060
 I get a little hole and if I lose 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:18.040
 mojito then how it looks half ugly me 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.390
 anyone and I explain a little here 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.989
 I will not show you from those who 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.910
 they have a little more powerful and the more 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:30.630
 light could be sincerity 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.150
 and I think it 's a cream and it smells 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.580
 rich that facilitates but that does have 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.069
 many spots and you're waiting for 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.709
 I cover you a lot 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:45.540
 if it hydrates you has the factor of 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.780
 solar protection of 25 and also has 10 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.350
 What is it 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.560
 anti-wrinkle that prevents you 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.380
 naked naked obviously 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.860
 You have 20 to 25 and you do not have many 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.349
 granites it seems to me that this is ideal 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.739
 I have not seen that they have many 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:07.250
 colors I think that is the only color 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:11.590
 but I 've stained it and it's going 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.590
 well I think it suits many 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:19.700
 I think they can be between nature and 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.620
 I like both of them, hydra, let's go 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.910
 to see that the smells 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.910
 this good normal cream 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.110
 is rich 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.880
 well toned the tone here 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:44.270
 he gave me but he gave me 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:47.349
 this has six tones when it was the 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:50.270
 store to teach me there were six colors 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:52.639
 so I think it could also be a 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.240
 stop 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.660
 both have protection factor 30 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.290
 so 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.260
 It seems to me that they are also 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:06.060
 perfect just let me put today 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.540
 and the one I wear on my arm is 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.280
 hour every day any 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:14.310
 using every day and much more 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.730
 it's something that did not give me marriage or something 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:20.010
 very night I need and match 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:23.220
 completely my skin is there was used base the 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.710
 since neither at night will I 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.150
 need a lot of sunscreen but 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.310
 during the day to work in a 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:33.690
 loose now we go with the ones that have 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:36.780
 more protection I think they are the ones 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:39.510
 they cover you much better if you 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:43.280
 you have a stain 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.280
 pronounced a scar 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:54.050
 best 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:55.580
 this is from 30 to 50 they do not have many 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:06:00.590
 shades a little 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:02.540
 iniesta so they seem perfect to me 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.640
 conclusion I would recommend to use a 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:10.430
 bicycle especially for the girls who 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:12.110
 they do not have much time in the morning to 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:20.660
 for those who are going to leave the 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:22.080
 university and the truth that the color 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.330
 have 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.129
 blocker then it is only 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.980
 necessary is to put some powder on you if 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:31.330
 they have shadows for another woman or so 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:35.530
 lips 7 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:37.990
 same for girls aged 5 over 30 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.849
 35 I think it's a super good product 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:43.050
 especially for those who do not need 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:43.050
 so much culture 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:50.050
 I recommend that anyone who wants 

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:52.719
 try something 3 in 1 that will relieve your life 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.610
 in the morning and that is something a face 

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:56.319
 introduce yourself and before you finish with 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.400
 video I wanted to tell you that we have a 

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:02.000
 draw 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:04.699
 3 and prince for the girls who are 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.639
 commenting here on the video or on the blog 

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:09.260
 you just have to put your name because 

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:13.260
 They carry 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:20.400
 and use the hashtag draw or megan is 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:22.500
 what it has to be and when entering the 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.470
 contest both the comments here as 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.880
 happy conversion 

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.110
 and I think it's serious they all have 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.590
 until this Friday to participate 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:33.010
 because the Saturday between myth and I'm 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:36.110
 saying the name of the three winners 

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:39.200
 so that would be all if you liked this 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:41.600
 video or have more suggestions or 

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:45.410
 comments let me work if you like me
