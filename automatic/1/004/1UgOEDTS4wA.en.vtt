that would have burned me which would

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.330 
that would have burned me which would
have<00:02:08.580> done<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> lot<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.030> damage<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.690> me<00:02:10.340> burdened

is like a

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.560 
is like a
uh<00:02:13.260> an<00:02:14.260> effect<00:02:15.040> what<00:02:15.610> do<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.030> call<00:02:16.210> it<00:02:16.240> I<00:02:16.420> don't

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
uh an effect what do you call it I don't

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.240 
uh an effect what do you call it I don't
know<00:02:16.630> but<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:16.960> burns<00:02:17.470> me<00:02:17.650> like<00:02:17.740> I<00:02:17.890> think<00:02:18.160> it's

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
know but it burns me like I think it's

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.100 
know but it burns me like I think it's
like<00:02:18.400> between<00:02:18.640> every<00:02:19.210> single<00:02:19.240> turn<00:02:19.780> I<00:02:19.930> get

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
like between every single turn I get

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.650 
like between every single turn I get
like<00:02:20.290> two<00:02:20.890> damage<00:02:21.340> counters<00:02:21.790> if<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:22.330> feel<00:02:22.570> the

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
like two damage counters if I I feel the

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.780 
like two damage counters if I I feel the
coin<00:02:22.870> if<00:02:23.320> its<00:02:23.620> tail's<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:24.070> get<00:02:24.250> two<00:02:24.430> damage

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
coin if its tail's I get two damage

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.480 
coin if its tail's I get two damage
counters<00:02:25.240> so<00:02:25.840> between<00:02:26.170> each<00:02:26.500> turn<00:02:27.100> I<00:02:27.130> have<00:02:27.310> to

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
counters so between each turn I have to

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.010 
counters so between each turn I have to
flip<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:27.760> coin<00:02:27.910> end<00:02:28.210> that<00:02:28.420> can<00:02:28.570> do<00:02:28.660> a<00:02:28.690> lot<00:02:28.780> of

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
flip a coin end that can do a lot of

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.430

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
cyndaquil right up right here and then

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.930 
cyndaquil right up right here and then
we<00:02:35.200> can<00:02:35.260> attach<00:02:35.530> an<00:02:35.710> energy<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.340> my<00:02:36.460> new<00:02:36.640> coil

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
we can attach an energy to my new coil

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.510 
we can attach an energy to my new coil
over<00:02:37.180> right<00:02:37.570> there<00:02:37.810> there<00:02:38.200> we<00:02:38.350> go<00:02:38.590> look<00:02:39.430> at

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
over right there there we go look at

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.670 
over right there there we go look at
that<00:02:39.700> now<00:02:39.910> we<00:02:39.970> can<00:02:40.120> do<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.300> flare<00:02:40.660> for<00:02:41.320> thirty

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
that now we can do the flare for thirty

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.160 
that now we can do the flare for thirty
damage<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.730> his<00:02:42.880> Vulpix<00:02:43.330> now<00:02:43.480> he<00:02:43.540> only<00:02:43.720> has<00:02:43.840> ten

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.210 
attach to another energy - wobba wobba
this<00:03:04.870> is<00:03:04.990> probably<00:03:05.350> pretty<00:03:05.530> stupid<00:03:05.860> I<00:03:06.040> should

hand wow that's really good but a Power

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.080 
hand wow that's really good but a Power
Plus<00:07:34.240> was<00:07:34.570> a<00:07:34.690> plus<00:07:35.260> power<00:07:35.620> I<00:07:35.950> think<00:07:36.790> they<00:07:36.880> used

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.090 
Plus was a plus power I think they used

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.790 
Plus was a plus power I think they used
to<00:07:37.180> be<00:07:37.270> called<00:07:37.510> power<00:07:37.870> pluses<00:07:38.470> that's<00:07:38.650> why<00:07:38.770> I

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 
to be called power pluses that's why I

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.050 
to be called power pluses that's why I
keep<00:07:38.980> doing<00:07:39.130> that<00:07:39.400> but<00:07:39.550> now<00:07:39.670> they're<00:07:39.820> plus

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:40.060 
keep doing that but now they're plus

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.910 
keep doing that but now they're plus

we're<00:07:45.130> going<00:07:45.250> to<00:07:45.310> be<00:07:45.400> facing<00:07:45.640> Kelvin<00:07:46.360> a<00:07:46.480> little

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 
we're going to be facing Kelvin a little

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.610 
we're going to be facing Kelvin a little
kid<00:07:46.900> Kelvin<00:07:47.380> here<00:07:47.560> and<00:07:48.090> yeah<00:07:49.090> so<00:07:50.020> he<00:07:50.500> has<00:07:50.590> a

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:50.620 
kid Kelvin here and yeah so he has a

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.500 
kid Kelvin here and yeah so he has a
water<00:07:50.980> type<00:07:51.340> which<00:07:51.580> will<00:07:51.850> not<00:07:52.090> be<00:07:52.120> good

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:52.510 
water type which will not be good

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:55.800 
water type which will not be good
against<00:07:52.750> my<00:07:52.870> fire<00:07:53.140> type<00:07:53.880> deck<00:07:54.880> because<00:07:55.420> fire

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:55.810 
against my fire type deck because fire

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:59.310 
against my fire type deck because fire
type<00:07:56.110> is<00:07:56.350> weakened<00:07:57.190> it<00:07:57.340> is<00:07:57.550> has<00:07:58.510> a<00:07:58.540> weakness<00:07:59.080> to

00:07:59.310 --> 00:07:59.320 
type is weakened it is has a weakness to

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.580 
type is weakened it is has a weakness to
water<00:07:59.560> type<00:08:00.210> obviously<00:08:01.210> so<00:08:02.020> that's<00:08:02.050> going<00:08:02.530> to

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:02.590 
water type obviously so that's going to

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:04.800 
water type obviously so that's going to
be<00:08:02.680> a<00:08:02.740> pretty<00:08:03.010> hard<00:08:03.250> game<00:08:03.310> so<00:08:03.760> next<00:08:04.210> time<00:08:04.480> we're

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:06.870 
be a pretty hard game so next time we're
going<00:08:04.930> to<00:08:04.990> be<00:08:05.110> facing<00:08:05.350> Kelvin<00:08:05.890> so<00:08:06.370> be<00:08:06.640> sure<00:08:06.790> to

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:06.880 
going to be facing Kelvin so be sure to

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.970
