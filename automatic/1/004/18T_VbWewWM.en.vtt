00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:10.500
 then we are with marco inside 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:13.950
 then renault clio then we are like 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:18.170
 you can see around the areas 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:22.230
 traffic or so it can be said of jesi 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:25.619
 to try a particular thing there 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.130
 saves money and is optional 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.769
 licu bene marco no then we say immediately 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.840
 4 the stop function has been provided 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.329
 start that just a function that then 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.719
 we will see in the practice that allows 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:44.820
 have to reduce that puts consumption and 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:47.780
 city pollution on two versions two 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.420
 motorizations 900 tcf 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.969
 new supercharged three-cylinder and up 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.030
 a thousand 460 common rail diesel engine 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.660
 from 90 horses energy version on these 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.399
 two clio precisely this stop system 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.769
 start 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.380
 allows us to save money 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.659
 save gasoline or diesel fuel e 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.280
 especially also pollute my grandparents 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.400
 the thing maybe more 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.430
 brought the situation to air form a 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:23.520
 level of pollution than today 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:26.159
 unfortunately we must bear to see 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.820
 we have a traffic light either because there 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.119
 we take 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.659
 my name is vertex unfortunately no no no 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.240
 Now there is no one stop us my 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.049
 red 15 Italian traffic light in column 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.850
 let's go to brake the car to press 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.100
 the clutch we put in neutral we detach 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.710
 the foot clutch on the brake and the nature 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.979
 the clutch has turned off after the clutch 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.020
 read turns on again I enter the gear 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:55.740
 allotment and then in that little lapse 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.520
 of time in which we have been in 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.300
 column 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.560
 waiting for a traffic light we have 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.390
 a little less polluted is saved a little 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.030
 of gasoline 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.170
 same thing is happening in the second half 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.239
 the friction 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.019
 the car starts again I enter the gear 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:15.630
 perfect climate but in this case we are 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:18.900
 on the clio mind in this case 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.360
 empathy we are on the 900 dc and between the 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.250
 supercharged cylinders as I said 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.989
 energy version that the version says 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.989
 top of the range one that offers 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:35.230
 best finishing level and is a 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:39.280
 engine again very new 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.530
 interesting especially because it is 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.440
 on a supercharged engine capacity so 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.810
 small allows excellent performance 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:52.450
 combined with an average consumption of 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:55.810
 extremely roughly with 4.7 liters 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.540
 of petrol per 100 kg of travel 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.739
 say that they are very much values 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.090
 interesting they will also watch this 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:11.760
 this system stop start that 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:15.910
 logically it helps even less and demands 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.640
 from profane but the fact of turning on 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.519
 turn off turn off can cause 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.630
 possibly engine problems 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.060
 this does not create anyone in this 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.220
 rotten empty system experienced it 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.739
 they use lots and lots of houses 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.230
 I mean we claim to be 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.540
 one of his first so we can 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.500
 i 'm absolutely calm there 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.500
 problems 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.980
 well another thing I can decide instead 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:45.070
 whether to exclude the stop start system 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.040
 of course the customer that some 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.470
 reason for some reason he didn't want to 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.060
 use this system 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.970
 particularly interesting we can 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.960
 unplug it there is a button here on the 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.640
 white left 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.440
 during pressed into the computer of 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.930
 border deactivation is signaled 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:10.400
 so there is no trial the 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:13.970
 problem well then after the start stop 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:18.050
 a clio stop and start 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.730
 after a short ride with marco is a 

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.480
 let's see a little how this works 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.940
 device 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.120
 we return to the base and continue to 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:30.820
 speak and woodpecker and not only for which a 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.820
 hello hello goodbye soon
