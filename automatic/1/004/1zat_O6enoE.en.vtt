on<00:02:16.310> Android<00:02:16.910> right<00:02:17.090> now<00:02:17.269> so<00:02:17.900> let's<00:02:18.650> quickly

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
on Android right now so let's quickly

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.650 
on Android right now so let's quickly
switch<00:02:19.040> to<00:02:19.160> windows<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:19.760> let's<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:20.269> make<00:02:20.450> it<00:02:20.569> a

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
switch to windows so let's it make it a

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.449 
switch to windows so let's it make it a
Windows<00:02:21.560> 8<00:02:21.860> tablet<00:02:23.620> so<00:02:24.620> yes<00:02:24.799> so<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.010> text<00:02:25.400> we

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
Windows 8 tablet so yes so the text we

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.580 
Windows 8 tablet so yes so the text we
was<00:02:25.610> typing<00:02:25.940> in<00:02:26.030> is<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.330> there<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.750> it's<00:02:27.380> still

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
was typing in is to there and it's still

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.309 
was typing in is to there and it's still
in<00:02:27.799> windows<00:02:28.069> 8<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.630> my<00:02:29.630> only<00:02:29.780> concern<00:02:30.230> about

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
in windows 8 and my only concern about

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.720 
in windows 8 and my only concern about
this<00:02:30.590> it's<00:02:30.890> what's<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.190> battery<00:02:31.430> life<00:02:31.519> going

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
this it's what's the battery life going

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.160 
this it's what's the battery life going
to<00:02:31.760> be<00:02:31.819> like<00:02:31.880> because<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:32.239> have<00:02:32.390> two<00:02:32.569> tours<00:02:33.049> is

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
to be like because you have two tours is

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.680 
to be like because you have two tours is
running<00:02:33.440> on<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.680> same<00:02:33.860> hardware<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.690> it

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
running on the same hardware and it

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:36.789 
running on the same hardware and it
seems<00:02:35.900> like<00:02:36.080> they're<00:02:36.200> going<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.350> be<00:02:36.470> passing

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
seems like they're going to be passing

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.410 
seems like they're going to be passing
and<00:02:37.190> putting<00:02:37.459> and<00:02:37.640> putting<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:37.970> u.s.<00:02:38.209> into<00:02:38.390> a

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
and putting and putting the u.s. into a

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.880 
and putting and putting the u.s. into a
virtual<00:02:38.569> state<00:02:38.930> or<00:02:39.140> something<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.530> that<00:02:39.560> sort

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
virtual state or something of that sort

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.550 
virtual state or something of that sort
but<00:02:40.400> still<00:02:40.580> it's<00:02:40.760> really<00:02:41.180> amazing<00:02:41.420> has<00:02:41.780> how

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
but still it's really amazing has how

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.289 
but still it's really amazing has how
fast<00:02:42.920> you<00:02:43.160> can<00:02:43.190> switch<00:02:43.519> from<00:02:43.549> an<00:02:43.940> Android<00:02:44.209> iOS

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
fast you can switch from an Android iOS

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.440 
fast you can switch from an Android iOS
to<00:02:44.750> or<00:02:44.840> Windows<00:02:45.080> OS<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:45.470> vice<00:02:45.590> versa<00:02:45.920> so<00:02:46.609> the

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
to or Windows OS and vice versa so the

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.180 
to or Windows OS and vice versa so the
keyboard<00:02:48.049> works<00:02:48.260> with<00:02:48.500> both<00:02:48.739> android<00:02:49.160> and

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
keyboard works with both android and

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.699 
keyboard works with both android and
windows<00:02:49.549> as<00:02:49.850> well<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.239> yes<00:02:51.109> so<00:02:51.320> that's<00:02:51.500> the

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
windows as well and yes so that's the

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.349 
windows as well and yes so that's the
tablet<00:02:52.190> itself<00:02:52.310> so<00:02:52.790> let's<00:02:52.940> quickly<00:02:53.030> take<00:02:53.299> a

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
tablet itself so let's quickly take a

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:54.640 
tablet itself so let's quickly take a
look<00:02:53.570> around<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.900> hardware<00:02:54.230> so<00:02:54.380> this<00:02:54.530> is<00:02:54.590> a

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
look around the hardware so this is a

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.640 
look around the hardware so this is a
docking<00:02:55.010> things<00:02:55.280> for<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.440> tablet<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.620> you

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
docking things for the tablet and you

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.130 
docking things for the tablet and you
have<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.940> audio<00:02:59.359> jack<00:02:59.600> ummm<00:03:00.519> HRM<00:03:01.519> be<00:03:01.670> yet

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
have the audio jack ummm HRM be yet

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.479 
have the audio jack ummm HRM be yet
something<00:03:03.140> like<00:03:03.230> a<00:03:03.320> charging<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:03.980> connector

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
something like a charging the connector

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.259 
something like a charging the connector
at<00:03:05.359> the<00:03:05.420> Windows<00:03:06.019> key<00:03:06.049> as<00:03:07.040> well<00:03:07.100> over<00:03:07.549> here<00:03:07.700> in
