you're going to do is run on the small

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.010 
you're going to do is run on the small
house<00:01:07.790> it's<00:01:08.240> going<00:01:08.390> to<00:01:08.479> run<00:01:08.600> on<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:08.720> wall<00:01:08.900> on

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
house it's going to run on the wall on

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.240 
house it's going to run on the wall on
that<00:01:09.050> and<00:01:09.500> you're<00:01:09.620> going<00:01:09.710> to<00:01:09.770> jump<00:01:09.920> up<00:01:10.070> to<00:01:10.100> the

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
that and you're going to jump up to the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:18.490 
that and you're going to jump up to the
larger<00:01:11.000> Shack<00:01:15.940> trees<00:01:16.940> are<00:01:17.180> in<00:01:17.300> place<00:01:17.570> which

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
larger Shack trees are in place which

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.780 
larger Shack trees are in place which
means<00:01:18.740> that<00:01:18.950> you<00:01:19.100> can<00:01:19.220> do<00:01:19.640> whatever<00:01:19.850> you<00:01:20.780> know

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
means that you can do whatever you know

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.470 
means that you can do whatever you know
yeah<00:01:23.300> weird<00:01:24.370> okay<00:01:25.370> so<00:01:25.760> there's<00:01:26.240> not<00:01:26.360> really

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
yeah weird okay so there's not really

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.480 
yeah weird okay so there's not really
too<00:01:26.600> much<00:01:26.810> to<00:01:26.990> do<00:01:27.170> here<00:01:27.380> because<00:01:27.470> it's<00:01:28.160> just<00:01:28.370> a

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
too much to do here because it's just a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.610 
too much to do here because it's just a
demo<00:01:28.700> but<00:01:29.030> so<00:01:29.330> I<00:01:29.510> guess<00:01:29.720> a<00:01:29.750> nice<00:01:30.110> feature<00:01:30.410> to

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
demo but so I guess a nice feature to

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.650 
demo but so I guess a nice feature to
have<00:01:33.460> in<00:01:34.460> order<00:01:34.970> to<00:01:35.090> get<00:01:35.240> anywhere<00:01:35.540> you're

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
have in order to get anywhere you're

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.790 
have in order to get anywhere you're
still<00:01:35.810> gonna<00:01:35.900> have<00:01:36.020> to<00:01:36.080> render<00:01:36.410> this<00:01:36.530> little

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
still gonna have to render this little

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.070 
still gonna have to render this little
part<00:01:37.070> right<00:01:37.160> here<00:01:37.610> and<00:01:37.850> if<00:01:38.120> you<00:01:38.240> mess<00:01:38.420> up<00:01:38.660> you

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
part right here and if you mess up you

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.700 
part right here and if you mess up you
do<00:01:39.320> start<00:01:39.740> back<00:01:39.980> at<00:01:40.960> the<00:01:41.960> room<00:01:42.110> where<00:01:42.410> the<00:01:42.530> pipe

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
do start back at the room where the pipe

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:51.539 
do start back at the room where the pipe
is

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:02:00.539 

still<00:01:52.090> Girly's<00:01:52.450> place

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.880 

and<00:02:00.640> that<00:02:01.240> little<00:02:01.390> section<00:02:01.869> that<00:02:02.079> small

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
and that little section that small

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.919 
and that little section that small
middle<00:02:03.399> section<00:02:03.939> right<00:02:04.090> over<00:02:04.240> here<00:02:04.450> is<00:02:04.570> pretty

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
middle section right over here is pretty

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.480 
middle section right over here is pretty
much<00:02:05.109> the<00:02:05.350> main<00:02:05.740> thing<00:02:05.950> that<00:02:06.070> you<00:02:06.159> can<00:02:06.280> access

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
much the main thing that you can access

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.910 
much the main thing that you can access
that's<00:02:06.880> kind<00:02:07.329> of<00:02:07.420> off-limits<00:02:07.689> in<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.050> demo

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:19.170 

always<00:02:11.920> happens<00:02:12.900> okay

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.140 

so<00:02:19.600> they're<00:02:19.690> going<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.870> take<00:02:20.050> this<00:02:20.819> down<00:02:21.819> to

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
so they're going to take this down to

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.180 
so they're going to take this down to
there<00:02:22.480> hope<00:02:22.840> I<00:02:22.990> don't<00:02:23.050> mess<00:02:23.319> this<00:02:23.530> up

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.730 

there<00:02:27.190> you<00:02:27.280> go<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.959> as<00:02:28.959> you<00:02:29.050> can<00:02:29.170> see<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:29.560> can

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
roleplay that your construction worker

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.660 
roleplay that your construction worker
you<00:02:34.959> can<00:02:35.110> do<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.850> all<00:02:36.850> of<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:38.040> yeah<00:02:39.040> it's

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
going to render a couple of section

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:47.640 
going to render a couple of section
series<00:02:40.990> so<00:02:41.080> you<00:02:41.110> can<00:02:41.260> see<00:02:41.380> what<00:02:41.590> there<00:02:41.739> is

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:03:00.200 

ah<00:02:47.879> oops

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.180 

actually<00:03:01.080> that's<00:03:01.200> just<00:03:01.290> about<00:03:01.710> it<00:03:01.770> this<00:03:02.070> is

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
actually that's just about it this is

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.589 
actually that's just about it this is
where<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.550> training<00:03:03.420> portion<00:03:03.690> ends<00:03:04.290> at<00:03:04.910> but

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.690 

you're<00:03:09.110> free<00:03:09.349> to<00:03:09.379> either<00:03:09.829> go<00:03:10.250> back<00:03:10.400> to<00:03:10.610> the

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
you're free to either go back to the

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:30.680 
you're free to either go back to the
beginning<00:03:10.849> which<00:03:11.480> is<00:03:11.599> up<00:03:11.959> that<00:03:12.200> way

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.600 

right<00:03:31.020> there

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.310 

or<00:03:34.060> I<00:03:34.120> guess<00:03:34.360> if<00:03:34.480> you<00:03:34.600> wanted<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:34.870> take<00:03:34.990> another

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
or I guess if you wanted to take another

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.880 
or I guess if you wanted to take another
path<00:03:35.620> in<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:35.950> beginning<00:03:39.540> okay<00:03:40.540> I<00:03:40.960> don't

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
path in the beginning okay I don't

00:03:41.890 --> 00:04:00.040 
path in the beginning okay I don't
really<00:03:42.040> know<00:03:42.250> what<00:03:42.370> I'm<00:03:42.430> doing<00:03:42.760> here<00:03:43.410> yeah

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.980 

this<00:04:00.650> is<00:04:00.740> probably<00:04:00.950> going<00:04:01.190> to<00:04:01.370> reactivate<00:04:02.120> the

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
this is probably going to reactivate the

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.559
