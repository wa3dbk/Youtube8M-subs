so<00:06:10.020> much<00:06:10.169> confidence<00:06:10.649> in<00:06:10.710> his<00:06:10.860> car<00:06:11.039> is<00:06:11.189> so<00:06:11.369> fast

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:11.639 
so much confidence in his car is so fast

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:12.980 
so much confidence in his car is so fast
that<00:06:11.909> he's<00:06:12.270> gonna<00:06:12.389> walk<00:06:12.599> away<00:06:12.719> with<00:06:12.809> this

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
that he's gonna walk away with this

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.139 
that he's gonna walk away with this
championship<00:06:13.319> if<00:06:13.860> he's<00:06:14.009> not<00:06:14.129> careful<00:06:14.399> but<00:06:15.029> if

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:15.149 
championship if he's not careful but if

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:17.089 
championship if he's not careful but if

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:17.099 
if Elliott Sadler could win it put some

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:18.559 
if Elliott Sadler could win it put some
pressure<00:06:17.249> on<00:06:17.399> him<00:06:17.639> yeah<00:06:17.969> it's<00:06:18.180> a<00:06:18.240> good<00:06:18.389> idea

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:18.569 
pressure on him yeah it's a good idea

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:20.269

00:06:20.269 --> 00:06:20.279 
for him to be able to do that he doesn't

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:21.799
