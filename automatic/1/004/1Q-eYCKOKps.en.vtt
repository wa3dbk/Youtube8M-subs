now Chevy says this car will reach 60 in
about<00:00:35.430> four<00:00:35.730> seconds<00:00:36.230> 3.9<00:00:37.230> if<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.530> get<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
about four seconds 3.9 if you get the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.410 
about four seconds 3.9 if you get the
automatic<00:00:37.950> it'll<00:00:38.670> do<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.850> quarter-mile<00:00:39.390> in

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
number will actually decrease if you're

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.290 
number will actually decrease if you're

claim let's see if we can match it I do
like<00:03:20.610> how<00:03:20.819> you<00:03:20.880> can<00:03:21.150> induce<00:03:21.360> rotation<00:03:21.959> with<00:03:22.050> a

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
like how you can induce rotation with a

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.260 
like how you can induce rotation with a
throttle<00:03:22.410> that's<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.800> nice<00:03:22.920> touch<00:03:23.459> but<00:03:23.819> of

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
throttle that's a nice touch but of

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.400 
throttle that's a nice touch but of
course<00:03:24.450> that's<00:03:24.599> not<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:24.870> difficult<00:03:25.230> thing<00:03:25.260> to

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
course that's not a difficult thing to

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.140 
course that's not a difficult thing to
do<00:03:25.560> when<00:03:25.739> you<00:03:25.800> have<00:03:25.950> 580<00:03:26.580> horsepower

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.569 

any<00:03:31.659> carpet<00:03:32.140> it's<00:03:32.260> generating<00:03:32.739> a<00:03:32.829> lot<00:03:33.099> of<00:03:33.280> grip

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
that checks out so the zl1 definitely

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.119 
that checks out so the zl1 definitely
meets<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.569> claims<00:03:49.840> but<00:03:50.500> there's<00:03:50.709> one<00:03:50.890> more

sections here that are are similar and

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.080 
sections here that are are similar and
that<00:04:25.300> they're<00:04:25.630> very<00:04:25.960> fast<00:04:26.880> transitional<00:04:27.880> and

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
that they're very fast transitional and

great job the car is extremely stable

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.330 
great job the car is extremely stable
even<00:04:41.020> though<00:04:41.169> it<00:04:41.650> has<00:04:41.830> good<00:04:42.070> steering

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
even though it has good steering

accuracy at the same time along with the

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.000 
accuracy at the same time along with the
braking<00:04:45.669> is<00:04:45.820> powerful<00:04:46.630> and<00:04:46.900> consistent<00:04:47.830> and

the handling stability along with the

00:04:50.530 --> 00:05:01.300 
the handling stability along with the
speed<00:04:50.970> it's<00:04:51.970> it<00:04:52.419> would<00:04:52.479> be<00:04:52.630> a<00:04:52.659> winner
