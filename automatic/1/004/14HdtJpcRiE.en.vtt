00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.480
 to what the need of the game 

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:11.670
 that required demonstrated the level of 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.510
 concentration and intensity in the 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.150
 job 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.740
 danilo bolívar the proof of today's training 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.419
 and coming back from the weekend can 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.759
 be the possibility of the next game 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:22.470
 had a real possibility I would say until 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.439
 that the greater possibility of January 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.220
 and Bolivia by side and by the average 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.230
 at least 15 days without d'Alessandro that 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.300
 this means for your business plans. 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.800
 tite 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.980
 I want to have the expectation that before 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.050
 still gave mine is not is not a 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.910
 disrespect to the medical department but 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.390
 always create a possibility of bringing 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:49.680
 before is close to having the athlete's 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.110
 d'alessandro andré and eo and the goianos are 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.960
 joint players doing what they 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.860
 give the pace the team knows we know 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.660
 the importance of d'alessandro 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.390
 I want to be with him 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.580
 less than 15 days at the disposal of 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.100
 how do you avoid it at the positive moment 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.600
 some pockets between crisis quotes 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.890
 we are just talking about the vice 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.479
 football fernando carvalho the following 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.649
 Look at all we can do 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.960
 Let's do it because the moment is positive. 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:17.329
 and any news that gets out of the rut 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:23.230
 can have a greater coherence ratio 

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:29.830
 true work 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:33.490
 to observe the errors and and recognize 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:36.040
 out of this there is no secret that the tyson 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.710
 said he apologized what he sees 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.450
 exactly it explain what you had 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.940
 charged them had already charged a thing 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.370
 this issue is already surpassed the already 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.500
 had the condition that you put in the 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.270
 start of the week right after the game 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.550
 had this situation she did well 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.920
 she was well informed publicly 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.460
 We already have there on Wednesday already 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.770
 Thinking of the game, your Alecsandro dar 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.810
 the message at the match against the new 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.120
 Hamburg can put a 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.830
 question in your head from here 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.070
 little seek his composition with 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.690
 nilmar has already posted on 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.940
 that he was in the young 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.950
 and the inputs they have during 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.630
 eyes already put it is always in 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.830
 in the dilemma of finding what is the 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.350
 better for the team maintaining a 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.480
 structuring but promoting the 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.220
 competition within the group itself 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.940
 loyalty and back saying there is no other 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.430
 form 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.930
 have to look the side and athlete respects the 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.209
 quality athlete 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.860
 the experience I bring a little bit 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.510
 athlete who looks at the side sends the 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.810
 Cuca is good, the guy is fine then. 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.900
 strength athlete regards quality 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.370
 you respect quality while you 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.680
 with respect to quality and 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.630
 so it's soft so too the athlete so 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.580
 also red can say a little 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.260
 Danilo bolivar if she 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.750
 establishes more by the income 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.239
 danilo on the side or the bolivar on the back 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.620
 the body of work sometimes a level of 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.770
 confrontation and the teams that the 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.880
 take me I say so if it were south 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.230
 and if it was a championship 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.080
 Brazilian 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.850
 bolívar is calm because because the 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.760
 Ze is one that the teams have been attacking 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.400
 more gaucho championship with the exception of 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.140
 youth team other teams one that 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.180
 another that comes a little bit daring 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.209
 she comes more closed behind 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.480
 so the decision is essential is a 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.480
 trend 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.799
 it's a good question and it's the sequence of games 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.030
 is what will determine the Julian is another 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.430
 already creates you a question mark 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.470
 I also say that all athletes I 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.360
 I'll have a number in the speech the team was 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.230
 31 I want to look at who knows what it is 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.569
 That's it 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.819
 there are 31 athletes and more than 15 31 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.040
 athletes who entered went in well 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.200
 then this appreciation is important to you 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.959
 have acknowledged this not only in France but also 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.209
 Julian's Danilo and how long the 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.920
 Attraction was spoken in danilo giuliano 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.370
 it would be a promise 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:59.650
 Lauro was the future and an athlete who was 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:02.840
 valued by the whole campaign 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.690
 end of the year a lot of club behind 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.760
 of him doing even an inconfidence then 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.739
 that's when I say so and when the team 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.269
 It's okay, she ends up valuing everyone. 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.269
 is a Julian case also
