00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.706
Footwork skills - rear corners (type 1 basic)

00:00:04.425 --> 00:00:09.523
ok now, this is really basic step

00:00:09.523 --> 00:00:13.073
all the club players must be able to do it is

00:00:13.073 --> 00:00:16.375
step one, one where

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:19.158
shuttle goes backward

00:00:19.158 --> 00:00:20.741
this one jump backward

00:00:20.741 --> 00:00:23.009
1 2

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.857
and then 3 is load - ready to hit

00:00:26.857 --> 00:00:28.991
shuttle goes back

00:00:28.991 --> 00:00:32.307
1 2 3

00:00:32.307 --> 00:00:34.209
shuttle goes side

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:37.593
1 2 3

00:00:37.593 --> 00:00:39.492
shuttle goes that side

00:00:39.492 --> 00:00:43.076
1 2 3

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:47.609
4 is switch hit same time switch feet

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:48.877
let's say

00:00:48.877 --> 00:00:52.160
go backwards watch my legs

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.193
1 2 3 switch

00:00:56.193 --> 00:00:58.038
ok, so 4 hit

00:00:58.038 --> 00:01:04.128
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 for clear

00:01:04.128 --> 00:01:07.265
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:01:08.612 --> 00:01:10.014
shuttle is there

00:01:10.014 --> 00:01:14.559
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:15.458
there

00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:19.293
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:01:19.293 --> 00:01:24.192
this step can be used when you have time

00:01:24.192 --> 00:01:27.510
time to the shuttle cock

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.844
and after you hit you have some time

00:01:29.844 --> 00:01:31.378
you can use this one

00:01:31.378 --> 00:01:33.459
with shuttle cock please

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:35.277
ok move there

00:01:35.277 --> 00:01:36.344
more forwarded

00:01:37.994 --> 00:01:40.678
let's say shuttle went backward

00:01:41.892 --> 00:01:43.560
ok watch my feet and together

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.395
ready go

00:01:45.395 --> 00:01:47.894
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:01:49.446 --> 00:01:51.844
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:01:53.443 --> 00:01:56.310
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:01:57.528 --> 00:02:00.577
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:02:01.845 --> 00:02:04.761
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.906
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:02:09.906 --> 00:02:16.361
ok that is basic 7 step for clear

00:02:16.361 --> 00:02:18.376
I will show you why you need 7

00:02:18.376 --> 00:02:22.260
if you do smash its different

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.976
ok without shuttle go 7 step go

00:02:24.976 --> 00:02:27.743
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:02:27.743 --> 00:02:28.998
center

00:02:28.998 --> 00:02:33.082
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:02:33.082 --> 00:02:35.931
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:36.928
ok shuttle goes

00:02:36.928 --> 00:02:37.529
1 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.430
because I might do that 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.347
1

00:02:41.347 --> 00:02:43.215
so you don't know where in real match

00:02:43.215 --> 00:02:44.481
so you have to make 1 clear

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:48.365
1 yeah hit 5 6 7

00:02:48.365 --> 00:02:51.296
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:52.048
center

00:02:52.048 --> 00:02:55.198
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:02:55.198 --> 00:02:58.832
1 2 3 4 5 6 ok now

00:03:01.064 --> 00:03:05.815
number 7 becomes 1 again in the real terms

00:03:05.815 --> 00:03:09.149
so start 1 finish 1 is equal

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:10.454
ready

00:03:10.454 --> 00:03:11.339
continue ok

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:13.104
7 becomes 1 bend knee

00:03:13.104 --> 00:03:13.888
go

00:03:13.888 --> 00:03:18.404
1 2 3 4 5 6 - 1 2 3 4 5 6

00:03:18.404 --> 00:03:23.955
1 2 3 4 5 6 - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:03:23.955 --> 00:03:28.889
your 1 is little bit too exaggerated ok just use your legs

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:29.686
ready go

00:03:29.686 --> 00:03:34.173
1 2 3 4 5 6 - too much - 5 6

00:03:34.173 --> 00:03:38.622
1 2 3 4 5 6 yes ok

00:03:38.622 --> 00:03:41.639
now good

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:49.289
I can make Tom change one thing to be at more efficient

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:53.375
what Tom did was look watch my posture

00:03:53.375 --> 00:03:57.540
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.391
because he stood up he will be slow to go to the net

00:04:02.391 --> 00:04:03.957
so the posture should be

00:04:03.957 --> 00:04:07.057
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:04:08.425 --> 00:04:09.324
rather than

00:04:09.324 --> 00:04:12.491
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:04:12.491 --> 00:04:13.640
Tom do it again

00:04:19.774 --> 00:04:21.390
ready lower, lower posture

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.407
when you come back you must have same posture lower

00:04:24.407 --> 00:04:25.241
better like that

00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:25.807
go

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:30.607
1 2 3 4 5 6 - 1 2 3 4 5 6

00:04:30.607 --> 00:04:36.239
1 2 3 4 5 6 - 1 2 3 much better

00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:37.439
ok

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:38.855
ok ready go

00:04:38.855 --> 00:04:39.740
any where

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.439
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:45.206
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:04:45.206 --> 00:04:45.889
continue

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.490
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.522
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:04:51.522 --> 00:04:53.839
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:57.723
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:04:57.723 --> 00:04:59.871
so the important thing is 

00:04:59.871 --> 00:05:06.614
start 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 becomes 1 again

00:05:06.614 --> 00:05:08.815
remember start finish 

00:05:08.815 --> 00:05:10.431
start is start

00:05:10.431 --> 00:05:12.346
finish is another start
