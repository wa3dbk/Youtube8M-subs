00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.540
 hello guys how are you welcome to a 

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:09.860
 new video and here I bring you the setup of 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:12.950
 2014 2015 I hope we start with the bad 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.490
 that are the cables I was previously 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.260
 very fussy about this but in the end 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.240
 I've become really lazy enough 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.700
 and with the theme that I have more and more 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.460
 appliances and more rolls so good at 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.610
 end as you see is a disaster maybe 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.410
 some day I put myself to order it but of 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.599
 I do not really want to see you there 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.930
 cat catcher that good hangs 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:39.140
 from there all the cables come and 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.480
 others and nothing once shown what 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.809
 disgusting now everything can improve 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.840
 let's go first to see the setup 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.980
 main thing that would be this is not a big deal 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.160
 the truth 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.860
 a tiny 11 inch laptop that 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:59.410
 I have put a screen of 23 a keyboard 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.699
 a mouse and is already so this is all 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.070
 nothing guys here I say goodbye I hope that 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.950
 you liked the video and see you 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:09.140
 see you later 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.409
 come let's see how good is this 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:16.090
 the sector that uses elena and good in 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:20.570
 principle did not have the macbook of 11 and 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:23.420
 we caught a 23 22 23 inch monitor 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.299
 and nothing true that very well to work 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.399
 all that and let's see mine we're going to 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:32.420
 make a general overview first and 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.649
 expand there you have it if we start with 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.000
 the right let's see a little in 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.270
 detail 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.099
 we have a 13 inch macbook air 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.880
 this you already saw in my previous setup 

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:47.820
 the best thing about this macbook is this 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.130
 and is that as you can see it is incredibly 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.390
 thin is also fat because here it has 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.009
 the usb connections the monitor to 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.860
 cards and more to thinner and here is 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:02.080
 well there it joins the support but 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.760
 Come on, you see, it's practically 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.460
 nothing or millimeters 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:13.800
 it's still a pretty powerful machine 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:18.050
 is a 72 gigas with turbo sides and peak 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.270
 has 8 gigas of ram memory this 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.530
 card is not very there but neither 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.900
 play computer so for what 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.490
 I do not want to spare me enough to edit 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.500
 it's a machine because it has a hard drive 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:34.330
 ssd of 256gb then here is one thing 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.819
 I like it a lot to see it at night 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.010
 now it is not going to appreciate but it is that 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.420
 the keys are still there you can see it 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.170
 they illuminate below you to the keyboard 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.780
 backlit and that gives a lot 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.670
 game here we have the jewel in the crown 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.860
 the main monitor is a 27 inch 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.320
 maybe you do not appreciate how huge it is 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.130
 I do not know how to do it so that what 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:06.510
 notes but it's amazing basically it's 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:06.510
 a resolution of 2560 wide x 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.060
 1440 high you know that most of 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.940
 monitors have 1080p 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.400
 this is 1440 or it has almost 400 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.860
 pixels higher and I can not 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.440
 put something in the browser so that 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.990
 you see maybe good in truth is a 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.700
 madness could I put as work 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.700
 I do not want to blur this much 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:39.490
 ok you see two windows enter you 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.750
 I'm going to say the width 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.210
 1280 is to say what he has basically 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:48.170
 it's exactly what a laptop has 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:50.060
 1280 wide as two enter 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.510
 entire windows and this is good for 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.390
 for me that web programming work 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.520
 have on this side the code and have in 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.070
 this side the browser updating 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.720
 authorizing all the time is let's go 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.770
 primordial and it saves me a lot of time 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.960
 here we have the 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:14.170
 good the microphone that you already saw in 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:16.239
 my previous setup and a 3.0 usb hub and 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.120
 also has a connection to see - is 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.310
 go now because this is connected to 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.840
 macbook air because this macbook air is 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.430
 so fine that it does not even bring a 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.960
 ethernet connection and good with the gps 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.330
 well I take advantage that I have more usb outputs 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.180
 and apart the ethernet that always goes 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:34.450
 better than the wifi wireless keyboard 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.280
 apple and this mouse that for me is let's 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.890
 one of the best mice that exists and 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.920
 I have tried enough has good part 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:44.500
 of the classic buttons the wheel this 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:48.040
 to change the speed of the wheel 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.110
 it has good here the best is not appreciated 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.570
 of the world because this I do not know how to be 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.180
 so that approach but good has here 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.520
 those two buttons that you see and then this 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.820
 doctor down here that with the zoom and 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.340
 this down here I do not know if it 's good 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.560
 you see that I have this action so that 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.110
 show the desk is another button 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.330
 then here in this with this finger 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.580
 you have one one two three and four buttons 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.300
 which is super useful 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.210
 and very 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.970
 and very convenient especially for 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:24.740
 move between windows and everything else and my 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:27.770
 Last acquisition would be this come 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.500
 rl 2455 hmm is the model up to 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.080
 memory is already a monitor of these from 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.430
 gaming with a millisecond of time 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.470
 answer really is not very expensive to 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.500
 what it offers as I tell you is a time 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:42.830
 Super low response in the lowest possible 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.569
 and have two hdmi have with that vga dvi 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.169
 well in the end it has a lot of 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:49.849
 control connections of the play four 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:53.300
 well this is the stand he has is 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:55.129
 quite sexy but here I take the opportunity to 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.349
 leave the command that grabs and with the 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:06:00.409
 triggers and is perfect and here behind 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:03.800
 we have a good bit of cables 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:05.569
 the router and the upl and 4 that I plan more 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.669
 forward to put it vertically for good 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:11.330
 so take advantage of a little space to 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:15.769
 here would have the ipad and basically this 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:18.919
 It's my setup, there's not much more, although I think 

00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:24.909
 that there is enough and now we are going to go with 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:24.909
 a small clip sebime and now you will see it 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:35.819
 Well, good guys, we're here in the 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.440
 bonus clip that good some already 

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:39.569
 surely you can imagine it and 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.199
 others and say on twitter you have seen 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:42.199
 photos even 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:50.160
 although dazzle as well here we are not 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:55.380
 I know if it will look great because there 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:58.480
 too much alone right now but this is 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.220
 my terrace 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:05.950
 nothing that is huge let's go a little 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:09.300
 around here I have therefore a table a 

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.300
 support for the umbrella 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:15.100
 I'm listening well but good 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:19.750
 here you see it is quite big and this 

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:23.400
 pillar here in the middle and well these are the 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.400
 views and with a panoramic
