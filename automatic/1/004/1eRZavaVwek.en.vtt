00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:23.590 
and it fills up biceps tendinitis so

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.229 
and it fills up biceps tendinitis so
people<00:00:23.890> often<00:00:23.980> say<00:00:24.250> oh<00:00:24.279> I've<00:00:24.640> got<00:00:24.820> biceps

that well the actual cause of that pain
in<00:00:33.520> the<00:00:33.640> biceps<00:00:34.090> tendons<00:00:34.600> is<00:00:34.960> actually<00:00:35.620> from<00:00:35.830> a

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
in the biceps tendons is actually from a

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.920 
in the biceps tendons is actually from a
muscle<00:00:36.160> on<00:00:36.400> the<00:00:36.490> back<00:00:36.640> of<00:00:36.850> the<00:00:36.940> of<00:00:37.540> the

muscle on the back of the of the

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.860 
muscle on the back of the of the
shoulder<00:00:38.290> blades<00:00:38.500> called<00:00:38.920> the<00:00:39.070> infraspinatus

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
shoulder blades called the infraspinatus

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.930 
shoulder blades called the infraspinatus
now<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.950> month<00:00:42.220> muscle<00:00:42.550> can<00:00:42.700> get<00:00:42.820> all

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
now that month muscle can get all

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.300 
now that month muscle can get all
knotted<00:00:43.180> up<00:00:43.420> and<00:00:43.630> tight<00:00:43.840> and<00:00:44.740> when<00:00:45.190> the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.310 
knotted up and tight and when the

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.200 
knotted up and tight and when the
infraspinatus<00:00:45.810> gets<00:00:46.829> knots<00:00:47.829> in<00:00:48.040> it<00:00:48.160> or<00:00:49.030> that

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
infraspinatus gets knots in it or that

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.180 
infraspinatus gets knots in it or that
everyone<00:00:49.480> do<00:00:49.660> is<00:00:49.780> they<00:00:49.900> can<00:00:50.050> refer<00:00:50.380> pain<00:00:50.770> down

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
everyone do is they can refer pain down

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.370

to the front of the arm and it so can

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.260 
to the front of the arm and it so can
actually<00:00:53.590> feel<00:00:53.800> like<00:00:53.829> the<00:00:54.190> pain<00:00:54.370> is<00:00:54.610> in<00:00:54.760> the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
actually feel like the pain is in the

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.569 
actually feel like the pain is in the
biceps<00:00:55.690> tendons<00:00:56.110> when<00:00:56.770> when<00:00:57.070> it's<00:00:57.220> not<00:00:57.400> the

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
biceps tendons when when it's not the

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.430 
biceps tendons when when it's not the
cause<00:00:57.790> of<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:57.970> pain<00:00:58.210> is<00:00:58.570> is<00:00:58.780> on<00:00:58.989> the<00:00:59.020> back<00:00:59.290> of

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
cause of the pain is is on the back of

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.950 
cause of the pain is is on the back of
the<00:00:59.500> shoulder<00:00:59.890> instead<00:01:00.730> so<00:01:01.300> what<00:01:01.510> I'll<00:01:01.630> do<00:01:01.840> in

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
the shoulder instead so what I'll do in

away the knots in your infraspinatus

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.600 
away the knots in your infraspinatus
using<00:01:10.240> the<00:01:10.330> help<00:01:10.510> of<00:01:10.630> a<00:01:10.750> friend<00:01:11.020> and<00:01:11.610> then

using the help of a friend and then
after<00:01:13.180> that<00:01:13.300> there's<00:01:13.570> a<00:01:13.630> session<00:01:13.810> in<00:01:14.050> the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
after that there's a session in the

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.040 
after that there's a session in the
video<00:01:14.380> that<00:01:14.470> just<00:01:14.860> explains<00:01:15.659> what<00:01:16.659> sort<00:01:16.990> of

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
video that just explains what sort of

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.440 
video that just explains what sort of
activities<00:01:17.620> can<00:01:18.010> can<00:01:18.700> constrain<00:01:19.210> the

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
activities can can constrain the

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.750 
activities can can constrain the
infraspinatus<00:01:19.780> in<00:01:20.380> everyday<00:01:20.740> life<00:01:20.920> so<00:01:21.370> for

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
infraspinatus in everyday life so for

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.789 
infraspinatus in everyday life so for
instance<00:01:22.060> putting<00:01:22.270> a<00:01:22.390> seatbelt<00:01:22.810> on<00:01:23.049> with

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
instance putting a seatbelt on with

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.060 
instance putting a seatbelt on with
improper<00:01:24.159> position<00:01:24.970> of<00:01:25.360> the<00:01:25.810> other<00:01:25.960> spine<00:01:26.350> and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
improper position of the other spine and

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.320 
improper position of the other spine and
I'll<00:01:27.190> just<00:01:27.340> kind<00:01:27.520> of<00:01:27.549> show<00:01:27.760> you<00:01:27.790> how<00:01:28.000> that<00:01:28.060> the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
I'll just kind of show you how that the

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.910 
I'll just kind of show you how that the
relationship<00:01:28.930> between<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.380> shoulder<00:01:29.740> blade

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
relationship between the shoulder blade

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.030 
relationship between the shoulder blade
and<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.220> arm<00:01:30.400> works<00:01:30.729> and<00:01:31.060> therefore<00:01:31.720> how<00:01:32.619> it

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
and the arm works and therefore how it

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.640 
and the arm works and therefore how it
is<00:01:33.220> possible<00:01:33.610> to<00:01:33.640> strain<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.180> infraspinatus

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
is possible to strain the infraspinatus

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.039 
is possible to strain the infraspinatus
so<00:01:35.650> have<00:01:36.549> a<00:01:36.580> look<00:01:36.670> at<00:01:36.790> video<00:01:36.909> and<00:01:37.420> let<00:01:37.930> me<00:01:37.960> know

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
so have a look at video and let me know

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.490 
so have a look at video and let me know
if<00:01:38.229> you've<00:01:38.320> got<00:01:38.409> any<00:01:38.440> questions<00:01:38.670> thanks

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
what you need to do is is lay down on

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.380 
what you need to do is is lay down on
you<00:01:44.680> from<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:45.460> then<00:01:45.700> you<00:01:45.790> need<00:01:45.970> to<00:01:46.090> get<00:01:46.240> your

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
you from and then you need to get your

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.630 
you from and then you need to get your
fit<00:01:46.600> your<00:01:47.080> friend<00:01:47.320> to<00:01:47.440> try<00:01:47.650> and<00:01:47.680> find<00:01:48.010> the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
fit your friend to try and find the

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.510 
fit your friend to try and find the
infraspinatus<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.500> best<00:01:50.650> way<00:01:50.830> to<00:01:50.860> find<00:01:51.250> it

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
infraspinatus so the best way to find it

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.880 
infraspinatus so the best way to find it
is<00:01:52.000> to<00:01:52.060> feel<00:01:53.050> longer<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.470> back<00:01:53.650> of<00:01:53.830> the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
is to feel longer the back of the

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.920 
is to feel longer the back of the
shoulder<00:01:54.340> blade<00:01:54.550> here<00:01:54.580> you<00:01:55.150> start<00:01:55.750> in<00:01:55.840> the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
shoulder blade here you start in the

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.590 
shoulder blade here you start in the
corner<00:01:56.350> of<00:01:56.440> the<00:01:56.590> shoulder<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:58.060> find<00:01:58.300> a<00:01:58.390> little

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
corner of the shoulder you find a little

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.050 
corner of the shoulder you find a little
bit<00:01:58.750> that<00:01:58.900> sticks<00:01:59.020> out<00:01:59.490> that<00:02:00.490> there<00:02:00.700> gives<00:02:00.970> you

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
bit that sticks out that there gives you

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.820 
bit that sticks out that there gives you
a<00:02:01.500> bony<00:02:02.500> Ridge<00:02:03.090> which<00:02:04.090> is<00:02:04.300> like<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:05.200> spine<00:02:05.560> of

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
a bony Ridge which is like the spine of

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.070 
a bony Ridge which is like the spine of
the<00:02:05.860> scapula<00:02:06.850> there<00:02:07.180> and<00:02:07.869> then<00:02:07.990> the

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
the scapula there and then the

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.749 
the scapula there and then the
infraspinatus<00:02:08.440> is<00:02:09.070> all<00:02:09.220> that<00:02:09.459> all<00:02:09.670> the

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
infraspinatus is all that all the

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.560 
infraspinatus is all that all the
muscles<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.840> lower<00:02:11.050> that<00:02:11.350> spine<00:02:11.800> and<00:02:12.570> then

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
muscles the lower that spine and then

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.290 
muscles the lower that spine and then
what<00:02:14.410> I<00:02:14.470> like<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.680> do<00:02:14.920> is<00:02:15.070> if<00:02:15.550> you<00:02:15.700> get<00:02:15.880> three

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
what I like to do is if you get three

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.320 
what I like to do is if you get three
fingers<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.170> then<00:02:17.470> pop<00:02:18.459> some<00:02:18.730> more<00:02:18.910> fingers

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
fingers and then pop some more fingers

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.199 
fingers and then pop some more fingers
on<00:02:19.480> top<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:21.190> can<00:02:21.340> get<00:02:21.489> quite<00:02:21.760> good<00:02:21.940> pressure

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
on top you can get quite good pressure

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.430 
on top you can get quite good pressure
and<00:02:22.840> you're<00:02:23.410> just<00:02:23.590> kind<00:02:23.800> of<00:02:23.860> fishing<00:02:24.550> around

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
and you're just kind of fishing around

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.790 
and you're just kind of fishing around
looking<00:02:26.440> for<00:02:26.739> some<00:02:27.670> rigid<00:02:28.209> bits<00:02:28.420> of<00:02:29.230> taught

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
looking for some rigid bits of taught

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.160 
looking for some rigid bits of taught
muscle<00:02:30.310> there<00:02:30.940> are<00:02:31.030> taught<00:02:31.239> bands<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:31.780> muscle

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
muscle there are taught bands of muscle

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.860 
muscle there are taught bands of muscle
and<00:02:32.700> usually<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:36.070> person<00:02:36.220> you're<00:02:36.489> helping

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
and usually the person you're helping

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.250 
and usually the person you're helping
will<00:02:37.870> give<00:02:38.080> you<00:02:38.170> feedback<00:02:40.080> because<00:02:41.080> they're

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
will give you feedback because they're

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.930 
will give you feedback because they're
probably<00:02:41.410> quite<00:02:42.190> a<00:02:42.250> little<00:02:42.370> pain<00:02:42.670> in<00:02:42.850> those

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
probably quite a little pain in those

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.270 
probably quite a little pain in those
areas<00:02:43.480> because<00:02:44.290> they'll<00:02:44.590> all<00:02:44.709> be<00:02:44.830> knotted<00:02:45.160> up

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
areas because they'll all be knotted up

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.460 
areas because they'll all be knotted up
and<00:02:45.610> I<00:02:45.670> can<00:02:45.850> feel<00:02:46.060> here<00:02:46.360> it's<00:02:46.989> in<00:02:47.080> where<00:02:47.260> we'll

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
and I can feel here it's in where we'll

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.570 
and I can feel here it's in where we'll
talk<00:02:48.060> ropey<00:02:49.060> bits<00:02:49.269> of<00:02:49.480> muscle<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:51.280> I'm<00:02:51.430> just

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
talk ropey bits of muscle and I'm just

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.020 
talk ropey bits of muscle and I'm just
kind<00:02:51.820> of<00:02:51.910> going<00:02:52.810> along<00:02:53.140> here<00:02:54.030> applying

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
kind of going along here applying

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.970 
kind of going along here applying
pressure<00:02:55.330> trying<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.230> break<00:02:56.440> down<00:02:56.470> these

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
pressure trying to break down these

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.150 
pressure trying to break down these
knots<00:02:57.280> in<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:58.450> infraspinatus<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.530> you<00:03:00.040> can

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
knots in the infraspinatus and you can

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.199 
knots in the infraspinatus and you can
work<00:03:00.340> out<00:03:00.610> here<00:03:01.260> not<00:03:02.260> so<00:03:02.440> bad<00:03:02.590> there<00:03:02.950> so<00:03:03.940> I<00:03:04.000> want

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
work out here not so bad there so I want

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.150 
work out here not so bad there so I want
to<00:03:04.299> try<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:04.600> find<00:03:04.810> me<00:03:04.989> and<00:03:05.470> then<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:05.830> middle

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
to try and find me and then the middle

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.580 
to try and find me and then the middle
section<00:03:06.580> of<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:06.760> fibers<00:03:07.269> most<00:03:08.080> of<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.350> lost

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
section of the fibers most of the lost

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.259 
section of the fibers most of the lost
him<00:03:08.860> to<00:03:09.010> lie<00:03:09.160> and<00:03:10.060> there'll<00:03:10.989> be<00:03:11.019> some<00:03:11.110> in<00:03:11.470> there

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
him to lie and there'll be some in there

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.789 
him to lie and there'll be some in there
okay<00:03:13.269> and<00:03:14.340> then<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.940> infraspinatus<00:03:16.799> covers

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
okay and then the infraspinatus covers

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.490 
okay and then the infraspinatus covers
the<00:03:17.980> whole<00:03:18.190> lower<00:03:18.880> side<00:03:19.269> of<00:03:19.299> the<00:03:19.540> of<00:03:20.380> the

the whole lower side of the of the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.020 
the whole lower side of the of the
scapula<00:03:21.070> say<00:03:22.170> that<00:03:23.170> they<00:03:23.350> can<00:03:23.530> be<00:03:23.760> tough<00:03:24.760> bits

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
scapula say that they can be tough bits

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.140 
scapula say that they can be tough bits
in<00:03:25.480> all<00:03:25.690> of<00:03:25.840> it<00:03:25.989> so<00:03:26.230> really<00:03:26.410> just<00:03:26.530> again<00:03:27.519> find

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
in all of it so really just again find

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.670 
in all of it so really just again find
that<00:03:28.239> scapular<00:03:28.660> spine<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:29.230> there's<00:03:29.350> anything

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
that scapular spine and there's anything

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.060 
that scapular spine and there's anything
in<00:03:30.549> the<00:03:30.760> bottom<00:03:31.030> section<00:03:31.410> has<00:03:32.410> potential<00:03:33.040> to

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
in the bottom section has potential to

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.920 
in the bottom section has potential to
have<00:03:33.250> not<00:03:33.459> seen<00:03:33.760> so<00:03:34.329> you<00:03:34.420> want<00:03:34.570> to<00:03:34.630> try<00:03:34.810> and

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
have not seen so you want to try and

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.110 
have not seen so you want to try and
explore<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.470> whole<00:03:35.500> area<00:03:36.100> with<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.880> feedback

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
explore the whole area with the feedback

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.789 
explore the whole area with the feedback
of<00:03:37.329> the<00:03:37.510> person<00:03:38.049> and<00:03:39.480> regular<00:03:40.480> treatments<00:03:41.049> of

of the person and regular treatments of
this<00:03:43.769> breaking<00:03:44.769> down<00:03:45.070> these<00:03:45.250> knots<00:03:45.750> should

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
this breaking down these knots should

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.289 
this breaking down these knots should
help<00:03:47.019> them<00:03:47.430> stop<00:03:48.430> your<00:03:48.610> shot<00:03:48.820> you're<00:03:48.970> an<00:03:49.120> arm

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299

pain when you're doing this course

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.710 
pain when you're doing this course
sometimes<00:03:52.959> it's<00:03:53.050> quite<00:03:53.260> interesting<00:03:53.940> when

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
sometimes it's quite interesting when

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.650 
sometimes it's quite interesting when
treating<00:03:56.320> somebody<00:03:56.590> here<00:03:56.980> is<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:58.510> they'll

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
treating somebody here is that they'll

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.000 
treating somebody here is that they'll
actually<00:03:58.810> feel<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.470> pain<00:03:59.770> of<00:04:00.180> this<00:04:01.180> massage

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
referring down the front of their arm

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.940 
referring down the front of their arm
into<00:04:04.840> they're<00:04:05.200> not<00:04:05.560> they're<00:04:05.710> biased

into they're not they're biased
attendants<00:04:06.670> and<00:04:07.050> then<00:04:08.520> that's<00:04:09.520> quite<00:04:09.850> a<00:04:10.120> good

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
attendants and then that's quite a good

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.380 
attendants and then that's quite a good
way<00:04:10.750> of<00:04:10.780> seeing<00:04:11.440> out<00:04:11.830> actual<00:04:12.670> pain<00:04:12.970> and<00:04:13.210> knots

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
way of seeing out actual pain and knots

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.020 
way of seeing out actual pain and knots
and<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:13.720> infraspinatus<00:04:14.730> actually<00:04:15.730> refer

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
and the infraspinatus actually refer

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.479 
and the infraspinatus actually refer
pain<00:04:16.420> to<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:17.049> front<00:04:17.320> of<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.530> arm<00:04:17.709> so<00:04:17.980> I<00:04:18.310> can

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
with the assistance of this this board

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.040 
with the assistance of this this board
here<00:04:33.789> which<00:04:33.940> I'm<00:04:34.090> pretending<00:04:34.389> is<00:04:34.659> a<00:04:34.690> vicious

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
here which I'm pretending is a vicious

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.320 
here which I'm pretending is a vicious
shoulder<00:04:35.500> blade<00:04:35.710> and<00:04:35.979> this<00:04:36.699> board<00:04:36.940> here<00:04:37.150> which

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
shoulder blade and this board here which

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.689 
shoulder blade and this board here which
I'm<00:04:37.509> pretending<00:04:37.870> is<00:04:38.080> an<00:04:38.199> arm<00:04:38.409> and<00:04:39.340> what<00:04:39.490> use

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
I'm pretending is an arm and what use

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.939 
I'm pretending is an arm and what use
needs<00:04:39.940> to<00:04:40.030> show<00:04:40.300> how<00:04:41.139> the<00:04:41.199> position<00:04:41.710> of<00:04:41.830> the

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
needs to show how the position of the

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.770 
needs to show how the position of the
the<00:04:42.190> shoulder<00:04:42.550> blades<00:04:42.789> on<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.389> upper<00:04:43.629> back

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
the shoulder blades on the upper back

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.749 
the shoulder blades on the upper back
can<00:04:44.379> affect<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.860> amount<00:04:44.919> of<00:04:45.190> work<00:04:45.400> that<00:04:45.430> the

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 
can affect the amount of work that the

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:49.350 
can affect the amount of work that the
infraspinatus<00:04:46.300> has<00:04:46.960> to<00:04:47.110> do<00:04:47.259> so<00:04:48.099> if<00:04:48.490> you

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
infraspinatus has to do so if you

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.430 
infraspinatus has to do so if you
imagine<00:04:49.449> that<00:04:50.430> I<00:04:51.430> just<00:04:52.300> plant<00:04:52.599> this<00:04:52.780> here<00:04:52.840> on

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
imagine that I just plant this here on

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.339 
imagine that I just plant this here on
the<00:04:53.500> on<00:04:53.949> on<00:04:54.159> the<00:04:54.250> shoulder<00:04:54.580> blade<00:04:54.789> there<00:04:55.349> and

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:56.349 
the on on the shoulder blade there and

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:57.719 
the on on the shoulder blade there and
then<00:04:56.500> this<00:04:56.620> is<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:56.949> arm<00:04:57.129> that's<00:04:57.490> kind<00:04:57.699> of

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
then this is the arm that's kind of

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.570 
then this is the arm that's kind of
attached<00:04:58.090> this<00:04:58.780> is<00:04:58.930> the<00:04:59.169> humerus<00:04:59.620> here<00:04:59.860> that's

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
attached this is the humerus here that's

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.689 
attached this is the humerus here that's
attached<00:05:00.940> to<00:05:01.180> this<00:05:01.300> shoulder<00:05:01.690> blade<00:05:02.699> the

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
attached to this shoulder blade the

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:07.230 
attached to this shoulder blade the
infraspinatus<00:05:04.240> kind<00:05:04.990> of<00:05:05.050> works<00:05:05.259> to<00:05:06.060> bring<00:05:07.060> me

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
infraspinatus kind of works to bring me

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.749 
infraspinatus kind of works to bring me
on<00:05:07.389> back<00:05:07.810> here<00:05:08.169> like<00:05:08.409> this<00:05:08.560> relative<00:05:09.159> to<00:05:09.669> the
