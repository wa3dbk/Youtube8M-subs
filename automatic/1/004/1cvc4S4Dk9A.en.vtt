 they are very very pretty yes and that is 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.100
 actually a problem as an artist 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.260
 if you are so pretty then everyone talks 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.689
 only by appearance and not at all 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.640
 talent of what you do and what you do 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.439
 says this is really the problem of the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:32.279
 pretty artist I speak from my own 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:34.140
 I mostly experience my ladies and 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.809
 gentlemen make his big applause for 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.980
 jenny gets screwed and everyone follows together 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.980

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.510
 Hello 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.089
 our next piece is the elvis 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:03.729
 presley of the nineteenth century 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:05.860
 franz liszt if the on the wing 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:08.830
 sat there immediately all in the room 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.690
 stormed and crowded and beyond 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.240
 he was also a real striker 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.320
 and the noble ladies succeeded 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.630
 to his feet 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.080
 oh yes and he lay down with everyone 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.420
 occasion to his second Hungarian 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.450
 rhapsody is not composed for two 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.310
 wings only for one and so on 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.500
 of course we have a problem that 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.670
 same as liszt and his playmates 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.049
 who is allowed to go up 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.690
 I have a whole for this problem 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:41.429
 simple solution I will also 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.429
 just as much better seen by the audience 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.119
 I play around 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.460
 I do not feel like doing it at all 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.460
 Nothing 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:01.910
 I would like to have said today 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.170
 plays open moment with funds we had 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.390
 as I said tomorrow you 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.580
 yesterday ground did not play at all 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:12.680
 Today, the list is what you are on 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.080
 spieÃŸer you'll get a list that's yes 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:21.550
 agrees that it is necessary at 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.550
 you wait for the people so 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.389
 now wobbles too 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.230
 we said I play up you 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.230
 sits up 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.090
 No 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.920
 you'll never call now a bit 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.920
 then help what a coincidence 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.930
 say you are actually musical 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.050
 semi-musical that's you 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.220
 sing only when closed 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:05.860
 bathroom door or leave it 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:11.980
 Rhythm feel yes in the air 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:14.250
 yes yes we test that now stretches the 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.250
 hand out 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:20.700
 I explain the principle works 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:34.390
 just always when the woman is not 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:41.590
 do you work you know from home 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:43.030
 It's so nice at home too 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.410
 At the same time, it's great to have one now 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.270
 small difficulty 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:53.320
 We are two women, you are alone 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:54.760
 that's for me we have such a thing 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.790
 had thought and that you look 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:02.790
 always on the genie but you you listen to 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.790
 me to me 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:07.110
 emphasis 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.110
 on 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:16.410
 yes, so you just spread the 

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.750

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:22.610
