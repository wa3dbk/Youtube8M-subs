00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.720 
right out I like to use the bearings
without<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.500> seals<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:44.160> they're<00:02:44.340> easier<00:02:44.700> to

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
without the seals so they're easier to

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.509 
without the seals so they're easier to
lube<00:02:45.090> but<00:02:45.690> if<00:02:45.810> you<00:02:45.959> fish<00:02:46.230> in<00:02:46.440> rivers<00:02:46.470> or<00:02:47.100> places

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
lube but if you fish in rivers or places

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.520 
lube but if you fish in rivers or places
with<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.790> lot<00:02:47.970> of<00:02:48.000> sediment<00:02:48.630> or<00:02:48.750> contaminants<00:02:49.320> I

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
with a lot of sediment or contaminants I

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.460 
with a lot of sediment or contaminants I
suggest<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.670> leave<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.120> seals<00:02:51.390> in<00:02:51.840> so

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
suggest you to leave the seals in so

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.170 
suggest you to leave the seals in so
after<00:02:52.829> you<00:02:52.920> remove<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.190> seals<00:02:53.579> and<00:02:53.790> loop<00:02:54.000> the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
after you remove the seals and loop the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.569 
after you remove the seals and loop the
bearings<00:02:54.570> you<00:02:55.200> can<00:02:55.380> put<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.739> seals<00:02:56.070> back<00:02:56.280> in

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
bearings you can put the seals back in

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:11.770 
bearings you can put the seals back in
for<00:02:57.180> me<00:02:57.329> where<00:02:57.750> I'm<00:02:57.840> going<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:58.109> skip<00:02:58.350> this<00:02:58.500> step

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.480 

all<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:13.050> need<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.260> do<00:03:13.500> is<00:03:13.740> to<00:03:13.920> put<00:03:14.070> a<00:03:14.100> drop<00:03:14.460> of

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
all you need to do is to put a drop of

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:30.170 
all you need to do is to put a drop of
oil<00:03:14.850> in<00:03:15.180> it

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.520 

the<00:03:31.180> first<00:03:31.390> bearing<00:03:31.749> we're<00:03:31.930> going<00:03:32.140> to<00:03:32.230> review

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
the first bearing we're going to review

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.009 
the first bearing we're going to review
replacing<00:03:33.219> is<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.459> side<00:03:33.790> plate<00:03:34.060> bearing<00:03:34.329> you

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
replacing is a side plate bearing you

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.379 
replacing is a side plate bearing you
can<00:03:35.170> see<00:03:35.409> there's<00:03:35.590> a<00:03:35.680> retainer<00:03:36.219> on<00:03:36.549> here<00:03:36.849> we're

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
can see there's a retainer on here we're

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.750 
can see there's a retainer on here we're
going<00:03:37.540> to<00:03:37.659> have<00:03:37.870> to<00:03:38.019> remove<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.469> retainer<00:03:38.889> put

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
going to have to remove the retainer put

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.360 
going to have to remove the retainer put
the<00:03:39.879> finger<00:03:40.329> on<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:41.349> retainer<00:03:41.739> otherwise

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
the finger on the retainer otherwise

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.369 
the finger on the retainer otherwise
it's<00:03:42.609> going<00:03:42.760> to<00:03:42.849> pop<00:03:43.060> out<00:03:43.299> and<00:03:43.510> take<00:03:44.109> a<00:03:44.139> small

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
it's going to pop out and take a small

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:50.729 
it's going to pop out and take a small
screwdriver<00:03:45.099> and<00:03:49.019> pop<00:03:50.019> it<00:03:50.170> out<00:03:50.290> just<00:03:50.530> like

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
screwdriver and pop it out just like

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:58.020 
screwdriver and pop it out just like
that<00:03:50.799> and<00:03:54.030> then<00:03:55.030> all<00:03:55.209> you<00:03:55.389> have<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.569> do<00:03:56.310> is<00:03:57.310> to

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
that and then all you have to do is to

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:06.589 
that and then all you have to do is to
remove<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.480> bearing<00:04:02.909> put<00:04:03.909> the<00:04:04.030> new<00:04:04.180> one<00:04:04.389> in

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:22.780 

and<00:04:09.060> reinstall<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.090> retainer

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.850 

and<00:04:23.790> there<00:04:24.389> you<00:04:24.510> go<00:04:24.660> one<00:04:25.110> down<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:28.560> next<00:04:28.830> thing

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
and there you go one down the next thing

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.800 
and there you go one down the next thing
we're<00:04:29.160> going<00:04:29.310> to<00:04:29.400> do<00:04:29.610> is<00:04:30.120> to<00:04:30.300> replace<00:04:30.630> the

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.160 
we're going to put the reel back

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:48.870 
we're going to put the reel back
together

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 
together

and there you have it the upgrade is
done<00:07:29.510> there<00:07:30.500> are<00:07:30.620> several<00:07:30.830> reasons<00:07:31.130> why<00:07:31.520> you

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:31.580 
done there are several reasons why you

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.370 
done there are several reasons why you
want<00:07:31.910> to<00:07:32.060> operate<00:07:32.360> the<00:07:32.480> bearings<00:07:32.990> on<00:07:33.200> your

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:33.380 
want to operate the bearings on your

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.520 
want to operate the bearings on your
dial<00:07:33.590> of<00:07:33.740> reels<00:07:34.070> the<00:07:34.280> boga<00:07:34.820> mx7<00:07:35.690> bearings<00:07:36.200> are

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:36.530 
dial of reels the boga mx7 bearings are

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.320 
dial of reels the boga mx7 bearings are
made<00:07:36.770> better<00:07:37.010> than<00:07:37.370> the<00:07:37.550> stock<00:07:37.790> bearings

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:38.330 
made better than the stock bearings

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.270 
made better than the stock bearings
which<00:07:38.810> in<00:07:38.990> turn<00:07:39.170> is<00:07:39.380> going<00:07:39.470> to<00:07:39.770> give<00:07:40.010> you<00:07:40.250> a

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:40.280 
which in turn is going to give you a

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.870 
which in turn is going to give you a
longer<00:07:40.760> cast<00:07:41.230> easier<00:07:42.230> startup<00:07:42.860> and<00:07:43.070> a<00:07:43.670> more

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:43.880 
longer cast easier startup and a more

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.730 
longer cast easier startup and a more
consistent<00:07:44.000> cast<00:07:44.780> which<00:07:45.050> means<00:07:45.260> that<00:07:45.470> you<00:07:45.590> can

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:45.740 
consistent cast which means that you can

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.070 
consistent cast which means that you can
cast<00:07:45.950> lighter<00:07:46.310> lures<00:07:46.790> at<00:07:47.270> a<00:07:47.330> further<00:07:47.720> distance

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 
cast lighter lures at a further distance

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.070 
cast lighter lures at a further distance
and<00:07:48.560> your<00:07:48.890> cast<00:07:49.130> will<00:07:49.340> be<00:07:49.460> more<00:07:49.670> consistent

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080 
and your cast will be more consistent

00:07:50.080 --> 00:08:00.510 
and your cast will be more consistent
now<00:07:51.080> to<00:07:51.140> order<00:07:51.380> your<00:07:51.530> bearings<00:07:52.070> you<00:07:52.460> can<00:07:52.580> go<00:07:52.730> to

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:00.520
