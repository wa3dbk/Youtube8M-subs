finishing<00:00:02.970> up<00:00:03.090> our<00:00:03.300> page<00:00:03.600> on<00:00:03.929> cerebral<00:00:04.500> spinal

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
finishing up our page on cerebral spinal

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.789 
finishing up our page on cerebral spinal
fluid<00:00:04.980> and<00:00:05.580> now<00:00:06.420> you<00:00:06.480> can<00:00:06.779> see<00:00:07.080> this<00:00:07.560> would<00:00:07.770> be

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
fluid and now you can see this would be

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.799 
fluid and now you can see this would be
the<00:00:08.040> back<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.460> someone's<00:00:08.670> head<00:00:09.000> here<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.570> ears

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
the back of someone's head here the ears

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.320 
the back of someone's head here the ears
you<00:00:10.230> can<00:00:10.320> see<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.620> lateral<00:00:11.010> ventricles<00:00:11.580> let's

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
you can see the lateral ventricles let's

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.390 
you can see the lateral ventricles let's
go<00:00:12.480> ahead<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:13.019> see<00:00:13.710> how<00:00:13.889> much<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.280> can

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
go ahead and see how much you can

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.380 
go ahead and see how much you can
recognize<00:00:14.759> so<00:00:15.630> these<00:00:15.839> are<00:00:16.850> the<00:00:17.850> lateral

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
recognize so these are the lateral

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.019 
recognize so these are the lateral
ventricles<00:00:18.990> in<00:00:19.199> blue<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:21.439> separating<00:00:22.439> them

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
ventricles in blue and separating them

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:31.359 
ventricles in blue and separating them
from<00:00:24.029> each<00:00:24.210> other<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.890> the<00:00:25.890> septum<00:00:27.109> pellucidum

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.470 

actually<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:32.610> they<00:00:32.730> just<00:00:33.059> see<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.360> these

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
actually so they just see it in these

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.540 
actually so they just see it in these
two<00:00:33.719> different<00:00:34.079> views<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:35.450> then<00:00:36.450> next<00:00:37.280> be<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
two different views and then next be the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.700 
two different views and then next be the
third<00:00:39.770> ventricle<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.780> then<00:00:42.780> after<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.379> in

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
third ventricle and then after that in

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.880 
third ventricle and then after that in
orange<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:45.320> fourth<00:00:46.370> ventricle<00:00:48.649> can<00:00:49.649> color

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
orange the fourth ventricle can color

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.670 
orange the fourth ventricle can color
the<00:00:50.160> choroid<00:00:50.430> plexus<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.660> purple<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.530> is

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
the choroid plexus is in purple this is

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.069 
the choroid plexus is in purple this is
where<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.070> cerebral<00:00:53.520> spinal<00:00:53.550> fluid<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.719> being

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
where the cerebral spinal fluid is being

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.549 
where the cerebral spinal fluid is being
formed<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.600> then<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.719> connections<00:00:58.350> between

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
formed and then the connections between

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.020 
formed and then the connections between
them<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.280> yellow<00:00:59.719> so<00:01:00.719> they're<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.170> inter

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
them and yellow so they're the inter

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.899 
them and yellow so they're the inter
vertebral<00:01:04.010> or<00:01:05.010> sorry<00:01:05.250> interventricular

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
vertebral or sorry interventricular

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.550 
vertebral or sorry interventricular
foramen<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:07.020> then<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:08.299> cerebral<00:01:09.299> aqueduct

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
foramen and then the cerebral aqueduct

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.219 
foramen and then the cerebral aqueduct
and<00:01:10.560> then<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.100> apertures<00:01:11.869> that<00:01:12.869> leave<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
and then the apertures that leave the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.640 
and then the apertures that leave the
fourth<00:01:13.500> ventricle

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
fourth ventricle

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.440 
fourth ventricle
okay<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.890> view<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.340> also<00:01:17.759> good<00:01:17.970> because<00:01:18.150> it

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
okay this view is also good because it

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.550 
okay this view is also good because it
gives<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.990> your<00:01:19.350> first<00:01:19.409> view<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.729> sinuses

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
gives you your first view of the sinuses

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.200 
gives you your first view of the sinuses
so<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> sinuses<00:01:23.280> are<00:01:23.520> blood<00:01:23.970> filled<00:01:24.439> spaces

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
so the sinuses are blood filled spaces

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.980 
so the sinuses are blood filled spaces
that<00:01:28.400> reabsorb<00:01:29.400> cerebral<00:01:30.030> spinal<00:01:30.150> fluid<00:01:30.479> and

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
that reabsorb cerebral spinal fluid and

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.649 
that reabsorb cerebral spinal fluid and
then<00:01:31.320> all<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.430> blood<00:01:32.729> flows<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.360> enters

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
then all of that blood flows and enters

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.890 
then all of that blood flows and enters
the<00:01:33.750> jugular<00:01:34.350> veins<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.860> drain<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.640> head<00:01:35.909> and

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
the jugular veins to drain the head and

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.749 
the jugular veins to drain the head and
neck<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:38.780> wherever<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:40.409> going<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.250> use<00:01:41.369> blue

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
neck so wherever you going to use blue

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:49.790 
neck so wherever you going to use blue
for<00:01:42.119> this

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.520 

actually<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.700> wish<00:01:50.910> I<00:01:51.060> had<00:01:51.210> not<00:01:52.670> gone<00:01:53.670> around

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
actually I wish I had not gone around

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.170 
actually I wish I had not gone around
just<00:01:55.530> leave<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.890> side<00:01:56.160> empty<00:01:56.550> ideally<00:01:57.030> I

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
just leave that side empty ideally I

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.440 
just leave that side empty ideally I
would<00:01:57.300> just<00:01:57.480> have<00:01:57.690> it<00:01:57.840> here<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.500> here<00:01:59.450> these

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
would just have it here and here these

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:08.000 
would just have it here and here these
transverse<00:02:01.080> sinuses<00:02:05.900> so<00:02:06.900> this<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.320> called<00:02:07.650> the

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
transverse sinuses so this is called the

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:16.610 
transverse sinuses so this is called the
transverse<00:02:10.250> sinus

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.240 

and<00:02:16.830> this<00:02:17.550> part<00:02:17.819> at<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.030> top<00:02:18.980> right<00:02:19.980> through

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
and this part at the top right through

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.980 
and this part at the top right through
here<00:02:20.959> is<00:02:21.959> called<00:02:22.379> the<00:02:22.440> superior

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.870 

sagital

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.949 

sinus

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
sinus

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.380 
sinus
so<00:02:33.530> these<00:02:33.709> are<00:02:33.920> one<00:02:34.489> blood-filled<00:02:34.879> space<00:02:35.209> up

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
so these are one blood-filled space up

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.959 
so these are one blood-filled space up
here<00:02:35.629> and<00:02:35.750> then<00:02:35.840> here<00:02:36.109> and<00:02:36.230> here<00:02:36.530> if<00:02:36.890> you<00:02:37.579> redo

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:37.969 
here and then here and here if you redo

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.179 
here and then here and here if you redo
your<00:02:38.000> notes<00:02:38.420> or<00:02:38.689> something<00:02:38.870> I<00:02:39.200> wish<00:02:39.769> I<00:02:39.890> had<00:02:40.040> not

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:40.189 
your notes or something I wish I had not

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:42.039 
your notes or something I wish I had not
colored<00:02:40.670> in<00:02:40.819> the<00:02:40.939> blood<00:02:41.150> here<00:02:41.569> not<00:02:41.810> to<00:02:41.930> say

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
colored in the blood here not to say

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.240 
colored in the blood here not to say
there's<00:02:42.230> no<00:02:42.349> blood<00:02:42.590> on<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.799> surface<00:02:43.099> of<00:02:43.189> the

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
there's no blood on the surface of the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.649 
there's no blood on the surface of the
brain<00:02:43.459> there<00:02:43.700> but<00:02:43.849> that's<00:02:44.030> not<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.209> sinus

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
brain there but that's not a sinus

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.119 
brain there but that's not a sinus
you've<00:02:44.870> got<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.170> suit<00:02:45.439> the<00:02:45.590> superior

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
you've got the suit the superior

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.569 
you've got the suit the superior
sagittal<00:02:46.310> sinus<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:47.209> then<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:47.959> transverse

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
sagittal sinus and then the transverse

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.569 
sagittal sinus and then the transverse
sinuses<00:02:49.579> that<00:02:49.819> can<00:02:49.969> reabsorb<00:02:51.579> cerebral

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
sinuses that can reabsorb cerebral

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.259 
sinuses that can reabsorb cerebral
spinal<00:02:52.700> fluid<00:02:53.030> okay<00:02:53.689> now<00:02:54.760> we'll<00:02:55.760> take<00:02:55.939> a<00:02:55.969> look

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
spinal fluid okay now we'll take a look

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.940 
spinal fluid okay now we'll take a look
up<00:02:56.420> here<00:02:57.939> more<00:02:58.939> closely<00:02:59.269> at<00:02:59.750> the<00:03:00.170> movement<00:03:00.829> of

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
up here more closely at the movement of

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.589 
up here more closely at the movement of
the<00:03:01.069> CSF<00:03:02.650> so<00:03:03.650> this<00:03:04.099> is<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.489> sinus<00:03:05.000> right<00:03:05.269> here

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
the CSF so this is the sinus right here

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:12.600 
the CSF so this is the sinus right here
from<00:03:05.840> a<00:03:05.959> sagittal<00:03:06.470> view

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.810 

we<00:03:13.090> will<00:03:13.270> use<00:03:13.420> hatch<00:03:13.630> marks<00:03:14.050> maybe<00:03:14.440> a<00:03:14.620> little

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
we will use hatch marks maybe a little

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:38.500 
we will use hatch marks maybe a little
easier<00:03:15.820> to<00:03:16.200> color<00:03:17.200> it<00:03:17.470> in

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.899 

okay<00:03:39.290> so<00:03:39.349> all<00:03:39.680> of<00:03:39.860> this<00:03:39.980> is<00:03:40.159> filled<00:03:40.430> with<00:03:40.519> blood

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:40.909 
okay so all of this is filled with blood

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:45.300 
okay so all of this is filled with blood
back<00:03:41.209> here<00:03:41.540> and<00:03:42.260> at<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.709> top<00:03:42.920> we<00:03:42.950> call<00:03:43.430> it<00:03:43.640> a

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
back here and at the top we call it a

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.330 
back here and at the top we call it a
superior<00:03:46.310> because<00:03:46.909> it's<00:03:47.209> at<00:03:47.330> the<00:03:47.420> top

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
superior because it's at the top

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.680 
superior because it's at the top
sagittal<00:03:49.340> because<00:03:50.030> it's<00:03:50.180> between<00:03:50.330> the<00:03:50.659> two

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
sagittal because it's between the two

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.729 
sagittal because it's between the two
sides<00:03:51.200> of<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:52.010> cerebrum<00:03:52.989> sinus<00:03:53.989> because<00:03:54.560> it's

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
sides of the cerebrum sinus because it's

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.309 
sides of the cerebrum sinus because it's
a<00:03:54.830> cavity<00:03:55.370> and<00:03:55.580> in<00:03:55.849> this<00:03:55.970> case<00:03:56.269> it's<00:03:56.989> blood

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
a cavity and in this case it's blood

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:04.070 
a cavity and in this case it's blood
filled

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.710 

and<00:04:04.680> it<00:04:04.770> collects<00:04:05.990> CSF

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.760 

and<00:04:09.960> drains

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.430 

from<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:13.520> head

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.900 

eventually<00:04:17.239> merging<00:04:18.239> into<00:04:18.420> the<00:04:19.910> jugular

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
eventually merging into the jugular

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.960 
eventually merging into the jugular
veins<00:04:21.300> then<00:04:22.050> the<00:04:22.170> transverse<00:04:22.710> sinus<00:04:23.130> here<00:04:23.550> is

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
veins then the transverse sinus here is

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.140 
veins then the transverse sinus here is
also<00:04:24.420> important<00:04:24.960> in<00:04:25.230> collecting<00:04:26.220> CSF<00:04:29.090> okay<00:04:30.090> so

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
also important in collecting CSF okay so

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.410 
also important in collecting CSF okay so
now<00:04:30.510> we're<00:04:30.750> going<00:04:30.900> to<00:04:31.020> use<00:04:31.170> a<00:04:31.770> pink<00:04:32.430> pen<00:04:32.760> to

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
now we're going to use a pink pen to

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.950 
now we're going to use a pink pen to
show<00:04:33.660> where<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.800> circle<00:04:35.250> spinal<00:04:35.670> fluid<00:04:36.030> is<00:04:36.090> so

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
show where the circle spinal fluid is so

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.260 
show where the circle spinal fluid is so
it<00:04:37.050> comes<00:04:37.290> out<00:04:37.740> the<00:04:38.340> apertures<00:04:38.910> from<00:04:39.150> the

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
it comes out the apertures from the

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.600 
it comes out the apertures from the
fourth<00:04:39.540> ventricles<00:04:40.140> and<00:04:40.410> it<00:04:40.980> can<00:04:41.130> go<00:04:41.220> up<00:04:41.460> and

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
fourth ventricles and it can go up and

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.070 
fourth ventricles and it can go up and
around<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:42.600> back<00:04:42.840> of<00:04:43.190> the<00:04:44.190> cerebellum<00:04:44.880> and<00:04:45.090> it

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
around the back of the cerebellum and it

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:53.150 
around the back of the cerebellum and it
can<00:04:46.230> go<00:04:46.350> up<00:04:46.560> and<00:04:46.920> around<00:04:48.530> the<00:04:49.530> brain<00:04:51.470> in<00:04:52.470> what's

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
can go up and around the brain in what's

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.310 
can go up and around the brain in what's
called<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.640> subarachnoid<00:04:54.240> space

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.140 

and<00:04:59.410> in<00:05:00.280> the<00:05:00.640> superior<00:05:01.240> sagittal<00:05:01.450> sinus<00:05:01.780> and

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
and in the superior sagittal sinus and

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.260 
and in the superior sagittal sinus and
other<00:05:04.150> sinuses<00:05:04.900> there<00:05:05.230> are<00:05:05.910> thinned<00:05:06.910> out

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
other sinuses there are thinned out

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.880 
other sinuses there are thinned out
areas<00:05:07.960> of<00:05:08.290> the<00:05:08.770> subarachnoid<00:05:09.160> space<00:05:09.670> where<00:05:10.210> it

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
areas of the subarachnoid space where it

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.150 
areas of the subarachnoid space where it
dumps<00:05:11.890> into<00:05:12.840> the<00:05:13.840> sinus<00:05:14.590> into<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:14.950> blood

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
dumps into the sinus into the blood

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.540 
dumps into the sinus into the blood
filled<00:05:15.400> cavity<00:05:15.610> and<00:05:16.090> then<00:05:17.050> it's<00:05:17.440> a<00:05:17.890> reversal

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
filled cavity and then it's a reversal

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.860 
filled cavity and then it's a reversal
of<00:05:18.760> what<00:05:18.970> happened<00:05:19.300> in<00:05:19.390> the<00:05:19.480> choroid<00:05:19.720> plexus

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
of what happened in the choroid plexus

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.660 
of what happened in the choroid plexus
now<00:05:20.620> the<00:05:21.490> fluid<00:05:21.940> is<00:05:22.390> pressed<00:05:23.020> back<00:05:23.350> into<00:05:24.040> the

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
now the fluid is pressed back into the

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:31.620 
now the fluid is pressed back into the
low-pressure<00:05:25.120> system<00:05:25.690> of<00:05:25.870> the<00:05:26.140> sinus<00:05:30.570> okay<00:05:31.570> so

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
low-pressure system of the sinus okay so

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.210 
low-pressure system of the sinus okay so
in<00:05:31.990> pink<00:05:34.050> try<00:05:35.050> to<00:05:35.110> fit<00:05:35.350> all<00:05:35.530> this<00:05:35.830> up<00:05:36.010> at<00:05:36.130> the

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
in pink try to fit all this up at the

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:44.460 
in pink try to fit all this up at the
top<00:05:36.430> here<00:05:38.220> the<00:05:39.220> CSF<00:05:40.530> flows<00:05:42.150> up<00:05:43.150> and<00:05:43.630> around<00:05:44.050> the

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
top here the CSF flows up and around the

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.760 
top here the CSF flows up and around the
blank<00:05:44.800> brain

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.429 

in<00:05:49.860> the<00:05:50.460> subarachnoid<00:05:50.760> space

00:05:55.429 --> 00:05:55.439 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:58.339 

and<00:05:55.529> like<00:05:56.369> I<00:05:56.489> mentioned<00:05:56.909> before<00:05:57.229> we're<00:05:58.229> going

00:05:58.339 --> 00:05:58.349 
and like I mentioned before we're going

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:02.029 
and like I mentioned before we're going
to<00:05:58.409> learn<00:05:58.649> about<00:05:58.860> that<00:05:59.189> in<00:05:59.989> coming<00:06:00.989> pages<00:06:01.589> I'm

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 
to learn about that in coming pages I'm

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:03.439 
to learn about that in coming pages I'm
going<00:06:02.249> to<00:06:02.309> tell<00:06:02.489> you<00:06:02.639> all<00:06:02.879> about<00:06:03.149> the

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449 
going to tell you all about the

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:05.659 
going to tell you all about the
subarachnoid<00:06:03.809> space<00:06:04.229> and<00:06:04.889> where<00:06:05.069> it<00:06:05.219> is<00:06:05.339> and

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
subarachnoid space and where it is and

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:08.570 
subarachnoid space and where it is and
why<00:06:06.119> it's<00:06:06.269> called<00:06:06.479> that<00:06:06.679> so<00:06:07.679> the<00:06:08.069> fluid<00:06:08.429> moves

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
why it's called that so the fluid moves

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.629 
why it's called that so the fluid moves
up<00:06:08.849> and<00:06:09.029> around<00:06:09.269> the<00:06:09.509> subarachnoid<00:06:09.839> space

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 
up and around the subarachnoid space

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:13.339 
up and around the subarachnoid space
subme<00:06:11.639> below<00:06:12.029> and<00:06:12.360> then<00:06:12.539> arachnoid<00:06:13.110> these

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:13.349 
subme below and then arachnoid these

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:21.469 
subme below and then arachnoid these
like<00:06:14.069> a<00:06:14.099> spider<00:06:15.679> webbing<00:06:16.679> almost<00:06:18.739> in<00:06:20.479> the

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
like a spider webbing almost in the

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:33.169 
like a spider webbing almost in the
superior<00:06:22.229> sagittal<00:06:23.069> sinus<00:06:29.389> arachnoid<00:06:32.179> villi

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:33.179 
superior sagittal sinus arachnoid villi

00:06:33.179 --> 00:06:37.180 
superior sagittal sinus arachnoid villi
that's<00:06:33.779> these<00:06:34.019> things

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.460 

actually<00:06:38.060> in<00:06:38.180> all<00:06:38.330> of<00:06:38.540> the<00:06:38.690> sinuses<00:06:39.170> of<00:06:39.230> the

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.470 
actually in all of the sinuses of the

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.460 
actually in all of the sinuses of the
brain<00:06:39.680> and<00:06:39.920> the<00:06:40.430> blood<00:06:40.580> sinuses<00:06:41.180> that<00:06:41.420> is<00:06:41.600> the

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.470 
brain and the blood sinuses that is the

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:56.070 
brain and the blood sinuses that is the
arachnoid<00:06:42.920> villi<00:06:46.450> allow<00:06:48.820> CSF<00:06:49.870> to<00:06:50.870> rejoin

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.080 

the<00:06:56.560> blood<00:06:56.800> supply

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.090 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.750 

so<00:07:00.690> in<00:07:00.930> the<00:07:01.200> subarachnoid<00:07:01.710> space<00:07:02.130> this<00:07:02.610> is

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:02.760 
so in the subarachnoid space this is

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:09.860 
so in the subarachnoid space this is
clear<00:07:03.090> fluid<00:07:03.570> that<00:07:04.050> is<00:07:04.260> pressed<00:07:05.960> back<00:07:06.960> in<00:07:08.870> to

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:09.870 
clear fluid that is pressed back in to

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:10.850 
clear fluid that is pressed back in to
the<00:07:09.990> blood<00:07:10.200> supply

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:10.860 
the blood supply

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.200 
the blood supply
so<00:07:11.190> in<00:07:11.310> the<00:07:11.430> choroid<00:07:11.639> plexus<00:07:12.360> the<00:07:13.110> CSF<00:07:14.210> comes

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.210 
so in the choroid plexus the CSF comes

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.240 
so in the choroid plexus the CSF comes
out<00:07:15.419> of<00:07:15.750> the<00:07:15.930> blood<00:07:16.139> supply<00:07:16.350> and<00:07:16.860> into<00:07:17.160> the

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:17.250 
out of the blood supply and into the

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.040 
out of the blood supply and into the
ventricles<00:07:17.790> then<00:07:18.270> it<00:07:18.480> flows<00:07:18.720> from<00:07:18.750> the

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.050 
ventricles then it flows from the

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.420 
ventricles then it flows from the
lateral<00:07:19.470> ventricles<00:07:19.980> to<00:07:20.100> the<00:07:20.190> third

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:20.430 
lateral ventricles to the third

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.280 
lateral ventricles to the third
ventricle<00:07:20.669> to<00:07:21.060> the<00:07:21.330> fourth<00:07:21.570> ventricle<00:07:21.750> and

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:22.290 
ventricle to the fourth ventricle and

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:26.420 
ventricle to the fourth ventricle and
then<00:07:22.680> up<00:07:22.919> and<00:07:23.190> around<00:07:23.520> the<00:07:23.880> brain<00:07:24.090> and<00:07:24.600> in<00:07:25.530> the

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:26.430 
then up and around the brain and in the

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.300 
then up and around the brain and in the
sinuses<00:07:27.360> here<00:07:27.690> we<00:07:27.780> can<00:07:27.930> put<00:07:28.110> one<00:07:28.290> and<00:07:29.130> the

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.310 
sinuses here we can put one and the

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:33.530 
sinuses here we can put one and the
transverse<00:07:29.820> sinus<00:07:30.300> as<00:07:30.540> well<00:07:31.250> then<00:07:32.250> that<00:07:32.580> CSF

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:33.540 
transverse sinus as well then that CSF

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.350 
transverse sinus as well then that CSF
can<00:07:33.840> rejoin<00:07:34.380> the<00:07:34.800> blood<00:07:35.040> stream<00:07:35.310> so<00:07:36.210> it's

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 
can rejoin the blood stream so it's

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:41.090 
can rejoin the blood stream so it's
circulating<00:07:38.150> okay<00:07:39.150> another<00:07:39.710> way<00:07:40.710> that<00:07:40.740> the

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:41.100 
circulating okay another way that the

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:46.240 
circulating okay another way that the
CSF<00:07:41.820> can<00:07:42.060> flow<00:07:42.330> is<00:07:42.950> down<00:07:43.950> the<00:07:44.460> central<00:07:44.880> canal

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:46.250 
CSF can flow is down the central canal

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.070 
CSF can flow is down the central canal
but<00:07:47.250> this<00:07:47.430> is<00:07:47.610> a<00:07:47.639> really<00:07:48.000> tiny<00:07:48.270> little<00:07:48.570> hole<00:07:48.870> in

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.080 
but this is a really tiny little hole in

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.040 
but this is a really tiny little hole in
the<00:07:49.200> middle<00:07:49.770> of<00:07:49.950> your<00:07:50.190> spinal<00:07:50.610> cord<00:07:50.820> it's<00:07:51.810> not

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.050 
the middle of your spinal cord it's not

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:53.450 
the middle of your spinal cord it's not
as<00:07:52.229> important<00:07:52.680> for<00:07:52.800> the<00:07:52.860> cushioning

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:53.460 
as important for the cushioning

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.800 
as important for the cushioning
evidently<00:07:54.180> as<00:07:54.450> the<00:07:55.320> CSF<00:07:55.889> that<00:07:56.490> can<00:07:56.790> go<00:07:57.510> in<00:07:57.690> the

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:57.810 
evidently as the CSF that can go in the

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.840 
evidently as the CSF that can go in the
subarachnoid<00:07:58.139> space<00:07:58.590> around<00:07:59.340> the<00:07:59.550> spinal

00:07:59.840 --> 00:07:59.850 
subarachnoid space around the spinal

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:04.670 
subarachnoid space around the spinal
cord<00:08:01.639> and<00:08:02.639> it<00:08:03.570> goes<00:08:03.720> all<00:08:03.900> the<00:08:03.930> way<00:08:04.350> to<00:08:04.500> the

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:04.680 
cord and it goes all the way to the

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.350 
cord and it goes all the way to the
bottom<00:08:04.860> of<00:08:05.070> the<00:08:05.160> spinal<00:08:05.430> cord<00:08:05.760> so<00:08:06.000> if<00:08:06.060> someone

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.360 
bottom of the spinal cord so if someone

bottom of the spinal cord so if someone
needs<00:08:06.390> to<00:08:06.600> have<00:08:06.750> a<00:08:06.870> lumbar<00:08:07.169> puncture<00:08:07.550> then

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:08.550 
needs to have a lumbar puncture then

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.550 
needs to have a lumbar puncture then
some<00:08:09.120> of<00:08:09.300> the<00:08:09.419> CF<00:08:09.810> right<00:08:10.050> here<00:08:10.289> can<00:08:10.530> be
