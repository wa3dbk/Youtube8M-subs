00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
currently is the one I prefer but it's

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.880 
currently is the one I prefer but it's
completely<00:01:45.180> up<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:46.140> which<00:01:46.500> one<00:01:46.740> you

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
completely up to you which one you

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.950 
completely up to you which one you
choose<00:01:47.130> now<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.909> reason<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.299> prefer<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.780> one

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
choose now the reason I prefer this one

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.539 
choose now the reason I prefer this one
is<00:01:49.170> it's<00:01:49.380> kind<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.070> middle<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
is it's kind of in the middle of the

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.460 
is it's kind of in the middle of the
mall<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.939> he<00:01:51.299> does<00:01:51.479> apparently<00:01:51.750> fly<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.380> a

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
mall and he does apparently fly in a

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.590 
mall and he does apparently fly in a
clockwise<00:01:52.979> circle<00:01:53.040> around<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.240> temple<00:01:54.509> of

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
clockwise circle around the temple of

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.139 
clockwise circle around the temple of
Earth<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.159> prefer<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.460> one<00:01:56.790> because

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
Earth so I just prefer that one because

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.170 
Earth so I just prefer that one because
it<00:01:57.299> seems<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.140> more<00:01:58.460> suitable<00:01:59.460> one<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.759> UI<00:01:59.909> in

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
it seems the more suitable one is UI in

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.910 
it seems the more suitable one is UI in
the<00:02:00.210> middle<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.630> kind<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.930> all<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.259> spawns<00:02:01.590> and

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
the middle of kind of all the spawns and

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.649 
the middle of kind of all the spawns and
you<00:02:02.369> will<00:02:02.520> see<00:02:02.729> him<00:02:02.820> if<00:02:02.969> he<00:02:03.000> kind<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.360> spawns

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
you will see him if he kind of spawns

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.730 
you will see him if he kind of spawns
north

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740

well<00:02:18.720> Bloodseeker<00:02:19.380> is<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.560> elite<00:02:20.280> bat<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.790> is

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
well Bloodseeker is a elite bat and is

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.350 
well Bloodseeker is a elite bat and is
the<00:02:21.780> placeholder<00:02:22.530> mop<00:02:22.709> for<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:23.519> NX<00:02:23.880> what<00:02:24.209> this

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
the placeholder mop for a NX what this

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.080 
the placeholder mop for a NX what this
basically<00:02:24.569> means<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:25.170> if<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:26.459> nax<00:02:26.670> doesn't

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
basically means is if a nax doesn't

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.240 
basically means is if a nax doesn't
spawn<00:02:27.330> then<00:02:27.690> Bloodseeker<00:02:28.260> will<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.980> high

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
spawn then Bloodseeker will and a high

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.490 
spawn then Bloodseeker will and a high
majority<00:02:29.819> of<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.030> time<00:02:30.269> put<00:02:30.599> Zika<00:02:30.959> will<00:02:31.140> spawn

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
majority of the time put Zika will spawn

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.540 
majority of the time put Zika will spawn
so<00:02:32.330> NX<00:02:33.330> is<00:02:33.480> basically<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:34.140> rare<00:02:34.470> spawn<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:35.099> a

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
so NX is basically a rare spawn of a

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.410 
so NX is basically a rare spawn of a
rare<00:02:35.790> spawn<00:02:36.830> if<00:02:37.830> you've<00:02:38.640> come<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.060> timeless

over is what happens when you actually
find<00:03:08.489> a<00:03:08.700> nax<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:10.470> will<00:03:10.680> be<00:03:10.800> friendly<00:03:11.160> at<00:03:11.250> first

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
find a nax it will be friendly at first
