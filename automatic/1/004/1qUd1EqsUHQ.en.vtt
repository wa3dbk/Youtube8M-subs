 all against one so you have ours 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.019
 cab house comparison override wants 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.620
 but the new Mercedes actros also at 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.330
 the driver's cab in the fast lane 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.190
 at the presentation of the new actros 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.810
 stood next to an improved 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.119
 driving behavior and the new 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.539
 six-cylinder engine especially the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.090
 cab in the foreground for comparison 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.140
 The largest ones ever competed 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.140
 cabins of scania r with top line house 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.860
 the renault magnum with high roof the daf 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.710
 xf 105 with super space cabin of volvo 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.930
 fh with globetrotter xl cab and 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.460
 the ema in dix in xxl format 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.170
 the five cabins are from 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.829
 our test crew under the microscope 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.510
 took 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.629
 point by point to yours 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.140
 Practicality checks how much 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.350
 There is storage space how is the storage space 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.519
 reachable 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:08.869
 which adjustment away have the steering wheels 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.869
 how good is the view 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:22.600
 what measurements does the cabin have? 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.600
 is the deck suitable for unloading there 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.380
 how is the ride comfort and how is that 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.380
 driving behavior 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.899
 a several hundred points comprehensive 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.020
 list worked out on two test days 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:45.729
 there will be nothing hidden 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.729
 and disadvantages are revealed 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.020
 Let's start with the cabin size 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.679
 Here the mercedes sets the new 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.439
 bests almost 200 liters more volume than 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:00.079
 the former top rider of the may 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:03.229
 mercedes in gigers ps execution approached 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:05.629
 with 93 5 cubic meters the maximum 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.229
 of the legally possible also at 

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:11.450
 storage space is the actros front 996 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.170
 liter outside and inside bin again 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.720
 followed by may but the size also has 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.000
 a disadvantage for the outside storage compartments 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.049
 are for normal grown drivers only 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.549
 difficult to reach 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:28.910
 but the new actros is also waiting 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:30.470
 lots of clever detailing on it 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.239
 for example, there is one 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.879
 different places mountable 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.160
 laptop holder or a ventilation nozzle 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:40.359
 the air at the same time and up 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.359
 can distribute below 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.440
 matter of taste, however, are the 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.630
 different interior colors the 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.340
 to divide the space and that 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:54.200
 Wood decor of the home line equipment 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.690
 a level floor again actros offers 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.519
 otherwise only the magnum despite the 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.739
 somewhat scarce cab 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.769
 The renault has a lot of volume 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.959
 Place on the storage volume too 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.269
 is oriented with 901 liters at the 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:12.530
 tip does not always show from 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:14.930
 the practical side were the renault 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.540
 for example, large externally accessible 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.810
 storage space what the idiosyncratic got started 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.549
 owed behind the front axle 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.769
 The market wants to be different at all 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.959
 This is also evident in the unusual 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.169
 design like the door handles and the 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.169
 dashboard 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.940
 sober opposite pole is the daf xf 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.560
 functional cab functional with 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.660
 cubic cut to the bin on 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.760
 Eye level with the actros is the may 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.700
 a thoroughly practical companion 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:53.290
 a bit old fashioned though and bar none 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:55.090
 elegance the strong sides of the xf cabin 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.880
 can be found in many good ones 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.490
 Detailed solutions, it is the head of the 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.160
 upper deck , it is the large storage 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.410
 in the middle of the dashboard or 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.420
 be it secured by bolts 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:11.920
 The little ones seem playful 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.020
 bad instruments to read the 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.080
 display with red writing on black 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.080
 reason 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:22.360
 factually and functionally comes the 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.940
 cabin of the ma n therefore can score the 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.600
 mrn with a spacious cab 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.220
 wide adjustment because of the driver's seat 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.160
 neat and comfortable 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:39.460
 lie and relatively large easily 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:41.860
 accessible outside bins of tgx 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.620
 is equipped with the best materials 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.380
 relies on dark interior colors 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.510
 Aluminum applications as contrast the 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.690
 Round instruments are big and good 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.040
 readable 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.740
 in contrast, is an example for 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.840
 Tight storage offer a bad 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.630
 front climb a limited 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:08.410
 steering wheel presentation or a difficult one 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:11.650
 away in the upper bed as the magnum gives 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.900
 it the volvo fh for nearly 20 years the 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.150
 sloping front and the relatively short 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.910
 cab make inside one 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.060
 restricted movement space too 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.250
 the storage space is only considerable 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.889
 if you have the optional console on the 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.990
 tail wall orders but goes on 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.180
 cost a second league like ever 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.190
 the leagues are a weak point of the volvo 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.900
 are 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.950
 Once in a while , the sprightly Swede can 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.260
 still score 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.820
 the comfort is high the 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.600
 steering conveys a safe 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.880
 driving emotion 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.760
 But the side slope of the cabin is 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.800
 great together with the soft feathers on 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:56.910
 the front axle made the fast 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:58.950
 steering maneuver not easy to 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.260
 conclusion of the scania at the readings 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.940
 for the cabin, the scania is only in 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.979
 midfield 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:08.340
 the storage space is with 670 meters of 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:09.740
 the smallest, especially inside, is not much 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.970
 accommodate 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.430
 and the lie has never been the strength 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.290
 of the scania 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:21.389
 but it is true around the workplace 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:23.550
 Once again the domain of Sweden has been 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:26.700
 always drive the discipline and 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.919
 driving behavior scania also scores 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:32.039
 now slow down on the topics steering 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:34.320
 Circuit and operation in driving comfort 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:36.000
 especially with the inside noise 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.370
 the scania the nose in front of all 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.470
 competitors 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.570
 but the exciting question is can the 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:47.180
 mercedes here scania the forehead 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:47.180
 Offer and the answer is he can 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.580
 the actros is now just as active as 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:55.400
 the scania steering is working now 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.620
 exactly the same as the mercedes powershift 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.689
 gear is now the finest 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.030
 the vote of the electronic helpers 

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:04.639
 into the driving is as perfect as 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.800
 when scania is so that can only 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:08.210
 due to low driving noise in 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.419
 the discipline is still driving 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:13.610
 gossamer before the new actros but in 

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:16.960
 the sum of all points has mercedes 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:20.750
 the nose in front and directs scania volvo 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.729
 may and renault on the places at 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:26.860
 cab are the stuttgarter now 

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:26.860
 for the first time the measure of things
