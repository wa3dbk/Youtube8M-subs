00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:11.700
 Hello everyone and today shot 3 reviews on 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.160
 cars zaz vida zaz sens and zaz forza 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.920
 and I want to share the total 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.060
 impressions in general about what is today 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.430
 what happened we begin senso 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.910
 First I want to say that sense is not 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.010
 he has changed altogether 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.500
 produced 10 years ago the same 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.630
 produced now with exactly the same 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.739
 most sores such as box 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.200
 gear that is the rocker and the box itself from 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.510
 brands 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.670
 with completely inappropriate gear 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.440
 numbers weak motor claimed 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.449
 passport data on consumption in principle 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.890
 true but only 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.370
 if you ride somewhere in the village 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.120
 where there are no traffic lights where there is no common 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.210
 city ​​traffic where most cars 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.540
 much more powerful because on the subject car 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.030
 with power like senso although there are 70 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.590
 horsepower but it is achieved when 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.750
 five thousand turns 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.399
 that is, roughly speaking to go at least 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.469
 approximately equal to the flow of others 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:21.399
 machines on sensei need to twist 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:23.799
 engine to the fullest and ride on 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:26.319
 increased speeds from 100 both by 10 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.149
 liters of consumption immediately this and at least 11 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:30.159
 passport she should eat there 80 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.420
 half and it is possible because 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.420
 on the highway she eats 6 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.040
 fuzzy transfer to sensei and back 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.869
 the show is in place where you are all 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.750
 normal cars is 5 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.490
 transfer that uncomfortable you can get used to 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.990
 this and not 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:54.270
 5 include the letters n back which means 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.759
 when you eat and you need to accelerate already 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.270
 faster, that is, you see at 80 90 is not 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.000
 4 need 5 and you accidentally including 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.670
 these places are 5 back accustomed to san shiro 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.300
 well, that is, those people who are patient 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.830
 I faced with all this yet again 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:16.319
 body reliable suspension good 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.140
 clearance is normal as it was 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:22.560
 so it remains the following 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.780
 say this car zaz vida zaz vida 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.299
 it looks like it is exactly the same 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.980
 like previous model chevrolet aveo 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:32.760
 then put Chinese new 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:38.470
 engine that is 15 atmospheric 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.390
 109 horsepower for its reliability is not 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.640
 I would say that he is very super 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.890
 reliable is the only thing I can 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:50.800
 note that after all the body assembly and 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.170
 Salon assembly ZAZ 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.840
 she's pretty good that is 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.560
 much better than Chinese assemblies and 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.050
 so it turns out such a car with 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.410
 Ukraine Ukrainian body Ukrainian 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.760
 salon but with the Chinese engine if 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.010
 the engine will show itself less 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.810
 ok reliable then avella everyone knows 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.370
 fine what sores he has 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.080
 his problems are rattling plastic but 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.830
 spacious lounge but good 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:26.400
 grade for 13,000 dollars cheaper 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:31.060
 solaris cheaper than rio cheaper than 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:34.170
 sat down for this will have to 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.900
 inspect what will happen with this engine 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.270
 here on ford 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.830
 situation following operas Ford also 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.790
 everyone knows how chery bonus 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:49.030
 and the engine there is the same good is different 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.740
 not only by design from species but also 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.510
 power steering that is there stands 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.670
 electric power steering that me too 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.680
 personally 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.750
 seemed nice to handle 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.140
 but for all that I absolutely do not believe 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:05.110
 I understand its reliability, of course, that 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.780
 the expense has decreased at the car due to this 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.970
 electric power steering she seems to be like 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:15.040
 truly shows eight with 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:17.709
 half the city but what will happen when 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.350
 it breaks it is not clear that is, again 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.240
 it’s Chinese parts to wait long 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.310
 expensive to buy 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.840
 and 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:32.420
 not every master will take it yet 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:34.550
 I still wanted to fix this 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.520
 share a little with plans for 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.650
 the next week or two that is on the next 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.440
 week I am going to go and test 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.440
 in mazda first mazda 6 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.160
 skyactiv che part for suspension 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.990
 engine for principles and approaches which 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:56.600
 Now use the Japanese in mazda 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:57.890
 skyactiv for the design of the code will also try 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.860
 still a week off 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.380
 if there is time and opportunity x5 and 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.760
 mazda 3 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:12.500
 after that, I definitely want to finish 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:14.390
 test drive them japanese business sedans 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.740
 I want to finish with them in order to 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.680
 release the movie total the same 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.230
 impression about japanese business 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.720
 sedans and there in principle Koreans can 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.780
 it will still do something that is 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:30.650
 to tell about cars 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:35.400
 such as kia optima honda accord 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:37.919
 toyota camry mazda 6 nissan teana 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.120
 most likely there will be the same even on the 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.810
 price category 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:47.990
 add volkswagen passat b7 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:51.120
 Of course, he is not Japanese but before 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.160
 mercedes bmw and audi he doesn't either 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.320
 falls short and for the price it just here 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.660
 exactly in that category here people choose 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.580
 usually take camry accord 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.930
 either it will be mazda 6 or it will be 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.240
 passat b7 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.550
 tell what advantage that anyone 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:11.320
 he no longer liked how she 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:14.470
 looks like it feels like riding here 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:19.110
 such as you plans so look 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.110
 on the video channel to new meetings
