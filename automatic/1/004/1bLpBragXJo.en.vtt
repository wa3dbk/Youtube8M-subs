00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:56.050 

so<00:03:54.109> you<00:03:54.230> may<00:03:54.379> ask<00:03:54.620> what<00:03:54.980> why<00:03:55.340> would<00:03:55.760> you

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
so you may ask what why would you

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.750 
so you may ask what why would you
actually<00:03:56.269> want<00:03:56.989> one<00:03:57.319> of<00:03:57.349> these<00:03:57.680> as<00:03:58.099> against<00:03:58.639> a

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
actually want one of these as against a

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.860 
actually want one of these as against a
laptop<00:03:59.329> but<00:04:00.170> of<00:04:00.319> course<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:01.599> performance<00:04:02.599> of

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
laptop but of course the performance of

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.879 
laptop but of course the performance of
this<00:04:03.109> is<00:04:03.499> is<00:04:04.219> far<00:04:04.730> and<00:04:04.909> above<00:04:05.409> what<00:04:06.409> you<00:04:06.650> could

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
this is is far and above what you could

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:16.020 
this is is far and above what you could
achieve<00:04:09.609> with<00:04:10.609> a<00:04:10.849> reasonably<00:04:11.659> priced<00:04:14.290> laptop

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
achieve with a reasonably priced laptop

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.390 
achieve with a reasonably priced laptop
so<00:04:17.030> that's<00:04:17.870> the<00:04:18.139> main<00:04:18.320> reason<00:04:18.799> for<00:04:18.829> it<00:04:19.130> it's

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
so that's the main reason for it it's

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.260 
so that's the main reason for it it's
also<00:04:19.609> quite<00:04:20.209> an<00:04:20.479> impressive<00:04:21.280> bit<00:04:22.280> of<00:04:22.430> kit<00:04:22.729> to

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
also quite an impressive bit of kit to

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.270 
also quite an impressive bit of kit to
take<00:04:23.509> in<00:04:23.840> to<00:04:24.139> show<00:04:24.410> your<00:04:24.740> room<00:04:25.130> your<00:04:26.030> clients

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
take in to show your room your clients

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.279 
take in to show your room your clients
it<00:04:28.280> certainly<00:04:28.699> would<00:04:28.880> be<00:04:28.910> a<00:04:29.060> talking<00:04:29.599> point<00:04:29.930> at

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
it certainly would be a talking point at

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.279 
it certainly would be a talking point at
any<00:04:30.500> meeting<00:04:31.190> that's<00:04:31.400> for<00:04:31.669> sure<00:04:31.930> it<00:04:32.930> has<00:04:33.259> a

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
any meeting that's for sure it has a

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:40.300 
any meeting that's for sure it has a
webcam<00:04:33.830> built<00:04:34.520> in<00:04:36.520> and<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:38.949> basically<00:04:39.949> that

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
webcam built in and the basically that

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.010 
webcam built in and the basically that
the<00:04:40.550> things<00:04:40.789> to<00:04:41.030> watch<00:04:41.210> out<00:04:41.479> with<00:04:41.750> using

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
the things to watch out with using

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.370 
the things to watch out with using
really<00:04:42.560> is<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:43.039> fact<00:04:43.280> that<00:04:43.460> the<00:04:43.669> cooling

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
really is the fact that the cooling

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.589 
really is the fact that the cooling
occurs<00:04:45.380> here<00:04:46.070> so<00:04:46.490> obviously<00:04:46.639> not<00:04:47.120> to<00:04:47.330> cover

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599 
occurs here so obviously not to cover

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:49.089 
occurs here so obviously not to cover
that<00:04:47.810> up

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
that up

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.689 
that up
although<00:04:49.910> the<00:04:50.150> modern<00:04:50.650> Intel<00:04:51.650> Core<00:04:52.099> i5

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
although the modern Intel Core i5

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.839 
although the modern Intel Core i5
machines<00:04:53.690> are<00:04:54.050> quite<00:04:54.289> the<00:04:54.820> processors<00:04:55.820> are

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:55.849 
machines are quite the processors are

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:02.110 
machines are quite the processors are
quite<00:04:56.180> cool<00:04:56.509> running<00:04:56.990> anyway<00:04:59.199> and<00:05:01.120> really

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
quite cool running anyway and really

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.390 
quite cool running anyway and really
that's<00:05:02.960> it

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
that's it

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.029 
that's it
it's<00:05:04.729> got<00:05:05.650> Wireless<00:05:06.650> n<00:05:07.070> builds<00:05:07.880> into<00:05:08.090> it<00:05:08.570> and

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
it's got Wireless n builds into it and

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:14.830 
it's got Wireless n builds into it and
it<00:05:10.039> also<00:05:10.310> has<00:05:10.940> bluetooth<00:05:11.419> as<00:05:12.380> well<00:05:13.389> so<00:05:14.389> pretty

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
it also has bluetooth as well so pretty

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.659 
it also has bluetooth as well so pretty
well<00:05:15.080> everything<00:05:15.650> you<00:05:15.680> could<00:05:16.070> possibly<00:05:16.099> need

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
well everything you could possibly need
