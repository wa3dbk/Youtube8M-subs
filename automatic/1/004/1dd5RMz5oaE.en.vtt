00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.849 
simple okay all right this is just an
accent<00:01:47.009> color<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.490> pillow<00:01:48.450> or<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:49.020> throw<00:01:49.530> or<00:01:49.560> some

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:49.859 
accent color a pillow or a throw or some

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:52.700 
accent color a pillow or a throw or some
okay<00:01:50.159> but<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:51.840> keep<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.170> moving<00:01:52.350> and

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
okay but to keep it moving and

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.970 
okay but to keep it moving and
interesting<00:01:53.219> i<00:01:53.340> pair<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.149> with

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
interesting i pair it with

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.160 
interesting i pair it with
a<00:01:55.070> blue<00:01:55.520> like<00:01:55.730> this<00:01:55.880> one<00:01:56.120> as<00:01:56.360> a<00:01:56.420> wall<00:01:56.930> color

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
a blue like this one as a wall color

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.850 
a blue like this one as a wall color

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
okay then I would probably put a neutral

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.960 
okay then I would probably put a neutral

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
could add in a little bit of that if you

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.710

of more color and just a touch of that

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:00.980 
of more color and just a touch of that
that<00:04:59.729> would<00:04:59.880> be<00:05:00.000> interesting<00:05:00.450> isn't<00:05:00.600> maybe<00:05:00.900> a

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
that would be interesting isn't maybe a

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.070 
that would be interesting isn't maybe a
powder<00:05:01.320> room<00:05:01.650> yes<00:05:02.090> exactly<00:05:03.090> just<00:05:03.750> a<00:05:03.810> little

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
powder room yes exactly just a little

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.930 
powder room yes exactly just a little
bit<00:05:04.229> of<00:05:04.320> that<00:05:04.440> coral<00:05:04.830> color<00:05:05.039> that<00:05:05.370> mixes<00:05:05.760> in

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
bit of that coral color that mixes in

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.710 
bit of that coral color that mixes in
with<00:05:06.150> our<00:05:06.300> pale<00:05:07.130> blues<00:05:08.130> blue<00:05:09.090> greens<00:05:09.360> I<00:05:09.570> guess

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
with our pale blues blue greens I guess

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.840 
with our pale blues blue greens I guess
neutral<00:05:10.320> neutral<00:05:10.800> so<00:05:10.979> the<00:05:11.070> main<00:05:11.280> palette<00:05:11.729> is

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
neutral neutral so the main palette is

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.760 
neutral neutral so the main palette is
still<00:05:12.090> neutral<00:05:12.539> but<00:05:13.050> it's<00:05:13.200> adding<00:05:13.560> in<00:05:13.650> that

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
still neutral but it's adding in that

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.380 
still neutral but it's adding in that
touch<00:05:14.010> of<00:05:14.130> color<00:05:14.340> that<00:05:14.580> really<00:05:14.820> makes<00:05:15.270> it

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
touch of color that really makes it

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.909 
touch of color that really makes it
interesting<00:05:15.660> take<00:05:15.990> your<00:05:16.110> common<00:05:16.440> theme<00:05:16.680> that
