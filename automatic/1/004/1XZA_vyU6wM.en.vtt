00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.240 
hey y'all so I'm 19 days late from four
months<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:08.929> 19<00:00:09.929> days<00:00:11.450> natural<00:00:12.679> my<00:00:13.679> hair<00:00:13.980> is

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
months and 19 days natural my hair is

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.120 
months and 19 days natural my hair is
about<00:00:15.199> maybe<00:00:16.199> three<00:00:16.320> inches<00:00:17.039> long<00:00:17.609> now<00:00:19.130> which

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
about maybe three inches long now which

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.439 
about maybe three inches long now which
I<00:00:20.400> think<00:00:20.880> it's<00:00:21.090> good<00:00:21.330> based<00:00:21.930> on<00:00:22.230> um<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:23.220> think<00:00:24.000> my

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
I think it's good based on um I think my

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.769 
I think it's good based on um I think my
hair<00:00:24.750> was<00:00:25.019> maybe<00:00:25.289> about<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:26.400> half<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.510> an<00:00:27.660> inch

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
hair was maybe about a half of an inch

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.779 
hair was maybe about a half of an inch
long<00:00:28.140> in<00:00:28.380> some<00:00:28.590> places<00:00:28.830> in<00:00:29.099> some<00:00:29.279> places<00:00:29.490> even

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
long in some places in some places even

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.990 
long in some places in some places even
shorter<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:31.009> for<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.130> be<00:00:32.340> about<00:00:32.610> three

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
shorter so for it to be about three

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.240 
shorter so for it to be about three
inches<00:00:33.239> long<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.510> four<00:00:34.440> months<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.890> 19<00:00:35.040> days

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
inches long and four months and 19 days

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.709 
inches long and four months and 19 days
I<00:00:35.700> guess<00:00:35.969> that's<00:00:36.149> not<00:00:36.270> too<00:00:36.329> bad<00:00:36.829> and<00:00:38.719> I'm

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
I guess that's not too bad and I'm

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.110 
I guess that's not too bad and I'm
starting<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.200> do<00:00:40.440> some<00:00:40.469> protective<00:00:41.399> styles
