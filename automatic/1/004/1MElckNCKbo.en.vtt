00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.490 
guitar playing in this video we'll go
over<00:00:18.990> two<00:00:19.619> pieces<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.340> advice<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:22.080> think

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
over two pieces of advice that I think

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.670 
over two pieces of advice that I think
apply<00:00:23.189> once<00:00:24.000> you've<00:00:24.240> got<00:00:24.480> past<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.289> stage

focus a typical approach to learning

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.130 
focus a typical approach to learning
guitar<00:00:43.610> often<00:00:44.610> involves<00:00:45.120> trying<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.809> learn<00:00:45.960> as

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
guitar often involves trying to learn as

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.910 
guitar often involves trying to learn as
many<00:00:46.440> songs<00:00:46.890> as<00:00:47.219> possible<00:00:48.079> this<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.289> no<00:00:49.530> bad

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
many songs as possible this is no bad

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.000 
many songs as possible this is no bad
thing<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.460> itself<00:00:50.930> but<00:00:51.930> whatever<00:00:52.469> often

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
thing in itself but whatever often

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.860 
thing in itself but whatever often
happens<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.730> your<00:00:53.940> focus<00:00:54.329> gets

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
happens is that your focus gets

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.119 
happens is that your focus gets
stretched<00:00:55.440> out<00:00:55.969> and<00:00:56.969> much<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.690> your<00:00:57.840> energy

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
stretched out and much of your energy

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.020 
stretched out and much of your energy
goes<00:00:59.129> into<00:00:59.399> memorizing<00:01:00.359> chord<00:01:00.809> sequences<00:01:01.590> and

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
goes into memorizing chord sequences and

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.690 
goes into memorizing chord sequences and
to<00:01:03.030> accelerate<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.500> development<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.549> your

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
to accelerate the development of your

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.929 
to accelerate the development of your
style<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.570> playing<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:07.799> better<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.400> go<00:01:08.640> back

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
style of playing it's better to go back

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.950 
style of playing it's better to go back
to<00:01:09.689> just<00:01:09.930> two<00:01:10.320> simple<00:01:10.950> chord<00:01:11.430> shapes<00:01:11.960> for

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
to just two simple chord shapes for

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.930 
to just two simple chord shapes for
example<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.710> minor<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.850> E<00:01:15.330> minor

my<00:01:26.200> second<00:01:26.800> piece<00:01:27.010> of<00:01:27.070> advice<00:01:27.310> is<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.960> really

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
my second piece of advice is to really

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.700 
my second piece of advice is to really
focus<00:01:30.040> on<00:01:30.630> listening<00:01:31.630> to<00:01:32.290> what<00:01:32.470> you're

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
focus on listening to what you're

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.430 
focus on listening to what you're
playing<00:01:33.510> restricting<00:01:34.510> your<00:01:34.660> plane<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.200> just

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
playing restricting your plane to just

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.240 
playing restricting your plane to just
two<00:01:35.770> simple<00:01:36.220> chords<00:01:36.970> frees<00:01:37.870> you<00:01:38.170> up<00:01:38.200> to<00:01:38.860> really

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
two simple chords frees you up to really

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.680 
two simple chords frees you up to really
listen<00:01:39.610> closely

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.010 

then<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.500> find<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.310> view<00:01:47.370> selectively<00:01:48.330> stop

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
then you find the view selectively stop

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.850 
then you find the view selectively stop
making<00:01:49.590> several<00:01:50.270> subtle<00:01:51.270> changes<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.620> the<00:01:52.710> way

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
making several subtle changes to the way

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:02.010 
making several subtle changes to the way
you<00:01:52.920> physically<00:01:53.700> interact<00:01:54.300> with<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.720> Attar

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.890 

it's<00:02:03.020> likely<00:02:03.710> that<00:02:03.890> your<00:02:04.070> touch<00:02:04.540> will<00:02:05.540> start

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
it's likely that your touch will start

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:12.400 
it's likely that your touch will start
to<00:02:06.110> lighten<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:11.630> you<00:02:11.720> start<00:02:12.050> to<00:02:12.200> introduce

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
to lighten and you start to introduce

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:19.440 
to lighten and you start to introduce
more<00:02:13.300> dynamic<00:02:14.300> range<00:02:14.600> into<00:02:15.200> your<00:02:15.350> strumming

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.010 

allowed<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:24.920> solve<00:02:28.540> according<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.750> needs

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
allowed to solve according to the needs

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.280 
allowed to solve according to the needs
of<00:02:30.200> what<00:02:30.410> you<00:02:30.560> play<00:02:31.420> or<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.660> mood<00:02:32.870> that<00:02:32.900> you're

of what you play or the mood that you're

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:42.040 
of what you play or the mood that you're
feeling<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:33.770> when<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.040> play<00:02:40.210> you<00:02:41.210> also<00:02:41.420> start

feeling and when you play you also start

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.400 
feeling and when you play you also start
to<00:02:42.140> find<00:02:42.440> yourself<00:02:42.890> being<00:02:43.190> more<00:02:43.460> selective

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
to find yourself being more selective

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.160 
to find yourself being more selective
with<00:02:45.410> which<00:02:45.710> strings<00:02:46.310> you<00:02:46.760> home<00:02:47.180> in<00:02:47.420> on<00:02:47.570> with
