00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
that it focused too much on elements

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.760 
that it focused too much on elements
that<00:00:32.790> were<00:00:32.969> classic<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.989> original<00:00:34.530> film

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
that were classic in the original film

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.010 
that were classic in the original film
and<00:00:35.010> just<00:00:35.489> repurposing<00:00:36.270> those<00:00:36.450> in<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.870> new

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
and just repurposing those in a new

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.470 
and just repurposing those in a new
situation<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:38.010> mean<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.790> me<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.180> just<00:00:39.210> felt

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
situation I mean it to me it just felt

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.360 
situation I mean it to me it just felt
like<00:00:39.629> they<00:00:39.899> were<00:00:39.989> kind<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.649> one-trick<00:00:41.070> pony

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
like they were kind of a one-trick pony

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.160 
like they were kind of a one-trick pony
and<00:00:41.700> they<00:00:41.790> weren't<00:00:42.030> creating<00:00:42.420> anything<00:00:42.809> new

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
and they weren't creating anything new

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.770 
and they weren't creating anything new
for<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:44.010> world<00:00:44.340> yes<00:00:45.210> there<00:00:45.360> are<00:00:45.390> actually

there<00:00:45.809> are<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.050> few<00:00:46.260> little<00:00:46.440> things<00:00:46.559> they

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
there are a few little things they

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.959 
there are a few little things they
create<00:00:47.129> new<00:00:47.219> but<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.579> felt<00:00:47.730> like<00:00:47.820> they

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
create new but it just felt like they

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.010 
create new but it just felt like they
were<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.210> like<00:00:48.270> resting<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:48.870> their<00:00:48.960> laurels

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
were just like resting on their laurels

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.660 
were just like resting on their laurels
and<00:00:49.500> like<00:00:49.620> oh<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:49.920> was<00:00:50.100> funny<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.460> first

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
and like oh this was funny in the first

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.770 
and like oh this was funny in the first
movie<00:00:51.000> let's<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.510> again

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
movie let's do it again

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.840 
movie let's do it again
Oh<00:00:52.020> people<00:00:52.620> love<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:53.219> let's<00:00:53.520> do<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.760> again

Oh people love this let's do it again

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.580 
Oh people love this let's do it again
and<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.420> for<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.780> reason<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.199> don't<00:00:55.230> think

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
and so for that reason I don't think

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.950 
and so for that reason I don't think
that<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:55.860> really<00:00:56.280> took<00:00:56.910> frozen<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.660> next

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
that this really took frozen to the next

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.170 
that this really took frozen to the next
level<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.559> just<00:00:58.739> sort<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.980> like<00:00:59.190> frozen

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
level it's just sort of like frozen

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.479 
level it's just sort of like frozen
mania<00:01:00.719> continuing<00:01:01.649> like<00:01:01.980> we're<00:01:02.160> still<00:01:02.430> in

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
mania continuing like we're still in

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.660 
mania continuing like we're still in
2013<00:01:03.420> on<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.809> huge<00:01:04.140> frozen<00:01:04.439> train<00:01:04.920> like<00:01:05.220> just

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
2013 on this huge frozen train like just

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.070 
2013 on this huge frozen train like just
capitalizing<00:01:06.299> on<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.780> think<00:01:06.810> this

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
capitalizing on that and I think this

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.510 
capitalizing on that and I think this
was<00:01:07.229> kind<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.560> missed<00:01:07.710> opportunity<00:01:07.799> to

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
was kind of a missed opportunity to

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.490 
was kind of a missed opportunity to
really<00:01:08.939> make<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.420> something<00:01:09.930> new<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.350> great

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
really make this something new and great

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.980 
really make this something new and great
so<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.979> plot<00:01:11.250> Elsa<00:01:11.850> she<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.270> Queen<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.780> she<00:01:12.900> is

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
so the plot Elsa she is Queen and she is

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.780 
so the plot Elsa she is Queen and she is
holding<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.530> birthday<00:01:13.770> party<00:01:14.250> for<00:01:14.280> her<00:01:14.520> sister

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
holding a birthday party for her sister

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.090

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
mama because growing up they were never

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.440 
mama because growing up they were never
allowed<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.490> have<00:01:17.670> birthday<00:01:18.060> parties

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
for the first time in forever where it's

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.950

think<00:01:58.900> that<00:01:59.049> this<00:01:59.229> long<00:01:59.470> did<00:01:59.799> much<00:02:00.100> if<00:02:00.460> you're

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
let's make sure that it's doing this

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.010 
let's make sure that it's doing this
Lady<00:02:05.830> Justice<00:02:06.130> in<00:02:06.759> the<00:02:06.940> short<00:02:07.180> L<00:02:07.420> so<00:02:07.570> sick<00:02:07.810> and

she's getting progressively sicker and

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.080 
she's getting progressively sicker and
so<00:02:10.690> as<00:02:11.050> a<00:02:11.080> result<00:02:11.380> in<00:02:11.890> Tina's<00:02:12.220> voice<00:02:12.459> is<00:02:12.819> like

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
so as a result in Tina's voice is like

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.479 
so as a result in Tina's voice is like
you<00:02:14.080> know<00:02:14.200> it's<00:02:14.380> just<00:02:14.560> it's<00:02:14.800> getting<00:02:14.980> sick<00:02:15.340> and

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
it's hard to sing and so that was

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.020 
it's hard to sing and so that was
another<00:02:18.040> thing<00:02:18.130> that<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:18.520> was<00:02:18.580> like<00:02:18.730> this<00:02:18.850> song

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030

another thing that it was like this song
is<00:02:19.239> not<00:02:19.450> gonna<00:02:19.600> be<00:02:19.750> memorable<00:02:20.080> like<00:02:20.410> because

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
is not gonna be memorable like because

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.250 
is not gonna be memorable like because
the<00:02:21.400> main<00:02:21.580> character<00:02:21.610> has<00:02:22.569> a<00:02:22.600> cold<00:02:22.959> throughout

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
and it's getting progressively worse I

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.160 
and it's getting progressively worse I
know<00:02:25.150> that<00:02:25.269> wasn't<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.570> purpose<00:02:25.720> like<00:02:26.050> how

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
know that wasn't the purpose like how

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.509 
know that wasn't the purpose like how
many<00:02:26.320> digital<00:02:26.739> downloads<00:02:27.160> would<00:02:27.280> be<00:02:27.340> able<00:02:27.459> to

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
opportunity to explain this and then

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.120 
opportunity to explain this and then
they<00:02:43.239> just<00:02:43.420> sort<00:02:43.600> of<00:02:43.690> like<00:02:43.900> sweep<00:02:44.680> it<00:02:44.800> away<00:02:44.890> at

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
the end and there's no I guess the real

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.559 
the end and there's no I guess the real
reason<00:02:48.190> with<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:48.400> is<00:02:48.610> there's<00:02:48.790> no<00:02:48.850> conflict

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
reason with this is there's no conflict

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.020 
reason with this is there's no conflict
in<00:02:49.989> this<00:02:50.860> short<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.580> then<00:02:51.730> there's<00:02:51.880> no

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
in this short and then there's no

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.640 
in this short and then there's no
resolution<00:02:52.360> like<00:02:52.810> yes<00:02:53.140> there's<00:02:53.380> these<00:02:53.500> little
