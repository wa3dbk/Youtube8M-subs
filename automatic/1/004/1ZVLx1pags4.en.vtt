00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
warm down it's a much safer element

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.500 
warm down it's a much safer element
warming<00:04:20.040> down<00:04:20.220> is<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.609> same<00:04:20.850> as<00:04:21.000> you<00:04:21.120> want<00:04:21.390> as

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
warming down is the same as you want as

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.290

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
you warmed up now moving forward into

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.480 
you warmed up now moving forward into
that<00:04:24.330> rotation<00:04:25.080> when<00:04:25.650> you<00:04:25.770> are<00:04:25.950> rotating

don't force it always feel as though the

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.989 
don't force it always feel as though the
rotation<00:04:29.220> is<00:04:29.310> coming<00:04:29.610> from<00:04:29.729> the

00:04:29.989 --> 00:04:29.999 
rotation is coming from the

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:31.639 
rotation is coming from the
the<00:04:30.299> hip<00:04:30.479> don't<00:04:30.929> feel<00:04:31.169> like<00:04:31.349> you<00:04:31.469> have<00:04:31.619> to

rotate from the knee or the ankle that's

00:04:33.989 --> 00:04:36.409 
rotate from the knee or the ankle that's
a<00:04:34.139> little<00:04:34.289> bit<00:04:34.499> dangerous<00:04:34.709> so<00:04:35.279> find<00:04:35.969> your<00:04:36.209> own

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419
