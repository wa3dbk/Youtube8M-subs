00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.970
 little replay that I comment alone 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.890
 so for once it's not a 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.849
 master but the part is still 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.969
 friendly so I'll comment on it 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:17.070
 so it was a part returned it 90 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:20.699
 the excellent light french two thirds 8 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.500
 and this is a shooting game 9 so that's it 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.750
 I am I am really good I 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.000
 compulse here there was even some ago 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.130
 even thirds is in phase so 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.260
 theoretically it's a little bit of a bit 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.300
 royal for me even if you do not have to 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.829
 no longer do the crazy I have not 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.960
 shielding i do not have no time to 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.739
 excellent focus but there is downright 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.850
 way I do beautiful things 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.309
 after my team is a little bit less 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.620
 good that the opposite but good nothing 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.629
 nothing very dramatic is so low there 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.500
 I rock the hill clearly tank 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.640
 light is where I prefer to go good 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.620
 then this fake ass coat is a 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.500
 little disgusting this future next to the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.059
 second pass better 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:04.650
 yeah because good the other part of the 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.710
 vap side has all this is not it 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.229
 not top top for a light it's really 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.880
 of frontal combat fight it's not my 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.070
 role while up there is more of 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.409
 more tanks a little lighter of 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.720
 stuff that I can pay near face 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:23.990
 that's where I have a good life interest I 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.400
 take a third of the streets and not past 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.840
 I 'm suspicious that does not fool me in the face of 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.040
 beings that's what makes the party for 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.610
 do but hey there are several colleagues 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.170
 to stop them 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.280
 so yeah I run to reload not the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.130
 trouble taking risks for a 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.729
 shell I 'll wait for two minutes 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.729
 to go to the assault 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.980
 for now nobody has taken 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.270
 the advantage that is a camp to another 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.690
 problem is we still have 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.010
 a lot of td back to our hill 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.620
 spawn 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.390
 so we can help you so roland 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.010
 many more people deployed to 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.210
 contact what makes us there 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.270
 almost half our team has to 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.730
 to say sorry our team that is useless 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:06.630
 it may cost quite expensive which 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.580
 age is fine reload lorraine I 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.590
 do not have the happily no angle the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.060
 hero back him here is the lot the 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.850
 means anadys glory forehand right him is 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.430
 gay I'm going out loots going out too 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.110
 good operation for once and I can 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.030
 darken in the back of the other two he's me 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.020
 remains half of my varied there is 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.190
 clearly enough to make twenty-five 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.170
 not progress a threat 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:38.209
 the manager of legends first shot 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:40.560
 ok then I take one and I go out 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.360
 it's cool we still managed to 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.900
 take a sacred advantage the beautiful 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.280
 option to victory 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.560
 the Ontario of danger on the 25th 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.590
 there on the 25th I do not know what he took 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:57.510
 frankly that's it rock our group 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:00.510
 of tanks not just the name needed 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.890
 had to try hindsight is limited the 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.540
 boundaries and angles so as to get 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.600
 get attacked only by one of them 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.610
 must at once what but then there rock 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:13.970
 we do not see the interest what really 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:16.019
 why year by year so the small 8.3 torah 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.300
 it begins well 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.610
 in addition now so we are released on 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.260
 can attack on their on their flanks 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.540
 their backs 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.100
 the td started to move and move forward 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.220
 so also the level map control 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.070
 I think we know we know this is March 9 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.820
 where are all their tanks it's 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.920
 quiet 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.799
 so I can go quietly in 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.680
 the cape I could also go to attack 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.260
 in their backs 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.140
 attack lives and telcos his 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:52.700
 frontally Saturday no more than that in 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:55.810
 actually is here so I'm waiting for 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:59.079
 whether the sua good idea to come 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.079
 it's the case 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.209
 this is the first small shot and his clan 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.990
 exceed damage I pull a little fast 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.280
 second pass well he does the 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.280
 caterpillars that's it's royal 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.030
 here is an exit 17 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.590
 I have more than two shells 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.680
 quietly in the cape and I count 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:26.220
 on the others to make buffer between 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.470
 me and opponents I did not throw any 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.940
 reload so the true and on the ways of 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.050
 take out the title in half if it goes ahead a 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.750
 little too much we made a good offer 4 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.970
 crowd life and so what is it to him 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.060
 1,3002 so yeah 30 lineage of what 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:47.310
 tanks and a 32 there is way I shoot in 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:49.290
 the ground he spot me the blow that makes a 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.460
 little more blunder they try to me 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.180
 push to shoot an encompasses 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.450
 disgusting 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.600
 this is his part in a carcass he's me 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:00.090
 magnifying glass not much but it's good 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.770
 so we went back to 10 10 then 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.640
 compare as frac we had advanced 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:08.850
 at one point it's not great but good 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.640
 what's going on there's still when 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.270
 same way so the 10 and 11 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:17.160
 it's not so good but nothing dramatic 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.320
 I just need to keep that 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.320
 colleagues that she still 45 seconds and 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.760
 irwin 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.330
 I'm moving a little bit here in the 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.470
 bushes soon movie reload tea 32g 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:35.540
 a shell with its name marked on it 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:38.360
 so it does not pass I deny 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.790
 threw in the ground I waited more 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.550
 focus of the shot there it goes back into the ground 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:46.160
 he has blind and the wrong place cupola 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.110
 the hall at goal we do not know where he is 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.200
 happened in any case it happened a 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.660
 blind who does not do anything and I'm in 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.780
 fashion and I realize that I am the 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.160
 last on my team with a cover 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.970
 who is fast 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.670
 disappear 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:05.570
 so now that attracted me I 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.620
 bar and that's it I have a catch and so 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.140
 it's just need to keep four 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:13.070
 the second looks worse you are and irene 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:16.220
 so here is a nice little colobane 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:19.490
 off is what's called equipment 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.110
 in jargon an asshole win 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.250
 thank you for following this quick part 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.250
 and see you soon for a new deadline
