00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.150
 hello I'm markariÃ¡n azzurra photographer 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.630
 annie with chile today I'm going to present 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.240
 two compact nikon cameras the j1 and the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.579
 b1 have some differences between 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.039
 one of them being a little more 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:28.710
 professional one of the things 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.669
 interesting about this camera is that you 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.460
 you can insert a separate flash that is 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.719
 You can buy at nikon center 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.460
 and also has one thing that to me 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.370
 I personally like it a lot 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.610
 what is an interchangeable lens this 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.570
 lens can be removed from the camera and there 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.970
 other lenses 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.790
 that can be used can also be 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.430
 buy an adapter to use the 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:02.150
 lenses nor with normals of a camera 35 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.890
 millimeters that makes it very good 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.920
 for everything that is optical because you can 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.470
 occupy your same lenses this these 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.540
 lenses have a zoom there are distinct 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.970
 zoom types you can find out which ones 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.390
 are the ones that are best for you and 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.910
 It also has a system called the 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:24.170
 smart photography photography 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.670
 smart really is smart and 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.990
 what makes these photographs that he takes 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.149
 a photo and four similar ones and choose in 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.729
 the background five photos that are the best 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.430
 photos that you take in a burst the 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:41.119
 single camera chooses from a series of photos 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.340
 the four best photos including the 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.610
 main shot that's really 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.560
 fantastic because it helps the photographer to 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.689
 choose the photo efe 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.979
 another thing that this camera has 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:57.730
 and also the j1 is that they have a 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.630
 long battery 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.990
 lithium 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.860
 and one of the important things is that 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.869
 you have to use sd cards but they are 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.180
 fast because when you use the mode 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.670
 video if you use a card that is not 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.290
 fast you will have problems that the 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.750
 screen will go black during a 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.180
 time when the card is reading and 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.920
 recording then important that you use 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.580
 a quick card because if you do not you will not 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.319
 to be able to see the image that you are recording and 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.510
 that is difficult 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.260
 let's set aside this camera a 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.200
 a little bit and let's take the j1 the j one 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.950
 It has a small flash that is a flash 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.989
 of filling which is quite useful for 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.989
 make close portraits to use the macro 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.610
 this camera is practically the same as 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.350
 the one with the difference I would say that 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.440
 the only important difference is the 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.350
 flash this camera is heavier this 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.020
 camera is lighter but the quality of 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.380
 the photos and the quality of the video that is 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.810
 practically equal the two cameras 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.970
 they have a very interesting system that 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.580
 flame instantaneous mode of movement what 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.400
 does this mean that every time you 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.910
 releases the shutter the camera records a 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.640
 in a static image this lasts 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.790
 about a second of the footage of the 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.620
 video so that when viewing the 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.620
 instantaneous movement obtained from the 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.260
 camera the video plays on camera 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.490
 slow for about 25 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.780
 seconds followed by this static image 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:42.010
 This camera has a focusing system 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.890
 of faces these work very well in the 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.060
 part video I liked a lot and 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.890
 what does this mean that when the 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.040
 person is moving 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:54.340
 the camera focuses the face all the time 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.819
 in very little the blur there is of a 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.490
 instant but in general it succeeds 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.670
 pretty good the video's relationship is 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:07.360
 16 is to 9 also has a system that 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.730
 it can be used with slow motion the same 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.800
 camera records in slow motion is not 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.020
 It is necessary for you to make a 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.329
 postproduction after good if you want 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.299
 you can do it but you have the option of 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.159
 record in slow motion 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.729
 the two cameras have an option 

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:26.639
 de di lighting this means that it 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.780
 take a normal photo and the other photo goes up 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.150
 the shadows 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.030
 therefore it works very well with everything 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.960
 what is backlight saves the original and 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.430
 the con dj time 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:42.660
 one's camera has a viewer 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:46.360
 like 35 millimeter cameras and 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.190
 has a diopter button what is 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.540
 very important for people who have 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:54.000
 vision problems or wear glasses 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:57.540
 the two cameras have a system that is 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.990
 very practical that when you are 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:05.190
 recording you can take simultaneously 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:07.740
 photos does not alter the recording and takes 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.530
 photos the moment you want that 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.530
 it's super practical I recommend them 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.540
 honestly these two cameras are going to 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:19.169
 to be able to do very good things with them 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:21.389
 especially in what is video 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.520
 as advice I tell you always read 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:26.180
 the manuals before occupying the camera 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:31.310
 so that we can get the most out of it 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.310
 at the time of taking pictures or videos 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.630
 or 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:48.479
 or not 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.350
 or not
