00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.450 

originally<00:01:15.540> when<00:01:16.080> we<00:01:16.140> thought<00:01:17.130> about<00:01:17.340> an

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
originally when we thought about an

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.030 
originally when we thought about an
alternative<00:01:18.090> treatment<00:01:18.270> here<00:01:18.780> I'm<00:01:19.560> basically

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
alternative treatment here I'm basically

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.010 
alternative treatment here I'm basically
I<00:01:20.159> did<00:01:20.430> about<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.729> month<00:01:20.820> search<00:01:21.659> on<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
I did about a month search on the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.609 
I did about a month search on the
Internet

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
Internet

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.540 
Internet
pretty<00:01:23.220> much<00:01:23.690> after<00:01:24.690> I<00:01:24.930> heard<00:01:25.590> her<00:01:25.770> diagnosis

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
pretty much after I heard her diagnosis

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.780 
pretty much after I heard her diagnosis
she<00:01:26.909> told<00:01:27.690> me<00:01:27.810> she<00:01:27.869> did<00:01:28.080> not<00:01:28.110> wish<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.500> go<00:01:29.460> along

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
she told me she did not wish to go along

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.640 
she told me she did not wish to go along
with<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.180> normal<00:01:30.390> standard<00:01:31.110> conventional

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
with the normal standard conventional

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.120 
with the normal standard conventional
method<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.570> chemotherapy<00:01:33.570> radiation<00:01:34.530> and

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
method of chemotherapy radiation and

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.520 
method of chemotherapy radiation and
surgery<00:01:35.400> which<00:01:36.330> is<00:01:36.630> basically<00:01:37.110> what<00:01:37.380> they

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
surgery which is basically what they

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.219 
surgery which is basically what they
told<00:01:37.770> us<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.220> u.s.<00:01:38.550> downs<00:01:39.240> their<00:01:39.540> approach

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
told us in the u.s. downs their approach

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.390 
told us in the u.s. downs their approach
so<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.630> decided<00:01:42.920> obviously<00:01:43.920> she<00:01:44.070> didn't<00:01:44.250> want

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
so I decided obviously she didn't want

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.639 
so I decided obviously she didn't want
to<00:01:44.430> do<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.509> decided<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:46.320> she<00:01:46.530> would

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
to do that so I decided that she would

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.410 
to do that so I decided that she would
do<00:01:46.800> a<00:01:46.830> little<00:01:47.039> awful<00:01:47.430> lot<00:01:47.580> of<00:01:47.610> searching<00:01:48.180> on

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
do a little awful lot of searching on

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.840 
do a little awful lot of searching on
the<00:01:48.539> internet<00:01:48.950> somewhere<00:01:49.950> between<00:01:50.160> 6<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.789> 8

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
the internet somewhere between 6 and 8

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.150 
the internet somewhere between 6 and 8
hours<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.450> day<00:01:51.619> took<00:01:52.619> me<00:01:52.800> in<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.920> lot<00:01:53.130> of

hours of the day took me in a lot of
different<00:01:53.430> directions<00:01:54.380> of<00:01:55.380> course<00:01:55.649> all<00:01:56.580> the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700

the<00:04:24.920> cancer<00:04:25.130> takes<00:04:26.120> care<00:04:26.450> of<00:04:26.480> you<00:04:27.080> as<00:04:27.350> a<00:04:27.380> person

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
the cancer takes care of you as a person

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.450 
the cancer takes care of you as a person
you<00:04:29.000> know<00:04:29.030> I<00:04:29.150> think<00:04:29.480> to<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:30.740> program<00:04:31.280> like

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
you know I think to the program like

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.330 
you know I think to the program like
she's<00:04:31.670> talking<00:04:32.060> about<00:04:32.150> overall<00:04:32.780> I<00:04:33.080> mean<00:04:33.340> it's

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
she's talking about overall I mean it's

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.280 
she's talking about overall I mean it's
not<00:04:34.520> like<00:04:34.760> in<00:04:35.000> the<00:04:35.060> states<00:04:35.420> it's<00:04:35.720> like<00:04:35.930> you

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
not like in the states it's like you

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.730 
not like in the states it's like you
know<00:04:36.580> here<00:04:37.580> it<00:04:37.700> is<00:04:37.960> surgery<00:04:38.960> chemo<00:04:39.560> radiation

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
know here it is surgery chemo radiation

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.880 
know here it is surgery chemo radiation
and<00:04:40.280> it<00:04:41.240> is<00:04:41.420> what<00:04:41.660> it<00:04:41.780> is<00:04:41.930> and<00:04:42.260> that's<00:04:42.350> it

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
and it is what it is and that's it

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.840 
and it is what it is and that's it
okay<00:04:43.960> when<00:04:44.960> we<00:04:45.080> heard<00:04:45.200> this<00:04:45.380> program<00:04:46.040> really

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
okay when we heard this program really

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.610 
okay when we heard this program really
made<00:04:47.030> more<00:04:47.300> sense<00:04:47.570> I<00:04:47.960> mean<00:04:48.080> if<00:04:48.470> you<00:04:48.590> think

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
made more sense I mean if you think

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.880 
made more sense I mean if you think
about<00:04:48.920> it<00:04:49.340> first<00:04:49.760> of<00:04:49.880> all<00:04:50.060> you<00:04:50.180> have<00:04:50.360> a<00:04:50.890> problem

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
about it first of all you have a problem

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.170 
about it first of all you have a problem
and<00:04:52.100> you're<00:04:52.250> within<00:04:52.490> your<00:04:52.610> body<00:04:52.880> that's

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
and you're within your body that's

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.880 
and you're within your body that's
attacking<00:04:53.830> okay<00:04:54.830> so<00:04:56.290> when<00:04:57.290> we<00:04:57.380> heard<00:04:57.590> about<00:04:57.680> it

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
attacking okay so when we heard about it

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.880 
attacking okay so when we heard about it
was<00:04:58.130> like<00:04:58.310> okay<00:04:58.730> nutrition<00:04:59.630> that<00:05:00.020> makes<00:05:00.260> sense

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
was like okay nutrition that makes sense

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.370 
was like okay nutrition that makes sense
building<00:05:01.730> an<00:05:01.820> immune<00:05:02.090> system<00:05:02.390> up<00:05:02.780> starting<00:05:03.260> to

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
building an immune system up starting to

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.110 
building an immune system up starting to
beginning<00:05:03.710> that's<00:05:04.100> really<00:05:04.490> your<00:05:04.580> first<00:05:04.790> step

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
beginning that's really your first step

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.710 
beginning that's really your first step
that<00:05:05.660> made<00:05:05.930> sense<00:05:06.320> and<00:05:07.040> then<00:05:07.240> going<00:05:08.240> along<00:05:08.540> and

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
that made sense and then going along and

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.720 
that made sense and then going along and
say<00:05:08.900> okay<00:05:09.260> your<00:05:09.560> mind<00:05:09.830> is<00:05:10.040> soothing<00:05:10.250> part<00:05:10.640> of

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
say okay your mind is soothing part of

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.820 
say okay your mind is soothing part of
all<00:05:10.880> it's<00:05:11.300> a<00:05:11.360> whole<00:05:11.510> set<00:05:11.930> up<00:05:12.080> because<00:05:12.290> you're

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
all it's a whole set up because you're

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.260 
all it's a whole set up because you're
in<00:05:12.950> a<00:05:13.010> case<00:05:13.220> of<00:05:13.400> fear<00:05:13.669> when<00:05:13.820> somebody<00:05:14.120> tells

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
in a case of fear when somebody tells

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.440 
in a case of fear when somebody tells
you<00:05:14.390> that

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
you that

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.420 
you that
your<00:05:16.450> brain<00:05:16.690> coming<00:05:17.020> you<00:05:17.320> know<00:05:17.440> certainly
