00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
piece around and then use that to deploy

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.310 
piece around and then use that to deploy
his<00:02:06.960> head<00:02:08.420> and<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:10.320> don't<00:02:11.220> know<00:02:11.460> it's<00:02:11.850> I<00:02:12.320> don't

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
his head and I don't know it's I don't

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.290 
his head and I don't know it's I don't
know<00:02:13.470> why<00:02:13.740> that<00:02:13.950> was<00:02:14.100> done<00:02:14.790> he<00:02:14.940> seems<00:02:15.180> like

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
know why that was done he seems like

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.640 
know why that was done he seems like
there<00:02:15.450> could<00:02:15.570> have<00:02:15.630> been<00:02:15.720> any<00:02:15.990> number<00:02:16.350> of

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
there could have been any number of

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.880 
there could have been any number of
better<00:02:17.340> ways<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.640> do<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.240> just<00:02:18.690> be<00:02:18.930> just<00:02:19.710> by

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
better ways to do that just be just by

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.190 
better ways to do that just be just by
having<00:02:20.430> like<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.670> slider<00:02:21.000> switch<00:02:21.240> here<00:02:21.600> now<00:02:22.050> I

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
having like a slider switch here now I

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.960 
having like a slider switch here now I
actually<00:02:22.590> do<00:02:22.950> know<00:02:23.130> why<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.310> was<00:02:23.490> done<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.850> was

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
actually do know why I was done it was

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:32.570 
actually do know why I was done it was
for<00:02:24.240> that<00:02:24.680> powerlinx<00:02:27.560> gimmick<00:02:28.560> but<00:02:31.580> anyway

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
for that powerlinx gimmick but anyway

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.600 
for that powerlinx gimmick but anyway
here<00:02:32.850> he<00:02:33.030> has<00:02:33.240> here<00:02:33.780> he<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:33.960> in<00:02:34.080> robot<00:02:34.410> mode

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
here he has here he is in robot mode

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.130 
here he has here he is in robot mode
he's<00:02:35.610> got<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:36.090> bunch<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.510> gimbal<00:02:36.780> hanging<00:02:37.020> off

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
he's got a bunch of gimbal hanging off

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.760 
he's got a bunch of gimbal hanging off
his<00:02:37.230> back

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
his back

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
his back
not<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.580> big<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:38.820> deal<00:02:38.970> but<00:02:40.790> something

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
not that big of deal but something

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.770 
not that big of deal but something
better<00:02:42.000> could<00:02:42.210> have<00:02:42.300> been<00:02:42.390> done<00:02:42.540> with<00:02:42.660> that

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
better could have been done with that

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.380 
better could have been done with that
and<00:02:43.650> then<00:02:43.830> he<00:02:43.860> has<00:02:44.070> these<00:02:44.460> things<00:02:44.880> which<00:02:45.150> don't

and then he has these things which don't

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.360 
and then he has these things which don't

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
plug in and just wiggle all over the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.000
