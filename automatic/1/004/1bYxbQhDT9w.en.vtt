00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
fingerings so I believe that the best

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.560 
fingerings so I believe that the best
way<00:01:18.290> to<00:01:18.380> play<00:01:18.770> it<00:01:18.829> would<00:01:19.340> be<00:01:19.579> in<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.180> middle<00:01:20.450> of

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
way to play it would be in the middle of

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.760 
way to play it would be in the middle of
your<00:01:20.720> bow<00:01:20.930> and<00:01:22.030> make<00:01:23.140> sure<00:01:24.140> that<00:01:24.469> you

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
your bow and make sure that you

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.020 
your bow and make sure that you
articulate<00:01:25.520> all<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.990> eighth<00:01:27.229> notes<00:01:27.590> in<00:01:28.460> the

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
articulate all the eighth notes in the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.050 
articulate all the eighth notes in the
slow<00:01:29.270> motion<00:01:29.299> I<00:01:30.049> will<00:01:30.619> play<00:01:31.280> for<00:01:31.340> you<00:01:31.579> a<00:01:31.850> little

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
slow motion I will play for you a little

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:39.249 
slow motion I will play for you a little
slower<00:01:32.479> so<00:01:36.729> you<00:01:37.729> see<00:01:37.909> the<00:01:38.090> eighth<00:01:38.659> notes<00:01:38.990> are

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
slower so you see the eighth notes are

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.800 
slower so you see the eighth notes are
articulated<00:01:40.070> now<00:01:40.490> regarding<00:01:41.149> the<00:01:41.180> fingerings

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
articulated now regarding the fingerings

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.420 
articulated now regarding the fingerings
my<00:01:42.380> suggestion<00:01:43.159> is<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:44.289> stay<00:01:45.289> in<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:46.130> position

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
my suggestion is to stay in the position

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.529 
my suggestion is to stay in the position
and<00:01:46.820> use<00:01:47.149> both<00:01:47.630> a<00:01:47.869> and<00:01:48.320> E<00:01:49.189> string<00:01:49.579> not<00:01:49.789> going

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
and use both a and E string not going

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.050 
and use both a and E string not going
down<00:01:50.750> on<00:01:51.020> E<00:01:51.289> because<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:52.430> rhythm<00:01:52.579> and<00:01:52.820> tight

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
down on E because the rhythm and tight

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.380 
down on E because the rhythm and tight
rhythm<00:01:53.810> is<00:01:53.930> tight<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:55.060> there<00:01:56.060> is<00:01:56.149> not<00:01:56.270> much

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
rhythm is tight and there is not much

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.410 
rhythm is tight and there is not much
time<00:01:56.750> for<00:01:56.810> shifting<00:01:59.350> even<00:02:00.700> later<00:02:01.700> on<00:02:01.969> when<00:02:02.270> it

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
time for shifting even later on when it

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.209 
time for shifting even later on when it

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
beginning of the note so so we try me

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.330 
beginning of the note so so we try me
yes<00:02:43.159> yeah<00:02:43.370> at<00:02:44.290> figure<00:02:45.290> six<00:02:45.650> is<00:02:45.829> where<00:02:46.250> the

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
yes yeah at figure six is where the

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.979 
yes yeah at figure six is where the
first<00:02:46.549> violins<00:02:47.090> are<00:02:47.299> playing<00:02:47.329> the<00:02:47.750> fugue

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
first violins are playing the fugue

00:02:47.989 --> 00:03:08.679 
first violins are playing the fugue
subject<00:02:48.230> either<00:02:48.799> side<00:03:04.510> yeah<00:03:05.680> so<00:03:07.329> try<00:03:08.329> to<00:03:08.359> make

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:08.689 
subject either side yeah so try to make

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:13.990 
subject either side yeah so try to make
sure<00:03:08.900> that<00:03:09.109> III<00:03:09.590> always<00:03:10.549> a<00:03:12.159> big<00:03:13.159> advocate<00:03:13.669> of

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
sure that III always a big advocate of

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.699 
sure that III always a big advocate of
playing<00:03:14.329> somewhere<00:03:15.019> near<00:03:15.349> the<00:03:15.530> middle

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
playing somewhere near the middle

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.960 
playing somewhere near the middle
because<00:03:16.009> then<00:03:17.000> you<00:03:17.209> have<00:03:17.509> two<00:03:18.109> ways<00:03:18.349> to<00:03:18.970> escape

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
because then you have two ways to escape

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.780 
because then you have two ways to escape
from<00:03:20.329> dead<00:03:20.599> and<00:03:20.870> it's<00:03:21.169> either<00:03:21.439> down<00:03:21.769> or<00:03:22.129> up<00:03:22.519> if

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
from dead and it's either down or up if

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.749 
from dead and it's either down or up if
you<00:03:23.120> close<00:03:23.540> to<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:23.989> tip<00:03:24.229> there<00:03:24.739> is<00:03:24.769> a<00:03:25.159> dead<00:03:25.549> end

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:25.759 
you close to the tip there is a dead end

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:28.659 
you close to the tip there is a dead end
and<00:03:26.030> you<00:03:26.269> only<00:03:26.509> have<00:03:26.900> one<00:03:27.229> direction<00:03:28.129> same<00:03:28.370> at

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:28.669 
and you only have one direction same at

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:29.379 
and you only have one direction same at
the<00:03:28.909> front

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:29.389 
the front

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:32.860 
the front
so<00:03:29.629> stay<00:03:30.319> compact<00:03:30.919> stay<00:03:31.879> in<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.299> middle<00:03:32.509> and

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
so stay compact stay in the middle and

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.369 
so stay compact stay in the middle and
try<00:03:33.859> to<00:03:33.919> articulate<00:03:34.759> in<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.269> same<00:03:35.509> time<00:03:35.810> the

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
try to articulate in the same time the

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.550 
try to articulate in the same time the
thing<00:03:36.970> should<00:03:37.970> be<00:03:38.150> light<00:03:38.599> don't<00:03:39.199> press<00:03:39.530> too

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
thing should be light don't press too

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.219 
thing should be light don't press too
much<00:03:39.859> I<00:03:40.189> can't<00:03:41.090> say<00:03:41.269> do<00:03:41.449> you<00:03:41.569> see<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:41.900> way<00:03:42.019> the

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:42.229 
much I can't say do you see the way the

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:45.159 
much I can't say do you see the way the
notes<00:03:42.379> are<00:03:42.790> arranged<00:03:43.790> in<00:03:44.030> this<00:03:44.209> piece<00:03:44.840> it's

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
notes are arranged in this piece it's

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.039 
notes are arranged in this piece it's
five<00:03:45.979> eight<00:03:46.220> and<00:03:46.459> then<00:03:47.060> three<00:03:47.389> four<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:48.019> then

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
five eight and then three four and then

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.759 
five eight and then three four and then
the<00:03:48.229> five<00:03:48.319> eighth<00:03:48.769> part<00:03:49.040> it's<00:03:49.459> 2<00:03:49.970> 8<00:03:50.180> +<00:03:50.540> 3<00:03:50.569> 8<00:03:51.109> so

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
the five eighth part it's 2 8 + 3 8 so

00:03:51.769 --> 00:04:01.200 
the five eighth part it's 2 8 + 3 8 so
we<00:03:51.889> have<00:03:52.040> this<00:03:52.220> in<00:03:52.669> slow<00:03:52.909> motion

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:20.199 

together<00:04:02.210> sure<00:04:18.070> so<00:04:19.070> that's<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:19.580> feeling<00:04:19.910> and

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
together sure so that's the feeling and

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.560 
together sure so that's the feeling and
then<00:04:21.080> when<00:04:21.650> you<00:04:21.830> have<00:04:22.270> accompanying<00:04:23.270> groups

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
then when you have accompanying groups

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:41.560 
then when you have accompanying groups
like<00:04:37.960> that's<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.200> feeling<00:04:40.000> alive<00:04:41.000> and<00:04:41.330> kind

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
like that's the feeling alive and kind

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.960 
like that's the feeling alive and kind
of<00:04:41.660> primitive<00:04:42.560> and<00:04:43.040> sophisticated<00:04:43.820> at<00:04:43.910> the

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
of primitive and sophisticated at the

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.870 
of primitive and sophisticated at the
same<00:04:44.060> time<00:04:44.510> it's<00:04:45.320> very<00:04:45.860> helpful<00:04:46.250> if<00:04:46.520> you<00:04:46.670> can

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
same time it's very helpful if you can

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.440 
same time it's very helpful if you can
think<00:04:47.330> of<00:04:47.510> some<00:04:48.110> words<00:04:48.920> when<00:04:49.610> the<00:04:49.940> rhythm<00:04:50.090> is

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
think of some words when the rhythm is

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.590 
think of some words when the rhythm is
difficult<00:04:51.350> and<00:04:51.650> the<00:04:52.280> great<00:04:52.880> historical

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
difficult and the great historical

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.550 
difficult and the great historical
example<00:04:54.350> is<00:04:54.520> rimsky-korsakov<00:04:55.520> who<00:04:56.290> when<00:04:57.290> he

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
example is rimsky-korsakov who when he

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.240 
example is rimsky-korsakov who when he
wrote<00:04:58.220> something<00:04:58.850> in<00:04:59.110> eleven<00:05:00.110> waters<00:05:00.740> eleven

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
wrote something in eleven waters eleven

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.180 
wrote something in eleven waters eleven
fork<00:05:01.580> and<00:05:01.850> couldn't<00:05:02.390> really<00:05:02.840> conduct<00:05:03.350> because

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
fork and couldn't really conduct because

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.000 
fork and couldn't really conduct because
he<00:05:04.370> got<00:05:04.960> confused<00:05:06.220> his<00:05:07.220> solution<00:05:07.700> was<00:05:07.850> to<00:05:07.910> say

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
he got confused his solution was to say

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.770 
he got confused his solution was to say
rimsky-korsakov<00:05:10.010> so<00:05:10.310> sam<00:05:10.670> tsui<00:05:10.910> Massaro

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
rimsky-korsakov so sam tsui Massaro

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.460 
rimsky-korsakov so sam tsui Massaro
eleven<00:05:12.710> which<00:05:13.190> means<00:05:14.140> rimsky-korsakov<00:05:15.140> he's

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
eleven which means rimsky-korsakov he's

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.050 
eleven which means rimsky-korsakov he's
out<00:05:15.770> of<00:05:16.280> his<00:05:16.610> mind<00:05:18.160> but<00:05:19.160> he<00:05:19.400> thought<00:05:19.550> about<00:05:19.790> his

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
out of his mind but he thought about his

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.880 
out of his mind but he thought about his
phrase<00:05:20.380> he<00:05:21.380> did<00:05:21.530> it

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
phrase he did it

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.950 
phrase he did it
so<00:05:22.700> whatever<00:05:22.910> like<00:05:23.240> would<00:05:23.419> you<00:05:23.510> want<00:05:23.690> to<00:05:23.780> think

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
so whatever like would you want to think

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.630 
so whatever like would you want to think
about<00:05:24.169> it<00:05:24.290> and<00:05:24.410> get<00:05:24.740> those<00:05:25.010> words<00:05:25.250> and<00:05:25.490> those

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
about it and get those words and those

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.900 
about it and get those words and those
rhythms<00:05:25.850> going<00:05:26.090> and<00:05:26.570> we'll<00:05:26.720> rock<00:05:27.110> the<00:05:27.380> joint

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
rhythms going and we'll rock the joint

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.020 
rhythms going and we'll rock the joint
Thanks
