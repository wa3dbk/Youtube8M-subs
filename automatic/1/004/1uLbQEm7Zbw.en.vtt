the free to rewatch up against the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
platen but the bubble jig on the surface

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.960 
platen but the bubble jig on the surface
adjust<00:01:18.030> until<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.450> bubbles<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.990> center

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.999 

this<00:01:23.970> next<00:01:24.180> pretty<00:01:24.450> steady<00:01:24.750> hand<00:01:27.619> to<00:01:28.619> do<00:01:28.799> this

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
this next pretty steady hand to do this

00:01:29.009 --> 00:03:11.430 
this next pretty steady hand to do this
but<00:01:29.720> no<00:01:30.720> practice<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.560> can<00:01:31.710> get

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.430 

see<00:03:12.440> it<00:03:12.650> up<00:03:14.440> keep<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.740> bevels<00:03:16.490> real<00:03:16.670> even

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
see it up keep the bevels real even

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.960 
see it up keep the bevels real even
looks<00:03:18.440> hey<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:18.650> takes<00:03:18.770> a<00:03:18.920> little<00:03:19.070> bit<00:03:19.250> too<00:03:19.460> it's

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
looks hey it takes a little bit too it's

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.250 
looks hey it takes a little bit too it's
a<00:03:20.030> little<00:03:20.090> bit<00:03:20.210> of<00:03:20.360> practice<00:03:20.810> to<00:03:20.930> hold<00:03:21.110> it

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
a little bit of practice to hold it

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.550 
a little bit of practice to hold it
steady<00:03:21.500> but<00:03:21.860> it's<00:03:22.730> a<00:03:22.880> lot<00:03:23.030> easier<00:03:23.090> than<00:03:23.600> doing

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
steady but it's a lot easier than doing

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.510 
steady but it's a lot easier than doing
a<00:03:24.710> completely<00:03:25.250> free<00:03:25.550> hand<00:03:25.580> the<00:03:26.570> I<00:03:27.520> never

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
a completely free hand the I never

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.010 
a completely free hand the I never
ground<00:03:28.820> folder<00:03:29.210> blades<00:03:29.450> I<00:03:29.570> make<00:03:29.720> straight

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
ground folder blades I make straight

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.360 
ground folder blades I make straight
knife<00:03:30.230> so<00:03:30.500> this<00:03:30.650> is<00:03:30.770> something<00:03:30.950> new<00:03:31.040> to<00:03:31.220> me

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
knife so this is something new to me

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.520 
knife so this is something new to me
also<00:03:31.760> but<00:03:32.690> we've<00:03:32.840> been<00:03:33.020> that<00:03:33.230> we've<00:03:33.410> been

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
also but we've been that we've been

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.740 
also but we've been that we've been
played<00:03:33.800> with<00:03:34.040> this<00:03:34.220> jig<00:03:34.520> for<00:03:34.760> about<00:03:35.480> a<00:03:35.510> year

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
played with this jig for about a year

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.960 
played with this jig for about a year
and<00:03:35.780> a<00:03:35.930> half<00:03:35.960> and<00:03:36.590> I've<00:03:37.340> been<00:03:37.460> looking<00:03:37.760> for<00:03:37.940> a

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
and a half and I've been looking for a

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.210 
and a half and I've been looking for a
way<00:03:38.150> for<00:03:38.450> people<00:03:38.660> that<00:03:39.320> grind<00:03:39.560> folder<00:03:39.950> blades

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
way for people that grind folder blades

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.870 
way for people that grind folder blades
to<00:03:40.430> be<00:03:40.550> able<00:03:40.670> to<00:03:40.880> you<00:03:41.600> to<00:03:41.870> use<00:03:42.620> this<00:03:42.890> and<00:03:43.190> also

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
to be able to you to use this and also

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.660 
to be able to you to use this and also
be<00:03:44.270> able<00:03:44.390> to<00:03:44.570> use<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:45.370> bubble<00:03:46.370> jig<00:03:46.550> in

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
be able to use the bubble jig in

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.830 
be able to use the bubble jig in
conjunction<00:03:47.090> with<00:03:47.210> it<00:03:47.510> because<00:03:47.600> it

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
conjunction with it because it

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.680 
conjunction with it because it
definitely<00:03:48.470> gives<00:03:48.800> u<00:03:49.180> equal<00:03:50.180> of<00:03:50.890> pebbles<00:03:51.890> and

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
definitely gives u equal of pebbles and

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.330 
definitely gives u equal of pebbles and
when<00:03:53.690> you<00:03:53.810> end<00:03:53.990> up<00:03:54.140> you<00:03:54.380> have<00:03:54.560> to<00:03:54.830> flat

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
when you end up you have to flat

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.490 
when you end up you have to flat
surfaces<00:03:55.850> on<00:03:56.030> each<00:03:56.180> side<00:03:56.480> check<00:03:57.290> us<00:03:57.410> out

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
surfaces on each side check us out

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.190 
surfaces on each side check us out
online<00:03:57.740> and<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.370> books<00:03:59.210> videos<00:03:59.660> and<00:03:59.960> see<00:04:00.080> what

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
online and the books videos and see what

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.000 
online and the books videos and see what
you<00:04:00.290> thought<00:04:01.300> we'll<00:04:02.300> move<00:04:02.390> to<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:03.010> plate

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
you thought we'll move to the plate

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:11.370 
you thought we'll move to the plate
right<00:04:04.220> now

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.440 

you
