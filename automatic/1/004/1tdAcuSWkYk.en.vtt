the button at the front in order to get
out<00:02:28.220> he<00:02:28.549> uses<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.000> move<00:02:29.150> explode<00:02:29.989> because

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
out he uses the move explode because

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.289 
out he uses the move explode because
he's<00:02:30.620> trapped<00:02:30.890> inside<00:02:31.069> and<00:02:31.430> can't<00:02:31.640> get<00:02:31.760> out<00:02:31.850> so

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
he's trapped inside and can't get out so
