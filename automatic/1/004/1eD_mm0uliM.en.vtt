00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:06.680
 I want to show you a method that I 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.310
 I use to do my projects 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.310
 electronics 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:16.080
 which is very practical and above all very 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:21.029
 economic and easy to carry out 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.640
 since I do not use drawn platelets and 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.220
 then revealed with acid but that 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.619
 I just use a piece of cardboard 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.369
 as you can see from some box 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.369
 in disuse 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.329
 I'm arranging the elements 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.829
 electronic cartons and stuck them 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:44.590
 with me thrill ato 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:47.250
 with that wonderful instant sticker 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.250
 and later 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.239
 I arrange the wires in such a way 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.899
 that can then be welded without any 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:01.390
 kind of inconvenience this is a method 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.430
 extremely economical very fast 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.880
 perform 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:10.229
 and with recyclable materials 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.980
 when developing the components 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:19.350
 or electronic circuits 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:24.390
 and elaborate electronic projects 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.920
 It is achieved with this very practical method 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.130
 truly a good solution 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.939
 then if necessary 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:39.300
 It is placed on top of a box with 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:42.330
 epoxy resin or epoxy putty 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:46.650
 to give you the necessary mechanical rigidity 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.430
 and protect from oxidation and in addition to 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:53.070
 dissipate the heat that's what I wanted 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:56.580
 show them today and I hope that you also 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.040
 be useful to all of you thank you very much 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.910
 for your attention that you have 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.910
 Good Morning
