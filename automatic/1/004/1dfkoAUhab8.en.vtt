the habitat and see few if any because

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.320 
the habitat and see few if any because
they're<00:01:22.049> hiding<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:23.520> all<00:01:23.670> these<00:01:23.790> crevices

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
they're hiding in in all these crevices

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.120 
they're hiding in in all these crevices
but<00:01:24.630> other<00:01:25.200> times<00:01:25.500> there's<00:01:25.710> lots<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.040> them

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
but other times there's lots of them

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.920 
but other times there's lots of them
zipping<00:01:26.430> around<00:01:26.520> when<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.479> feed<00:01:27.659> them<00:01:27.780> of

zipping around when you feed them of
course<00:01:28.080> they<00:01:28.259> come<00:01:28.439> out<00:01:28.590> here's<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.549> perfect

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
course they come out here's a perfect

in<00:01:33.630> some<00:01:33.930> shots<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.829> video<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.100> see<00:01:35.340> algae

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
in some shots in the video you see algae

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.429 
in some shots in the video you see algae
on<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.880> glass<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.360> another's<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.020> glass<00:01:37.229> is

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
on the glass and another's the glass is

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.100 
on the glass and another's the glass is
pretty<00:01:37.829> clean<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.509> due<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.869> these

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
pretty clean and this is due to these

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.440 
pretty clean and this is due to these
all<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.439> neurites<00:01:40.970> sometimes<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.150> takes<00:01:42.240> only

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
all of neurites sometimes it takes only

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.730 
all of neurites sometimes it takes only
a<00:01:42.570> couple<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.840> days<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.290> neurites<00:01:43.560> to

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
a couple of days for the neurites to

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.350 
a couple of days for the neurites to
clean<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.040> glass<00:01:44.220> almost<00:01:44.549> completely<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.329> I

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
clean the glass almost completely so I

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.270 
clean the glass almost completely so I
rotate<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.229> knee<00:01:46.500> rights<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:46.979> out<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
rotate the knee rights in and out of the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.310 
rotate the knee rights in and out of the
habitat<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.390> they<00:01:48.509> hit<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.750> algae<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.140> hard

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
habitat and they hit the algae so hard

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.719 
habitat and they hit the algae so hard
that<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.500> take<00:01:49.799> them<00:01:49.950> out<00:01:50.040> again<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.460> let<00:01:50.579> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
that I take them out again to let the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.429 
that I take them out again to let the
opal<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> chance<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.720> graze<00:01:51.899> naturally

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
opal have a chance to graze naturally

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.469 
opal have a chance to graze naturally
and<00:01:52.619> they<00:01:53.159> breed<00:01:53.640> pretty<00:01:53.880> well<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.270> me

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
and they breed pretty well for me

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.819 
and they breed pretty well for me
they're<00:01:54.659> less<00:01:54.840> prolific<00:01:55.049> than<00:01:55.320> red<00:01:55.590> cherry

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
they're less prolific than red cherry

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.679 
they're less prolific than red cherry
shrimp<00:01:55.950> for<00:01:56.219> example<00:01:56.579> but<00:01:56.700> they<00:01:57.390> produce

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
shrimp for example but they produce

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.389 
shrimp for example but they produce
smaller<00:01:58.110> clutches<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:58.860> female<00:01:59.189> in<00:01:59.310> the

smaller clutches this female in the
