00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
to be the Batpod but that didn't really

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.260 
to be the Batpod but that didn't really
look<00:00:43.230> like<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.920> just<00:00:44.280> called<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.180> the

look like it so I just called it the
bat-cycle<00:00:45.719> because<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.649> don't<00:00:46.860> think<00:00:47.399> they

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
bat-cycle because I don't think they

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.389 
bat-cycle because I don't think they
have<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> bat-cycle<00:00:48.530> think<00:00:49.530> if<00:00:49.770> they<00:00:49.890> do<00:00:50.039> then

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
have a bat-cycle think if they do then
