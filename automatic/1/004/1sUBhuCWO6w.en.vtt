 there is to justify itself there is a modern side if since it is a 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:36.089
 rookie built on a pork basis this one can say that the girl 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:37.329

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.489
 there is a transparency that is quite interesting compared to May 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.459
 lace associations that are done here entirely by hand 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.439

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:59.929

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:43.580

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.469
 something for everyday life 

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:51.659
