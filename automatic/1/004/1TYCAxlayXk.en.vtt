these guys out this is mdf and systemic
gaming<00:00:14.360> makes<00:00:14.770> like<00:00:15.770> lines<00:00:16.100> of<00:00:16.609> buildings<00:00:17.449> and

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
gaming makes like lines of buildings and

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.620 
gaming makes like lines of buildings and
this<00:00:18.140> one<00:00:18.289> is<00:00:18.529> called<00:00:18.770> the<00:00:18.890> base<00:00:19.039> o<00:00:19.330> line<00:00:20.330> and

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
this one is called the base o line and

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.650 
this one is called the base o line and
this<00:00:20.750> is<00:00:20.839> the<00:00:20.929> HQ<00:00:21.529> unit<00:00:21.830> so<00:00:22.820> this<00:00:23.089> is<00:00:23.119> one<00:00:23.419> kit

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
this is the HQ unit so this is one kit

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.220 
this is the HQ unit so this is one kit
the<00:00:23.810> HQ<00:00:24.169> unit<00:00:24.439> and<00:00:24.970> you<00:00:25.970> can<00:00:26.150> get<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:26.419> bay<00:00:27.019> so

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
the HQ unit and you can get the bay so

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.249 
the HQ unit and you can get the bay so
base<00:00:27.769> and<00:00:28.400> it<00:00:29.329> comes<00:00:29.599> with<00:00:29.689> this<00:00:29.900> one<00:00:30.109> and<00:00:30.199> a

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
base and it comes with this one and a

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.120 
base and it comes with this one and a
couple<00:00:30.470> other<00:00:30.710> habitats<00:00:31.460> and<00:00:32.140> platforms<00:00:33.140> what

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
couple other habitats and platforms what

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.920 
couple other habitats and platforms what
I<00:00:34.160> really<00:00:34.460> like<00:00:34.670> about<00:00:34.700> system<00:00:35.450> again<00:00:35.720> yeah

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
I really like about system again yeah

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.210 
I really like about system again yeah
there's<00:00:35.960> actually<00:00:36.530> a<00:00:36.560> lot<00:00:36.620> of<00:00:36.860> things<00:00:36.950> I<00:00:37.100> like

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
there's actually a lot of things I like

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.650 
there's actually a lot of things I like
well<00:00:37.400> systemic<00:00:37.850> gave<00:00:37.940> me<00:00:38.030> one<00:00:38.240> thing<00:00:38.420> you'll

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
well systemic gave me one thing you'll

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.120 
well systemic gave me one thing you'll
notice<00:00:38.840> is<00:00:39.080> that<00:00:39.140> if<00:00:39.380> they're<00:00:39.620> on<00:00:39.650> kind<00:00:40.040> of

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
notice is that if they're on kind of

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.280 
notice is that if they're on kind of
like<00:00:40.310> stilts<00:00:40.970> right<00:00:41.030> they're<00:00:41.720> not<00:00:41.870> touching

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
like stilts right they're not touching

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.210 
like stilts right they're not touching
the<00:00:42.410> ground<00:00:43.330> right<00:00:44.330> off<00:00:44.570> and<00:00:44.960> I<00:00:45.200> actually<00:00:45.800> like

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
the ground right off and I actually like

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.160 
the ground right off and I actually like
that<00:00:46.250> I<00:00:46.490> think<00:00:46.520> that's<00:00:46.850> kind<00:00:47.030> of<00:00:47.090> cool<00:00:47.270> I<00:00:47.540> think

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
that I think that's kind of cool I think

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.420 
that I think that's kind of cool I think
this<00:00:48.260> would<00:00:48.410> be<00:00:48.440> perfect<00:00:48.770> for<00:00:48.980> like<00:00:49.160> maybe<00:00:49.310> a

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
this would be perfect for like maybe a

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.700 
this would be perfect for like maybe a
swamp<00:00:49.820> terrain<00:00:50.150> but<00:00:50.630> at<00:00:50.780> us<00:00:50.930> it's<00:00:51.200> also<00:00:51.350> cool

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
swamp terrain but at us it's also cool

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.570 
swamp terrain but at us it's also cool
because<00:00:52.060> he<00:00:53.060> makes<00:00:53.300> some<00:00:53.800> some<00:00:54.800> some<00:00:55.310> kiss

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 
because he makes some some some kiss

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.050 
because he makes some some some kiss
they<00:00:55.760> make<00:00:56.150> second<00:00:56.750> and<00:00:56.870> third<00:00:57.110> level

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.060 
they make second and third level

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.810 
they make second and third level
platforms<00:00:59.060> so<00:00:59.840> this<00:01:00.140> is<00:01:00.170> its<00:01:00.860> modular<00:01:01.460> with

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
platforms so this is its modular with

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.049 
platforms so this is its modular with
all<00:01:01.940> the<00:01:02.060> kids<00:01:02.300> and<00:01:02.510> and<00:01:03.350> so<00:01:04.250> it<00:01:04.549> kind<00:01:04.759> of<00:01:04.850> works

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
all the kids and and so it kind of works

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.380 
all the kids and and so it kind of works
out<00:01:05.269> like<00:01:05.449> for<00:01:05.630> example<00:01:05.720> this<00:01:06.909> you<00:01:07.909> see<00:01:08.090> how<00:01:08.210> it

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
out like for example this you see how it

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.230 
out like for example this you see how it
has<00:01:08.539> those<00:01:08.780> those<00:01:09.619> stilts<00:01:09.950> well<00:01:10.640> so<00:01:10.969> does<00:01:11.179> this

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
has those those stilts well so does this

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.950 
has those those stilts well so does this
looks<00:01:11.960> so<00:01:12.890> does<00:01:13.130> this<00:01:13.570> so<00:01:14.570> you<00:01:14.630> have<00:01:14.780> those

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
looks so does this so you have those

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.389 
looks so does this so you have those
still<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:15.439> you<00:01:15.499> can<00:01:15.740> put<00:01:15.950> this<00:01:16.039> one<00:01:16.219> as<00:01:16.369> a

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
still so you can put this one as a

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.580 
still so you can put this one as a
separate<00:01:16.820> unit<00:01:17.090> I<00:01:17.299> actually<00:01:17.719> use<00:01:18.020> this<00:01:18.289> as

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
separate unit I actually use this as

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.999 
separate unit I actually use this as
your<00:01:18.619> roof<00:01:20.109> hold<00:01:21.109> on<00:01:21.999> there<00:01:22.999> we<00:01:23.090> go<00:01:23.859> check<00:01:24.859> that

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
your roof hold on there we go check that

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.010 
your roof hold on there we go check that
out<00:01:25.069> so<00:01:25.399> now<00:01:25.549> you're<00:01:25.759> bit<00:01:26.060> your<00:01:26.359> your<00:01:26.719> building

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
out so now you're bit your your building

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.480 
out so now you're bit your your building
is<00:01:27.079> different<00:01:27.439> now<00:01:27.590> you<00:01:27.649> have<00:01:27.799> a<00:01:27.859> completely

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
is different now you have a completely

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.319 
is different now you have a completely
separate<00:01:28.880> building<00:01:29.240> over<00:01:29.749> here<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:31.240> there<00:01:32.240> we

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
separate building over here and there we

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.929 
separate building over here and there we
go<00:01:32.799> another<00:01:33.799> thing<00:01:34.039> I<00:01:34.130> really<00:01:34.700> like<00:01:34.909> about

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
go another thing I really like about

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.129 
go another thing I really like about
systemic<00:01:35.539> gaming<00:01:35.990> is<00:01:36.229> that<00:01:36.499> the<00:01:37.539> the<00:01:38.539> assembly

00:01:39.129 --> 00:01:39.139 
systemic gaming is that the the assembly

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:43.059 
systemic gaming is that the the assembly
is<00:01:39.350> so<00:01:39.909> so<00:01:40.909> easy<00:01:40.939> i<00:01:41.840> mean<00:01:42.530> i've<00:01:42.619> been<00:01:42.770> i've<00:01:43.039> been

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
is so so easy i mean i've been i've been

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:44.919 
is so so easy i mean i've been i've been
putting<00:01:43.280> together<00:01:43.490> a<00:01:43.670> lot<00:01:43.789> of<00:01:43.850> MDF<00:01:44.270> lately<00:01:44.659> and

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
putting together a lot of MDF lately and

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:47.800 
putting together a lot of MDF lately and
i<00:01:45.439> must<00:01:45.649> say<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:46.009> system<00:01:46.189> a<00:01:46.369> gaming<00:01:46.789> is<00:01:46.909> the

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
i must say the system a gaming is the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.359 
i must say the system a gaming is the
easiest<00:01:48.439> by<00:01:48.740> far<00:01:49.509> the<00:01:50.509> fit<00:01:50.810> is<00:01:51.350> not<00:01:51.619> is<00:01:52.310> not

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
easiest by far the fit is not is not

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.270 
easiest by far the fit is not is not
tight<00:01:52.969> snug<00:01:53.869> so<00:01:54.229> you<00:01:54.289> can't<00:01:54.590> just<00:01:54.649> like<00:01:54.950> put<00:01:55.249> a

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
tight snug so you can't just like put a

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.800 
tight snug so you can't just like put a
piece<00:01:55.490> in<00:01:55.520> there<00:01:55.789> and<00:01:55.969> leave<00:01:56.209> it<00:01:56.359> there<00:01:56.389> it

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
piece in there and leave it there it

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.849 
piece in there and leave it there it
will<00:01:57.439> fall<00:01:57.679> off<00:01:58.240> as<00:01:59.240> you<00:01:59.450> can<00:01:59.600> see<00:01:59.840> this<00:02:00.409> just

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:00.859 
will fall off as you can see this just

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:02.800 
will fall off as you can see this just
comes<00:02:01.100> on<00:02:01.369> and<00:02:01.520> off<00:02:01.670> i<00:02:01.909> left<00:02:02.149> these<00:02:02.299> off<00:02:02.539> so

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
comes on and off i left these off so
