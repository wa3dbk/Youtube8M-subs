00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640

to<00:04:07.110> have<00:04:07.260> an<00:04:07.380> elder

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
to have an elder

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
acid mushroom or an elder lava mushroom

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.120 
acid mushroom or an elder lava mushroom
a<00:04:10.870> wouldn't<00:04:11.170> I<00:04:11.260> don't<00:04:11.470> think<00:04:11.620> they<00:04:11.680> take<00:04:11.710> much

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130

a wouldn't I don't think they take much
but<00:04:12.460> Quinn<00:04:13.300> would<00:04:13.420> have<00:04:13.570> to<00:04:13.660> draw<00:04:13.870> up<00:04:14.050> a<00:04:14.170> new

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320
