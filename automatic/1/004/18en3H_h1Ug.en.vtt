00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
nice comfort swivel which is a ball

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.640 
nice comfort swivel which is a ball
joint<00:01:17.490> rather<00:01:17.850> than<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.330> normal<00:01:19.020> swivel<00:01:19.380> so

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
joint rather than a normal swivel so

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.620 
joint rather than a normal swivel so
it's<00:01:19.770> got<00:01:20.280> much<00:01:20.580> greater<00:01:20.939> freedom<00:01:21.540> of

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
it's got much greater freedom of

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.570 
it's got much greater freedom of
movement<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:24.750> outside<00:01:25.080> given<00:01:25.979> from<00:01:26.100> very

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
movement the outside given from very

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.749 
movement the outside given from very
nice<00:01:26.729> styling<00:01:27.890> most<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.070> styling<00:01:29.430> actually

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
nice styling most of styling actually

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.330 
nice styling most of styling actually
has<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> purpose<00:01:30.420> as<00:01:30.570> well<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.590> deflector

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
has a purpose as well so the deflector

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.039 
has a purpose as well so the deflector
as<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.880> separate<00:01:33.210> compartments<00:01:33.720> really

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
as the separate compartments really

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.140 
as the separate compartments really
helps<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.439> spread<00:01:35.430> some<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.820> bubbles

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
helps to spread some of the bubbles

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.390 
helps to spread some of the bubbles
breaks<00:01:36.689> them<00:01:36.869> up<00:01:36.990> into<00:01:37.320> smaller<00:01:37.770> smaller

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
breaks them up into smaller smaller

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.980 
breaks them up into smaller smaller
bubbles<00:01:38.729> they<00:01:38.820> don't<00:01:39.030> interfere<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.570> much

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.499 

from<00:01:42.990> cover<00:01:43.820> even<00:01:44.820> though<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.060> looks<00:01:45.270> like<00:01:45.360> a

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
from cover even though it looks like a

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.380 
from cover even though it looks like a
harder<00:01:45.810> plastic<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.619> full<00:01:47.100> silicon<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:48.270> it

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
harder plastic is full silicon so it

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.340 
harder plastic is full silicon so it
does<00:01:48.680> completely<00:01:50.270> go<00:01:51.270> into<00:01:51.630> activate<00:01:52.259> the

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.680 
on the outside gate inhalation adjuster
so<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.100> can<00:02:17.310> wind<00:02:17.730> it<00:02:17.880> in<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.300> increase<00:02:18.569> the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
so you can wind it in to increase the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.420 
so you can wind it in to increase the
resistance<00:02:18.840> on<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.410> spring<00:02:19.709> so<00:02:20.130> if<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.280> need

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
resistance on the spring so if you need

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.980 
resistance on the spring so if you need
to<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:20.670> can<00:02:20.790> obviously<00:02:21.030> make<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.630> little

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
to you can obviously make it a little

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.370 
to you can obviously make it a little
bit<00:02:22.140> harder<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.440> breathe<00:02:23.870> there<00:02:24.870> is<00:02:24.959> no<00:02:25.110> manual

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.070 
give you the best between performance
and<00:02:40.320> reliability<00:02:40.709> says<00:02:41.550> reduces<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.569> chance

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
and reliability says reduces the chance

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.140 
and reliability says reduces the chance
of<00:02:43.200> free<00:02:43.440> flow<00:02:43.680> but<00:02:44.220> also<00:02:44.370> gives<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:44.910> best

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
of free flow but also gives you the best

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.110 
of free flow but also gives you the best
flow<00:02:45.510> towards<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:45.930> mouthpiece<00:02:46.459> so<00:02:47.459> that's<00:02:47.640> the

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
flow towards a mouthpiece so that's the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.110 
flow towards a mouthpiece so that's the
atomic<00:02:48.709> automatic<00:02:49.709> flow<00:02:49.920> control<00:02:50.280> AFC

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
atomic automatic flow control AFC

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.840 
atomic automatic flow control AFC
mouthpiece<00:02:54.120> again<00:02:55.110> super<00:02:55.739> soft<00:02:55.980> silicon<00:02:56.550> is

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
mouthpiece again super soft silicon is

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.370 
mouthpiece again super soft silicon is
incredibly<00:02:57.390> soft<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.870> touch

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
incredibly soft to touch

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.600 
incredibly soft to touch
so<00:02:58.769> you're<00:02:59.040> not<00:02:59.130> going<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.310> cause<00:02:59.459> irritation

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
so you're not going to cause irritation

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.420 
so you're not going to cause irritation
against<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.540> gums<00:03:00.750> or<00:03:01.019> inside<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:01.980> cheeks<00:03:02.310> or

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
against the gums or inside the cheeks or

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.550 
against the gums or inside the cheeks or
anything<00:03:02.550> like<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:02.900> but<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:03.959> have<00:03:04.110> added<00:03:04.320> a

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
anything like that but I have added a

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.400 
anything like that but I have added a
denser<00:03:05.489> silicon<00:03:06.000> on<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.630> grip<00:03:06.840> so<00:03:07.110> it's<00:03:07.140> much

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
denser silicon on the grip so it's much

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.170 
denser silicon on the grip so it's much
harder<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.860> bite<00:03:08.040> fruit<00:03:08.310> it's<00:03:08.880> obviously

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
harder to bite fruit it's obviously

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.460 
harder to bite fruit it's obviously
