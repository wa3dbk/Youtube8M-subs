reserve settings it is vacuum actuated
so<00:01:14.490> nothing<00:01:14.880> flows<00:01:15.119> through<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.689> bike<00:01:15.900> from

the gas tank unless there is sufficient

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.050 
the gas tank unless there is sufficient
vacuum<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:22.070> that's<00:01:23.070> one<00:01:23.250> thing<00:01:23.400> I'd<00:01:23.580> inspect

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060
