the differences between the two the the
how<00:00:15.540> they<00:00:15.719> differ<00:00:15.900> how<00:00:16.260> they<00:00:16.379> come<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:16.680> each

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
how they differ how they come in each

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.180 
how they differ how they come in each
other

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
other

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.220 
other
what<00:00:17.580> type<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.789> golfers<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:18.390> would<00:00:18.869> Garrett

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
what type of golfers I would Garrett

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.820 
what type of golfers I would Garrett
eight<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.910> do<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:22.020> these<00:00:22.199> two<00:00:22.590> different

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
eight to do to to these two different

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.370 
eight to do to to these two different
types<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:23.160> drivers<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.570> wouldn't<00:00:25.080> tell<00:00:25.230> us<00:00:25.260> a

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
types of drivers so I wouldn't tell us a

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.359 
types of drivers so I wouldn't tell us a
little<00:00:25.439> bit<00:00:25.560> about<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.039> yeah<00:00:26.130> so<00:00:26.340> we

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
little bit about this and yeah so we

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.130 
little bit about this and yeah so we
have<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.640> r11<00:00:26.820> s<00:00:27.210> here<00:00:28.519> the<00:00:29.519> original<00:00:29.699> r11<00:00:30.480> had

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
have the r11 s here the original r11 had

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.190 
have the r11 s here the original r11 had
three<00:00:32.390> configurations<00:00:33.390> on<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.960> soleplate

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
three configurations on the soleplate

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.229 
three configurations on the soleplate
the<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.700> new<00:00:35.850> or<00:00:36.149> 11<00:00:36.570> s<00:00:36.719> has<00:00:37.079> five<00:00:37.469> a

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
the the the new or 11 s has five a

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.369 
the the the new or 11 s has five a
couple<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.300> other<00:00:39.450> new<00:00:39.629> features<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.050> that

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
couple of other new features that that

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.549 
couple of other new features that that
the<00:00:41.450> wear<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.540> screws<00:00:42.840> go<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.050> that's<00:00:43.469> a

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
the wear the screws go in that's a

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.709 
the wear the screws go in that's a
little<00:00:43.680> bit<00:00:43.829> more<00:00:43.980> aerodynamic<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.539> me

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
little bit more aerodynamic and to me

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.840 
little bit more aerodynamic and to me
you<00:00:46.289> can<00:00:46.469> tell<00:00:46.680> where<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.039> CG<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.579> little

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
you can tell where the CG is a little

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.479 
you can tell where the CG is a little
bit<00:00:47.940> lower<00:00:48.450> back<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.840> center<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.489> original

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
bit lower back in center the original

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.590 
bit lower back in center the original
r11<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.149> for<00:00:52.110> 40<00:00:52.410> CCS<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.309> 460<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.420> right

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
r11 is for 40 CCS this is 460 so right

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.170 
r11 is for 40 CCS this is 460 so right
off<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.780> bat<00:00:54.899> when<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.320> set<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.530> down<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:56.010> just

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
off the bat when you set it down it just

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.420 
off the bat when you set it down it just
looks<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.239> much<00:00:57.360> more<00:00:57.780> easier<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.199> hit<00:00:58.530> and

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
looks that much more easier to hit and

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.510 
looks that much more easier to hit and
just<00:01:00.020> aesthetically<00:01:01.020> overall<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:02.190> can<00:01:02.309> just

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
just aesthetically overall you can just

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.539 
just aesthetically overall you can just
tell<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:03.539> just<00:01:03.600> looks<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.650> lot<00:01:04.830> better<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.430> my

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
tell it just looks a lot better in my

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.630 
tell it just looks a lot better in my
opinion<00:01:05.750> lower<00:01:06.750> back<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.229> center<00:01:07.590> real<00:01:08.159> easy

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
opinion lower back and center real easy

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.730 
opinion lower back and center real easy
great<00:01:09.090> footprint<00:01:09.689> really<00:01:10.200> nice<00:01:10.380> big

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
great footprint really nice big

ill worn out we were just hitting some
with<00:01:57.020> a<00:01:57.050> fairway<00:01:57.680> would<00:01:57.920> suffice

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.300

RocketBallz the RBZ get worn out from
that<00:03:04.079> all<00:03:04.409> the<00:03:04.530> notes<00:03:05.370> are<00:03:05.930> and<00:03:06.930> here<00:03:07.590> is<00:03:07.709> the

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
that all the notes are and here is the

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.979 
that all the notes are and here is the
the<00:03:09.450> RocketBallz<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.680> biggest<00:03:11.010> thing<00:03:11.189> here

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
the RocketBallz the biggest thing here

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.929 
the RocketBallz the biggest thing here
is<00:03:12.989> that<00:03:13.140> they've<00:03:13.290> taken<00:03:13.439> the<00:03:13.680> weight<00:03:13.859> it<00:03:14.760> is

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:14.939 
is that they've taken the weight it is

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:16.250 
is that they've taken the weight it is
still<00:03:15.150> low<00:03:15.299> back<00:03:15.510> in<00:03:15.659> center<00:03:15.900> but<00:03:16.140> they've

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
still low back in center but they've

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.740 
still low back in center but they've
moved<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.709> up<00:03:16.859> to<00:03:16.890> create<00:03:17.220> more<00:03:17.579> speed<00:03:17.970> in<00:03:18.329> more

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
moved it up to create more speed in more

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.080 
moved it up to create more speed in more
distance<00:03:19.170> as<00:03:19.409> you<00:03:20.310> know<00:03:20.459> if<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:20.790> move<00:03:20.939> the

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
distance as you know if you move the

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.879 
distance as you know if you move the
weight<00:03:21.450> farther<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.139> farther<00:03:22.260> back<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:22.739> move

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
obviously I would put him in the r11 if

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.030 
obviously I would put him in the r11 if
I<00:06:46.860> had<00:06:46.980> a<00:06:47.010> guy<00:06:47.190> that<00:06:47.220> came<00:06:47.490> to<00:06:47.669> me<00:06:47.790> and<00:06:47.880> said<00:06:48.030> hey

I had a guy that came to me and said hey
I'm<00:06:50.040> pate<00:06:50.250> trying<00:06:50.430> to<00:06:50.490> pick<00:06:50.610> up<00:06:50.669> some<00:06:50.730> distance

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 
I'm pate trying to pick up some distance

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.510 
I'm pate trying to pick up some distance
I<00:06:51.570> would<00:06:52.230> move<00:06:52.350> to<00:06:52.410> the<00:06:52.620> RBZ<00:06:54.080> because

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 
I would move to the RBZ because

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.650 
I would move to the RBZ because
obviously<00:06:56.520> both<00:06:57.000> they're<00:06:57.180> good<00:06:57.360> clubs

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 
obviously both they're good clubs

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.409 
obviously both they're good clubs
obviously<00:06:58.140> both<00:06:58.980> are<00:06:59.010> long<00:06:59.310> but<00:06:59.640> I<00:06:59.880> think<00:07:00.150> the

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:00.419 
obviously both are long but I think the

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:02.420 
obviously both are long but I think the
RBZ<00:07:00.870> it<00:07:01.080> definitely<00:07:01.560> has<00:07:01.710> a<00:07:01.740> little<00:07:02.040> more<00:07:02.160> pop

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:02.430 
RBZ it definitely has a little more pop

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.270 
RBZ it definitely has a little more pop
to<00:07:02.460> it<00:07:02.730> and<00:07:03.240> it's<00:07:03.419> more<00:07:03.780> suited<00:07:04.169> if<00:07:05.100> you're

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 
to it and it's more suited if you're

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.950 
to it and it's more suited if you're
looking<00:07:05.760> to<00:07:05.880> try<00:07:06.030> to<00:07:06.090> pick<00:07:06.300> up<00:07:06.419> distance<00:07:06.810> where

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 
looking to try to pick up distance where

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.710 
looking to try to pick up distance where

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.370 
you're more focused on point A to point

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.220 
B to Point C to try to make a putt so I

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.310

I'd probably stick to our 11s in the bag
if<00:07:21.210> I<00:07:21.300> went<00:07:21.510> to<00:07:21.600> a<00:07:21.800> course<00:07:22.800> where<00:07:23.040> left<00:07:23.460> and

if I went to a course where left and
right<00:07:23.760> is<00:07:23.850> not<00:07:24.000> bigger<00:07:24.210> than<00:07:24.300> that<00:07:24.630> big<00:07:24.750> of<00:07:24.870> a
