both<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.350> them<00:01:01.469> as<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.520> see<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.820> caught

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
both of them as you can see I caught

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.289 
both of them as you can see I caught
that<00:01:03.210> first<00:01:03.690> first<00:01:04.409> on<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.799> mama<00:01:05.010> look<00:01:05.939> just

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
that first first on the mama look just

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.940 
that first first on the mama look just
behind<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.720> shoulder<00:01:06.960> looks<00:01:07.500> like<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.770> went

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
behind the shoulder looks like I went

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.550 
behind the shoulder looks like I went
right<00:01:08.100> through<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.400> vitals<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:09.350> think<00:01:10.350> that's

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
right through the vitals I think that's

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.160 
right through the vitals I think that's
the<00:01:10.680> one<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.100> staggered<00:01:11.670> for<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> bit<00:01:12.170> it

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
the one that staggered for a bit it

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.050 
the one that staggered for a bit it
looks<00:01:13.470> like<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.799> might<00:01:14.010> have<00:01:14.159> got<00:01:14.340> got<00:01:14.880> one

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060
