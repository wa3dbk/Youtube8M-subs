00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.530 
garden start off with I'm going to take
off<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:31.019> Lance<00:00:31.399> pop<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.610> down<00:00:32.640> here<00:00:33.180> and

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
off the Lance pop that down here and

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.319 
off the Lance pop that down here and
then<00:00:33.960> there's<00:00:34.140> also<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.829> an<00:00:35.190> extension<00:00:36.059> for<00:00:36.239> the

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
then there's also a an extension for the

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.110 
then there's also a an extension for the
Lancer<00:00:36.719> clip<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.170> there<00:00:37.500> now<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.670> handle

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
Lancer clip it in there now this handle

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.389 
Lancer clip it in there now this handle
you<00:00:39.270> can<00:00:39.420> use<00:00:39.600> for<00:00:39.809> carrying<00:00:40.320> but<00:00:40.770> also<00:00:40.950> it

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
you can use for carrying but also it

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.729 
you can use for carrying but also it
releases<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.030> piston<00:00:42.480> but<00:00:43.379> we<00:00:43.469> just<00:00:43.590> don't

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
releases the piston but we just don't

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.760 
releases the piston but we just don't
screw<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.570> and<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.690> opens<00:00:46.140> us<00:00:46.260> up<00:00:46.379> for<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
screw that and that opens us up for the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.549 
screw that and that opens us up for the
cylinder<00:00:47.219> here<00:00:47.570> now<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.629> can<00:00:48.960> fill<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.320> up

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
cylinder here now you can fill this up

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.810 
cylinder here now you can fill this up
to<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.460> six<00:00:50.690> liter<00:00:51.690> mark<00:00:52.039> gives<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.309> three

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
to the six liter mark gives you a three

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.299 
to the six liter mark gives you a three
liter<00:00:54.180> air<00:00:54.570> space<00:00:54.960> at<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.379> top<00:00:55.649> which<00:00:56.100> you

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
liter air space at the top which you

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.430 
liter air space at the top which you
need<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.550> be<00:00:56.879> able<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.120> get<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.050> pressure

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
need to be able to get the pressure

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.610 
need to be able to get the pressure
built<00:00:58.920> up<00:00:59.160> inside<00:00:59.340> cylinder<00:00:59.910> if<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.989> need<00:01:01.379> to

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
built up inside cylinder if you need to

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.189 
built up inside cylinder if you need to
fill<00:01:01.859> any<00:01:02.010> more<00:01:02.309> than<00:01:02.579> six<00:01:03.000> liters<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.899> really

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
fill any more than six liters you really

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.560 
fill any more than six liters you really
should<00:01:04.409> be<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.680> knapsack<00:01:05.220> sprayer<00:01:05.570> so

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
should be on a knapsack sprayer so

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.910 
should be on a knapsack sprayer so
return<00:01:07.580> the<00:01:08.580> handle<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.180> piston<00:01:09.920> and

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
return the handle and the piston and

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.890 
return the handle and the piston and
then<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.340> turn<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.150> unlocks<00:01:12.570> and

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
then we turn that so that unlocks and

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.260 
then we turn that so that unlocks and
now<00:01:13.110> we<00:01:13.170> can<00:01:13.530> pump<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.130> compress<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.090> whole

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
now we can pump and compress the whole

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.320 
now we can pump and compress the whole
thing<00:01:15.570> about<00:01:16.380> 20<00:01:16.830> pumps<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.490> sufficient

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
thing about 20 pumps is sufficient

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.170 
thing about 20 pumps is sufficient
you<00:01:18.840> can't<00:01:19.290> over<00:01:20.100> inflate<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.729> whole<00:01:20.909> thing

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
you can't over inflate the whole thing

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.960 
you can't over inflate the whole thing
because<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.080> side<00:01:22.320> here<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.580> release

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
because on the side here is a release

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.870 
because on the side here is a release
valve<00:01:24.240> which<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.170> can<00:01:25.380> also<00:01:25.560> use<00:01:26.159> when<00:01:26.759> it

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
valve which you can also use when it

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.270 
valve which you can also use when it
comes<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.540> emptying<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.409> whole<00:01:28.560> thing<00:01:28.860> you

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
comes to emptying the whole thing you

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.310 
comes to emptying the whole thing you
can<00:01:29.310> depressurize<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.479> just<00:01:30.689> by<00:01:30.810> pulling<00:01:31.049> that

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
can depressurize it just by pulling that

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.700 
can depressurize it just by pulling that
plunger<00:01:31.829> out<00:01:31.979> there<00:01:33.110> if<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.290> don't<00:01:34.500> want<00:01:34.619> to

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
plunger out there if you don't want to

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.800 
plunger out there if you don't want to
carry<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.100> on<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.400> handle<00:01:35.820> you've<00:01:36.299> got<00:01:36.630> a

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
carry it on the handle you've got a

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.749 
carry it on the handle you've got a
carrying<00:01:37.259> strap<00:01:37.619> which<00:01:38.009> will<00:01:38.220> go<00:01:38.369> over<00:01:38.670> the

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
carrying strap which will go over the
