technology that we employ to make tier 3

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.450 
technology that we employ to make tier 3
we've<00:01:04.420> been<00:01:04.600> doing<00:01:04.839> since<00:01:05.100> 1997<00:01:06.100> with<00:01:06.250> just

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
we've been doing since 1997 with just

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.240 
we've been doing since 1997 with just
some<00:01:06.580> refinements<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:07.360> so<00:01:08.200> while<00:01:08.560> our<00:01:08.590> our

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
some refinements and so while our our

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.609 
some refinements and so while our our
competitors<00:01:10.090> are<00:01:10.330> entering<00:01:10.660> new<00:01:10.869> technology

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
we're just enhancing hours and so we're

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.630 
we're just enhancing hours and so we're
really<00:01:14.020> excited<00:01:14.140> to<00:01:14.560> be<00:01:14.710> here<00:01:14.920> and<00:01:15.100> this<00:01:15.460> is

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.760 
kinds of worries 2 or 3 i'm going to
lose<00:01:31.000> power<00:01:31.270> whose<00:01:31.780> performance<00:01:32.440> you<00:01:32.620> know

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
lose power whose performance you know

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.649 
lose power whose performance you know
how<00:01:33.159> do<00:01:33.220> you<00:01:33.340> sort<00:01:33.520> of<00:01:33.700> swage<00:01:34.090> those<00:01:34.299> fears<00:01:34.540> and

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
how do you sort of swage those fears and

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:35.730 
how do you sort of swage those fears and
how<00:01:34.750> do<00:01:34.810> you<00:01:34.840> make<00:01:35.020> sure<00:01:35.140> you<00:01:35.229> don't<00:01:35.470> lose<00:01:35.590> this

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
how do you make sure you don't lose this

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.860 
how do you make sure you don't lose this
well<00:01:35.950> I<00:01:36.280> think<00:01:36.400> that<00:01:36.790> the<00:01:37.060> key<00:01:37.270> thing<00:01:37.540> is<00:01:37.570> we've

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
well I think that the key thing is we've

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.070 
well I think that the key thing is we've
been<00:01:37.900> doing<00:01:38.320> this<00:01:38.470> technology<00:01:39.340> since<00:01:39.570> 1997<00:01:40.570> so

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
been doing this technology since 1997 so

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.800 
been doing this technology since 1997 so
we<00:01:41.500> have<00:01:41.680> a<00:01:41.710> leg<00:01:41.950> up<00:01:41.979> and<00:01:42.630> with<00:01:43.630> the

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
we have a leg up and with the

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.840 
we have a leg up and with the
refinements<00:01:44.590> we've<00:01:44.770> used<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.369> base<00:01:45.610> engine

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
refinements we've used the base engine

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.430 
refinements we've used the base engine
that<00:01:46.150> we've<00:01:46.270> been<00:01:46.360> using<00:01:46.420> all<00:01:46.810> along<00:01:46.869> which<00:01:47.290> is

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
that we've been using all along which is

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.770 
that we've been using all along which is
proven<00:01:47.860> as<00:01:48.490> we<00:01:48.640> call<00:01:48.850> it<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.000> legend<00:01:49.540> the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
proven as we call it the legend the

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.690 
proven as we call it the legend the
Ironmen<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:50.350> is<00:01:50.860> a<00:01:50.890> proven<00:01:51.159> technology

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
Ironmen it is a proven technology

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.120 
Ironmen it is a proven technology
approve<00:01:52.240> an<00:01:52.360> engine<00:01:52.659> and<00:01:52.810> so<00:01:53.320> the<00:01:53.470> refinements

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
approve an engine and so the refinements

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.100 
approve an engine and so the refinements
are<00:01:54.310> things<00:01:54.700> such<00:01:54.909> as<00:01:54.990> increasing<00:01:55.990> the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
are things such as increasing the

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.370 
are things such as increasing the
pressure<00:01:56.320> and<00:01:56.680> our<00:01:56.770> common<00:01:57.159> rail<00:01:57.340> fuel<00:01:57.729> to<00:01:58.479> get

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
pressure and our common rail fuel to get

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.850 
pressure and our common rail fuel to get
a<00:01:59.439> better<00:01:59.850> mixture<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:02.049> it's<00:02:02.260> not<00:02:02.409> fallen

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
a better mixture and so it's not fallen

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.140 
a better mixture and so it's not fallen
to<00:02:02.979> us<00:02:03.130> we've<00:02:03.310> already<00:02:03.460> had<00:02:03.670> it<00:02:03.790> running<00:02:03.939> in

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
to us we've already had it running in

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.179 
to us we've already had it running in
different<00:02:04.330> engine<00:02:04.979> packages<00:02:05.979> and

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
different engine packages and

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.370 
different engine packages and
construction<00:02:06.820> and<00:02:06.970> industrial<00:02:07.090> so<00:02:08.049> it's

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
construction and industrial so it's

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.830 
construction and industrial so it's
already<00:02:08.560> proven<00:02:09.070> technology<00:02:09.700> out<00:02:10.450> in<00:02:10.690> other

already proven technology out in other

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.470 
already proven technology out in other
other<00:02:11.170> fields<00:02:11.650> sure<00:02:11.980> now<00:02:12.250> you<00:02:12.310> know<00:02:12.549> tier<00:02:13.030> 4<00:02:13.330> is

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
other fields sure now you know tier 4 is

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.940 
other fields sure now you know tier 4 is
coming<00:02:13.750> down<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.959> pipeline<00:02:14.170> you<00:02:14.830> know

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
coming down the pipeline you know

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.070 
coming down the pipeline you know
there's<00:02:15.489> always<00:02:15.730> more<00:02:16.000> concern<00:02:16.390> about<00:02:16.570> fuel

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
there's always more concern about fuel

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.750 
there's always more concern about fuel
costs<00:02:17.350> you<00:02:17.709> want<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.070> use<00:02:18.160> as<00:02:18.280> little<00:02:18.400> fuel<00:02:18.670> as

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
costs you want to use as little fuel as

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.610 
costs you want to use as little fuel as
possible<00:02:18.790> at<00:02:19.269> the<00:02:19.360> offensive<00:02:19.780> stuff<00:02:20.019> know

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
possible at the offensive stuff know

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.170 
possible at the offensive stuff know
what's<00:02:20.799> in<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.010> pipeline<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.820> you<00:02:21.940> know<00:02:22.060> what

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
what's in the pipeline and you know what

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.400 
what's in the pipeline and you know what
are<00:02:22.239> you<00:02:22.299> doing<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.600> make<00:02:22.720> sure<00:02:22.930> that<00:02:23.260> you're

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
are you doing to make sure that you're

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.340 
are you doing to make sure that you're
ready<00:02:23.560> for<00:02:23.709> that<00:02:23.980> well<00:02:24.310> in<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.239> every<00:02:26.200> time

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
ready for that well in the every time

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.470 
ready for that well in the every time
you<00:02:26.410> you<00:02:27.280> increase<00:02:27.730> your<00:02:27.970> emissions

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
you you increase your emissions

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.140 
you you increase your emissions
reduction<00:02:29.079> then<00:02:29.560> fuel<00:02:30.010> they<00:02:30.190> take<00:02:30.700> more<00:02:30.880> fuel

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
reduction then fuel they take more fuel

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.820 
reduction then fuel they take more fuel
so<00:02:31.360> they<00:02:31.480> can<00:02:31.660> be<00:02:31.750> as<00:02:31.870> much<00:02:31.989> as<00:02:32.050> five<00:02:32.380> six<00:02:32.680> seven

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
so they can be as much as five six seven

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.160 
so they can be as much as five six seven
percent<00:02:33.310> loss<00:02:33.489> when<00:02:34.150> you<00:02:34.300> go<00:02:34.510> up<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.690> your<00:02:34.810> next

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.130 
percent loss when you go up to your next
level<00:02:35.319> in<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:36.099> case<00:02:36.310> for

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140

to<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:37.380> when<00:02:37.590> we<00:02:37.740> went<00:02:37.890> from<00:02:38.270> epa<00:02:39.270> tier<00:02:39.540> 2<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.870> 3

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
to you when we went from epa tier 2 to 3

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.400 
to you when we went from epa tier 2 to 3
we<00:02:40.650> only<00:02:40.830> had<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.069> two<00:02:41.280> percent<00:02:41.930> fuel<00:02:42.930> burn<00:02:43.110> rate

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
we only had a two percent fuel burn rate

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.720 
we only had a two percent fuel burn rate
going<00:02:44.069> up<00:02:44.250> when<00:02:45.180> we<00:02:45.300> go<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.480> tier<00:02:46.020> 4<00:02:46.560> we<00:02:47.010> will<00:02:47.280> be

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
going up when we go to tier 4 we will be

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.920 
going up when we go to tier 4 we will be
employing<00:02:48.270> scr<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.110> with<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.040> scr<00:02:50.630> we<00:02:51.630> will

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
employing scr and with the scr we will

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.720 
employing scr and with the scr we will
have<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.500> same<00:02:52.680> engine<00:02:53.100> so<00:02:53.220> our<00:02:53.340> fuel<00:02:53.580> burn

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
have the same engine so our fuel burn

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.580 
have the same engine so our fuel burn
will<00:02:53.940> not<00:02:54.090> change<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.720> for<00:02:55.020> our<00:02:55.200> readers<00:02:55.380> are

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
will not change and for our readers are

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.560 
will not change and for our readers are
don't<00:02:55.709> want<00:02:55.890> scr<00:02:56.370> stand<00:02:56.610> ser<00:02:57.090> is<00:02:57.209> urea

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
don't want scr stand ser is urea

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.510 
don't want scr stand ser is urea
injection<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:58.230> so<00:02:58.709> what<00:02:58.890> we're<00:02:59.070> doing<00:02:59.100> is

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
injection and so what we're doing is

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.490 
injection and so what we're doing is
we're<00:02:59.730> running<00:03:00.030> mixing<00:03:00.810> some<00:03:00.959> urea<00:03:01.290> in<00:03:01.380> the

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
we're running mixing some urea in the

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.790 
we're running mixing some urea in the
exhaust<00:03:01.770> and<00:03:02.360> with<00:03:03.360> that<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:04.170> helps<00:03:04.500> reduce

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
exhaust and with that it helps reduce

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.400 
exhaust and with that it helps reduce
the<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.790> NOx<00:03:06.030> which<00:03:06.540> is<00:03:06.810> part<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.319> the

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
the the NOx which is part of the

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.199 
the the NOx which is part of the
requirements<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.130> then<00:03:08.640> we<00:03:08.850> see<00:03:09.060> the

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
requirements and then we see the

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.330 
requirements and then we see the
particulate<00:03:09.840> matter<00:03:10.080> some<00:03:10.440> some<00:03:10.980> folks<00:03:11.220> are

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
particulate matter some some folks are

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.920 
particulate matter some some folks are
going<00:03:11.459> to<00:03:11.550> have<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.730> use<00:03:11.910> our<00:03:12.180> particulate

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
going to have to use our particulate

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.080 
going to have to use our particulate
trap<00:03:13.200> filters<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:14.010> catch<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.580> particulate

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
trap filters to catch the particulate

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.900 
trap filters to catch the particulate
matter<00:03:15.330> we<00:03:15.810> see<00:03:16.019> it<00:03:16.140> as<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.320> in<00:03:16.739> cylinder<00:03:17.190> we

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
matter we see it as a in cylinder we

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
matter we see it as a in cylinder we
weren't<00:03:18.150> going<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:18.330> have<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.510> deal<00:03:18.660> with<00:03:18.810> that

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
weren't going to have to deal with that

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.509 
weren't going to have to deal with that
