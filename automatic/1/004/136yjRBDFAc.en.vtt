00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.139
 This is the new rescue and we already put 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.000
 on our off road track to know if the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.279
 four-wheel drive and one engine 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.140
 diesel really can stand in the mud 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.500
 check out one more video of talking about 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.500
 car 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:34.790
 Only we 're walking is 2.0 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:38.160
 engine with 170 horsepower and 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.710
 35.7 kg of maximum torque 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.629
 According to the jeep, I reneged 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.360
 reach 100 kilometers per hour in 9.9 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.340
 seconds the renegade despite being a 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.059
 jeep entry model is filled with 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.379
 Details 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.260
 the front grille follows the characteristics 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.960
 brand and it's rear flashlight refers 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.149
 old willys jeep halls 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.160
 inside the rustic style continues the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.870
 console looks simpler but 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.600
 do not be fooled as the hoops 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.309
 materials are of excellent quality 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.290
 series diesel versions rely on 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.180
 air conditioning with traction control and 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.250
 stability driver's seat with 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.479
 height adjustment electric steering 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.590
 USB input and electronic handbrake 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.470
 back that surprised us is the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.380
 Inside noise is you do not listen is a 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.439
 beating console sound you do not listen 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.840
 noise from any other 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.360
 A typical noise of cars in a hole 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.650
 is the car was very well built you 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.520
 do not listen to any kind of noise 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.110
 despite being a diesel engine 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.960
 We noticed that the car is very 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.939
 anxious mainly and walking in that 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.880
 stop we notice the noise of the 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.049
 diesel engine hitting but from the 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.119
 moment you start walking that 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.820
 some noise and it even looks like a 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.570
 same gasoline and do not transmit any 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.220
 noise 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.700
 that noise that many many people 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.079
 do not like the noise said consom 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.049
 energy system has three modes of 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.869
 off-road driving that is snow rising 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.579
 and lover, in the case of the sport version, are 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.910
 the three available in the case of the 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:12.480
 rock you win the role of rock that is 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.800
 for you to climb a few stones is the 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.350
 some mountains 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.280
 this is the case we tested the version 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:23.100
 maintained with a differential lock 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.310
 lowering assistant right and reduced 144 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.370
 It's how you can see in the video oo 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.310
 blocking differential he notices the 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.350
 where the wheel has no grip and 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.110
 soon it was giving more strength and 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.870
 priority for the wheels that have traction 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.090
 we noticed that the kind of lick 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.640
 He likes to walk in the mud. I'm super good. 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.110
 by the way is he has not transmitted in any 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.660
 moment the car jammed 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.940
 he notices some wheel that goes 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.150
 lose grip he's already strong 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.160
 other wheels we were not even 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.310
 mud and just rolling 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.360
 only that opinion is more made for the 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.250
 City 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.770
 unlike the version of rock the tires 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.030
 most viewed you can not climb 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.860
 anything with it 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.730
 who knows in the rock version that is 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.740
 more possible 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.220
 besides that it has the function 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.990
 rock that does not have 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.750
 in the case of the diesel version it is equipped with 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.450
 nine-speed transmission that leaves the 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.250
 Very economical car by the way is the 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.620
 from 110 kilometers per hour 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.870
 you have the ninth gear engaged and the 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.130
 From here you have a change of track 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.500
 interesting to work on a 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.080
 down is anything you need 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.220
 overtake or win 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.239
 speed with a little more than 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.070
 facility 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.680
 You have to reduce to the seventh 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.590
 Eighth gear for you has a touch more 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.430
 interesting and gain power with more 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.230
 facility 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.600
 traction control and stability and 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.270
 secure the remake of curves but you 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.390
 realize that anything a little bit 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.700
 the faster you do you already heard 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.890
 the tires singing this ends up being a 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.440
 feature of higher cars right 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.620
 but the traction control he 's there for 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.370
 to handle this kind of discomfort 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:12.060
 despite being a four-by-four car 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:14.010
 dirceu is facing and the sounds of the road 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.000
 renegade he is much more ready 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.340
 when the city 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.410
 it is a completely soft car 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.500
 macpherson front suspension and 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.460
 helps you to ride in the 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.009
 city pass through holes with 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.500
 the extreme comfort thanks to the engine 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:31.840
 renegade is very economical in the 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.849
 city today travels up to 12 kilometers 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.460
 per liter and on the road this average 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:37.270
 to 18 kilometers per liter for those who 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.250
 travel back 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.080
 the jeep can take everyone off 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.849
 only the trunk that has no space 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.430
 to carry all the luggage 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:47.620
 the jeep I renegedi from 69 thousand and 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.590
 nine hundred reais in the sport flex version 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.479
