00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.730
 about the lenovo yoga tablet 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.559
 tablet 10 h more so there we go 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.630
 to talk to you about all aspects 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.100
 techniques of this tablet then already 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.189
 we'll start with the processor is 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.350
 a qualcomm snapdragon processor 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.390
 of body that is clocked at 1.6 ghz arm 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.439
 I'm pretty good it turns 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.330
 relatively well 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.869
 everything is supported and that's a beautiful 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.910
 surprise m by 2 gigabytes of ram internally 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.530
 So that's it's a novelty 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.780
 for lenovo which before us we 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.149
 propose that only one giga there really 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.239
 falls much faster in terms 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.489
 internal storage we have 16 or 32 gigas 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.989
 depending on your model purchased from 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.879
 internal storage and then one to android 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:54.059
 14.4 kat kit that is already installed 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.219
 so I'm doing a little tour ah yes just 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.100
 one more thing about the screen 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.460
 so we're on a full hd resolution 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.280
 dock sindali ps of 10.1 with a 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.140
 full HD resolution of 1920 by 1200 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.670
 pixels so it's really what 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.220
 really does better for a tablet 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.720
 So this format then there one of 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.130
 point of view technical specs 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.960
 so we're already going to do a little bit 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.850
 the round of the table is always sent 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.830
 this shape a little cylindrical 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.960
 with the flapper that is recovering like those 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.369
 this is really the big thing 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.630
 specificity of this tablet 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.790
 they had seen him on the model 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.509
 push that's really the cool side 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.270
 on the side there you see right here we have a 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.350
 case a micro usb input so for 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.360
 recharge the tablet 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.909
 here is the power button that we can not 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.040
 to miss the front we have nothing 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.250
 except the famous bar to pose for 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.470
 do some kind of dock with the tablet 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.909
 Then I turn on the other side of the 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.880
 big button here it's the jack 3 5 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.369
 100 mm to connect the headphones there the 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.770
 further for the volume right there the 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.590
 tiny hole that we see here is the 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.000
 ambient micro sensor and on the 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.100
 on here nothing and as on the 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.959
 previous model right there and that's 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.000
 an interesting specificities 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:11.989
 openly and impulsively to integrate a 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.670
 micro sd slot that can go up there 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.739
 I believe that these 32 gigas of memory on 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.540
 this one so we can do it again but 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:21.049
 like these we have the dolby surround sound 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.660
 which is integrated with this tablet on the 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:27.890
 storefront so if you see there we have a 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.030
 video sensor that meanwhile I 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.819
 believe if I tell you will bless you he 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:36.860
 makes 1 3 megapixel front and back 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.410
 there is none so there is just the 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.720
 part of which he is here and it's a sensor 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.000
 of 8 megapixels and we will see as a result 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.109
 of this test that this tablet realizes 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.530
 very very beautiful shots 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:49.280
 so to continue on the specs 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.900
 techniques 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.180
 so there is a possibility of having a 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.410
 model with the 3g we do not have this 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.440
 model there but have the possibility of the 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:01.579
 see with a 3 of the 3g + otherwise in 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:07.630
 terms of dimensions so that's 2 161 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:10.849
 2 2 wide by 180 mm high 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:14.680
 for a thickness and then there my opinion 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.919
 they took the small part here of 9.3 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.810
 mm 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:19.099
 so here is a little bit for them 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.989
 technical specifications of this 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.069
 Tablet 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.660
 I told you a moment ago the microphone 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.310
 sd up to 32 but it's really 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.569
 up to 64 gigabytes 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.819
 as much for me I planted there 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.160
 on it so here is a little bit for them 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.090
 info of this tablet 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.799
 otherwise we will see as a result of this 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.750
 head that there are a whole lot of small 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.849
 features that works very very 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.190
 well on this tablet is including a 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.109
 advantages of this tablet is a 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.790
 extra long battery that allows 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.560
 to go up to 18 hours of autonomy 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.419
 so it's pretty rare to find 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.870
 tablets that go so far in term 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:50.060
 autonomy 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.920
 to finish there is a small overlayer 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.599
 software 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.550
 the new that is integrated with this 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.709
 tablet that not to displease it's not 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.819
 bad is called the new launcher it's 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.050
 not bad at all good then cons 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.130
 it's quite confusing at the beginning since 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.060
 all the apps are found a little 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.620
 as on the ipad 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.970
 that is directly on the page 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.160
 we have no place to go 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.510
 search inside android the 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.190
 apps to drag them so 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.610
 it's a little subtlety of this 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.160
 Tablet 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.989
 so here it was just about everything I 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.430
 just want to finish the last thing 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.820
 separates the different modes that can 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.750
 to have 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.669
 so if I close here that's like that one 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.350
 can hold it like this as an ebook 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:27.620
 we can read without problem 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:31.790
 in the nose we can also do it 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:35.300
 hold on like this if we want to say it with 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.919
 seen a kind of little thick here me 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.650
 allows easy reading 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.120
 and finally the last position that at 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.790
 my sense is the most practical like those 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.090
 he saw that we can see it like that 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.650
 what's nice is that the the the 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.780
 crutch is strong enough for the 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.550
 move down to the desired position 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.770
 and that's not a luxury because it's 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.300
 quite painful on some tables so 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.400
 this is ptet the specifications 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.900
 lenovo yoga tablet techniques 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.900
 tablet 10 am more 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.240
 or
