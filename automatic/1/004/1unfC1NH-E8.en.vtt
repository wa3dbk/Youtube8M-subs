00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.769
 today we are going to prepare lasagna de carro 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:12.190
 for this we are going to need 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:16.360
 a medium eggplant a quarter of a kilo 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:19.090
 of minced pork eight sheets of 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.260
 precooked cannelloni 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:26.530
 two slices of cheese 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:30.270
 140 grams of crushed tomato 8 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.270
 tablespoons of olive oil 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.040
 Salt 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.930
 grated cheese for grating 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.100
 directly 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:48.680
 we put the cannelloni slices in water 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.070
 hot for 15 to 20 minutes peel the 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.070
 eggplant 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.500
 and cut it into small cubes 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.059
 in a pan with the oil we put 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.180
 support the eggplant 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.460
 once done, we remove them and 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.220
 We reserve on a plate with paper of 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.490
 kitchen to remove excess 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.490
 oil 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.590
 in the same oil we throw the meat and 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.830
 let's go around so it's done 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.830
 all right 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.960
 when done we remove and reserve 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.630
 with the eggplant 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.510
 after having 15 to 20 minutes 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.180
 Soak the plates and take them out 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:45.400
 we put well stretched on paper 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.400
 absorbent to dry 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.310
 I used cannelloni plates because 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:55.000
 I like its texture 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:58.229
 Now we mix the tomato very well 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.229
 meat and eggplant 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.450
 in a baking dish we put a 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.530
 layer of plates and on it a layer of 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.530
 meat mixture 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.840
 and we repeat the operation again 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:36.020
 we must cover all the 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.020
 surface of the plate with the mixture 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.760
 and finally once again a layer of 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.760
 plates and other market 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:01.200
 now we put the two slices of cheese and 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.200
 we close with another layer of plates 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.690
 we throw over the bÃ©chamel that 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.690
 cover lasagna very well 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:25.000
 to finish we toss the grated cheese 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:29.720
 above covering the entire bus 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.900
 We put in the oven to gratinate about 180 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:36.140
 degrees when we see that the cheese is 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:40.900
 we get cast 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.900
 I hope you like it and take advantage
