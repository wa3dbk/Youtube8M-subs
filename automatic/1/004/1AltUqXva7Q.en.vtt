00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
camshaft back on because of pressure you

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.500 
camshaft back on because of pressure you

there's<00:02:37.530> some<00:02:37.680> guys<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.060> suggested<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.330> I

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
there's some guys that suggested that I

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.200 
there's some guys that suggested that I
compress<00:02:40.260> some<00:02:40.920> of<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.100> springs<00:02:41.430> put<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.030> bit

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
compress some of the springs put a bit

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.020 
compress some of the springs put a bit
of<00:02:42.330> rope<00:02:42.710> under<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.830> valve<00:02:44.070> that<00:02:44.490> keeps<00:02:44.700> it

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
of rope under the valve that keeps it

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.260 
of rope under the valve that keeps it
compressed<00:02:45.510> while<00:02:45.750> I<00:02:45.780> clamp<00:02:46.320> down<00:02:46.730> I<00:02:47.730> might

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
compressed while I clamp down I might

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.780 
compressed while I clamp down I might
try<00:02:48.570> that<00:02:48.630> technique<00:02:51.470> or<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:52.500> might<00:02:53.160> I've<00:02:53.490> taken

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
try that technique or I might I've taken

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.240 
try that technique or I might I've taken
out<00:02:54.120> just<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:55.200> think<00:02:55.590> there's<00:02:55.800> three<00:02:55.980> of<00:02:56.160> the

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
out just I think there's three of the

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.410 
out just I think there's three of the
followers<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:57.000> they've<00:02:57.450> hit<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.900> camshaft

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
followers that they've hit the camshaft

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.360 
followers that they've hit the camshaft
when<00:03:00.420> locked<00:03:01.050> down<00:03:01.290> so<00:03:01.620> I've<00:03:01.710> taken<00:03:01.950> them<00:03:02.160> off

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
when locked down so I've taken them off

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.140 
when locked down so I've taken them off
and<00:03:02.900> I'll<00:03:03.900> do<00:03:04.410> everything<00:03:04.680> up<00:03:04.980> and<00:03:05.880> then

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
and I'll do everything up and then

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.230 
and I'll do everything up and then
compress<00:03:06.750> one<00:03:07.170> each<00:03:07.350> time<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:08.070> try<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.030> put

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
compress one each time and try and put

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.370 
compress one each time and try and put
the<00:03:09.420> followers<00:03:10.080> back<00:03:10.290> in<00:03:11.930> please<00:03:12.930> tell<00:03:13.170> me<00:03:13.320> if

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
the followers back in please tell me if

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.850 
the followers back in please tell me if
that's<00:03:13.500> not<00:03:13.770> a<00:03:13.830> good<00:03:13.980> idea<00:03:14.010> or<00:03:14.490> not<00:03:15.860> anyway

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
that's not a good idea or not anyway

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.900 
that's not a good idea or not anyway
once<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:17.400> do<00:03:17.459> that<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:19.860> next<00:03:20.160> big<00:03:20.370> problem<00:03:20.790> I

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
once I do that the next big problem I

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.520 
once I do that the next big problem I
have<00:03:21.180> that<00:03:21.390> I'm<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.540> little<00:03:21.780> bit<00:03:22.020> worried<00:03:22.320> about

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
have that I'm a little bit worried about

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.860 
have that I'm a little bit worried about
is<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:23.610> timing<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.800> haven't<00:03:25.800> got<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:26.190> clue<00:03:26.400> about

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
is the timing I haven't got a clue about

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.840 
is the timing I haven't got a clue about
that<00:03:27.870> I<00:03:28.650> understand

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
that I understand

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.610 
that I understand
top<00:03:30.480> dead<00:03:30.660> center<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.850> I<00:03:32.850> believe<00:03:33.120> there<00:03:33.510> is<00:03:33.870> a

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
top dead center and I believe there is a

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.770 
top dead center and I believe there is a
marking<00:03:35.660> somewhere<00:03:36.660> on<00:03:37.220> here<00:03:38.220> that<00:03:38.600> needs<00:03:39.600> to

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
marking somewhere on here that needs to

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:49.479 
marking somewhere on here that needs to
be<00:03:41.270> facing<00:03:42.270> upwards<00:03:45.680> also<00:03:46.680> I<00:03:47.040> haven't<00:03:47.430> got<00:03:47.959> a

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
be facing upwards also I haven't got a

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.479 
be facing upwards also I haven't got a
cam<00:03:50.489> locking<00:03:50.820> nut<00:03:51.260> that<00:03:52.260> how<00:03:52.410> I<00:03:52.440> got<00:03:52.830> it<00:03:52.950> out<00:03:53.190> in

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
cam locking nut that how I got it out in

cam locking nut that how I got it out in
the<00:03:53.820> first<00:03:54.060> place<00:03:54.330> was<00:03:54.600> two<00:03:54.780> bits<00:03:55.050> of<00:03:55.340> wood

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340
