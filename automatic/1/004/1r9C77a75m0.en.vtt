might have a problem with some of it but

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.720 
might have a problem with some of it but
from<00:02:32.590> my<00:02:32.739> point<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:32.980> view<00:02:33.040> it<00:02:33.220> seemed<00:02:33.459> like<00:02:33.610> it

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
from my point of view it seemed like it

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.449 
from my point of view it seemed like it
was<00:02:33.849> trying<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.470> shell<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.890> whole<00:02:36.040> science

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
was trying to shell the whole science

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.339 
was trying to shell the whole science
religion<00:02:36.640> thing<00:02:37.299> and<00:02:37.599> in<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:37.959> good<00:02:38.170> way<00:02:38.290> a

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
religion thing and in a good way a

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.589 
religion thing and in a good way a
religion<00:02:38.980> versus<00:02:39.340> science<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.790> good<00:02:39.940> cinematic

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
religion versus science a good cinematic

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.160 
religion versus science a good cinematic
battle<00:02:40.989> always<00:02:42.090> always<00:02:43.090> that's<00:02:43.450> good<00:02:43.720> versus

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
battle always always that's good versus

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.410 
battle always always that's good versus
evil<00:02:44.319> with<00:02:44.859> every<00:02:45.190> good<00:02:45.400> girl<00:02:45.609> who<00:02:45.760> is<00:02:46.030> evening

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
evil with every good girl who is evening

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.960 
evil with every good girl who is evening
I<00:02:46.810> mean<00:02:47.319> they<00:02:47.470> would<00:02:47.620> think<00:02:47.829> science<00:02:48.370> is<00:02:48.579> evil

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
I mean they would think science is evil

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.759 
I mean they would think science is evil
they<00:02:49.150> do<00:02:49.299> a<00:02:49.329> lot<00:02:49.569> more<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:49.930> kind<00:02:50.079> of<00:02:50.230> push<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:50.500> on

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
they do a lot more to kind of push it on

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.140 
they do a lot more to kind of push it on
the<00:02:50.890> book<00:02:51.069> then<00:02:51.250> in<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.489> movie<00:02:51.670> I<00:02:51.790> thought<00:02:52.000> it

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
the book then in the movie I thought it

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.360 
the book then in the movie I thought it
was<00:02:52.269> nice<00:02:52.480> I<00:02:52.720> mean<00:02:52.840> it<00:02:53.019> didn't<00:02:53.290> put<00:02:54.099> the<00:02:54.220> church

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370

Howard trying to make up with them from

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.949 
Howard trying to make up with them from
The<00:02:57.370> DaVinci<00:02:57.549> Code<00:02:57.760> I<00:02:58.030> guess<00:02:58.329> so<00:02:58.569> yeah<00:02:58.780> there

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
The DaVinci Code I guess so yeah there

00:02:58.959 --> 00:02:59.970 
The DaVinci Code I guess so yeah there
were<00:02:59.019> some<00:02:59.079> things<00:02:59.319> that<00:02:59.470> were<00:02:59.620> missing<00:02:59.799> I

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
were some things that were missing I

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.160 
were some things that were missing I
said<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:00.639> know<00:03:00.730> I<00:03:00.760> don't<00:03:01.420> know<00:03:01.569> I<00:03:01.599> think<00:03:01.780> this

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
said you know I don't know I think this

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.949 
said you know I don't know I think this
is<00:03:02.319> like<00:03:02.530> tamer<00:03:03.489> my<00:03:03.910> daughter<00:03:04.150> loved<00:03:04.569> the<00:03:04.750> book

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
is like tamer my daughter loved the book

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.309 
is like tamer my daughter loved the book
but<00:03:05.530> I'm<00:03:06.160> afraid<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.669> movie<00:03:06.970> is<00:03:07.239> like<00:03:08.049> the

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
but I'm afraid the movie is like the

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.879 
but I'm afraid the movie is like the
first<00:03:08.560> movie<00:03:08.799> The<00:03:09.220> DaVinci<00:03:09.459> Code<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:09.940> bit<00:03:10.389> of<00:03:10.510> a

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889 
first movie The DaVinci Code a bit of a

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.890 
first movie The DaVinci Code a bit of a
hokey<00:03:11.889> thing<00:03:12.250> which<00:03:12.849> is<00:03:13.090> easy<00:03:13.329> to<00:03:13.569> figure<00:03:13.750> out

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
hokey thing which is easy to figure out

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.080 
hokey thing which is easy to figure out
in<00:03:14.590> a<00:03:14.739> short<00:03:14.889> period<00:03:15.250> of<00:03:15.459> time<00:03:15.519> it's<00:03:15.940> usually

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
in a short period of time it's usually

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.599 
in a short period of time it's usually
books<00:03:16.599> and<00:03:16.840> movies<00:03:17.319> don't<00:03:17.560> go<00:03:17.680> together<00:03:17.859> the

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
books and movies don't go together the

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.319 
books and movies don't go together the
book<00:03:18.940> could<00:03:19.090> be<00:03:19.180> good<00:03:19.389> in<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.720> movie<00:03:19.870> be<00:03:20.290> yeah

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
book could be good in the movie be yeah

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.569 
book could be good in the movie be yeah
the<00:03:22.329> movie<00:03:22.810> did<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.500> book<00:03:23.680> justice<00:03:24.190> I<00:03:24.370> mean

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
the movie did the book justice I mean

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.640 
the movie did the book justice I mean
Ron<00:03:24.819> Howard<00:03:25.239> did<00:03:25.419> his<00:03:25.540> thing<00:03:25.569> it's<00:03:25.989> definitely

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
Ron Howard did his thing it's definitely

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.319 
Ron Howard did his thing it's definitely
better<00:03:26.799> than<00:03:26.919> the<00:03:27.130> DaVinci<00:03:27.639> Code<00:03:27.669> maybe<00:03:28.030> I

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
better than the DaVinci Code maybe I

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.180 
better than the DaVinci Code maybe I
would<00:03:28.540> say<00:03:28.750> first<00:03:29.049> movie<00:03:29.410> drags<00:03:29.680> on<00:03:29.829> a<00:03:29.889> little

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
would say first movie drags on a little

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.190 
would say first movie drags on a little
bit<00:03:30.340> this<00:03:31.030> one<00:03:31.239> doesn't<00:03:31.599> it<00:03:31.660> just<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:32.109> know

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
bit this one doesn't it just you know

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.470 
bit this one doesn't it just you know
action<00:03:32.980> after<00:03:33.220> action<00:03:33.579> scene<00:03:33.819> I<00:03:34.060> hope<00:03:34.299> it

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
action after action scene I hope it

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.970 
action after action scene I hope it
doesn't<00:03:34.690> like<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:35.109> tell<00:03:35.319> you<00:03:35.440> rate<00:03:35.680> as<00:03:35.950> a

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
doesn't like to tell you rate as a

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.890 
doesn't like to tell you rate as a
