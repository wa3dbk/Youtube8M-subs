ok on the right we have my g.skill 1600

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.670 
ok on the right we have my g.skill 1600
which<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.150> going<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.390> be<00:00:27.480> our<00:00:27.599> base<00:00:27.810> mark<00:00:28.109> for

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
which is going to be our base mark for

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.700 
which is going to be our base mark for
every<00:00:28.890> random<00:00:29.099> thing<00:00:29.340> we<00:00:29.429> do<00:00:29.929> 1600<00:00:31.369> 686<00:00:32.369> 24

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
every random thing we do 1600 686 24

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.770 
every random thing we do 1600 686 24
okay<00:00:35.059> so<00:00:36.059> uh<00:00:36.350> first<00:00:37.350> thing<00:00:37.649> we<00:00:37.800> got<00:00:38.100> is

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
okay so uh first thing we got is

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.080 
okay so uh first thing we got is
sandwich<00:00:39.780> oh<00:00:40.140> by<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.829> way<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.730> test<00:00:41.940> system

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
sandwich oh by the way the test system

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.709 
sandwich oh by the way the test system
we<00:00:42.300> used<00:00:42.540> was<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:43.460> BJP<00:00:44.460> 67<00:00:45.289> FTW<00:00:46.700> 2600<00:00:47.700> k<00:00:47.850> at<00:00:48.120> 4.6

air<00:00:57.420> instead<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.379> bench<00:00:58.530> we<00:00:58.829> got<00:00:59.239> 8.79<00:01:01.219> and

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
air instead of bench we got 8.79 and

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.679 
air instead of bench we got 8.79 and
over<00:01:02.430> here<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:03.409> so<00:01:04.409> much<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.830> 1600<00:01:05.549> we<00:01:06.510> got

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
over here on so much of the 1600 we got

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.950 
over here on so much of the 1600 we got
a<00:01:06.930> slightly<00:01:07.710> higher<00:01:07.920> score<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.150> was<00:01:09.270> 1600

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
a slightly higher score like it was 1600

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.850 
a slightly higher score like it was 1600
yes<00:01:10.380> she<00:01:10.799> got<00:01:10.950> point<00:01:11.280> 01<00:01:11.580> but<00:01:12.060> yeah<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.930> lot

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
yes she got point 01 but yeah a lot

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.950 
yes she got point 01 but yeah a lot
lower<00:01:14.070> timings<00:01:14.520> i<00:01:14.640> believe<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.390> dark<00:01:15.600> run

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
lower timings i believe so the dark run

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.080 
lower timings i believe so the dark run
is<00:01:16.320> corsair<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.340> bright<00:01:17.490> round<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.880> g

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
is corsair on the bright round is g

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.350 
is corsair on the bright round is g
scale<00:01:18.299> right<00:01:18.750> okay<00:01:19.200> thank<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.409> yeah<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.610> i

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
scale right okay thank you yeah and i

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.390 
scale right okay thank you yeah and i
think<00:01:21.689> that's<00:01:21.869> all<00:01:22.170> due<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> really<00:01:23.280> low

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
think that's all due to the really low

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.160 
think that's all due to the really low
timings<00:01:23.790> at<00:01:23.909> 686<00:01:24.479> source<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.930> 999<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:26.990> it's<00:01:27.990> not

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
timings at 686 source of 999 so it's not

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.639 
timings at 686 source of 999 so it's not
really<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.560> ram<00:01:29.130> benchmark<00:01:29.939> anyway<00:01:30.680> but<00:01:31.680> uh

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
really a ram benchmark anyway but uh

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.830 
really a ram benchmark anyway but uh
here<00:01:33.649> we<00:01:33.799> have<00:01:33.979> a<00:01:34.369> new<00:01:34.759> bit<00:01:35.060> benchmark

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
here we have a new bit benchmark

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.569 
here we have a new bit benchmark
fountain<00:01:36.320> called<00:01:36.530> well<00:01:36.740> if<00:01:36.799> it<00:01:36.950> knocks<00:01:37.159> men

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
fountain called well if it knocks men

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.539 
fountain called well if it knocks men
squared<00:01:38.890> they<00:01:39.890> thought<00:01:40.070> they're<00:01:40.250> gonna<00:01:40.460> be

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
squared they thought they're gonna be

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.600 
squared they thought they're gonna be
cute<00:01:40.820> for<00:01:41.000> number<00:01:41.210> two<00:01:41.360> um<00:01:42.280> and<00:01:43.280> here's<00:01:43.490> the

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
cute for number two um and here's the

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.529 
cute for number two um and here's the
Corsair<00:01:44.000> and<00:01:44.299> here's<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:46.000> 1600<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:47.119> they

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
Corsair and here's the 1600 and they

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.359 
Corsair and here's the 1600 and they
show<00:01:47.750> you<00:01:47.810> know<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.259> specs<00:01:48.500> right<00:01:48.679> here<00:01:48.890> okay

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
show you know the specs right here okay

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:50.560 
show you know the specs right here okay
so<00:01:49.429> it's<00:01:49.640> that<00:01:49.729> full<00:01:49.909> point<00:01:50.119> five<00:01:50.299> not<00:01:50.539> four

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
so it's that full point five not four

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.870 
so it's that full point five not four
point<00:01:50.899> six<00:01:54.490> basically<00:01:55.490> you're<00:01:55.640> going<00:01:55.759> to<00:01:55.819> be

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
point six basically you're going to be

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.999 
point six basically you're going to be
looking<00:01:55.970> at<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.299> copy<00:01:56.509> speed<00:01:56.840> of<00:01:57.079> 24,000

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
looking at the copy speed of 24,000

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.039 
looking at the copy speed of 24,000
megabytes<00:01:59.200> really<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.439> I'm<00:02:01.119> sewing<00:02:02.119> 21,000

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
megabytes really and I'm sewing 21,000

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.839 
megabytes really and I'm sewing 21,000
over<00:02:03.200> here<00:02:04.720> and<00:02:05.720> 23,000<00:02:06.649> on<00:02:06.709> the<00:02:06.830> read<00:02:06.950> 21,000

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
over here and 23,000 on the read 21,000

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:11.020 
over here and 23,000 on the read 21,000
03<00:02:08.530> 22,000<00:02:09.530> on<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.709> right<00:02:09.860> 21,000<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.849> right

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
03 22,000 on the right 21,000 the right

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.030 
03 22,000 on the right 21,000 the right
and<00:02:12.730> with<00:02:13.730> higher<00:02:13.970> timings<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:15.410> corsair<00:02:15.830> ram

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
and with higher timings the corsair ram

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.280 
and with higher timings the corsair ram
has<00:02:16.280> lower<00:02:16.549> leads<00:02:16.849> so<00:02:17.660> that's<00:02:17.810> what<00:02:18.110> if<00:02:18.200> i

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
has lower leads so that's what if i

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.210 
has lower leads so that's what if i
create<00:02:18.560> and<00:02:19.130> this<00:02:19.670> is<00:02:20.200> 40.7<00:02:21.200> so<00:02:21.769> if<00:02:21.980> you<00:02:22.069> want

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
create and this is 40.7 so if you want

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.559 
create and this is 40.7 so if you want
to<00:02:22.280> look<00:02:22.340> at<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:22.549> real<00:02:22.730> number<00:02:23.090> you<00:02:23.299> got<00:02:23.420> to

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
to look at the real number you got to

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.630 
to look at the real number you got to
look<00:02:23.660> at<00:02:23.810> this<00:02:23.930> reach<00:02:24.170> memory<00:02:24.560> score<00:02:24.860> it's

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
look at this reach memory score it's

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.660 
look at this reach memory score it's
basically<00:02:26.180> like<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.930> scoring<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:27.860> totals

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
basically like and scoring the totals

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.330 
basically like and scoring the totals
them<00:02:28.790> all<00:02:28.910> together<00:02:29.060> so<00:02:29.690> this<00:02:29.840> is<00:02:29.870> 22.5<00:02:30.500> 18<00:02:31.130> 18

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
them all together so this is 22.5 18 18

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.699 
them all together so this is 22.5 18 18
4<00:02:31.670> gigabytes<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.150> second<00:02:32.540> versus<00:02:32.900> 21.2

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
4 gigabytes a second versus 21.2

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.120 
4 gigabytes a second versus 21.2
gigabytes<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.310> second<00:02:35.049> good<00:02:36.049> enough<00:02:36.230> so

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
gigabytes a second good enough so

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.410 
gigabytes a second good enough so
recently<00:02:37.640> faster

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.370 

next<00:02:43.410> we<00:02:43.560> have<00:02:43.680> prime<00:02:44.280> or<00:02:44.640> sugar<00:02:45.120> pie<00:02:45.300> run<00:02:45.660> 232

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
next we have prime or sugar pie run 232

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.270 
next we have prime or sugar pie run 232
m<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:47.900> where<00:02:48.900> we<00:02:48.989> looking<00:02:49.290> right<00:02:49.950> here<00:02:50.099> at<00:02:50.190> the

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
m and where we looking right here at the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.460 
m and where we looking right here at the
very<00:02:50.459> end<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:50.880> can<00:02:51.150> see<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.569> Corsair<00:02:52.080> finish

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
very end you can see the Corsair finish

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.420 
very end you can see the Corsair finish
at<00:02:52.680> seven<00:02:53.010> minutes<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.370> 39<00:02:53.700> seconds<00:02:54.239> when<00:02:55.170> the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
at seven minutes and 39 seconds when the

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.040 
at seven minutes and 39 seconds when the
1600<00:02:56.430> finish<00:02:56.790> at<00:02:56.940> seven<00:02:57.239> minutes<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.630> 45

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
1600 finish at seven minutes and 45

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.150 
1600 finish at seven minutes and 45
seconds<00:02:58.440> so<00:02:59.930> so<00:03:00.930> more<00:03:01.260> than<00:03:01.530> six<00:03:01.800> seconds

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
seconds so so more than six seconds

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.070 
seconds so so more than six seconds
faster<00:03:02.580> that's<00:03:02.850> just<00:03:02.970> pretty<00:03:03.420> significant

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
faster that's just pretty significant

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.199 
faster that's just pretty significant
yeah<00:03:04.530> I<00:03:04.560> mean<00:03:04.830> cuz<00:03:05.370> that's<00:03:05.520> higher<00:03:05.670> megahert

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
yeah I mean cuz that's higher megahert

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.900 
yeah I mean cuz that's higher megahert
paying<00:03:06.959> off<00:03:07.110> right<00:03:07.319> there<00:03:07.560> yeah<00:03:08.310> didn't

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
paying off right there yeah didn't

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.630 
paying off right there yeah didn't
really<00:03:09.150> do<00:03:09.300> much<00:03:09.569> better<00:03:09.900> especially<00:03:10.739> over

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
really do much better especially over

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.910 
really do much better especially over
how<00:03:12.360> big<00:03:12.660> of<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.900> thing<00:03:13.080> how<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.349> do<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:13.650> think

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
how big of a thing how to do you think

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.350 
how big of a thing how to do you think
if<00:03:14.040> it's<00:03:14.220> better<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.640> start<00:03:14.850> pulling<00:03:15.090> away<00:03:15.209> you

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
if it's better to start pulling away you

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.900 
if it's better to start pulling away you
know<00:03:15.690> like<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:15.900> top<00:03:16.110> speed<00:03:16.380> but<00:03:16.800> better<00:03:17.760> is

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
know like a top speed but better is

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.380 
know like a top speed but better is
better<00:03:20.150> so<00:03:21.830> next<00:03:22.830> we<00:03:23.160> did<00:03:23.310> 3dmark<00:03:23.880> just<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.209> see

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
better so next we did 3dmark just to see

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.449 
better so next we did 3dmark just to see
if<00:03:24.720> we<00:03:24.959> can<00:03:25.170> get<00:03:25.290> anything<00:03:25.590> there<00:03:25.739> and<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:26.310> can

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
if we can get anything there and you can

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.780 
if we can get anything there and you can
see<00:03:26.670> we<00:03:26.819> did<00:03:27.030> got<00:03:27.360> moving<00:03:27.660> from<00:03:27.810> 10<00:03:28.049> fit<00:03:28.790> 570

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
see we did got moving from 10 fit 570

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.630 
see we did got moving from 10 fit 570
down<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.330> 10<00:03:30.510> 5<00:03:30.780> 22<00:03:31.200> so<00:03:31.860> we<00:03:31.950> went<00:03:32.069> down<00:03:32.310> yeah

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
down to 10 5 22 so we went down yeah

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.110 
down to 10 5 22 so we went down yeah
let's<00:03:32.910> go<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.440> 1866<00:03:34.440> was<00:03:34.769> faster<00:03:35.370> so<00:03:36.000> if

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
let's go the 1866 was faster so if

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.509 
let's go the 1866 was faster so if
you're<00:03:36.209> a<00:03:36.299> 3d<00:03:36.630> mark<00:03:36.810> junkie<00:03:37.140> gopher<00:03:38.100> megahertz

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
you're a 3d mark junkie gopher megahertz

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.380 
you're a 3d mark junkie gopher megahertz
not<00:03:38.670> timing<00:03:38.910> right<00:03:39.600> and<00:03:40.910> you<00:03:41.910> can<00:03:42.030> look<00:03:42.180> down

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
not timing right and you can look down

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.530 
not timing right and you can look down
here<00:03:42.690> actually<00:03:43.260> more<00:03:44.090> towards<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.180> physics

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
here actually more towards the physics

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.960 
here actually more towards the physics
corker<00:03:45.870> that's<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.140> CPU<00:03:46.560> part<00:03:46.829> and<00:03:47.040> we<00:03:47.820> got

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
corker that's the CPU part and we got

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.380 
corker that's the CPU part and we got
10,000<00:03:48.660> 1761<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:50.400> with<00:03:50.700> this<00:03:51.000> one<00:03:51.180> we<00:03:51.299> got

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
10,000 1761 and with this one we got

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.259 
10,000 1761 and with this one we got
10,000<00:03:52.100> 473<00:03:53.100> so<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.430> couple<00:03:53.670> hundred<00:03:53.910> you're

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
10,000 473 so a couple hundred you're

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.910 
10,000 473 so a couple hundred you're
still<00:03:54.390> in<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:54.540> CPU<00:03:54.900> score<00:03:55.200> looks<00:03:55.799> like

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
still in the CPU score looks like

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.680 
still in the CPU score looks like
nificant<00:03:56.160> yeah<00:03:56.900> so<00:03:57.900> that's<00:03:58.829> that<00:03:59.070> and<00:03:59.400> um<00:03:59.700> we

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
nificant yeah so that's that and um we

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.180 
nificant yeah so that's that and um we
also<00:04:00.840> want<00:04:01.079> to<00:04:01.140> see<00:04:01.260> if<00:04:01.350> we<00:04:01.440> got<00:04:01.560> any<00:04:01.859> gaming

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
also want to see if we got any gaming

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.500 
also want to see if we got any gaming
performance<00:04:02.549> so<00:04:03.329> we<00:04:03.840> have<00:04:04.049> metro<00:04:04.799> done<00:04:05.700> here<00:04:06.030> I

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
performance so we have metro done here I

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.020 
performance so we have metro done here I
think<00:04:07.079> basically<00:04:07.680> maxed<00:04:08.430> out<00:04:08.549> maybe<00:04:08.850> the

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
think basically maxed out maybe the

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.920 
think basically maxed out maybe the
video<00:04:09.470> almost<00:04:10.470> maxed<00:04:10.680> out<00:04:10.950> and<00:04:11.840> you're<00:04:12.840> gonna

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
video almost maxed out and you're gonna

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.349 
video almost maxed out and you're gonna
want<00:04:13.140> to<00:04:13.170> look<00:04:13.290> right<00:04:13.470> here<00:04:13.530> and<00:04:14.160> down<00:04:16.430> see<00:04:17.430> the

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
want to look right here and down see the

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:25.530 
want to look right here and down see the
total<00:04:18.600> frames<00:04:18.959> was<00:04:20.150> 3906<00:04:21.590> versus<00:04:24.229> 4360

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
total frames was 3906 versus 4360

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.790 
total frames was 3906 versus 4360
so<00:04:26.540> why<00:04:27.320> in<00:04:27.380> a<00:04:27.500> bit<00:04:27.620> more<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:28.639> 1600<00:04:29.270> did<00:04:29.389> better

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
so why in a bit more the 1600 did better

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.140 
so why in a bit more the 1600 did better
yes<00:04:30.800> as<00:04:31.160> you<00:04:31.250> can<00:04:31.340> see<00:04:31.520> the<00:04:31.610> average<00:04:31.790> frame

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
yes as you can see the average frame

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.960 
yes as you can see the average frame
here<00:04:32.360> 73<00:04:33.139> and<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:34.100> average<00:04:34.250> frame<00:04:34.610> on<00:04:34.850> the

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
here 73 and the average frame on the

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.360 
here 73 and the average frame on the
course<00:04:35.180> here<00:04:35.330> 65<00:04:35.780> although<00:04:36.530> the<00:04:36.710> Corsair<00:04:37.130> did

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
course here 65 although the Corsair did

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.840 
course here 65 although the Corsair did
have<00:04:37.520> a<00:04:37.610> higher<00:04:37.850> peak<00:04:39.460> average<00:04:40.460> is<00:04:40.610> what<00:04:40.729> you

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
have a higher peak average is what you

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.090 
have a higher peak average is what you
want<00:04:41.030> them<00:04:41.210> and<00:04:41.740> the<00:04:42.740> 1600<00:04:43.400> did<00:04:43.669> get<00:04:43.940> lower

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
want them and the 1600 did get lower

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.270 
want them and the 1600 did get lower
took<00:04:46.100> Pete<00:04:46.400> here<00:04:46.729> but<00:04:47.090> worse<00:04:47.919> we're<00:04:48.919> so<00:04:49.070> long

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
took Pete here but worse we're so long
