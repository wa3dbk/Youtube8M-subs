he scored three goals in eight games

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.020 
he scored three goals in eight games
that<00:03:25.020> is<00:03:25.260> pretty<00:03:25.680> tragic<00:03:26.100> but<00:03:26.640> he's<00:03:26.760> managed

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
that is pretty tragic but he's managed

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.490 
that is pretty tragic but he's managed
to<00:03:27.090> get<00:03:27.180> four<00:03:27.420> assists<00:03:27.720> which<00:03:27.930> i<00:03:27.990> guess<00:03:28.170> sort

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
to get four assists which i guess sort

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.740 
to get four assists which i guess sort
of<00:03:28.740> balances<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.459> out<00:03:29.550> a<00:03:29.610> little<00:03:29.910> bit<00:03:30.060> but

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
of balances it out a little bit but

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.540 
of balances it out a little bit but
overall<00:03:31.140> that<00:03:31.380> it's<00:03:31.560> just<00:03:31.770> not<00:03:31.800> good<00:03:32.370> enough

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
overall that it's just not good enough

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.370 
overall that it's just not good enough
so<00:03:32.850> I<00:03:33.030> was<00:03:33.360> like<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.570> know<00:03:33.690> what<00:03:33.870> there's<00:03:34.230> no
