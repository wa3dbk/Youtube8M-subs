00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
this so we've returned after fast

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.469 
this so we've returned after fast
traveling<00:01:51.100> and<00:01:51.310> taking<00:01:51.579> a<00:01:51.670> catnap<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:52.329> we'll

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
traveling and taking a catnap and we'll

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.419 
traveling and taking a catnap and we'll
notice<00:01:52.719> that<00:01:52.810> our<00:01:52.869> vendor<00:01:53.229> has<00:01:53.320> reappeared<00:01:53.590> so

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
notice that our vendor has reappeared so

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:55.889 
notice that our vendor has reappeared so
we<00:01:54.549> can<00:01:54.670> repeat<00:01:54.969> the<00:01:55.060> process<00:01:55.090> all<00:01:55.630> over<00:01:55.659> again

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
we can repeat the process all over again

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.050 
we can repeat the process all over again
so<00:01:56.200> make<00:01:56.320> sure<00:01:56.439> you<00:01:56.560> save<00:01:56.770> it<00:01:56.950> by<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.579> backpack

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
and then murder out the reason that we

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.169 
and then murder out the reason that we
save<00:01:59.799> it<00:01:59.979> is<00:02:00.130> because<00:02:00.490> I<00:02:00.520> was<00:02:00.729> told<00:02:00.909> this<00:02:01.030> by

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
save it is because I was told this by
