 today we will talk about how to solve a 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:30.769
 problem regarding fast boot 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:32.390
 or waiting for the valls when the 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.180
 your phone is not recognized 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.340
 from fast boot is precisely because the drivers 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.140
 the fas tribute driver were not 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.850
 installed correctly and for this vi 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.690

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.890
 so if you have windows 7 or lower 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.270

 you have windows 8 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:04.339
 it will take one more step because windows 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.890
 8 disability the censored driver signing 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.930
