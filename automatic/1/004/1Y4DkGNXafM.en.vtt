00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:11.340
 This time, the explanation about the exposed portion system 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.900
 After everyone is taken 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:22.599
 I think it's dark 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:22.599
 Do you have the experience of being too bright and the colors are flying away? 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:29.760
 One of the reasons for this is built into the camera 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.090
 Exposure meter can be considered 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.320
 Exposure system is white of the body 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:41.650
 If the entire shooting location is white 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:50.260
 I recognize it as bright without recognizing it as the back 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:54.179
 Therefore, the camera is adjusted 4 to reduce the brightness, and as a result, it is cracked up 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.179
 This is called underexposure 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:04.710
 Also , if the subject is black to the customer or the entire shooting location is dark 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.450
 The exposure meter recognizes that it is dark 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:13.790
 Camera adjusts to shift grip 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:17.080
 Therefore, it becomes too bright or the colors fly 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:21.870
 This is called overexposure 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:27.710
 So how do you shoot in this case 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.710
 At first it is necessary to include the exposure mad woman 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:36.950
 When the shutter release button is pressed halfway 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.950
 You can check the goods level 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.600
 Turn the dial while looking at the display panel 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.990
 The dial operation is performed while the display panel is out 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.110
 Also If you want to cancel the exposure compensation 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:02.340
 Adjust this part in the middle of the correction amount 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:16.030
 Basically, when the picture is overexposed, this amount of 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.030
 -2 adjust 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:25.049
 On the contrary, if under exposure is adjusted to this fraud fee + 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:38.930
 Let's actually shoot 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:42.530
 First of all, it is shooting in the case of overall white without substance correction 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.650
 It looks dark as a whole 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.830
 White part of the gray Lie 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:54.040
 roots are under 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:59.370
 Let's shoot martial arts luck with plus 1.5 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:03.819
 It is used to look like by + correction 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:08.190
 I will try to shoot it with blackness this time 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:11.340
 Here too, I will shoot without Roche attribute at first 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.850
 The picture is bright overall 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:18.290
 Black 7 or black camera becomes gray 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:24.150
 It has become overexposed 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:28.430
 Adjust the exposure compensation to negative if the whole is black 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:31.500
 Let's adjust to 1 point 5 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:38.140
 It became a color close to the appearance 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:45.840
 In the case of overall black, it was possible to make the color closer by performing negative correction 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:49.670
 You can adjust the brightness of the eye as seen if the sustainability that this way 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.400
 Most digital cameras have material correction 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.230
 From -2 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.230
 There are stages to + 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:06.400
 But with Roche there is no such thing as a wrong number 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:12.150
 While checking the brightness of the world and the surroundings 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.150
 You may find yourself looking for the right numbers
