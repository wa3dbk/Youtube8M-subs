00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.100
 before starting the segment I want to give 

00:00:02.549 --> 00:00:08.429
 thanks to the production I want to give 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.620
 thanks to my parents for my children 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.839
 my great friends who are always with me 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.580
 supporting all the projects that I 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:18.970
 I do and also my sweetheart 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:22.390
 now what we are going to work is box 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.390
 a box to store toys so that 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.270
 the children are not messy here what 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.480
 what we did was like a landscape 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:35.200
 with some birdhouses if you see 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.290
 here we also have a box 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.180
 which is to keep things that is 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.300
 similar to what we are going to 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.000
 work here with a partner look 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:50.280
 how beautiful the jobs get 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.120
 jobs that they do here in the workshop 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.670
 here we advance we made dimos 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.500
 a water-based sealer forgiveness 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.680
 let it dry 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.120
 let's choose a background I made a gradient 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.309
 the grade we have always done 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.500
 right now the important thing of this segment 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.240
 is that we are going to lower the houses aviaries 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.750
 how lights and lights are achieved 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.460
 shadows point brush blur here 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.920
 we gave a lilac color and a 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.530
 turquoise if you see even though 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.570
 they put many colors and they are here in 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.570
 the sides there is none that 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.119
 distort always try to be based on 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.369
 the chromatic circle is stationery 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.369
 you can learn to manage and 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.040
 make spectacular combinations now 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.740
 what we are going to do is this 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.680
 photo that we already have here with a brush 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.590
 What I'm going to take is to give the 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.530
 Main light in our low house of 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.830
 she always assumed that the center is 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.670
 the most of the bad that more light has 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.140
 now I put the color care and background that 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.310
 it's on the sides 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.460
 and on the edge I'm going to give a color 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.479
 Look, it's not from the range but 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.479
 same as the spectacular
