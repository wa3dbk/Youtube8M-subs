00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
some you know basic bending that you may

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.999 
some you know basic bending that you may
apply<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.009> phones<00:01:44.579> for<00:01:44.970> whatever<00:01:45.780> reason<00:01:46.290> but

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
again basic bending that we would be

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.080 
again basic bending that we would be
able<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.049> do<00:01:49.229> ourselves<00:01:49.470> pretty<00:01:50.220> easily<00:01:50.549> and

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
able to do ourselves pretty easily and

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.870 
able to do ourselves pretty easily and
that<00:01:51.119> may<00:01:51.750> be<00:01:51.810> able<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.229> get<00:01:53.040> replicated<00:01:53.340> in

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880

completely<00:02:04.649> bent<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:06.210> seems<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.540> be<00:02:06.719> again

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
completely bent and it seems to be again

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.639 
completely bent and it seems to be again
with<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> power<00:02:07.680> button

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
with a power button

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.319 
with a power button
is<00:02:08.709> it<00:02:09.189> doesn't<00:02:09.700> seem<00:02:09.819> to<00:02:09.909> be<00:02:10.030> in<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.179> middle

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:10.329 
is it doesn't seem to be in the middle

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:11.640 
is it doesn't seem to be in the middle
of<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.539> phone<00:02:10.869> so<00:02:11.110> it<00:02:11.170> looks<00:02:11.349> like<00:02:11.409> there's

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
of the phone so it looks like there's

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.149 
of the phone so it looks like there's
just<00:02:11.739> a<00:02:12.040> weak<00:02:12.280> spot<00:02:12.489> with<00:02:12.970> that<00:02:13.269> so<00:02:13.599> again<00:02:14.260> that

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:15.159 
just a weak spot with that so again that

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:16.679 
just a weak spot with that so again that
may<00:02:15.310> be<00:02:15.370> something<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.849> think<00:02:16.030> about<00:02:16.180> if<00:02:16.540> you

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:16.689

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.199 
may be something to think about if you
are<00:02:16.840> thinking<00:02:17.110> about<00:02:17.500> getting<00:02:17.829> the<00:02:18.310> iphone<00:02:18.790> 6

lot better the first time we did it he

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.890 
lot better the first time we did it he
didn't<00:02:38.890> notice<00:02:39.040> any<00:02:39.430> change<00:02:39.879> and<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.510> second

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
time I did it doing it as hard as he

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.699 
time I did it doing it as hard as he
could<00:02:42.879> he<00:02:42.940> only<00:02:43.359> noticed<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:43.959> little<00:02:44.409> bit<00:02:44.590> of

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
could he only noticed a little bit of

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.920 
could he only noticed a little bit of
warping<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:45.430> that's<00:02:46.180> something<00:02:46.510> that<00:02:46.659> may

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
warping and that's something that may

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.020 
warping and that's something that may
end<00:02:47.109> up<00:02:47.260> just<00:02:47.560> shaping<00:02:47.950> back<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.519> normal<00:02:48.909> with

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
end up just shaping back to normal with

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.180 
end up just shaping back to normal with
the<00:02:49.150> next<00:02:49.450> couple<00:02:49.659> of<00:02:49.840> hours<00:02:49.989> or<00:02:50.379> something<00:02:50.739> so

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
the next couple of hours or something so

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.640 
the next couple of hours or something so
by<00:02:51.400> now<00:02:51.639> his<00:02:51.970> galaxy<00:02:52.540> note<00:02:52.690> 3<00:02:52.900> could<00:02:53.500> be

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
by now his galaxy note 3 could be

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.640 
by now his galaxy note 3 could be
perfectly<00:02:54.129> fine<00:02:54.519> so<00:02:55.120> again<00:02:55.420> that<00:02:56.230> may<00:02:56.379> be<00:02:56.439> the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
perfectly fine so again that may be the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.710 
perfectly fine so again that may be the
one<00:02:56.829> bad<00:02:57.069> thing<00:02:57.099> about<00:02:57.310> metal<00:02:57.909> phones<00:02:58.209> all

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720

one bad thing about metal phones all
metal<00:02:59.049> phones<00:02:59.290> anyway<00:02:59.620> is<00:03:00.040> that<00:03:00.069> again<00:03:01.260> you

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
are going to be at risk at finding them

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.970 
are going to be at risk at finding them

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
now the iphone 6 plus size may have

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.649 
now the iphone 6 plus size may have
something<00:03:06.250> to<00:03:06.400> do<00:03:06.579> with<00:03:06.730> it<00:03:06.760> because<00:03:07.090> even

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
something to do with it because even

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.179 
something to do with it because even
though<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:08.079> note<00:03:08.230> 3<00:03:08.590> has<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.769> bigger<00:03:09.069> screen

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:09.189 
though the note 3 has a bigger screen

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.729 
though the note 3 has a bigger screen
the<00:03:10.090> iphone<00:03:10.420> 6<00:03:10.689> is<00:03:10.810> actually<00:03:11.109> just<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.349> little

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
the iphone 6 is actually just a little

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.309 
the iphone 6 is actually just a little
bit<00:03:11.920> bigger<00:03:12.400> than<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.180> note<00:03:13.419> 3<00:03:13.750> in<00:03:13.900> terms<00:03:14.169> of

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
bit bigger than the note 3 in terms of

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.520 
bit bigger than the note 3 in terms of
height<00:03:14.650> at<00:03:14.980> least<00:03:15.310> so<00:03:15.639> again<00:03:16.480> take<00:03:17.139> that<00:03:17.349> for

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
height at least so again take that for

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.020 
height at least so again take that for
what<00:03:17.560> it<00:03:17.799> is<00:03:17.949> that<00:03:18.340> may<00:03:18.519> be<00:03:18.579> something<00:03:18.910> you

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030
