00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.410 
I like it if it's got a mode where when
you<00:01:46.979> turn<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.340> car<00:01:47.490> on<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.850> starts<00:01:48.149> recording

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
you turn the car on it starts recording

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.420 
you turn the car on it starts recording
as<00:01:48.840> long<00:01:49.049> as<00:01:49.200> there's<00:01:49.350> power<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.310> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
as long as there's power to the to the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.310 
as long as there's power to the to the
USB<00:01:50.820> cable<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.720> don't<00:01:51.869> even<00:01:52.110> have<00:01:52.200> to

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
USB cable and you don't even have to

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.660 
USB cable and you don't even have to
think<00:01:52.439> about<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.829> alright<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.310> we<00:01:53.399> saw<00:01:53.610> the

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
think about it alright and we saw the

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.550 
think about it alright and we saw the
difference<00:01:54.119> between<00:01:54.390> day<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.659> night<00:01:54.869> not<00:01:55.320> bad

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
difference between day and night not bad

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.050 
difference between day and night not bad
on<00:01:55.920> there<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.430> have<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.670> street<00:01:56.909> light

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
on there you have the street light

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.880 
on there you have the street light
exactly<00:01:57.659> still<00:01:57.869> get<00:01:57.990> good<00:01:58.110> video<00:01:58.259> exactly

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
exactly still get good video exactly

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.530 
exactly still get good video exactly
you're<00:01:59.189> not<00:01:59.310> shooting<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.939> next<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.420> know

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
you're not shooting the next you know

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.160 
you're not shooting the next you know
epic<00:02:01.439> movie<00:02:01.770> with<00:02:01.890> the

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
epic movie with the

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.960 
epic movie with the
but<00:02:02.530> you<00:02:02.710> know<00:02:02.830> to<00:02:03.310> keep<00:02:03.520> track<00:02:03.700> of<00:02:03.729> what's

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
but you know to keep track of what's

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.039 
but you know to keep track of what's
happening<00:02:04.030> in<00:02:04.330> your<00:02:04.450> car<00:02:04.630> I<00:02:04.780> think<00:02:04.869> it's

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
happening in your car I think it's

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.210 
happening in your car I think it's
pretty<00:02:05.170> slick<00:02:05.470> let's<00:02:05.710> talk<00:02:05.830> about<00:02:05.920> one<00:02:06.100> of<00:02:06.130> the

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
pretty slick let's talk about one of the

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.469 
pretty slick let's talk about one of the
graphics<00:02:06.549> I<00:02:06.640> just<00:02:06.850> saw<00:02:06.939> on<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.060> bottom<00:02:07.150> screen

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
graphics I just saw on the bottom screen

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:08.940 
graphics I just saw on the bottom screen
that<00:02:07.750> it<00:02:07.869> knows<00:02:08.080> when<00:02:08.410> you're<00:02:08.530> in<00:02:08.619> a<00:02:08.649> crash

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
that it knows when you're in a crash

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.919 
that it knows when you're in a crash
exactly<00:02:09.640> there's<00:02:09.880> put<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.390> video<00:02:10.660> and

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
exactly there's put the video and

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.410 
exactly there's put the video and
there's<00:02:11.319> this<00:02:11.470> there's<00:02:11.800> a<00:02:11.920> gyro<00:02:12.459> inside<00:02:13.060> and

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
there's this there's a gyro inside and

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.390 
there's this there's a gyro inside and
it<00:02:13.510> knows<00:02:13.750> if<00:02:14.170> you've<00:02:14.470> been<00:02:14.860> hit<00:02:15.040> in<00:02:15.099> the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
it knows if you've been hit in the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.309 
it knows if you've been hit in the
g-forces<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.239> it<00:02:16.360> will<00:02:16.480> automatically<00:02:17.050> save

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
g-forces and it will automatically save

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.750 
g-forces and it will automatically save
that<00:02:17.500> video<00:02:17.770> for<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.099> and<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.280> little<00:02:18.370> director

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
of a dog I think so there you go you at

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.820 
of a dog I think so there you go you at
Fry's<00:02:58.450> comm<00:02:58.840> is<00:02:58.989> where<00:02:59.140> you<00:02:59.230> can<00:02:59.380> get<00:02:59.440> rights<00:02:59.709> I

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
Fry's comm is where you can get rights I

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.860 
Fry's comm is where you can get rights I
caught<00:03:00.010> yet<00:03:00.250> Swann<00:03:00.760> doesn't<00:03:01.090> sell<00:03:01.299> directly

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
caught yet Swann doesn't sell directly

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.410 
caught yet Swann doesn't sell directly
so<00:03:02.200> when<00:03:02.650> you<00:03:02.739> go<00:03:02.860> there<00:03:03.010> they<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:04.090> know<00:03:04.209> shoot
