00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.210 
apricot sort of color and even though on
there<00:02:05.600> it's<00:02:06.600> actually<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:07.409> color<00:02:07.740> pretty

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
there it's actually that color pretty

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.550 
there it's actually that color pretty
much<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.789> that's<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.660> little<00:02:09.810> bit<00:02:09.959> strange<00:02:10.200> but

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
much so that's a little bit strange but

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.480 
much so that's a little bit strange but
we'll<00:02:11.039> see<00:02:11.250> okay<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:11.580> I'm<00:02:11.730> going<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:11.940> put<00:02:12.060> this

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
we'll see okay so I'm going to put this

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.400 
we'll see okay so I'm going to put this
right<00:02:13.490> now<00:02:13.670> just<00:02:14.540> on<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.900> ends<00:02:15.170> of<00:02:15.260> my<00:02:15.320> hair

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
right now just on the ends of my hair

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.800 
right now just on the ends of my hair
and<00:02:15.820> yeah<00:02:16.820> we'll<00:02:17.030> see<00:02:17.180> what<00:02:17.270> happens

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.210 

okay<00:02:20.810> so<00:02:20.870> I've<00:02:21.020> got<00:02:21.170> my<00:02:21.320> trusty<00:02:21.380> hair<00:02:22.010> dye

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
okay so I've got my trusty hair dye

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.770 
okay so I've got my trusty hair dye
t-shirt<00:02:22.910> on<00:02:23.030> I'm<00:02:23.270> gonna<00:02:23.390> take<00:02:23.540> this<00:02:23.660> off

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
t-shirt on I'm gonna take this off

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.700 
t-shirt on I'm gonna take this off
actually<00:02:24.230> roll<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:26.840> think<00:02:27.170> I<00:02:27.320> shall<00:02:27.560> just

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
actually roll and I think I shall just

00:02:27.710 --> 00:03:15.290 
actually roll and I think I shall just
clip<00:02:28.010> my<00:02:28.280> hair<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:29.120> then<00:02:29.510> get<00:02:30.110> going

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.730 

oh<00:03:17.300> it's<00:03:18.300> getting<00:03:18.630> slightly<00:03:18.870> lighter<00:03:19.290> I

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
oh it's getting slightly lighter I

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.230 
oh it's getting slightly lighter I
thought<00:03:20.220> we<00:03:20.340> might<00:03:20.490> go<00:03:20.760> a<00:03:20.790> little<00:03:20.940> bit<00:03:21.120> lighter

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
thought we might go a little bit lighter

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.610 
thought we might go a little bit lighter
more<00:03:21.840> like<00:03:21.990> a<00:03:22.020> blonde

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
more like a blonde

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.770 
more like a blonde
gingery<00:03:22.980> blonde<00:03:23.280> but<00:03:23.670> it's<00:03:24.030> probably<00:03:24.600> all<00:03:24.750> the

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
gingery blonde but it's probably all the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.590 
gingery blonde but it's probably all the
dyes<00:03:25.140> that<00:03:26.010> built<00:03:26.370> up<00:03:26.550> that<00:03:27.180> I've<00:03:27.270> been<00:03:27.420> using

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
dyes that built up that I've been using

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.540 
dyes that built up that I've been using
over<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.960> past<00:03:28.140> couple<00:03:28.290> of<00:03:28.440> months<00:03:28.500> I<00:03:28.950> think

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
over the past couple of months I think

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.250 
over the past couple of months I think
it'll<00:03:29.790> go<00:03:29.940> just<00:03:30.000> a<00:03:30.240> little<00:03:30.270> bit<00:03:30.540> lighter<00:03:30.930> and

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
it'll go just a little bit lighter and

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.560 
it'll go just a little bit lighter and
then<00:03:31.500> I<00:03:31.620> wash<00:03:31.800> it<00:03:31.830> off<00:03:32.100> okay<00:03:33.000> I<00:03:33.030> think<00:03:33.150> this<00:03:33.420> is

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
then I wash it off okay I think this is

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.150 
then I wash it off okay I think this is
probably<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:34.140> lightest<00:03:34.590> it's<00:03:34.740> going<00:03:34.920> to<00:03:34.980> get

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
probably the lightest it's going to get

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.950 
probably the lightest it's going to get
and<00:03:35.490> it's<00:03:36.000> probably<00:03:36.270> going<00:03:36.570> to<00:03:36.630> look<00:03:36.690> lighter

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
and it's probably going to look lighter

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.540 
and it's probably going to look lighter
once<00:03:37.410> I've<00:03:37.800> washed<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.160> because<00:03:38.400> obviously

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
once I've washed it because obviously

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.010 
once I've washed it because obviously
your<00:03:38.880> hair<00:03:39.000> always<00:03:39.180> looks<00:03:39.270> darker<00:03:39.780> when<00:03:39.900> it's

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
your hair always looks darker when it's

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.380 
your hair always looks darker when it's
got<00:03:40.170> Diane<00:03:40.440> anyways<00:03:40.860> oh<00:03:41.220> I'm<00:03:41.850> gonna<00:03:42.060> go<00:03:42.270> and

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.670 
got Diane anyways oh I'm gonna go and

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
but yeah not much care by yesterday so

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.320 
but yeah not much care by yesterday so
that's<00:05:10.630> kind<00:05:10.870> of<00:05:11.370> interested<00:05:12.370> but<00:05:12.790> I<00:05:12.850> really

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
that's kind of interested but I really

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.640 
that's kind of interested but I really
really<00:05:13.540> like<00:05:13.690> the<00:05:13.840> color<00:05:14.050> I<00:05:14.200> think<00:05:14.380> it's<00:05:14.500> gonna

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
really like the color I think it's gonna

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.790 
really like the color I think it's gonna
fade<00:05:14.890> really<00:05:15.220> nice<00:05:15.370> as<00:05:15.580> well<00:05:15.729> and<00:05:16.590> once<00:05:17.590> it

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
fade really nice as well and once it

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.140
