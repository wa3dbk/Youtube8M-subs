00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.670 
obviously he gained a lot more than
Daniel<00:03:44.750> Bryan<00:03:44.990> did<00:03:45.170> if<00:03:45.260> anything<00:03:45.590> it

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
Daniel Bryan did if anything it

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.990

downgraded Daniel Bryan a little bit

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.130 
downgraded Daniel Bryan a little bit
because<00:03:47.180> he<00:03:47.330> was<00:03:47.420> the<00:03:47.510> world<00:03:47.660> champion<00:03:47.750> before

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140
