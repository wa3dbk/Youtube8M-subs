00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
Jake is saying and quite rightly so is

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.840 
Jake is saying and quite rightly so is
that<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.960> use<00:01:10.080> your<00:01:10.260> left<00:01:10.439> hand<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:11.010> part<00:01:11.400> and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
that you use your left hand to part and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.359 
that you use your left hand to part and
you<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.479> won't<00:01:12.630> get<00:01:12.840> out<00:01:12.960> here<00:01:13.260> well<00:01:14.189> it's

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
you just won't get out here well it's

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.940 
you just won't get out here well it's
not<00:01:14.549> as<00:01:14.700> easy<00:01:14.939> as<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.630> as<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.990> sounds<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:16.890> you

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
not as easy as it as it sounds so you

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.719 
not as easy as it as it sounds so you
need<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.610> practice<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.180> but<00:01:18.890> just<00:01:19.890> be<00:01:20.040> just

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
need to practice it but just be just

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.609 
need to practice it but just be just
making<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.119> point<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.810> actually<00:01:22.110> took

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
making the point that I actually took

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.870 
making the point that I actually took
this<00:01:22.799> Apple<00:01:23.250> off<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.259> safe<00:01:25.259> way<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.790> was

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
this Apple off the safe way and it was

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.450 
this Apple off the safe way and it was
bloody<00:01:27.360> hard<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:28.170> don't<00:01:28.590> mind<00:01:28.770> saying<00:01:29.009> because

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
bloody hard I don't mind saying because

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.080 
bloody hard I don't mind saying because
I'm<00:01:30.270> right-handed<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:32.430> tool<00:01:32.640> always<00:01:32.939> goes

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
I'm right-handed so the tool always goes

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.550 
I'm right-handed so the tool always goes
in<00:01:33.270> your<00:01:33.390> right<00:01:33.540> hand<00:01:33.570> there<00:01:34.320> are<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> lot<00:01:34.530> of

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
in your right hand there are a lot of

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.600 
in your right hand there are a lot of
tuners<00:01:34.979> out<00:01:35.100> there<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.520> they're

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
tuners out there that they're

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.210 
tuners out there that they're
ambidextrous<00:01:36.270> they<00:01:36.390> can<00:01:36.540> use<00:01:36.659> either<00:01:37.049> hand<00:01:37.439> to

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
ambidextrous they can use either hand to

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.999 
ambidextrous they can use either hand to
do<00:01:38.340> their<00:01:38.520> roughing<00:01:38.790> out<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.500> doing<00:01:40.500> doing

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
do their roughing out and doing doing

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.499 
do their roughing out and doing doing
beads<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.490> everything<00:01:41.759> else<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.210> really

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
beads and everything else and I really

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.700 
beads and everything else and I really
admire<00:01:42.750> them<00:01:42.990> for<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.320> think<00:01:43.530> it's

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
admire them for that I think it's

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.620 
admire them for that I think it's
brilliant<00:01:43.890> but<00:01:44.130> I've<00:01:44.430> tried<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.909> like<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.299> can't

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
brilliant but I've tried it like I can't

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.469 
brilliant but I've tried it like I can't
do<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.930> can't<00:01:46.439> do<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.399> anyway<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:48.149> was<00:01:48.299> just

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
do it can't do it so anyway it was just

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.200 
do it can't do it so anyway it was just
a<00:01:48.540> point<00:01:48.860> and<00:01:49.860> I'm<00:01:50.130> not<00:01:50.280> trying<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.579> upstage
