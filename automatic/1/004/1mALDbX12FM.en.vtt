00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 we'll go with the policy commentary 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.410
 with bob fernandes 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.620
 politics is theater 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.980
 the citizen the people against the scene from time to time. 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.949
 when he rarely becomes a lead actor 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.039
 so the fierce competition for the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.980
 hegemony of the narrative the word that 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.680
 free or imprison ideas is 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.410
 primordial conductor of narrative 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.529
 in Brazil, more and more in politics 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.710
 narratives seek to castrate 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.070
 new ideas solutions and ways 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.190
 many say PT or derivatives like 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.739
 who vomits and in the quest to intimidate those who 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.039
 be intimidating as many people say 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.890
 tucano as if it were issuing album 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.960
 and with the intention of framing this 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.930
 dispute over the feared narrative 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.199
 imprison and shrink words to 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.410
 imagination the austerity ideas by 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.409
 example is expression in vogue here and world 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.970
 throughout the world means 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.920
 not only but also 100 million 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.950
 unemployed since the crisis of 2008 in 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.520
 an account of 15 trillion dollars 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.439
 for that reason without knowing in what goes of the 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.530
 party rise if flat in greece and 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.250
 maybe we can in spain 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.670
 if smooth and we can are tale shoots 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.070
 of the crisis with austerity in the 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.189
 brazil in the fierce contest for hegemony 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.579
 of the narrative the corruption of decades of 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.530
 centuries is protected by euphemisms like 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.380
 for example poster 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.340
 already those who are new in the attack the booty the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.850
 safe box 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.280
 What's the use of that gang or gang? 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.340
 by the hegemony of narrative 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.369
 gives each word every case 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.710
 lack of water 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.860
 example is thing for the northeast and 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.380
 Northeast in sao paulo in the southeast 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.140
 that even in the face of the threat of

 a social tragedy is a water crisis and 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.580
 when in the northeast it is said that the

 is the weapon of colonels wanted 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.190
 out the delay in sÃ£o paulo in the southeast 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.340
 It was Pedro who did not help his friend. 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.500
 friend even more in times of crisis to 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.990
 attention to the narrative 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.770
 check whether institutions or port 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.590
 voices screaming and pointing fingers 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:35.250
