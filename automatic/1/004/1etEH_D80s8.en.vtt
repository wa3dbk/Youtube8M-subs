00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
pre-sequel just came out and I was

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.950 
pre-sequel just came out and I was
benchmarking<00:00:08.429> it<00:00:08.580> these<00:00:09.090> are<00:00:09.240> two<00:00:09.420> AMD<00:00:09.809> cards

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960

let's<00:00:10.260> get<00:00:10.410> rid<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.590> one<00:00:10.830> of<00:00:10.950> those<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.370> make

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
let's get rid of one of those and make

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.680 
let's get rid of one of those and make
it<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.059> bit<00:00:12.179> more<00:00:12.210> even<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:13.370> I've<00:00:14.370> got<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:15.089> lot<00:00:15.450> of

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
it a bit more even so I've got a lot of

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.950 
it a bit more even so I've got a lot of
video<00:00:16.139> cards<00:00:16.710> behind<00:00:17.070> me<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.609> lot<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.480> them<00:00:18.690> let

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
video cards behind me a lot of them let

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.740 
video cards behind me a lot of them let
me<00:00:19.080> just<00:00:19.260> emphasize<00:00:19.970> there<00:00:20.970> are<00:00:21.240> more<00:00:21.539> video

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
me just emphasize there are more video

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.109 
me just emphasize there are more video
cards<00:00:22.109> than<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.320> can<00:00:22.470> presently<00:00:22.890> count<00:00:23.220> bit

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
cards than I can presently count bit

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.880

early<00:00:24.420> but<00:00:24.660> that's<00:00:24.960> part<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.380> so<00:00:25.560> we've<00:00:25.710> got

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
early but that's part of it so we've got

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.529 
early but that's part of it so we've got
a<00:00:26.269> 980<00:00:27.269> extreme<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.990> 270x<00:00:28.769> right<00:00:29.010> now<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.539> a

Borderlands<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.380> optimized<00:01:58.860> specifically

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
Borderlands it is optimized specifically
