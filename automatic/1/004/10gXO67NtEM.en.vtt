00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.410
 22 years young Australian Deputy Roman Weidenfeller in the bvb-tor and 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:11.140
 today of about 69 000 spectators who today should be critical or not 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.040
 turn out to be more goose bumps than a cause 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.300
 bundesliga debut away at Bayern Munich 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:23.789
 first exams for men Red after two minutes of Actelion dry bread the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.300
 Australians with their fists on it 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.919
 before this data security assured the team of Louis van 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.540
 Gaal at the beginning was missing the pop star of Schweinsteiger threatens Friday clearly leads 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.899
 not attacked hurt Varela 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:39.670
 Bodner had 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.180
 first goal of the season and because of in the game the 1 4 0 lead for the BVB 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.080
 Barrios but the adequate of pop was the mistake in African 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.770
 also in front of Switzerland more data 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.320
 Bayern too passively only spectators at the pass of big Kreutz and also at 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.390
 graduation 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.900
 Barrios and BVB set accordingly two minutes after the leadership Pellengahr 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.030
 Sven Bender was just like there duel champion against champions contender 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.050
 unequal in favor 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.730
 Borussia Bayer puts vulnerable but forward dangerously smooth with 5 2 down and that 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.380
 is the compensation 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.180
 completely uncovered Luiz Gustavo with his first goal for Bayern 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.939
 the longer way beaten for the first time 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.939
 the error but here goes on the assignment in the bvb defense 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.720
 just two minutes after the balance logical a parking lot will be back 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.310
 not intervened 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.220
 so learned to build there 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.310
 logically enter Mad Village 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.540
 and also the doctors may at 2 4 0 in the first leg 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.359
 the question how is the Bayern the new backlog way 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:45.650
 the answer 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.280
 In the meantime, there was a wrongly canceled gate Mistura the bridge 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.780
 give it like this time not in the offside played MÃ¼ller and the with 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.530
 the big chance to compensate Madness defense by Lukasz Piszczek 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.670
 also incredible for Werder 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.730
 it went back and forth as in tennis is again the BVB free kick rise again 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.010
 burns the bayern-defense but before 11 and data he was embarrassing on many 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.030
 Counts beat Badstuber and Timoshchuk were missing in the Bayern 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.889
 completely overwhelmed outen parties 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:23.979
 Weilrod Dortmund better longer way says since balance a goal cashed thereby asked 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:25.929
 but he is powerless 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:30.559
 second half Dortmund continued better by Steve Walker 22 point seven 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:34.559
 Children gave the BVB in the Bundesliga ran especially much worse 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:40.199
 after one hour was previously the last in the range 4 1 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:44.789
 the right Schweinsteiger was the turn but it was not his 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:45.419
 Day 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:48.939
 and Hummels the ex-Munich does his old club right 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:54.189
 and it could have been worse for Bayern six minutes before 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:57.509
 At the end, Khoi beats her head in the Levante house 

00:02:57.509 --> 00:03:01.499
 that does not look good but it loses painfully on the line 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:04.639
 Even without fourth goal a low blow for Bayern in the top game 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.109
 It was a dominant performance of BVB Dortmund wins for the first time since 1990 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:15.200
 Munich and cemented with the three to one the table top the railing 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.780
 Active militia thus hardly detention and for the Bayern find the weeks of the 

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:22.590
 Truth at least in terms of last hope for the championship here 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.329
 End 16 points behind for the master are doing a pure
