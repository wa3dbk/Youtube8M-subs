00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:00.550
 nothing we propose to beat the record of 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:03.909
 round the world solo without stops 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:07.270
 in the smallest ship that route is 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.220
 considered the everest of the sail less 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.500
 of 100 people in the world browse in 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.690
 lonely the balloon without stopping and those 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.030
 great sailors did it on boats 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.210
 of considerable size but there was a 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.369
 person who defying the limits 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.920

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.710
 incredible feat on a ship barely 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.580
 six meters into account the only man in 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:33.159
 the world so far beat this record 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.380
 strawberry is something ambitious historical 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.170
 of the dessert that challenge a woman 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.700
 making the trip much more interesting 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.399
 and attractive 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.229
 I think the most obvious foundation 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.750
 important in my project beyond 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.360
 personal desire to fulfill a dream of 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.549
 self - improvement is to be able to serve 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.759
 example to show that any 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.830
 dream is possible and to be able to share it with 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.980
 willpower combined with the 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.440
 capacity and planning the impossible 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.960
 it has to be this is the spirit of 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.590
 project passes that my spirit my 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.590
 dreams 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.390
 the ship with the glory of just five 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:18.909
 meters 97 the rails are like this is called 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.700
 our beloved ship was designed 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:23.950
 especially for this adventure then 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.590
 of an intense search of who would be 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.590
 the designer of the ship did not stay 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.750
 no doubt that Nestor Walker was the 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.909
 indicated person he is one of the 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.730
 best Argentine naval engineers 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:38.829
 and his name is recognized in the world 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.859
 It is worth noting that in addition to a large 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:43.870
 engineer is an excellent navigator that 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.930
 It makes a big difference at the moment 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.359
 to choose the drawing of a ship step 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.879
 out is inaudible your drawing is 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:53.849
 designed to support and return as 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:56.349
 possible fast one turn bell 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.569
 has a maneuver that adapts to the 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.299
 areas of equatorial calm and 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:04.180
 aggressive south winds will be a boat 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:07.329

 in less than six meters 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.180
 beyond my technical capabilities of my 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.310
 experience in navigation I think what 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.040
