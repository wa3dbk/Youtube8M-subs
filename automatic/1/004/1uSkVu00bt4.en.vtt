 has a pro evolution super demos 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.200
 cool to actually play a game a lot 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.200
 interesting for those who like the series 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.180
 We have many new details such as one 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.340
 Super fun event, let's go 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.140
 chat right there with mauro 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.300
 betting to know how it was the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.829
 work in the production of the game 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.230
 we talked to the people who talked about 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.770
 metal gear is really cool and I hope 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.770
 that you like 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.360
 we are here now with mauro beth a 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.820
 of the voices of the game that will tell 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.409
 how the production process was 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.180
 well I just want to say that you were 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.440
 dancing with the music here in the arena 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.240
 Corinthians when he began recording it 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.979
 You stop dancing so you see everything. 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.140
 it's a lie but let's talk a deal is 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.110
 kind of fake such a script that comes from 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.149
 japanese will translate the translated japanese 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.470
 in English and loose double shoots for the 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.659
 countries come to sÃ£o paulo translated 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.250
 to the Portuguese falls into the hand of the genius who 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.830
 the circle is in the hand of head catfish 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.630
 It's me and we'll boot to break. 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.940
 not to mention something else in the game and 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.950
 sensational guy because he works in 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.750
 radio tv internet newspaper a lot of 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.850
 thing 25 years as a sports journalist 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.619
 and for six years recording feet 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.450
 I never imagined having the privilege of being able to 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.190
 record a video game comment the game that 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.080
 You do not see this is a result as 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.940
 Sensational new in my work a lot 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.250
 by the work of symbolism but by what 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.250
 konami makes confession of gameplay to 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.080
 reality the fantastic detroit realism 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.479
 it's a business that has no say 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.759
 I never imagined being part of a game 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.430
 much less six years and if god willing 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.019
 also going to the 2017 foot because it is not 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.030
 the first time you do it more 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.010
 contains a little detail 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.799
 difference working in a game brings 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.870
 other areas, it is fundamental to 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.540
 people are forced to watch the game and I do not see 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.400
 comments without seeing does not see or see 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.290
 the weight is sensational that comments on the 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.090
 game you did not see and sometimes you are 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.890
 stone throwing your house between a 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.609
 comment my recorded in 2010 ewerthon 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.840
 of 2012 in 2013 and 3 2016 central government 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.280
 2019 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.840
 that is to say, there are several situations 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.850
 people have already recorded that they are 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.799
 game and various new situations 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.260
 the degree of specificity the degree of 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.299
 reality realism of each recording is 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.459
 a great deal the script gives us 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.930
 that conama gives us and that is the 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.880
 Fantastic result you need to keep 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.930
 let alone the standard you had there and 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.570
 2010 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.120
 adding new ideas and not making a 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.859
 slang that lasts seven minutes you need 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.200
 It's kind of focused and focused on me. 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.519
 I'm almost 49 years silvio luiz 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.310
 which is seven thousand nine hundred and twenty 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.890
 six decades of life, we are one 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.959
 work pleasurable exercise to Issimo 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.990
 people try to be focused on the world 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.990
 Mega Portuguese that is the videogame 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.990
 campbell 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.010
 and tell us about this new 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.320
 ps was complicated production is mode of 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.000
 talk had enough things there that she 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.860
 It's very happy, I have it here in the arena. 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.810
 corinthians very pleased 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.510
 Corinthians staff received a lot 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.820
 well and partnered with mauro beth civil luiz 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.340
 continue and for the way forever, right? 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.720
 we like them and let's see if he 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.940
 continue to him with him forever not 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.980
 I know how he said the mauro bete I do not know 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.230
 Until when are we going to hang out, huh? 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.090
 but we can handle it what the player 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.370
 can wait until the time comes. 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.810
 buy the one issue of the term in the 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.350
 ground beyond the best Brazilian player 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.990
 on the cover 20 times in the series a 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.709
 in brazil four of the demoisers of the series 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.660
 B 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:11.670
 beyond competitive exclusivity 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.670
 one piece has the Corinthians 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.260
 and how was this partnership with 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.180
 konami to work with corinthians 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.100
 in the good game we already had a 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.570
 relationship with them in the 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.870
 corinthians is present in the 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.550
 I fight only for some time and since 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.169
 beginning of this year we were 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.150
 try to do something 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.620
 differentiated something that 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.200
 to provide an experience for the 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.140
 that they had never had 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.750
 this kind of access we found 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.310
 interesting their approach to speech 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.919
 of them we really started to 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.110
 to realize that we could have a 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:54.430
 type of twist relationship 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.590
 club and game in a way is that no 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.940
 team had done previously 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.410
 we started to narrow the 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.580
 which is also important in 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.600
 any type of contract of 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.940
 licensing 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.380
 I started thinking and drafting the 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.750
 activation of the possibilities 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.669
 possibilities we could have and 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.720
 after a few months it is obvious that it is not 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:15.790
 a quick negotiation nekounam 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.470
 Japanese company but after a few months 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.860
 people reached a consensus and we 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.150
 that would be so good pro the konami propugnam 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.530
 proves the shock so good for the 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.320
 Corinthians and we arrived at this agreement 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.030
 including all these negotiations they 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.729
 have to do with the capture of 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.740
 movements of the players face as it is 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:34.180
 that corinthians work that 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.849
 konami has a number of demands 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.460
 techniques is not that we already had 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:41.169
 because we are already in the game 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.690
 and there you have a whole piece of production 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.610
 technique involving the soccer team 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.710
 involves a marketing department that 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.680
 We fulfilled to the letter in order to such 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:53.410
 as real as possible within the game 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.789
 even if you are aware of the 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.169
 demo version that the first the first 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:06:00.970
 game that has arina present to the arena is 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:04.389
 perfect in that arena look in the game if 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:07.470
 look and nac is in reality looks like car 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.470
 exactly the same thing
