00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
see I only have about level 19 I could

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.420

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
rep level 44 but I don't think I'm gonna

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.190

much but I mean I don't know it's
something<00:00:47.100> it's<00:00:47.280> better<00:00:47.489> than<00:00:47.670> nothing<00:00:47.969> I

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
something it's better than nothing I

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.850 
something it's better than nothing I

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
ability is guys rage which this is this

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.319 
ability is guys rage which this is this
takes<00:00:52.559> actually<00:00:52.890> full<00:00:53.100> rage<00:00:53.340> but<00:00:53.699> feel<00:00:54.180> great

a<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.570> goes<00:00:54.719> down<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.110> course<00:00:55.320> but<00:00:55.559> anyways<00:00:55.860> it

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
a it goes down of course but anyways it

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.189 
a it goes down of course but anyways it
increases<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.850> attack<00:00:57.090> rate<00:00:57.329> by<00:00:57.449> 6%<00:00:57.750> and

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
increases the attack rate by 6% and

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.709 
increases the attack rate by 6% and
speed<00:00:58.829> by<00:00:59.039> 20%<00:00:59.100> for<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.300> your<00:01:00.390> destroyer

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
for 15 seconds cost for rage so it's

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.310 
for 15 seconds cost for rage so it's
really<00:01:03.809> awesome

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
really awesome

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.140 
really awesome
maybe<00:01:04.949> reason<00:01:05.100> why<00:01:05.189> once<00:01:05.430> guy<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.700> because

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
maybe reason why once guy is because

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.670 
maybe reason why once guy is because
actually<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.140> guy<00:01:07.290> right<00:01:07.470> here<00:01:07.500> and

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
actually have this guy right here and

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.620 
actually have this guy right here and
he's<00:01:07.770> also<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.159> tank<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:08.880> guy<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.270> tank

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
he's also a tank but this guy is a tank

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.140 
he's also a tank but this guy is a tank
and<00:01:09.869> he<00:01:10.170> does<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.560> lot<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.799> damage<00:01:11.090> so<00:01:12.090> I

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
and he does a lot of damage so I

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.100 
and he does a lot of damage so I
definitely<00:01:12.479> want<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.689> use<00:01:12.780> them<00:01:12.930> but

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
definitely want to use them but

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.260 
definitely want to use them but
basically<00:01:13.430> what<00:01:14.430> another<00:01:14.580> ability<00:01:14.760> does<00:01:15.060> is

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
basically what another ability does is

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.719 
basically what another ability does is
aid<00:01:15.659> skills<00:01:16.110> savage<00:01:16.740> oath<00:01:16.950> increases<00:01:17.610> they

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
aid skills savage oath increases they

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.160 
aid skills savage oath increases they
deployed<00:01:18.150> heroes<00:01:18.479> attack<00:01:18.750> rate<00:01:18.960> by<00:01:19.110> two

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
deployed heroes attack rate by two

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.410 
deployed heroes attack rate by two
percent<00:01:19.729> upgradeable<00:01:20.729> when<00:01:20.850> main<00:01:21.090> skill

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
percent upgradeable when main skill

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.899 
percent upgradeable when main skill
reaches<00:01:21.720> level<00:01:22.049> two<00:01:22.280> so<00:01:23.280> there's<00:01:23.729> basically

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
reaches level two so there's basically

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.219 
reaches level two so there's basically
everything<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.420> need<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.630> know<00:01:24.720> about<00:01:25.020> them

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
everything you need to know about them

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.420 
everything you need to know about them
of<00:01:25.320> course<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.650> have<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.830> hero<00:01:25.979> talent<00:01:26.369> so

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
of course you have the hero talent so
