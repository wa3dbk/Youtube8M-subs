00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.120
 This video is supposed to be a what's on today 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.410
 my mac video and many give me 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.760
 People asked you if I did not even 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.380
 So a video can do to show 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.179
 which apps use daily 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.830
 Of course, I then go into it and 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.330
 therefore makes for you in his little 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.490
 video I think that should also be quite 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.779
 be interesting if he still cares for me 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.330
 have suggestions because it combined I 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:30.240
 also frankly, have fun 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:31.800
 video the first app I really do 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.030
 use every day and that will be many 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.309
 maybe not that surprising 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.530
 like bot that is a twitter client with 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.820
 here between a device and 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.350
 can synchronize 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.570
 that is when i am here on the macbook 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.219
 and which tweets I read when I am 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.379
 Do the iphone and david porter 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.600
 open exactly where I put the 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.780
 Street offered here on the mac ended that 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.980
 is quite different between mac and iphone 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.500
 normal back and forth 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.899
 I like that very much and give it away 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.859
 it now also has a ios 7 version suite 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.870
 3.0 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.579
 I'm curious when the update for 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.719
 mac comes out with me now too 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.760
 Not so the surprise it is the 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.890
 adobe creative suite cs 6 which use 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.479
 I'm really partial about every day 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.530
 to make any video project 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.930
 to edit pictures 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.430
 all sorts of things and I can really speak 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.189
 heart does not matter if the price 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.299
 is a bit higher than for others 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.740
 software that you can pay for 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.869
 but it just as a student with the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.640
 student or student discount too 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.130
 that's really a nice thing 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.900
 with photoshop after effects premiere pro 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.090
 audition what I her organs to 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.530
 accommodate users and everything possible 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.049
 So in my opinion, still so 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.759
 the best complete package what to look at 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.590
 really imagine the video production 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.119
 like maybe some of you 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.979
 I am so small after all 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.829
 play fine and therefore belong now 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.710
 also play it for almost every day bread 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.720
 it always goes down a bit what 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.610
 Update the fce user is up 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.020
 any case colin mcrae dirt 2 super 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.990
 It will also play directly in the mac app 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.210
 store there can you download like 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.630
 said my favorite game right now 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.640
 mac what I still have is portal 2 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.659
 as a team version of the playstation 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.759
 back then 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.110
 race driver grid and minecraft me 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.720
 I play through the sale in the app store 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.180
 has also been noticed is the cave 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.319
 a really exciting adventure game 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.510
 because it once on a bit 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.680
 Thinking requires a lot 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.120
 I have fun there now first as a 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.860
 a bit tapped but so the first 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.989
 impression is relatively cool one 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.049
 simple graphics but interesting 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.209
 history a speaking it covers very 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.580
 interesting in any case, one of them 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.810
 the apps I currently pedestal a 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.489
 program what i study by unfortunately 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.170
 also needs to use is parallels desktop 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:42.599
 So windows 8 in monierten machine for 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.160
 Software development is definitely 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.329
 It's not that bad at all 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.579
 i thought i am talking now 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.269
 not from windows 8.1 you know mine 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.239
 opinion on it 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.890
 but in any case parallel to itself 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.840
 is really a nice thing just up 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.640
 macs ok if you do not have windows in parallel 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.739
 installed as operating system 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.290
 it would be a nice thing 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.030
 just like that between mac and windows 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.410
 to switch directly back and forth 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.209
 Finally, I have two small ones 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.250
 clients and that is carissa once 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.230
 there you can have small instagram photos 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.599
 look at the post unfortunately not 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.170
 you can share it with licon comment 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.430
 everything you can even the 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.769
 favorite instagram pictures or 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.440
 Of course you can show your videos 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.840
 own profile then the likes 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.639
 you have ever forgiven that is possible 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.099
 unfortunately not one can not see who 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.569
 when something has been laid by one there is 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.269
 no notifications also no 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.829
 window for but otherwise I use that 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.510
 relatively often when I'm not 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.400
 the mobile phone have to me up 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.840
 instagram has the pictures I like that 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.630
 subscribed to view 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.280
 the last one would recommend is memory 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.530
 The power on the way home still sounds good 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.579
 more sense than macbook in any case 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.910
 could with this app one 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:52.680
 Check memory status and 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.019
 clean up most of the time it is so that 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.239
 RAM just inactive 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.980
 is lying around and convenient to him 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.419
 not can use, and this program 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.019
 helps you always in the eye 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.669
 to keep 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.500
 how much RAM is currently used 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:06.599
 which one is inactive and natural 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.730
 then clear the RAM 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.510
 what a very interesting thing to see 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.519
 the 32 GB of RAM in the imac 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.599
 a video clip using the rapide 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:17.269
 go down and then you really 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:19.130
 only a few mb left you like it 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.239
 Do not believe it but it is the end 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.250
 it is this way and now it is up to you 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.780
 Write me your favorite mac 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.490
 apps just below in the comments and 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.020
 which you would recommend to me as well 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.150
 because I'm real to be real 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.830
 not so the frequent apps user or 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.260
 Not so the apps I really have 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.910

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.650
