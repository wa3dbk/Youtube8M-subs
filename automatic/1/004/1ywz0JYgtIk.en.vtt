just<00:03:16.970> in<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.150> sense<00:03:17.420> of<00:03:17.920> statistics<00:03:18.920> but

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
just in the sense of statistics but

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.610 
just in the sense of statistics but
really<00:03:19.840> understanding<00:03:20.840> how<00:03:21.080> it<00:03:21.350> intersects

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
really understanding how it intersects

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.040

masculinity I do think that there is a

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.130 
masculinity I do think that there is a
stark<00:03:27.110> difference<00:03:27.380> in<00:03:28.370> how<00:03:29.150> fat<00:03:29.450> stigma<00:03:29.780> is

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140
