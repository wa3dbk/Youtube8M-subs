00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.750
 hello everyone today I bring you a trick of 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.910
 how to leave the map in plants vs 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.320
 zombies just what you are seeing 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.060
 I was already out of the map I was in 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.369
 an inaccessible area and here it was 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.170
 using the drone to enter 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.059
 inside the map again and so you can 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.680
 get support since I was with him in this 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.180
 departure and good the truth that was 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.559
 pretty curious we started to search 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.330
 around here we find a hole where 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.190
 get out here as you are going to see me just 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.379
 I put the drone here in this area here 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.510
 now then let it climb on top and there's 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.610
 that go up little by little because this is a 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.870
 bit complicated is worth what 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.700
 we have to do that we go up little to 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.890
 little value so that the partner does not 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.780
 fall because it moves a lot with the 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.250
 helix is ​​worth then when we get to 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.780
 this area here we have to lower a 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.550
 just not worth climb as high as 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.780
 was I now you will see that go down a bit 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.220
 and we have to have a little bit towards 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.690
 ahead it's worth now that we see that the train 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.369
 pull a little towards the side you have to 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.750
 go up but as I say it has not been 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.240
 say little by little they put the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.710
 mate will fall once he leaves us 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.630
 get here the mate already jumps 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.610
 and we would both be in an area 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.039
 inaccessible in quotes outside the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.720
 map is worth as you are seeing there we are 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.820
 the two have rivals building since that 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.220
 building would already be out worth 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.720
 and well now you are going to see what we are going to 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.790
 do a little bit over there you're going to see a little 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.660
 what is the limits where we 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.950
 we can move and once abyss we do not go 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.140
 to teach a little here is worth this 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.100
 area where we be now if 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.390
 we go a little bit more towards the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.090
 We could not be left 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.030
 do not jump to the countdown but here 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.759
 Well, I decided to throw myself down, not at 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.320
 which it is at the bottom of the map and 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.910
 I thought it would be transparent or something 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.259
 it would fall below but good as you are 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.180
 seeing I stay right here 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.530
 now that he will also jump and we 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.140
 we will give a little spin for her 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.970
 we just had what you see 36 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.610
 seconds we did not have much better for 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.619
 to be able to go recording and that here a 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.119
 drone that of someone who was out there 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.399
 playing that saw us off the map and it 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.690
 I would be flipping surely and nothing 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.130
 it's just this, now you're going to 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.900
 see we're going through a few of 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.430
 houses out there is worth as you see already 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.250
 we are out and you can see it's worth it 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.110
 we can go through mountains houses and 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.880
 all that the problem is that we could not 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.950
 teach much more since we are running out of 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.110
 weather 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.879
 as I say good surely 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.170
 we will keep looking at more things of these 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.330
 to see where we can go where no 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.280
 we can go and if we do something like that too 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.620
 interesting then surely we will continue 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.300
 recording some little things so curious 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.590
 in this game as you are seeing good 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.900
 It has no useful value 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.849
 simply for taking a look and 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.170
 little more so I do not expect anything that I have 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.760
 liked it if you liked to vote many 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.780
 favorites and see you in the next 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.780
 video greetings to all
