to 80 to 11 and the video ports that

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.429 
to 80 to 11 and the video ports that
come<00:01:26.549> with<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.850> system<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.570> DisplayPort

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
come with this system is a DisplayPort

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.859 
come with this system is a DisplayPort
so<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.680> can<00:01:28.950> connect<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.939> external<00:01:30.329> monitor<00:01:30.750> as

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
so you can connect a external monitor as

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.390 
so you can connect a external monitor as
well<00:01:30.930> as<00:01:31.650> has<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> data<00:01:32.460> connection<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:33.090> us<00:01:33.570> be

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
well as has a data connection of us be

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.819 
well as has a data connection of us be
2.4<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.579> lower<00:01:35.850> end<00:01:36.210> model<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.439> battery

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
2.4 that lower end model and the battery

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.289 
2.4 that lower end model and the battery
is<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.509> 31-point<00:01:39.509> 5<00:01:40.110> watts<00:01:40.950> per<00:01:41.400> hour<00:01:41.640> battery

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
is a 31-point 5 watts per hour battery

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.690 
is a 31-point 5 watts per hour battery
so<00:01:42.630> you'll<00:01:42.780> get<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.110> lot<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.770> battery<00:01:44.100> time<00:01:44.460> out

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
so you'll get a lot of battery time out

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.590 
so you'll get a lot of battery time out
of<00:01:45.180> this<00:01:45.329> small<00:01:45.899> thin<00:01:46.409> tablet<00:01:47.270> moving<00:01:48.270> on<00:01:48.390> to
