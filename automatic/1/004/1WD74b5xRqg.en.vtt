00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.990 
it comes back to the start now a lot of
people<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:04.050> original<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.800> think<00:02:05.790> actually

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
people the original I think actually

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.139 
people the original I think actually
doesn't<00:02:06.570> have<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.470> third<00:02:07.740> string<00:02:08.160> from<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
doesn't have the third string from the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.110 
doesn't have the third string from the
bottom<00:02:09.570> being<00:02:09.780> plugged<00:02:10.110> but<00:02:10.940> obviously<00:02:11.940> when

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
bottom being plugged but obviously when

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.000 
bottom being plugged but obviously when
you<00:02:12.240> list<00:02:12.390> when<00:02:12.630> it<00:02:12.660> every<00:02:13.170> case<00:02:13.440> got<00:02:13.710> all<00:02:13.860> the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
you list when it every case got all the

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.510 
you list when it every case got all the
other<00:02:14.190> bits<00:02:14.340> going<00:02:14.580> on<00:02:14.820> in<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.360> song<00:02:16.190> but<00:02:17.190> when

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
other bits going on in the song but when

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.010 
other bits going on in the song but when
you<00:02:17.640> play<00:02:17.820> not<00:02:18.000> under<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.300> cue<00:02:18.540> stick<00:02:18.600> I

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
you play not under the cue stick I

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.840 
you play not under the cue stick I
always<00:02:19.350> find<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:19.920> seems<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.310> flow<00:02:20.580> better

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
always find that it seems to flow better

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.930 
always find that it seems to flow better
by<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.780> in<00:02:22.020> that<00:02:22.140> string<00:02:22.530> before<00:02:22.710> people<00:02:23.100> leave

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
by it in that string before people leave

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.940 
by it in that string before people leave
comments<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.600> say<00:02:24.870> oh<00:02:24.900> well<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.680> original

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
comments and say oh well the original

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.720 
comments and say oh well the original
never<00:02:26.370> had<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.820> but<00:02:28.280> you<00:02:29.280> know<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.490> started

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
never had that but you know it started

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.200 
never had that but you know it started
you<00:02:29.820> going

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.940 

but<00:02:34.210> something<00:02:34.660> like<00:02:34.810> that<00:02:35.020> I<00:02:35.230> tend<00:02:35.710> to<00:02:35.860> always

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
but something like that I tend to always

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:50.840 
but something like that I tend to always
put<00:02:36.490> pull<00:02:36.970> that<00:02:37.120> one<00:02:37.300> on<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.750> way<00:02:37.870> through

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.760 

and<00:02:51.850> that's<00:02:52.000> it<00:02:52.240> all<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.510> way<00:02:52.600> free<00:02:52.930> so<00:02:53.650> we

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
and that's it all the way free so we

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.740 
and that's it all the way free so we
