00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:11.800
 Hello Tsuchiya of ping-pong kids of the world rubber market partners 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:14.320
 The theme of this time is to know the mechanism of return serving 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.840
 2 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:22.940
 By putting the returns serve to wear 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:29.570
 Wear a serve that controls the amount of ball rotation 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:34.690
 The length of the ball and the falling of the ball after the ball bounces on the opponent's court 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:42.420
 Many things will come to be heard such as controlling the distance 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:43.680
 Please practicing proceed because it is also the main base of the practice of Saab 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:51.590
 Then 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:54.340
 The back serve will also introduce you to the three important points of practice 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.780
 First is the first one 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.780
 This time is this 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:09.840
 We prepared model of angle 30 degrees 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:13.860
 As it is good as reference as how to refer to how to get off racket, we use this first of all three 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.760
 I will introduce one of the points 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.010
 First of all 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.460
 This 30 degree angle 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.600
 The front is the manager 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.530
 Install 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.070
 this 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.130
 Cotton linen 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:36.420
 Practice using the upper tongue as a guideline 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.659
 Change racket fear by turning 30 degrees upward 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.370
 Well this guidelines 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:48.690
 I think it feels good to shake 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:51.650
 The moon doing normal 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.900
 There is a slope in the front direction 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.150
 This is Tamanoo 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:01.450
 Because the speed in the straight direction will increase 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:05.820
 If you go back and hit upside down 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.619
 Can occur easily 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:15.040
 The second point 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:20.170
 Let's hook the pole with rubber firmly to the ball coming down after bird's eyebrow 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.550
 I feel like going to pick up the ball at the hook 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.990
 On the ball 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:29.480
 If you touch gently 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:35.739
 The ball won't catch on the rubber, so it won't create a spin unless it's caught 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:38.640
 The action Tteyuu hook firmly come by the force of the first friction on the ball 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:44.940
 Let's do it correctly 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:48.440
 The third is the point third is the point hooking when shake the racket 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:52.910
 Not like the ball comes out in the forward direction 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:58.550
 The racket pulls out when hooked 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.210
 I think it will be a very good point if you can leave the image that the ball comes from the app 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.840
 I will 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:08.430
 While swinging the way of the racket is to fall to 30 degrees 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:12.650
 The ball will come later I pull the racket ahead of the image reproduction shop 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:16.750
 I think that the image of waving with feeling is good 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.750
 Please see the actual video 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.269
 Good 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.269
 Good 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.230
 pa 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.670
 pa 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.490
 Yes yes 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.490
 Ha 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.380
 Follow 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.580
 Bach 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.699
 eh 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:03.480
 The 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.350
 In practicing this back word 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.950
 Usually 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:13.200
 Quite 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:15.320
 I think that many people have experienced a unique but slightly different ball touch 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.380
 How to touch the ball 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.040
 Personality is born 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.020
 By each player 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:29.770
 You can do it with distinctive 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:37.590
 As it is part to become reference that is reference of rotation of various balls 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:37.590
 I think I want you to get the ball touch of the return serve by repeating the practice by all means 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.590
 Let's practice repeatedly 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.590
 Thank you very much
