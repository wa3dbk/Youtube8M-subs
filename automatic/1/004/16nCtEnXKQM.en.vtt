00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
in the series the difficulty of the game

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.030 
in the series the difficulty of the game
will<00:04:25.390> probably<00:04:25.930> be<00:04:26.080> off-putting<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:26.800> zone

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
will probably be off-putting the zone

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.280 
will probably be off-putting the zone
but<00:04:27.640> I<00:04:27.669> felt<00:04:27.910> that<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.210> low<00:04:28.360> price<00:04:28.660> a<00:04:28.930> nice

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290

mesh between platforming and music will

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.150 
mesh between platforming and music will
