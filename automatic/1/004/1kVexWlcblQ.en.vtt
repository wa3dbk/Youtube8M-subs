00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.650
 see what happens 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.939
 it seems it is 

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:11.299
 speed 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:12.980
 care speed 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.339
 Be careful with these things intro control 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.339
 to the inclement when I squeezed the space bar 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:20.599
 will shoot 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.599
 when it works space hours it goes off 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.619
 let's forget that if it comes to the end, go back to the beginning 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.910
 and so we will have the possibility of 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.529
 others 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.309
 I have here now 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.380
 squeezed intros after this condition 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.310
 We want to tell you if the bad 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.520
 10 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.520
 bar point 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.080
 low medion x 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.790
 is older 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.790
 the stage on the right 550 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.410
 so today I want it to happen 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.690
 we want the bullet to put me half we believe that the bullet will return ana 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.630
 what is the trade 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.380
 then what will we do we simply modify the variable 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.400
 speed we propose to do it the program 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.140
 knows 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.180
 kemp has to put back lacy 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.320
 in what is 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.980
 praised of wool 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.960
 we change the speed 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.960
 speed 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.860
 It does not matter 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.950
 that is to say we could almost say that we are using the variable speed 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.850
 for two things 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.909
 to control 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.909
 if it has to follow 1 and to compensate this what speed 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.800
 beck control 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.700
 now you go step 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.840
 and if it envelops you 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.299
 when it reaches the end it returns again it will have another shot now what 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.299
 we will control 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.580
 what we propose is that if the bullet 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.070
 soca with 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.140
 the cyan 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.160
 let's tell the Martian yes 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.170
 this out 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.450
 finally the actress 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.450
 the Martian who is going to control this 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.519
 for it we selected the Martian in the line of time i doublet 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.620
 this Martian in the photo the plus 5 had all a drought of 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.560
 programming 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.889
 that he also controlled in this part of here 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:20.950
 psycho cava 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.069
 with our with 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.069
 the ship then this condition 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:29.699
 let's do a very similar one but if it hits 

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:31.819
 the shot 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:32.829
 good 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:33.670
 you are right 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.499
 if you have 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:38.499
 gil point 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:47.059
 small things that poor city directly shot and 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:51.379
 We have not put a name on the cards and here 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.260
 notice that you are wrong, I will accept 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.480
 and I'll keep in mind that they're inside the symbol whether there's 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.439
 replenish 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.439
 and still under par 

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:08.429
 yes this fact cascon the bullet 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.509
 pablo god cost it 

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:12.719
 I enter 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:17.279
 here is missing as always if it stays that it is legal to come here it was missing then 

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:17.749
 here 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:19.539
 a parenthesis 

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:23.050
 - Falkirk visually helps us already 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.449
 I put it to follow 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:27.129
 perfect and this 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.519
 perfect that we want and crash these gestures with your hand 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:33.540
 the comet 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.740
 it has to disappear 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.559
 and the kettle 

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:38.669
 has to go again to the beginning has to follow 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:40.979
 paddle 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:42.059
 aloft 

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:45.179
 then to start 10 we go albor the band 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:51.339
 point I'm going to modify for and then the variables speed that is in the 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:53.579
 timeline of the scene in the previous 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.579
 so that in pits 

00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:01.269
 bilbo-trinity 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.269
 I do not forget is the same 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.730
 remember that if it hits the bullet 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.680
 the optimist the comet sichoca with the potty what speed irak different 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.309
 efe 

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:15.139
 well now what will he do 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.139
 the shootings back 

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:19.650
 inf 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.659
 what else do we want 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:25.899
 this timeline the Martian's timeline return to 1 and exit 

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:27.710
 another is to say that it appears 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.569
 estimate what ended 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:31.669
 point 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.669
 hangout uu 

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:45.889
 world 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.499
 let's try this 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:51.499
 squeezed control entered 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.090
 let's see or try to exceed at some point 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:58.849
 shocking 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:00.189
 there are 15 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:04.209
 Bartlett goes back to the beginning but I would like it if it were shown 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:07.770
 yes and that same a little better 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.770
 Let's read 

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:15.459
 for what we will do is on the line the Martian look for example 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:17.349
 in the frame 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:18.060
 6 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.029
 I will insert a hesitant keyframe 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:24.029
 from here we will make a small explosion 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.219
 without contour 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:29.339
 White 

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:30.830
 and we do as always 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.559
 a small explosion 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:34.539
 that yes it will consist 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:35.919
 of a circle 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.150
 they just make you a little bit 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.330
 even so 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.059
 and here other keyframe 

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:46.059
 meadow a little bit more 3 

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:00.169
 with this 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:01.889
 decent we have left 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.650
 we have to correct a bit the code here look, I know we said 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.560
 when it hit the bullet even if it went to 1 we'll tell him to leave 

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:13.740
 6 others we just could not say play 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.729
 for this affirmation to be launched 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:18.949
 Approve law 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:19.839
 and I close 

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:21.110
 ap installs you 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.189
 these two frames 

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:26.710
 these equipment but then at the beginning 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.340
 with pose to detect 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.949
 we are going to 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:31.819
 we have it shots 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:33.559
 now, now 

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:35.840
 um chhoun chou bun 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.390
 suncho used a knife a clash of egos that expected this now what we 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:42.139
 remains 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:47.619
 expose here a marker a sissokÃ³ marker of lives both of lives as 

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:50.479
 running no cough 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:54.819
 we kill let's go to the scene and now it's time that in the bottom 

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:56.669
 down to put us 

00:06:56.669 --> 00:06:57.539
 a marker 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:06:58.699
 to control 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:00.649
 how many lives do you have left? 

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:02.270
 to the spacecraft 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.159
 how many Martians 

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:04.659
 we have passed
