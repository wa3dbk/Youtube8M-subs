multiplayer<00:02:54.270> and<00:02:54.420> all<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:54.930> think<00:02:55.410> honestly<00:02:55.740> I

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
multiplayer and all I think honestly I

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.080 
multiplayer and all I think honestly I
think<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.220> multiplayer<00:02:56.670> is<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.880> real<00:02:57.060> reason

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
think the multiplayer is the real reason

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.060 
think the multiplayer is the real reason
why<00:02:57.480> they<00:02:57.630> probably<00:02:57.840> deleted<00:02:58.230> either<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.830> or

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
why they probably deleted either that or

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.580 
why they probably deleted either that or
some<00:02:59.580> type<00:02:59.790> of<00:02:59.820> marketing<00:03:00.390> strategy<00:03:00.960> I<00:03:01.170> don't

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
some type of marketing strategy I don't

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.380 
some type of marketing strategy I don't
really<00:03:01.710> see<00:03:01.800> that<00:03:01.950> or<00:03:02.310> they<00:03:02.940> could<00:03:03.000> be<00:03:03.180> having

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
really see that or they could be having

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.150 
really see that or they could be having
trouble<00:03:03.840> cuz<00:03:03.960> I<00:03:04.020> did<00:03:04.200> lay<00:03:04.380> some<00:03:04.590> people<00:03:04.830> all<00:03:04.950> to

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
trouble cuz I did lay some people all to

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.830 
trouble cuz I did lay some people all to
something<00:03:05.730> like<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.030> don't<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.660> said
