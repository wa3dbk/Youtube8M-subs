are<00:01:40.799> there<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.850> but<00:01:42.689> once<00:01:43.289> we<00:01:43.500> assemble<00:01:44.689> like

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
are there in but once we assemble like

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.779 
are there in but once we assemble like
this<00:01:47.209> and<00:01:48.209> after<00:01:48.599> completion<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.789> it's

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
this and after completion of this it's

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.479 
this and after completion of this it's
very<00:01:50.939> difficult<00:01:51.539> to<00:01:51.750> detect<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:53.009> sun<00:01:53.219> causing

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
the inside in the sense so we need to

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.020 
the inside in the sense so we need to
have<00:01:58.590> interim<00:01:59.579> interim<00:02:01.009> inspection<00:02:02.009> on<00:02:02.759> this

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
have interim interim inspection on this

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.199 
have interim interim inspection on this
time<00:02:03.239> it's<00:02:03.479> okay<00:02:03.869> then<00:02:04.349> we<00:02:04.560> can<00:02:04.590> call<00:02:05.149> go<00:02:06.149> to

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
time it's okay then we can call go to

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.050 
time it's okay then we can call go to
the<00:02:06.450> next<00:02:06.659> step<00:02:06.959> and<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:08.039> time<00:02:08.280> it's<00:02:08.670> okay

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
the next step and this time it's okay

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.650 
the next step and this time it's okay
then<00:02:09.509> we<00:02:09.750> can<00:02:09.929> go<00:02:10.079> to<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.319> next<00:02:10.500> step<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:12.390> as<00:02:12.629> a

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
then we can go to the next step and as a

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.190 
then we can go to the next step and as a
result<00:02:13.370> we<00:02:14.370> can<00:02:14.400> have<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.730> perfect<00:02:15.470> product<00:02:18.200> for
