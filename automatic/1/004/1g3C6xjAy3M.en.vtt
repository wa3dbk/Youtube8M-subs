00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.839
 hello I am olive tree I am 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.370
 climbed teacher today I 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.410
 will show you how to choose a 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.570
 good length of rope the rope 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.849
 climbing so very very accessory 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.380
 important for escalation 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.900
 we see small or big question for 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.920
 to be safe 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.080
 obviously there are climbers who 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.539
 climbs without it's not a category 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.320
 that he is not here to choose the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.270
 good length of rope 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:36.930
 it's very simple in general the ways 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.480
 we see them in the mountains 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.489
 most of the time the maximum they 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.250
 do in 30 35 meters so at least one 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.460
 will choose a rope of 70 m since 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.199
 do not forget that who has a 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.600
 length that goes the corals and then he 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.000
 must bring down the rapper so 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.949
 on the double routes of languor more 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 wide 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.859
 if you really want to be you will 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.899
 the best is to take a rope 200 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.580
 m like that at least at least in France 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.830
 you can do all the voices 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.400
 almost all voices are there 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.400
 very few voices exceeding 50 m on 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.680
 There is a case where there are cases 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.650
 exceptional, of course, or if 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.880
 begins to make the big way there 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.549
 is advised to take the ropes a 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.680
 very small but includes 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.200
 in double okay so rather than 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.000
 to have a single one arm one has to 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.280
 finer than this one because that 's 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.220
 from the 11th to put me about 11 12 that's 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.780
 an artificial string of halls and 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.560
 natural resume the courses in everything 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.350
 a little bit thinner from 9.4 to 10 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.550
 mm for an obvious reason this is the 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.830
 transport is much heavier and 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.570
 if you have a walk approaching and a 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.370
 day the escaladent case is better 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.320
 take something the sets are 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.950
 calculated for maximum security what 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.750
 whatever the diameter 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.170
 why are we going to take a rope in 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.450
 double when making long lanes 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.310
 because simply 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.700
 flowers measure of evolution of climber 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.050
 it may be that the strings rub this 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.399
 tale on long ways we will not 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.890
 necessarily all right maybe we'll 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.560
 take turns all that he can 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.180
 that driving the fraud fraud bodies 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.709
 on the rock on a rock that can 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.319
 to be more or less he was saying if there is a 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.180
 strand a piece of rope that breaks it 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.620
 remains the second while if we have 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.230
 only one is more risky 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.480
 good these are the extreme cases whatever it is 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.540
 either to choose the right length 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.340
 rope you have to learn about the 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.890
 kind of voice we're going to climb 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.830
 so either by inquiring on the internet 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.829
 either by buying a topo of the places of the 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.329
 site to properly define the length of 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.730
 maximum lanes that you will be able to 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.890
 to do and at that moment to be able to buy 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.709
 a rope accordingly so always 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.420
 by doubling the length of 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.810
 the way and adding a margin 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.209
 minimum of 5 meters or 10 if you 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.769
 really want to be wide 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.590
 ultimately if you do not want you 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.569
 take the lead is sure of you the best 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.060
 it is to buy a 100 m 100 m you 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.250
 are quiet you can get 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.049
 no surprise here now that 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.160
 you know how to choose a good 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.160
 length of rope it's up to you to play
