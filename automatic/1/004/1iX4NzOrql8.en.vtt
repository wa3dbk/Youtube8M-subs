looked at this processor online today

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.140 
looked at this processor online today
and<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.650> seems<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.100> be<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.220> pretty<00:01:17.460> decent<00:01:18.000> one

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
and it seems to be a pretty decent one

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
although it's not as good as the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.440 
although it's not as good as the
eight-core<00:01:22.650> processor<00:01:22.710> could<00:01:23.640> be<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:24.000> theory

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
eight-core processor could be in theory

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.130 
eight-core processor could be in theory
with<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.470> mind<00:01:25.500> also<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:27.150> hear<00:01:27.900> that
