00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.710
 here for you to realize that I have a 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.080
 a screen that shows some options there 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.119

 happens there are some options there that I 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.110
 I already leave it pre-defined that the game like this 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.900
 since fifa 11 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.579
 What is there, for example, has changed 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.850
 important is the first personal law 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.110
 automatic exchange many people complain 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.810

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.100

 here the assistance in automatic exchange 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.250
 I leave no assistance in the strength of 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.039
 I leave the assistance in the 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.230
 Pass I was watching 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.109
 The existence on the ball threading I leave 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.049
 assisted in the completion of the 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:22.739
 I left assistance in the 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:26.430
 intersection leaves the 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:30.780
 go over I watched 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:34.230
 defense assistance I leave semi and 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.720
 analogue I leave off and on 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.819
 defense I leave the tactical defense but here 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.379
 staff are not as alone as you 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.349
 to play with your friend who will give 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:45.599
 you change this option because even this 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.299
 type of defense here is that kind of 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.669
 defense that you had before you were alone. 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.500
 holding one to score and now service 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:54.079
 you hold it in the air it's only about 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.709
 You have to give an x to give the boat 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.480
 folks 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.459

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.989
 looked at what settings I use 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.150
 in control many people speak little 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.099
 I keep taking too much goal I 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.730
 player is scoring wrong personally 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:10.349
 try to use these settings that I used 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.239
 I am not saying that is the best but 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.639

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.840
 training in everything you do not 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:18.569
 I do not like it 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.459
 it's just you press and hold the button and 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.269
 that it returns all the pattern as it was 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.909
 before 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.310

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.829
 in control and started to gain staff 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.319
