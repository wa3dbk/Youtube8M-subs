material<00:02:49.660> editor<00:02:49.780> also

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:04.900 

Oh<00:02:58.300> gradient<00:03:01.150> drag<00:03:02.150> that<00:03:02.360> here<00:03:03.880> make<00:03:04.880> sure

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
Oh gradient drag that here make sure

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:40.750 
Oh gradient drag that here make sure
it's<00:03:05.150> an<00:03:05.210> instance

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.500 

that's<00:03:41.599> pretty<00:03:41.750> awesome<00:03:41.870> looking<00:03:42.319> I<00:03:43.239> took<00:03:44.239> a

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
that's pretty awesome looking I took a

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.869 
that's pretty awesome looking I took a
big<00:03:44.720> swing<00:03:45.200> for<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.769> better<00:03:45.950> once<00:03:46.430> we<00:03:46.610> got<00:03:46.730> it

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
big swing for the better once we got it

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.030 
big swing for the better once we got it
going<00:03:47.110> also<00:03:48.110> because<00:03:48.290> you<00:03:48.470> see<00:03:48.620> both<00:03:48.799> leaders

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
going also because you see both leaders

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.440 
going also because you see both leaders
are<00:03:49.159> called<00:03:49.340> lens<00:03:49.549> effects<00:03:49.939> we<00:03:50.090> could<00:03:50.239> call

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
are called lens effects we could call

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.630 
are called lens effects we could call
this<00:03:50.629> glow<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:54.709> we<00:03:54.860> could<00:03:55.010> call<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.459> other

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
this glow and we could call the other

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:07.990 
this glow and we could call the other
one<00:03:56.829> streak<00:04:01.480> let's<00:04:02.480> go<00:04:02.629> to<00:04:02.690> glow<00:04:06.790> raise<00:04:07.790> this

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
one streak let's go to glow raise this

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.679 
one streak let's go to glow raise this
back<00:04:08.269> up<00:04:08.510> to<00:04:08.750> 80<00:04:09.170> I<00:04:09.560> think<00:04:10.390> turn<00:04:11.390> this<00:04:11.480> down

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:11.689 
back up to 80 I think turn this down

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:26.650 
back up to 80 I think turn this down
even<00:04:11.989> more<00:04:12.040> 25<00:04:13.690> we<00:04:14.690> render<00:04:22.750> net<00:04:23.750> 70<00:04:25.660> hello

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
even more 25 we render net 70 hello

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:33.240 
even more 25 we render net 70 hello
strong

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.400 

so<00:04:34.250> anyway<00:04:34.520> that's<00:04:34.670> basically<00:04:35.600> how<00:04:35.750> you<00:04:36.050> have

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
so anyway that's basically how you have

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:59.140 
so anyway that's basically how you have
it<00:04:38.590> or<00:04:39.590> how<00:04:39.710> it's<00:04:39.920> done

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:06.640 

this<00:05:00.140> works<00:05:00.380> and<00:05:00.560> all<00:05:00.650> kinds<00:05:01.070> of<00:05:01.160> things<00:05:05.650> for

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
this works and all kinds of things for

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.800 
this works and all kinds of things for
not<00:05:07.040> only<00:05:07.190> is<00:05:07.280> the<00:05:07.430> light<00:05:07.640> pulsating<00:05:08.540> to<00:05:08.690> the

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
not only is the light pulsating to the

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.570 
not only is the light pulsating to the
music<00:05:09.940> we<00:05:10.940> can<00:05:11.090> change<00:05:11.410> anything<00:05:12.410> max<00:05:13.100> is<00:05:13.310> so

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
music we can change anything max is so

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.810 
music we can change anything max is so
strong<00:05:14.270> when<00:05:14.660> it<00:05:14.810> comes<00:05:15.020> to<00:05:15.460> this<00:05:16.460> curve

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
strong when it comes to this curve

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.930 
strong when it comes to this curve
editor<00:05:17.090> it's<00:05:17.540> everything<00:05:18.260> we<00:05:19.250> can<00:05:19.430> change<00:05:19.610> the

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
editor it's everything we can change the

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.790 
editor it's everything we can change the
wind<00:05:20.150> strength<00:05:20.570> to<00:05:20.870> the<00:05:21.020> beat<00:05:21.230> of<00:05:21.260> it<00:05:21.560> or<00:05:21.770> just

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
wind strength to the beat of it or just

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.770 
wind strength to the beat of it or just
buy<00:05:22.550> a<00:05:22.580> regular<00:05:22.970> noise<00:05:23.210> float<00:05:23.690> or<00:05:24.760> anything

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
buy a regular noise float or anything

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.490 
buy a regular noise float or anything
anything<00:05:26.780> at<00:05:27.020> all<00:05:28.330> max<00:05:29.330> is<00:05:29.540> so<00:05:29.720> super<00:05:30.110> powerful

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
anything at all max is so super powerful

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.430 
anything at all max is so super powerful
it's<00:05:30.860> only<00:05:30.980> limited<00:05:31.340> by<00:05:31.960> you<00:05:32.960> know<00:05:33.080> what<00:05:33.320> you

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
it's only limited by you know what you

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.080 
it's only limited by you know what you
can<00:05:33.620> come<00:05:33.770> up<00:05:33.830> with<00:05:35.770> so<00:05:36.770> anyway<00:05:37.100> this<00:05:37.610> is<00:05:37.790> mr.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
can come up with so anyway this is mr.

that it's not all about me it's all

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.920

about<00:07:04.130> learning<00:07:04.730> and<00:07:05.120> that's<00:07:05.480> how<00:07:05.690> it<00:07:05.900> should

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:05.930

and I think that is it now so for me and

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.550 
and I think that is it now so for me and
fairness<00:07:15.410> of<00:07:15.560> course<00:07:15.830> and<00:07:16.990> heck<00:07:17.990> we<00:07:18.199> even<00:07:18.229> do

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 
fairness of course and heck we even do

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.600 
fairness of course and heck we even do
it<00:07:18.710> for<00:07:18.740> sue<00:07:19.490> Richards<00:07:20.500> saying<00:07:21.500> have<00:07:22.280> a<00:07:22.310> good
