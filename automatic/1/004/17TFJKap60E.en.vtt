 hello friends in this video I'm going to 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.640
 teach how to return to the rom state 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:12.030
 original of your samsung galaxy s3 mini or 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.340
 gone when it stays dry you get 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.640
 the screen is in a black cell phone 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.770
 black and only comes out of the samsung logo 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.900
 galaxy s3 and from there you do not go out 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.610
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.610
 have downloaded or dyn 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.239
 that I already have it does not weigh much 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.480
 around us 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:39.579
 54 megs 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.579
 which is quite heavy is 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.030
 rice 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.160
 is this my mistake 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.429
 and we execute as administrator 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.440
 cell we put it in don gas mode and 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:14.110
 as it is the longa mode they will ask you 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:16.890
 good is button turn off a volume down and 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.890
 plus 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.830
 excuse me 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.680
 once we have it, we have it like that 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.509
 we will connect our usb cable and here in 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.509
 this big here 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:37.770
 with I will put on us blue that 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.200
 means that you already read it body or that 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.840
 I already recognized it good then 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.630
 we will put in pda this is very fast for 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.690
 that is strange to you very very quickly 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.470
 we will put in pda 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.470
 no matter 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.880
 in my case it is this 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.210
 and it should only be and I hope that 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.630
 start working takes around 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.550
 45 minutes and that's all we 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.170
 disconnect and we will have our 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.520
 Our Navarre system 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.520
