00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.410 
because I didn't have my polisher it
basically<00:00:29.369> it's<00:00:29.490> just<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.699> little<00:00:29.880> attachment

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
basically it's just a little attachment

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.729 
basically it's just a little attachment
that<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.570> can<00:00:30.660> put<00:00:31.050> on<00:00:35.600> so<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.410> sand

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
that you can put on so that you can sand

whatever it is velcro or whatever and
we're<00:02:38.819> just<00:02:38.880> gonna<00:02:39.000> start<00:02:39.150> sanding<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.720> down

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
we're just gonna start sanding it down

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.319 
we're just gonna start sanding it down
so<00:02:40.920> I'm<00:02:41.400> going<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:42.380> put<00:02:43.380> this<00:02:43.500> right<00:02:43.650> back<00:02:43.709> here

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
so I'm going to put this right back here

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.759 
so I'm going to put this right back here
and<00:02:45.329> so<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:45.959> can<00:02:46.079> see<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.290> little<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.650> the

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
and so you can see a little of the

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.890 
and so you can see a little of the
action<00:02:47.220> my<00:02:47.790> battery<00:02:48.180> is<00:02:48.209> almost<00:02:48.329> dead<00:02:49.099> but

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
action my battery is almost dead but

00:02:50.900 --> 00:03:23.980 
action my battery is almost dead but
hopefully<00:02:51.900> it'll<00:02:52.049> be<00:02:52.110> enough

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.150 

so<00:03:24.990> you're<00:03:25.140> gonna<00:03:25.230> want<00:03:25.500> to<00:03:25.560> start<00:03:25.770> off<00:03:25.950> at<00:03:26.130> a

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
so you're gonna want to start off at a

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.360 
so you're gonna want to start off at a
low<00:03:26.310> speed<00:03:26.780> increasing<00:03:27.780> your<00:03:28.310> increasing<00:03:29.310> in

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
low speed increasing your increasing in

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.960 
low speed increasing your increasing in
the<00:03:29.460> speed<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:32.040> have<00:03:32.220> it<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.430> little<00:03:32.700> slight

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
the speed and I have it a little slight

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.540 
the speed and I have it a little slight
edge<00:03:33.180> so<00:03:33.960> I<00:03:34.020> can<00:03:34.350> get<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.500> little<00:03:34.740> better<00:03:34.860> but

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
edge so I can get a little better but

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.370 
edge so I can get a little better but
it'll<00:03:35.730> look<00:03:35.820> like<00:03:36.030> this<00:03:36.390> I'm<00:03:37.110> gonna<00:03:37.260> keep

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
it'll look like this I'm gonna keep

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.240 
it'll look like this I'm gonna keep
going<00:03:37.710> for<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:37.920> little<00:03:38.100> while<00:03:38.220> pulling<00:03:39.030> about

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
going for a little while pulling about

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.920 
going for a little while pulling about
five<00:03:41.250> more<00:03:41.430> minutes<00:03:41.490> or<00:03:41.850> so<00:03:42.030> maybe<00:03:42.360> depending

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
five more minutes or so maybe depending

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.180 
five more minutes or so maybe depending
on<00:03:43.020> how<00:03:43.140> much<00:03:43.260> pressure<00:03:43.560> you<00:03:43.770> use<00:03:43.980> that's

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
on how much pressure you use that's

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.100 
on how much pressure you use that's
about<00:03:44.430> what<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.880> time<00:03:45.630> you're<00:03:45.750> gonna<00:03:45.840> want<00:03:46.050> to

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
about what the time you're gonna want to

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.740 
about what the time you're gonna want to
go<00:03:46.610> and<00:03:47.610> it's<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.910> same<00:03:48.090> with<00:03:48.240> every<00:03:48.450> step<00:03:48.690> you

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
go and it's the same with every step you

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.110 
go and it's the same with every step you
can<00:03:48.960> use<00:03:49.080> 500<00:03:49.560> grit<00:03:49.680> than<00:03:49.920> 800<00:03:50.340> grit<00:03:50.460> and<00:03:51.030> I

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
can use 500 grit than 800 grit and I

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.560 
can use 500 grit than 800 grit and I
think<00:03:51.450> they<00:03:51.570> have<00:03:51.720> like<00:03:51.750> 3000<00:03:52.710> grit<00:03:52.860> with<00:03:53.160> it

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
think they have like 3000 grit with it

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.600 
think they have like 3000 grit with it
or<00:03:54.570> 2,000<00:03:55.170> I<00:03:55.230> don't<00:03:55.410> know<00:03:55.500> what<00:03:55.650> it<00:03:55.740> is<00:03:55.830> and

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
or 2,000 I don't know what it is and

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.160 
or 2,000 I don't know what it is and

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.020 
then you're just gonna want to polish it
and<00:03:58.350> on<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:59.070> polishing<00:03:59.550> step<00:03:59.790> you're<00:03:59.970> gonna

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
and on the polishing step you're gonna

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.480 
and on the polishing step you're gonna
want<00:04:00.270> to<00:04:00.300> use<00:04:00.510> I'm<00:04:01.470> using<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:01.920> medium<00:04:02.250> cut
