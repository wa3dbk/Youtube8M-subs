on the inside of these cans a hole needs
to<00:01:27.380> be<00:01:27.500> put<00:01:27.740> in<00:01:27.800> the<00:01:27.890> lid<00:01:28.130> to<00:01:28.730> vent<00:01:29.330> gases

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
to be put in the lid to vent gases

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.530 
to be put in the lid to vent gases
produced<00:01:30.170> by<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.590> charcoal<00:01:31.100> in<00:01:31.880> this<00:01:32.360> case

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
produced by the charcoal in this case

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.390 
produced by the charcoal in this case
I'm<00:01:32.720> actually<00:01:32.870> going<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.200> use<00:01:33.290> do<00:01:33.740> three<00:01:34.160> holes

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
I'm actually going to use do three holes

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.930 
I'm actually going to use do three holes
in<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.940> lid<00:01:35.090> using<00:01:35.930> a<00:01:36.220> 3/16<00:01:37.220> inch<00:01:37.460> drill<00:01:37.880> bit

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
in the lid using a 3/16 inch drill bit

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.120 
in the lid using a 3/16 inch drill bit
but<00:01:38.570> one<00:01:38.780> hole<00:01:38.990> in<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.170> center<00:01:39.500> of<00:01:39.710> one

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
but one hole in the center of one

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.170 
but one hole in the center of one
quarter<00:01:40.430> inch<00:01:40.700> will<00:01:41.060> also<00:01:41.450> do<00:01:42.460> here<00:01:43.460> is<00:01:43.729> the

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
quarter inch will also do here is the

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.249 
quarter inch will also do here is the
lid<00:01:45.940> and<00:01:46.940> that<00:01:47.090> makes<00:01:47.390> a<00:01:47.750> finished<00:01:48.710> crucible

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
lid and that makes a finished crucible

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.380 
lid and that makes a finished crucible
the<00:01:51.259> next<00:01:51.619> step<00:01:51.950> once<00:01:52.250> your<00:01:52.430> crucible<00:01:52.850> is<00:01:53.090> made

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
the next step once your crucible is made

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.980 
the next step once your crucible is made
is<00:01:53.860> to<00:01:54.860> select<00:01:55.340> your<00:01:55.490> wood<00:01:55.759> now<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.450> wood<00:01:56.840> to

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
is to select your wood now the wood to

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.580 
is to select your wood now the wood to
be<00:01:57.110> used<00:01:57.470> for<00:01:57.860> charcoal<00:01:58.750> determines<00:01:59.750> what

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
be used for charcoal determines what

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.160 
be used for charcoal determines what
it's<00:02:00.710> going<00:02:00.830> to<00:02:00.890> be<00:02:01.040> good<00:02:01.220> for<00:02:01.490> a<00:02:01.899> softwood<00:02:02.899> is

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
it's going to be good for a softwood is

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.010 
it's going to be good for a softwood is
