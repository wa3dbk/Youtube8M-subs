00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.950
 good today we will learn to make a 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.779
 support for the cell phone 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.109
 all we need is a sheet 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.109
 of paper 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.050
 we doubled in half 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.420
 we remark on the doubles and doubled another 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.420
 once in half this way 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:37.400
 it generates something like this now the tip is 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.400
 we go to z 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.110
 ah 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.110
 we repeat the same with the other 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.240
 wait like this now we have to do is it what 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.240
 following 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.710
 we will have something like that 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.970
 now let's go back to this part up 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.400
 and then halfway 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.890
 do not 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.040
 thus 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.020
 here we have two tips 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.020
 we open it 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.310
 and we turn it in half 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.520
 now in the following 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.830
 we have two peaks left here we doubled 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.830
 upwards 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.380
 and ready 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.340
 We only put the cell phone 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.340
 thus 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.300
 as it goes
