we are also going to take those related

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.690 
we are also going to take those related
facts<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:09.929> turn<00:00:10.170> them<00:00:10.380> into<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.710> fact<00:00:11.099> family

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
facts and turn them into a fact family

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.970 
facts and turn them into a fact family
let's<00:00:12.509> take<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.780> look<00:00:13.049> at<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.320> cubes<00:00:13.620> on<00:00:13.830> the

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
let's take a look at the cubes on the

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.519 
let's take a look at the cubes on the
screen<00:00:14.309> you'll<00:00:14.940> see<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.269> I<00:00:15.330> have<00:00:15.540> six<00:00:15.960> purple

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
screen you'll see that I have six purple

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.120 
screen you'll see that I have six purple
cubes<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.359> three<00:00:18.359> yellow<00:00:18.960> cubes<00:00:19.289> this<00:00:19.920> week

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
cubes and three yellow cubes this week

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.830 
cubes and three yellow cubes this week
we've<00:00:20.310> been<00:00:20.340> working<00:00:20.910> on<00:00:21.090> something<00:00:21.600> very

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
we've been working on something very

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.900 
we've been working on something very
similar<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.590> we've<00:00:22.980> been<00:00:23.160> writing<00:00:23.400> addition

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
similar and we've been writing addition

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.570 
similar and we've been writing addition
sentences<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.720> represent<00:00:25.289> those<00:00:25.500> cubes<00:00:26.010> so

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
sentences to represent those cubes so

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.580 
sentences to represent those cubes so
the<00:00:26.730> addition<00:00:27.119> sentence<00:00:27.539> for<00:00:27.900> these<00:00:28.050> cubes

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
the addition sentence for these cubes

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.440 
the addition sentence for these cubes
would<00:00:29.340> be<00:00:29.519> six<00:00:30.090> purple<00:00:31.050> cubes<00:00:31.560> plus<00:00:32.520> three

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
would be six purple cubes plus three

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.790 
would be six purple cubes plus three
yellow<00:00:34.170> cubes<00:00:35.149> equals<00:00:36.149> nine<00:00:36.600> cubes<00:00:37.230> total

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
yellow cubes equals nine cubes total

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.610 
yellow cubes equals nine cubes total
that's<00:00:38.370> one<00:00:38.879> addition<00:00:39.450> sentence<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.140> could<00:00:40.350> use

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
that's one addition sentence I could use

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.229 
that's one addition sentence I could use
for<00:00:40.649> these<00:00:41.070> cubes<00:00:41.600> if<00:00:43.309> I<00:00:44.309> took<00:00:44.550> those<00:00:44.820> same

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
for these cubes if I took those same

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.080 
for these cubes if I took those same
cubes<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.960> flip<00:00:46.500> them<00:00:46.710> around<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.430> could<00:00:47.940> make

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
cubes and flip them around I could make

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.150 
cubes and flip them around I could make
another<00:00:48.420> fact<00:00:48.840> what<00:00:49.410> we<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.680> first<00:00:49.920> grade

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
another fact what we in first grade

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.029 
another fact what we in first grade
sometimes<00:00:50.730> call<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.210> flip<00:00:51.719> fact<00:00:52.140> where<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.680> take

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
sometimes call a flip fact where I take

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.090 
sometimes call a flip fact where I take
the<00:00:53.100> numbers<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:53.969> flip<00:00:54.360> them<00:00:54.629> around<00:00:55.100> if

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
the numbers and I flip them around if

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.740 
the numbers and I flip them around if
you<00:00:56.250> look<00:00:56.399> down<00:00:56.550> here<00:00:56.610> at<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.969> bottom<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.449> can

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
you look down here at the bottom I can

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.840 
you look down here at the bottom I can
make<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> flip<00:00:58.230> fact<00:00:58.559> by<00:00:58.859> putting<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.370> three

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
make a flip fact by putting the three

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.509 
make a flip fact by putting the three
first<00:01:00.270> for<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:02.850> three<00:01:03.300> yellow<00:01:03.899> cubes<00:01:04.519> then

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
first for the three yellow cubes then

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.510 
first for the three yellow cubes then
the<00:01:05.850> six<00:01:06.210> for<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> six<00:01:06.990> purple<00:01:07.290> cubes<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.040> my

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
the six for the six purple cubes and my

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.070 
the six for the six purple cubes and my
answer<00:01:08.880> would<00:01:09.030> still<00:01:09.060> be<00:01:09.299> nine<00:01:09.630> because<00:01:10.049> I

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
answer would still be nine because I

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.190 
answer would still be nine because I
still<00:01:10.409> have<00:01:10.650> nine<00:01:11.100> total<00:01:11.610> cubes<00:01:12.090> both<00:01:12.930> of

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
still have nine total cubes both of

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.350 
still have nine total cubes both of
those<00:01:13.380> sentences<00:01:14.100> are<00:01:14.340> addition<00:01:14.790> sentences

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
those sentences are addition sentences

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.300 
those sentences are addition sentences
that<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.720> could<00:01:16.020> use<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.290> represent<00:01:16.619> those

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
that I could use to represent those

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.840 
that I could use to represent those
cubes<00:01:17.850> now<00:01:18.619> let's<00:01:19.619> move<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.009> subtraction

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
cubes now let's move on to subtraction

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.620 
cubes now let's move on to subtraction
if<00:01:21.439> I<00:01:22.439> use<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.860> same<00:01:23.159> set<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.460> cubes<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.450> make<00:01:24.600> a

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
if I use the same set of cubes to make a

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.350 
if I use the same set of cubes to make a
subtraction<00:01:25.170> fact<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:26.040> would<00:01:26.490> start<00:01:26.790> with<00:01:26.909> my<00:01:26.970> 9

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
subtraction fact I would start with my 9

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.469 
subtraction fact I would start with my 9
first<00:01:28.310> because<00:01:29.310> that's<00:01:29.520> my<00:01:29.759> biggest<00:01:30.000> number

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
first because that's my biggest number

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.080 
first because that's my biggest number
if<00:01:31.250> I<00:01:32.250> took<00:01:32.310> away<00:01:32.670> three<00:01:33.509> cubes<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.490> would<00:01:35.490> write

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
if I took away three cubes I would write

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.469 
if I took away three cubes I would write
minus<00:01:36.720> three<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:38.340> would<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.640> six<00:01:39.030> cubes

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
minus three and I would have six cubes

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.600 
minus three and I would have six cubes
remaining<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.259> represent<00:01:40.799> my<00:01:40.920> six<00:01:41.280> purple

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
remaining to represent my six purple

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.139 
remaining to represent my six purple
cubes<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.210> are<00:01:42.329> still<00:01:42.659> there<00:01:43.549> now<00:01:44.549> let's<00:01:44.850> see

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
cubes that are still there now let's see

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.719 
cubes that are still there now let's see
if<00:01:45.360> we<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.780> use<00:01:46.110> those<00:01:46.380> same<00:01:46.770> cubes<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.579> come

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
if we can use those same cubes to come

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.010 
if we can use those same cubes to come
up<00:01:47.850> with<00:01:48.030> another<00:01:48.509> subtraction<00:01:49.470> fact<00:01:50.869> so<00:01:51.869> we

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
up with another subtraction fact so we

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.620 
up with another subtraction fact so we
already<00:01:52.350> took<00:01:52.500> away<00:01:52.770> three<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:53.970> time<00:01:54.360> I'm

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
already took away three so this time I'm

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.350 
already took away three so this time I'm
going<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.079> take<00:01:55.290> away<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.829> six<00:01:56.189> purple<00:01:56.759> cubes

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
going to take away the six purple cubes

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.870 
going to take away the six purple cubes
so<00:01:58.020> my<00:01:58.200> subtraction<00:01:58.469> sentence<00:01:59.280> would<00:01:59.490> start

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
so my subtraction sentence would start

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.399 
so my subtraction sentence would start
with<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.210> nine<00:02:00.420> because<00:02:00.810> that's<00:02:01.020> how<00:02:01.229> many

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
with the nine because that's how many

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.859 
with the nine because that's how many
total<00:02:01.680> cubes<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.399> have<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.000> it's<00:02:03.390> also<00:02:03.600> my

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
total cubes I have and it's also my

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.800 
total cubes I have and it's also my
biggest<00:02:04.110> number<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.890> would<00:02:05.430> subtract<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.479> six

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
biggest number I would subtract the six

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.139 
biggest number I would subtract the six
because<00:02:07.770> those<00:02:08.069> are<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.340> purple<00:02:08.670> cubes<00:02:08.940> I'm

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
because those are the purple cubes I'm

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.020 
because those are the purple cubes I'm
taking<00:02:09.660> away<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.200> my<00:02:11.129> answer<00:02:11.550> would<00:02:11.849> be<00:02:11.910> the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
taking away and my answer would be the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.820 
taking away and my answer would be the
three<00:02:12.480> because<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.379> time

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
three because that time

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.820 
three because that time
yellow<00:02:14.370> cubes<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.940> have<00:02:15.240> left<00:02:15.570> these<00:02:16.560> would<00:02:16.710> be

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
yellow cubes I have left these would be

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.160 
yellow cubes I have left these would be
the<00:02:16.860> two<00:02:17.090> subtraction<00:02:18.090> sentences<00:02:18.720> that

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
the two subtraction sentences that

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.610 
the two subtraction sentences that
represent<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:20.220> set<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.700> cubes<00:02:21.090> now<00:02:21.620> let's

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
represent that set of cubes now let's

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.620 
represent that set of cubes now let's
take<00:02:22.800> a<00:02:22.830> look<00:02:23.070> at<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.400> four<00:02:23.730> facts<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.450> we

wrote about that set of cubes you see

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.600 
wrote about that set of cubes you see
that<00:02:27.270> there's<00:02:27.480> two<00:02:27.570> addition<00:02:28.470> facts<00:02:28.740> and<00:02:29.070> two

the<00:03:00.390> way<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:00.570> remember<00:03:00.810> fact<00:03:01.530> families<00:03:01.830> is<00:03:02.280> the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
the way I remember fact families is the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.030 
the way I remember fact families is the
numbers<00:03:03.270> stick<00:03:03.660> together<00:03:03.840> just<00:03:04.650> like<00:03:04.770> the

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
numbers stick together just like the

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.880 
numbers stick together just like the
people<00:03:05.190> in<00:03:05.490> your<00:03:05.640> family<00:03:05.700> sick<00:03:06.450> together<00:03:06.890> nine
