this<00:00:07.830> is<00:00:07.950> gonna<00:00:08.099> vary<00:00:08.400> aircraft<00:00:08.970> by<00:00:09.150> aircraft

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
this is gonna vary aircraft by aircraft

here<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.900> course<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.320> pmdg<00:00:10.830> 737<00:00:11.389> in<00:00:12.389> GX<00:00:13.639> which

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
here of course the pmdg 737 in GX which

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.890 
here of course the pmdg 737 in GX which
is<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:15.350> approximation<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.980> 737<00:00:17.760> NGS<00:00:18.539> out

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
is a approximation of the 737 NGS out

so<00:02:21.120> again<00:02:22.299> click-click<00:02:22.900> click-click

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
so again click-click click-click

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.789 
so again click-click click-click
just<00:02:24.250> remember<00:02:24.670> on<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.239> yoke<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.780> on<00:02:26.650> the

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
just remember on the yoke and on the

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.740 
just remember on the yoke and on the
throttle<00:02:27.220> again<00:02:27.670> all<00:02:27.970> depends<00:02:28.629> on<00:02:28.690> the

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
throttle again all depends on the

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.180 
throttle again all depends on the
aircraft<00:02:29.110> type<00:02:29.319> it's<00:02:29.620> gonna<00:02:29.739> be<00:02:29.890> similar

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
aircraft type it's gonna be similar

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.680 
aircraft type it's gonna be similar
across<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.640> Boeing<00:02:30.910> fleet<00:02:31.150> not<00:02:31.450> very

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
across the Boeing fleet not very

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.509 
across the Boeing fleet not very
particularly<00:02:32.650> knowledgeable<00:02:32.830> about<00:02:33.220> air

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
particularly knowledgeable about air

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.940 
particularly knowledgeable about air
buses<00:02:33.879> so<00:02:34.150> you<00:02:34.780> guys<00:02:34.930> can<00:02:35.170> figure<00:02:35.349> that<00:02:35.500> out<00:02:35.680> on

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
buses so you guys can figure that out on

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.280 
buses so you guys can figure that out on
your<00:02:36.580> own<00:02:36.640> now<00:02:37.510> for<00:02:37.750> those<00:02:37.870> of<00:02:37.989> you<00:02:38.080> who<00:02:38.170> want

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
your own now for those of you who want

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.860 
your own now for those of you who want
to<00:02:38.349> take<00:02:38.500> this<00:02:38.620> a<00:02:38.680> step<00:02:38.769> further<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.750> set<00:02:40.750> up

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
to take this a step further and set up

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.140 
to take this a step further and set up
these<00:02:41.110> commands<00:02:41.739> on<00:02:41.890> your<00:02:42.220> actual<00:02:42.610> hardware

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
these commands on your actual hardware

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.580 
these commands on your actual hardware
because<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.810> last<00:02:44.019> thing<00:02:44.200> you<00:02:44.260> want<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:44.500> be

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
because the last thing you want to be

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.490 
because the last thing you want to be
doing<00:02:44.799> is<00:02:45.099> you<00:02:45.400> know<00:02:45.430> cruising<00:02:45.940> down<00:02:46.500> along

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
doing is you know cruising down along

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.080 
doing is you know cruising down along
your<00:02:47.530> final<00:02:48.010> approach<00:02:48.280> course<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.819> then<00:02:48.910> have

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
your final approach course and then have

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.259 
your final approach course and then have
to<00:02:49.120> pan<00:02:50.019> down<00:02:50.349> click<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.340> then<00:02:51.730> click<00:02:52.060> and

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
to pan down click and then click and

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.960 
to pan down click and then click and
then<00:02:53.019> pan<00:02:53.290> back<00:02:53.530> up<00:02:53.769> or<00:02:54.010> for<00:02:54.190> those<00:02:54.310> some

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
then pan back up or for those some

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.300 
then pan back up or for those some
people<00:02:55.269> love<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.690> zoom<00:02:56.590> out<00:02:56.769> something

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
people love to zoom out something

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.130 
people love to zoom out something
ridiculous<00:02:57.819> like<00:02:57.879> this<00:02:58.239> yeah<00:02:58.569> of<00:02:58.660> course<00:02:58.930> they

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
ridiculous like this yeah of course they

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.860 
ridiculous like this yeah of course they
could<00:02:59.290> click<00:02:59.500> things<00:02:59.769> but<00:03:00.329> it's<00:03:01.329> probably<00:03:01.840> a

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
could click things but it's probably a

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.259 
could click things but it's probably a
lot<00:03:02.109> easier<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:03.010> set<00:03:03.519> these<00:03:03.640> up<00:03:03.849> via<00:03:04.030> key

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
lot easier to set these up via key

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.520 
lot easier to set these up via key
commands<00:03:04.840> off<00:03:05.680> of<00:03:06.160> your<00:03:06.640> yoke<00:03:06.940> or<00:03:07.840> Hardware<00:03:08.379> of

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
commands off of your yoke or Hardware of

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.460 
commands off of your yoke or Hardware of
some<00:03:08.709> sort<00:03:09.150> so<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.930> first<00:03:11.170> thing<00:03:11.349> you're

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
some sort so the first thing you're

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.629 
some sort so the first thing you're
gonna<00:03:11.560> want<00:03:11.799> to<00:03:11.889> do<00:03:12.160> is<00:03:12.430> go<00:03:13.030> into<00:03:13.299> the<00:03:14.639> menu

you're<00:03:34.810> gonna<00:03:34.900> have<00:03:35.049> to<00:03:35.169> set<00:03:35.349> this<00:03:35.470> to

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
you're gonna have to set this to

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.620 
you're gonna have to set this to

whatever you want shift control 1 to
disengage<00:03:38.079> the<00:03:38.109> autopilot<00:03:38.410> so<00:03:38.859> I<00:03:38.889> could<00:03:39.099> also

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
disengage the autopilot so I could also

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.449 
disengage the autopilot so I could also
just<00:03:40.540> go<00:03:40.630> down<00:03:40.989> onto<00:03:41.349> my<00:03:41.590> keyboard<00:03:42.040> shift

just go down onto my keyboard shift

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.349 
just go down onto my keyboard shift
control<00:03:43.299> 1<00:03:44.459> press<00:03:45.459> it<00:03:45.609> again<00:03:45.819> to<00:03:45.849> silence<00:03:46.269> the
