00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello welcome to a new one 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.390
 video and a new project from me 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.980
 It should be in the next few months 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.590
 one wants to turn to fashion and indeed wants 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.550
 I'll give you some styling tips and tricks 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.630
 and also the latest trends 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.820
 present 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.190
 The first video should be the kick on 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.930
 you share with the ten most important ones 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.539
 everyone should have in the wardrobe 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.710
 have fun 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.539
 We start with a simple 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.240
 cut blouse naturally without 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.580
 pattern and above fits a part of that 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.510
 I have proven since 1870 and that is 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.189
 the trenchcoat 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.100
 Here you pay attention to the best 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.170
 perfect fit in the waist and one 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.820
 beautiful shoulder line because only that makes 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.820
 a perfect hourglass figure 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.600
 Everyone must have the perfect white t-shirt 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.670
 find for yourself 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.590
 but I recommend the Assembly at 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.050
 hip height and not too deep 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.090
 v-section as you can see I am 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.560
 himself still undecided and always 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.080
 Still looking for the perfect 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:03.090
 for me biker jacket stand collar or 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.379
 a classic cut a leather jacket 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.960
 can be in every season 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.210
 combine classic black stays 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.950
 always in trend and cream and beige fits 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.950
 especially to or suede 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.290
 black boot are an absolute must 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.270
 have 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.500
 but you should really only one here 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.300
 have priority and that is comfort that 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.400
 most important accessory is a big one 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.140
 pocket a so-called xl beck in the 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.140
 really can stow everything 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.380
 as high heels one calls first 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.120
 shoes from a heel height of 10 cm 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.380
 But you should not do that too seriously 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.630
 you need a nice one 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.650
 comfortable shoes stretches and the best 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.390
 a neutral color has the most famous 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.430
 all clothes is probably the small one 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.160
 black also little black dress or 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.530
 lpg called there may be this dress 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.320
 since 1920 but fortunately there are 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:04.539
 so many variations of that today 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:07.660
 everyone finds the right one and another one 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.429
 part with tradition the jeans i put 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.520
 here on a very dark wash because 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.200
 This is particularly advantageous 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.820

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.630
 personal favorit the statement chain 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:29.850
 because without them I would not be me 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.050

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.390
