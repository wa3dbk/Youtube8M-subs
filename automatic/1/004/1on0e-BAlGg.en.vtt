00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:19.000

 Honestly, I 'll show you a product that I can play today . 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:36.640
 Hey Gigabyte's new release from Silver 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:43.120
 It can be seen as a control product if I've gigabytes previously Oh Ghost 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:48.340
 Sez and then that abr that series, I'm telling you what to do 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:51.969
 Among the series, now the mid-range line is now the Force series 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:56.410
 If you want 5-Force series in Korea 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:01:01.589
 Yes, because I do not know as yet managed to get the product at low tide it is felt 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.589
 I showed you how much this product is, 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:12.550
 It's still a secret. Uh, yeah. 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.900
 Oh, excuse me uh uh haejusimyeon lawmakers who either can eat well 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.640
 Thank you 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.640
 He was strangely out of his way. 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:25.600
 If I look at the coffee, I will not have a voice. 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:28.840
 Here's come from the camp, I take a look at the amount features bogeonde 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.900
 I'll ask you all the way. 4 Just wait a little while. 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:36.040
 I have a mouse mode in 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:42.130
 The mouse is so independent of the system that the coating is now laid 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:46.990
 Now a little bit in the hands that the non-slip lipid is fixed 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:51.759
 The top plate and side support are almost similar, 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.660
 Uh high rattling up feeling that a little soft, a little further seating 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.640
 As much as 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:01.570
 There are two side curves that give the feel of that inner touch 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:05.710
 Having dual curves in both is now 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:08.979
 The options are so one, so here they are now cut into oblique lines. 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:13.540
 There's a broken part and a life that goes inside . 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:18.489
 So, if you have a big hand, then you should have something like this 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:22.750
 Finger and I can get into the inside as well as all the various 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:26.440
 It was enough so you can get going now served Configuration 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.920
 But now if you like palm grip is now a little bit compared to other parts of the plate products 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:35.739
 Because it is composed low, it seems to be a little difficult. 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.570
 Of course, the huge jakeusin minute hands with me or what I really u hands 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.799
 Those who speak 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.900
 Such people are'll grab a sheet metal part 2, but in this class that geurigu 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:47.769
 It's configured to receive . 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:52.390
 When you look at the top as a whole , 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:54.790
 I would suggest that you will probably show up in the corporate template 8000 x model 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:59.350
 There dpi there 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:03.130
 Such as the change to write one configuration to allow a knife back and forth 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:07.030
 There is an additional configuration to the back and forth so that the more 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:11.680
 dpi is possible to change the Hue and you now had its back tpi Profile 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.820
 Mark the LED so you know which dpf port you are using . 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.459
 He came . 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.450
 uh 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:21.780
 Once you have a theme on the side of the function key buttons, 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:25.620
 If you forget the part, Joe Gita is a little wider than the product. 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:30.689
 If Clyde does these things , it's a little bit of a good circle 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.680
 Glide going to be produced so that the hard part, but also the applied stage 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:36.780
 Configuration 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:40.709
 If that fits to guess the number of air along the material last longer 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:46.370
 When I saw this on my own, now 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:52.169
 I'm great now that the talk was going on inside that is a part mwogo 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:55.230
 You know this poetry is a poet, and the lacquer is two thousand 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:58.829
 Equipped with a sensor 500 such that the mouse 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:02.730
 2 mouse attached to the cleaning features that are featured in the support 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:07.319
 Why do not you look inside the memory now that the memory address chip is not qualified 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:10.530
 However, this part is supported, but the current mouse mouse can write functions 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:15.900
 There is a button in front of which you can write comfortably in Explorer 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:19.259
 Now the sensor part is now accurate because that part is now 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.889
 You're using a high-end mouse, but the Arbor 9500 sensor laser 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:26.729
 The center has not been installed, 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:29.940
 It's crazy. The real thing is that I did not say this. 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:34.979
 I think this will start the mouse . 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:40.470
 How about 29,000 won or so in this town after just what is the official amount yet 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:46.020
 No, because you still know the summer of Danawa, 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:47.159
 There are also plans to now I've km from Suzhou to 30,000 won him the night 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.479
 It is called a product 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:55.050
 I hope you enjoy this product because it is high 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:05:00.659
 In addition to the high end, the mouse that makes up the sensor 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:04.530
 The fact that it does not exceed 30,000 won is high sensitivity to many users. 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:07.979
 I can give you more options to feel. 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:13.620
 That's why it's always welcome. 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:14.699
 What higher than the high-quality products only, or the amount of functional mouse itself ever 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.500
 Function 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:23.219
 You can see that such a product of faithfulness is rather missing . 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.860
 Here then today is like a movie where I'll party tonight Inside 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:30.389
 So that you can look at it more conveniently 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:33.659
 Maybe a new page will be dropped in the eighth page of the championship. 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:37.199
 Now the future more convenient for the mouse for that part to you 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:41.180
 It 's a page that 's easy to understand. 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:41.180
 I hope you will not miss it. Thank you.
