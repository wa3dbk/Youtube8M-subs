it's<00:01:31.539> pretty<00:01:31.720> cool<00:01:31.899> but<00:01:32.170> looks<00:01:32.349> like<00:01:32.410> a<00:01:32.500> dirt

00:01:32.699 --> 00:01:32.709 
it's pretty cool but looks like a dirt

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:35.520 
it's pretty cool but looks like a dirt
bike<00:01:32.890> and<00:01:33.399> duro<00:01:33.759> can<00:01:34.179> go<00:01:34.300> off-road<00:01:34.720> or<00:01:35.050> on-road

bike and duro can go off-road or on-road

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.919 
bike and duro can go off-road or on-road
so<00:01:35.860> you<00:01:35.920> can<00:01:36.130> take<00:01:36.340> it<00:01:36.520> it's<00:01:36.910> legal<00:01:37.390> to<00:01:37.720> drive

so you can take it it's legal to drive

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.080 
so you can take it it's legal to drive
on<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:38.229> streets<00:01:38.560> and<00:01:38.890> if<00:01:39.489> I<00:01:39.580> want<00:01:39.759> to<00:01:39.819> just<00:01:39.970> go

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
on the streets and if I want to just go

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.199 
on the streets and if I want to just go
off<00:01:40.239> path<00:01:40.569> I<00:01:40.869> can<00:01:41.140> do<00:01:41.289> that<00:01:41.470> as<00:01:41.619> well<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:43.030> then

00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:43.209 
off path I can do that as well and then

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:45.540 
off path I can do that as well and then
of<00:01:43.300> course<00:01:43.330> the<00:01:43.660> sport<00:01:43.959> bike<00:01:44.140> is<00:01:44.500> what<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:45.250> lot

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
of course the sport bike is what a lot

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.570 
of course the sport bike is what a lot
of<00:01:45.580> people<00:01:45.849> call<00:01:46.030> crotch<00:01:46.300> rockets<00:01:46.869> or<00:01:47.580> not

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
of people call crotch rockets or not

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.860 
of people call crotch rockets or not
that's<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.819> main<00:01:49.000> one<00:01:49.470> anyway

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
that's the main one anyway

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.020 
that's the main one anyway
so<00:01:52.870> I'm<00:01:52.930> thinking<00:01:53.290> maybe<00:01:53.320> the<00:01:53.650> sport

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
so I'm thinking maybe the sport

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.520 
so I'm thinking maybe the sport
supermoto

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
supermoto

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.430
