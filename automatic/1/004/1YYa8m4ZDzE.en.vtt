00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.630
 Nine deep trench shield a first video of Ströhl &amp; the Furious 

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:15.789
 So I have four times selected a small program for you 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:18.989
 came overclocked with the man 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.119
 the graphics card 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.239
 FK 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:23.419
 fishing 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.419
 I was on 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.069
 great idea 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:30.550
 very easy 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.940
 Newer 4 grams 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.950
 and 2 you can overclock your graphics card and I recommend you 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.940
 if you are not like that 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.239
 Years do not choose to overclock and so on 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.730
 not let the fingers of Ralph try it out though 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.350
 Mittermeier either so here you can set the Fed will be Dr 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.900
 Whistler and the graphics card 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.860
 that would definitely have to be higher, but 78 percent more 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.630
 and then around 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.430
 Minister the Core Clock Künzell actors in my ex club about 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.600
 same old no longer part of the hostages 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.990
 from Dr Peter how much that just increases 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.270
 a little higher and always possible with very small steps 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.549
 public toilets here over 60 8 night rest 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.010
 and then from Fulda now he would be distributed to four 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.090
 Prop Bets life 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.680
 under its still declared 100 the player may perceive when 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.630
 you in the starting eleven 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.070
 So we hold that Oliver van Bommel you can yours 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.730
 Sheaf body conscious overclocking 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.760
 if you do not have a good graphic card then you can 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.260
 Games that have a high requirement play a bit better 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.200
 and you become my warning too 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.130
 not so many Pathak because the video card can also burn through it so 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.480
 you keep the tension 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.940
 which is necessary so that more power Zollverein can for the video card 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.840
 Well, and if we did that 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.840
 Meaning something fluid run so 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.470
 Rüdiger Variety just does not make it easy though 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.369
 this threatens his feelings 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:17.299
 so I hope I could help you a little bit what the program is about 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.729
 really new so maybe that helped unfortunately so 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:21.850
 on 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.759
 yes, there was also a lecturer 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:27.599
 Percent so much we do actively so that Kontron also for their beer graphics card 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:28.399
 use 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:32.789
 here is the tool here is compatible for all graphics cards 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:35.269
 It should be definitely 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.609
 and around 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:41.259
 he does not forget Dr. five pages you should know "farmsteads 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:44.719
 under which a very small step is possible if Marko Kon 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:47.329
 There is free there are mistakes in everything 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.579
 that in the end what video of old but me milk so 

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:54.149
 I'm glad to record each one 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:56.379
 also makes further suggestion so me 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.469
 the forest area to use here so I'm doing elective 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.289
 like Rolf Schauder was
