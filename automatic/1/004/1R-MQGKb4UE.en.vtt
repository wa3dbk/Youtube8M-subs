so mathematically he's out and if

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.120 
so mathematically he's out and if
Villopoto<00:01:39.360> doesn't<00:01:39.810> show<00:01:39.930> up<00:01:39.960> it's<00:01:40.590> done<00:01:40.890> geez

now<00:01:41.790> let's<00:01:42.090> talk<00:01:42.270> about<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.780> Dungey<00:01:43.170> strategy

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
now let's talk about the Dungey strategy

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.960 
now let's talk about the Dungey strategy
now<00:01:43.799> he<00:01:43.860> no<00:01:44.070> longer<00:01:44.220> asked<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.610> win<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.790> races

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970

now he no longer asked to win the races
I'm<00:01:45.210> going<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.390> assume<00:01:45.570> he<00:01:45.780> might<00:01:45.930> even<00:01:46.079> adjust

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
I'm going to assume he might even adjust

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.990 
I'm going to assume he might even adjust
as<00:01:46.799> his<00:01:46.890> riding<00:01:47.220> schedule<00:01:47.579> during<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.880> week

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
as his riding schedule during the week

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.370 
as his riding schedule during the week

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
to maybe focus a little more on outdoors
