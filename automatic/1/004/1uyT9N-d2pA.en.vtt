00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.740 
there I don't look really cool but it'd
probably<00:02:04.580> take<00:02:04.790> a<00:02:04.910> little<00:02:05.120> bit<00:02:05.240> longer<00:02:05.390> so

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
probably take a little bit longer so

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:16.480 
probably take a little bit longer so
it's<00:02:05.869> okay

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.460 

here's<00:02:17.490> another<00:02:17.640> one<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.180> my<00:02:18.900> person<00:02:19.320> just

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
here's another one of my person just

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.940 
here's another one of my person just
standing<00:02:19.800> still<00:02:20.100> with<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.490> sword<00:02:21.740> it<00:02:22.740> looks

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
standing still with the sword it looks

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.740 
standing still with the sword it looks
great<00:02:23.250> against<00:02:23.610> all<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.850> trees<00:02:24.120> in<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.540> grass

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
great against all the trees in the grass

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.720 
great against all the trees in the grass
I'm<00:02:25.020> also<00:02:25.170> using<00:02:25.350> lush<00:02:25.740> trees<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.280> less<00:02:26.430> grass

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
I'm also using lush trees and less grass

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.040 
I'm also using lush trees and less grass
mod<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:29.030> I'm<00:02:30.030> about<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.330> show<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.750> side

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
mod and I'm about to show you the side

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.880 
mod and I'm about to show you the side
by<00:02:31.260> side<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:32.460> two<00:02:32.610> swords<00:02:33.350> I<00:02:34.350> think

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
by side of the two swords I think

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.980 
by side of the two swords I think
they're<00:02:35.040> about<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.370> same<00:02:35.720> weight<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:36.840> for

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
they're about the same weight and for

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.720 
they're about the same weight and for
them<00:02:37.110> I<00:02:37.290> think<00:02:37.770> they're<00:02:38.100> about<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.430> same<00:02:38.670> size

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
them I think they're about the same size

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.370 
them I think they're about the same size
when<00:02:39.300> they're<00:02:39.450> lined<00:02:39.660> up<00:02:39.900> what<00:02:40.080> shouldn't<00:02:40.320> be

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
when they're lined up what shouldn't be

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.720 
when they're lined up what shouldn't be
right<00:02:40.620> because<00:02:40.980> one<00:02:41.160> should<00:02:41.280> be<00:02:41.370> longer<00:02:41.550> than

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
right because one should be longer than

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.640 
right because one should be longer than
the<00:02:41.880> other<00:02:41.910> which<00:02:42.870> could<00:02:43.050> be<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:43.170> thing<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.470> fix

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
the other which could be a thing to fix

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.460 
the other which could be a thing to fix
in<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:43.950> future<00:02:44.250> but<00:02:44.990> yeah<00:02:45.990> other<00:02:46.320> than<00:02:46.380> that

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
in the future but yeah other than that

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.220 
in the future but yeah other than that
it's<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.160> great<00:02:48.030> mod<00:02:48.240> swords<00:02:48.840> look<00:02:48.990> really
