00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.330
 easy 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.130
 this year and martians were very whole 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.029
 quickly through the inspection everything is right 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.980
 everything good for each other 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.029
 so yes that is because preparation 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.980
 that you are prepared with a little 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.720
 all have before that time 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.189
 so only preparation yes but the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.360
 mean they have the car once 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.680
 maybe seen or seen things 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.730
 you will have a lot of new ones 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.960
 things on the car 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.070
 no that's right indeed have a lot 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.980
 new things but we actually have 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.270
 to make the aso the roofs organization 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.219
 the already at the construction of the vehicle 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.050
 involved so that you know exactly what is 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.149
 may and may not and then it is here 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.170
 does not mean as much as 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.210
 you look at the car you have 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.530
 rear wheel steering is unique 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.449
 see you here at the inspection to 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.300
 people all turn around and look around 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.530
 yes but also a bivouac in all 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.690
 Competitors are already know you and look 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.629
 yes that runs and everyone looks at it 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.489
 This means a good start 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.350
 of the day there 2014 for you 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.810
 yes that certainly starts well yes if everything 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.260
 for each other there is and gives peace and that 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.260
 is good feeling 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.290
 technical inspection small problem 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.390
 area now small indeed small 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.250
 a little something a thread pair 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.860
 laying wires it is nothing you have nothing 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.480
 It's that important that you yourself too 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.040
 know that the car is good 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.750
 yes but I know anyway have a 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.310
 but how well you prepared him 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.420
 can always have stupid things 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.610
 performance 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.910
 electronics and software and computers that 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.620
 can also have a yes small I have 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.570
 but generally think so 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.650
 I that it all looks good 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.370
 You should now themselves remain in the car 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.479
 are required yes if you want sand there 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.890
 you already know if you are insured during the inspection 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.110
 have it everywhere now well then your hand 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.030
 system your shoes your socks and so 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.830
 for the clothes but sometimes things are 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.380
 who knows the rider and applicator or the 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.420
 Visually there must always faster 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.070
 when finished, the car parc 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.290
 fermÃ© so that is 20 minutes here 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.930
 further on and then we go to the hotel 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.700
 and so chill for a while and 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.030
 yes tomorrow then i believe and has 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.709
 what serious ceremonial happen and then 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.420
 slowly but surely start to like 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.260
 so don't get it a bit too 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.110
 tickle me 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.989
 yes absolutely you actually prefer to see 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.110
 algae seems to be the hand contribution of 543 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.910
 and then pick up in then go and then yes 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.130
 we have not tested any meters 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.650
 the pre-prologue that was those two laps 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.860
 so in 50 seconds I believe everything 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:38.000
 we just go quietly in the rally 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.650
 zippers and then yes with a rally like that 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.180
 you just have to wait for this to come 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.130
 she and not trying to force it 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.549
 at least that's how I see it 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.549
 we are going to look 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.990
 Willem 2 da Team Manager Jan is just running 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.240
 the garage from what a you what from you 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.310
 shoulders or now what 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.990
 the same tension by really doing everything for you 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.030
 find each other or something that you just like 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.340
 can not solve, there is correct time 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.870
 and you do not want that you want rich of tight 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.940
 from each other we have done our best from 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.780
 in advance and all safety stuff 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.820
 What you need 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.050
 we eagerly thought about where i am 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.860
 you just say you still have to go 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.480
 explain something 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.040
 yes there is someone you see this and 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.060
 then they see rocket for the first 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.830
 grade 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.990
 you order a package get complete 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.700
 from ho and then your husband has to explain 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.930
 that you get it so complete and then it is 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.220
 good again 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.380
 and he thinks that you already have three 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.640
 have you more we get that 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.310
 and that and then it's so good 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.240
 it's french by french it's a scary him 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.610
 car itself 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.680
 Jan have now seen agreement and for this 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.450
 everything went well yes yes actually 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.100
 technically we don't have the self what 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.230
 smaller is a thread for that for 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.790
 wanderer against that failure but that is down 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.270
 I have understood the 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.630
 technical jobs so we can of set 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.630
 would say 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.190
 not
