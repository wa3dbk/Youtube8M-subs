up as you can see they're doing that I

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.220 
up as you can see they're doing that I
think<00:00:26.699> because<00:00:27.150> I'm<00:00:27.390> watching<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.810> game<00:00:27.990> and

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
think because I'm watching a game and

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.439 
think because I'm watching a game and
their<00:00:28.320> snow<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.680> going<00:00:28.920> on<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.580> think<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.300> can

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
their snow is going on so think you can

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.910 
their snow is going on so think you can
change<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.960> sequence<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.439> how<00:00:31.590> they<00:00:31.710> light<00:00:31.890> up

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
change the sequence of how they light up

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.110 
change the sequence of how they light up
or<00:00:32.219> something<00:00:32.579> but<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:33.450> seems<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.840> little<00:00:33.899> crazy

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
or something but it seems a little crazy

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.670 
or something but it seems a little crazy
they've<00:00:36.120> got<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.329> little<00:00:36.660> dota<00:00:36.989> logo<00:00:37.500> right
