00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:08.640
 and let's go forward 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:17.869
 I followed a beat and I think 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.960
 which is the fifth training in 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.300
 skates if memory does not fail me more the 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.750
 another one that we did with the slide word is and 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.570
 I think last week you saw 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.670
 one is a pretty strong progression 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.910
 with respect to the first days as you 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.910
 like 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:41.150
 but good that that to see to me it animates to me 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.210
 but I know I still have a lot if 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.760
 I need a lot of time for that and what 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:55.239
 I sleep and I dream uncle with this because 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:57.439
 I do not think it was what we need is 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.699
 skate domain skate domain 

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:01.159
 davinia for free 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.869
 and I give a lot of thought to the 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.180
 communication formulas 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:07.100
 we have to try many systems to 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.600
 see which ones are not 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.840
 maybe it does not have to be one 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.820
 but which are the most suitable for 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.969
 apply at certain times not of 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.469
 the seriousness the best we do not have to 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:19.689
 articulate just one system for everything to 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:22.090
 all at all times but several in 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:24.880
 function of the difficulty of the orography 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.039
 of terrain or fatigue 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.740
 that is another other fear that I have 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.630
 when you are accumulating fatigue 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.030
 logically the reflections are not the 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.310
 themselves and in the response capacity 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.979
 neither cooling the legs and there is the 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.579
 male we will go looking for we will look for a 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:47.099
 method to synchronize us and such I see 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.099
 is that you already have the race and in mind 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:53.860
 let's focus on mastering well the 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:02:00.000
 skates in which you get tired less and less 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.000
 he is on top of them I can not reach 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.490
 your life 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.320
 and we raise left knee 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.200
 you have to have a lot of time balance to 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:26.200
 do that there will be no good either 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:41.640
 and that's it 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.570
 with the heart 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:59.170
 well today is the day that I have most 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.180
 held on on roller skates 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.989
 and that the day I least tired 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.510
 also I suppose it is for the time 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.670
 and by training we are testing 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.500
 communication systems today we have 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.660
 tried to tell it, I am like that, 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.760
 I always speak is that you speak very well 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.010
 when our side several things good 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.450
 first we saw that it was very good 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.310
 with the sound what I do not know is that the 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.690
 clear sound is already processing the 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.130
 which now well the movements that 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.290
 have to do with the skates towards 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.450
 where we will attend to sound what 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.769
 I know there are several things and what happens 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.330
 so what do we think we're going to do 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.330
 thing at a time therefore 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:41.569
 We process in series, not in parallel, the 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:45.170
 women in parallel and then what happens 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:47.420
 Well, the old woman says in an equal system 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.790
 that we have a contact but not 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.799
 we're stuck and if we're going to try 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.209
 the strings all speak the strings 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.209
 things we have tried in various ways 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.930
 the rope comes from the same point inside 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.540
 of the palms and hearts brings the 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.129
 famous and the other that comes out of two 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.810
 points of care of the two 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:08.000
 sides is also that the two sides 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.370
 is a little more imagination if 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.290
 it gets better better then some 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.790
 way the two systems are valid and they 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.609
 try to implement both and of 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.549
 use them according to each moment 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.289
 from use mos reconciles may in 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.789
 some moments sound systems 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:26.050
 especially the same for curves that 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:26.050
 do uphill or whatever 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:38.210
 for long straight lines themes 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:38.210
 we take the reference 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.790
 if we were all the time with the system 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.920
 voice demands a lot more effort from me 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.450
 concentration and of course I have to process 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.100
 everything that tells me all the sound that 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.220
 me is coming at all times plus 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.390
 exercise of the feet and the other 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.460
 way 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.500
 it's easier because because in everything 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.270
 moment and there is a contact even if it is not 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.130
 physical but yes that the strings are 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.600
 giving an information of what there is that 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.320
 do at all times in terms of curves 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.360
 etc 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.450
 that requires less effort from me 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.040
 mental concentration to be 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.530
 Pending the two things and there I can 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.580
 be more focused then on what is the 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.920
 skating 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.450
 purely said but I insist we are going to 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.480
 use the two systems that I believe 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.160
 they are very good both also good 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.290
 I have not told josu that if this year 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.910
 I am able to finish this one that 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.569
 it may not be the only time 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.990
 make 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:36.629
 the pamplona bridge and that possibly 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:40.289
 let's consider other things to do 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:42.539
 some other routes that you have done 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:44.569
 you who want to run a race 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:47.580
 directly 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:49.699
 it's more complicated running if I beat you 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.990
 but not easy but we can 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:54.089
 Now Pamplona Bridge is our 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.889
 goal right now that we have there in 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:58.530
 the focus 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:00.120
 but good as we see that you are not 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.759
 liking but like having a lot of 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.110
 face of happiness that you notice because 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:07.529
 I also imagine that there will be enough 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:09.360
 races in Spain of skates and we have 

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:12.650
 also for example loads like 24 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.650
 hours of le mans or what can be 

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:22.319
 To have ink, I'm going to take the 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:25.199
 provisioning is a sport 

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:27.479
 wonderful I have to recognize it and I 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:29.819
 we are not leaving I had no idea but 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:31.590
 I also think I said it I do not know if any 

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:33.180
 day I said it is from all 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.250
 sports that I practiced is the most 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.740
 hard is proving to me at least 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:40.590
 start then we'll see later I 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.750
 is more difficult than the bike or that 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:45.169
 run and harder physically even 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.169
 so many 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.889
 we will see that step 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:54.529
 efe 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:56.780
 it is more than a duty that is our life 

00:06:54.529 --> 00:07:00.160
 do not 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.160
 a house
