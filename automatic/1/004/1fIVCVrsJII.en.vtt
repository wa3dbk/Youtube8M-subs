00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.009
 there is a mountain a mountain like 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.840
 misshapen and good I think to find 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.420

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.549
 place that today in the mountains here where 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:04.130
 are these these clouds the truth that 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.630
 it's so super cool this village I 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.459
 I had never seen a village like that before 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.060
 up a mountain see these crops 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:13.670
 and those villagers build very well 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.709
 and well this village is not bad 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.430
 although he does not have a blacksmith's house that is 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.890
 something bad but in any case it is very 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.440
 well how do they see and apart below as well as 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.620

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.470
 little houses here there are some little houses that 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.640
 and being able to meet you I do not know 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.240
 make them bigger 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.000
 here we go down and 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.830
 we got off here there are more houses have their 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.870
 church here to see that they 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.140
 he raided then they will also grow a 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.720
 little bit here the truth is it is not 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.120
 small but they do not have blacksmith's house 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.460
 damn blacksmith dentists 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.330
 but he has his normal purpose and 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:59.230
 a chicken bathing x of that chicken and 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.240
 well here is the first appointment of 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.030
 this video and well let's go with the 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.700
 next that is this that is hills 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.010
 extreme n good vanilla no no I put 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.140
 because it was not thought to put and good 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.760
 I was if I chose him because he is one of the 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.100
 new ones that they added in this 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.150
 update and that's why I chose 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.150
 let's mark the unknown background 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.680
 here it is and good this as they see 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.250
 we're just going to turn right and 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.110
 is going to start this language has many 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.510
 more things more biomes than if they want 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.970
 I did a full review say 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.460
 in the comments and I do it by testing 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.500
 what matters is this this new language 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.740
 They added that it looks pretty good the 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.500
 combination of this earth edge of 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:49.050
 parties since they understand and the gravel is 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:52.290
 sees very well it looks like well 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.480
 how it looks and well this is too much 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.870
 really extensive that is fine for 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.330
 go here then exploring a little bit and 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.180
 well here we go walking it looks very 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.780
 well and something that I liked that was for 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.390
 here do not know if I find this these 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.230
 gentlemen this little thing that at night looks 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.420
 super cool this thing that is like 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:18.390
 is this mini cave with this trickle 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.850
 of water this torch I put it because 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.040
 to see if there was something else but there was no 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.610
 nothing there was this trickle of water the 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.550
 truth that is very very father is this 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.470
 charcoal language there are several little things 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.720
 you explore it since I already told you 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.630
 If you want a complete review, say 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.330
 the comments if I will do it and good 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.420
 let's move on with the third and last 7 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.850
 this video that is birch forest 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.340
 it is also a biome of the new ones that 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.020
 they added that's why I also put it 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.410
 in this mole 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.629
 rather of three of the best if it is 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.940
 I really like this language is like 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:59.099
 a normal forest but of pure trees 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.430
 of birch which is one of the new 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:04.259
 biomes that added and well let's 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.569

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:09.090

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.199
 right here we are going to look 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:18.539
 right in the middle do not have to 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:22.259
 look for it here we will appear and only 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:25.169
 to see it, it is only necessary to turn and 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:28.169
 here everything appears as we see here is 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:31.040
 the whole biome as you see is very also 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:34.910
 very very long and 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.830
 Of course there is no missing the poor flying bucket 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.720
 as a flyer this host that I thought 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:42.350
