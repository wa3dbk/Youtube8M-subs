through a new bit of kit I've got which
is<00:00:05.790> a<00:00:06.000> midi<00:00:06.690> controller<00:00:07.280> this<00:00:08.280> one's<00:00:08.550> called

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
is a midi controller this one's called

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.190 
is a midi controller this one's called
the<00:00:09.030> novation<00:00:09.780> Nocturne<00:00:11.809> which<00:00:12.809> you<00:00:12.990> can<00:00:13.170> use

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
the novation Nocturne which you can use

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.560 
the novation Nocturne which you can use
in<00:00:13.830> conjunction<00:00:14.820> with<00:00:15.830> lightroom<00:00:16.830> 3<00:00:17.570> to

example<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:06.000> one<00:01:06.240> I've<00:01:06.869> got<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.409> first<00:01:07.619> one

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
example this one I've got the first one

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.890 
example this one I've got the first one
is<00:01:07.860> exposure<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:09.119> when<00:01:09.210> we<00:01:09.270> look<00:01:09.420> our<00:01:09.600> image

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
is exposure so when we look our image

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.280 
is exposure so when we look our image
Adele<00:01:10.590> may<00:01:10.799> expose<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.369> up<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.670> down<00:01:12.140> and<00:01:13.140> you

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
Adele may expose you up and down and you

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.749 
Adele may expose you up and down and you
can<00:01:13.409> see<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.979> can<00:01:14.970> just<00:01:15.509> very<00:01:16.140> quickly<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:17.610> good

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
can see I can just very quickly the good

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.130 
can see I can just very quickly the good
thing<00:01:17.790> here<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.330> can<00:01:18.570> actually<00:01:18.659> have<00:01:19.020> you

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
thing here is you can actually have you

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.780 
thing here is you can actually have you
know<00:01:19.350> hands<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.830> two<00:01:20.009> or<00:01:20.130> three<00:01:20.340> buttons<00:01:20.640> at

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
know hands on two or three buttons at

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.820 
know hands on two or three buttons at
the<00:01:20.820> same<00:01:20.880> time<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:23.630> adjust<00:01:24.830> simultaneously

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the same time and adjust simultaneously

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.240 
the same time and adjust simultaneously
different<00:01:26.640> things<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.470> look<00:01:29.009> at

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
different things so if I just look at

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.340 
different things so if I just look at
this<00:01:29.700> raw<00:01:30.000> file<00:01:30.329> for<00:01:30.540> example<00:01:30.900> if<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.079> want<00:01:31.259> to

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
this raw file for example if I want to

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.649 
this raw file for example if I want to
adjust<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.280> white<00:01:32.460> balance<00:01:32.520> I've<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.299> got

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
adjust the white balance I've just got

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.319 
adjust the white balance I've just got
this<00:01:33.689> programmed<00:01:34.490> for<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> main<00:01:35.820> slider<00:01:36.180> in

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
this programmed for the main slider in

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.640 
this programmed for the main slider in
the<00:01:36.390> middle<00:01:36.630> for<00:01:36.810> white<00:01:36.990> balance<00:01:37.320> gives<00:01:37.530> us

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
the middle for white balance gives us

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.319 
the middle for white balance gives us
one<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.040> first<00:01:38.280> things<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.549> change<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.090> as<00:01:39.210> I

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
one of the first things I change so as I

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.550 
one of the first things I change so as I
just<00:01:39.540> move<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.829> after<00:01:40.829> dry<00:01:41.240> you<00:01:42.240> will<00:01:42.360> see<00:01:42.659> my

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
just move that after dry you will see my

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.270 
just move that after dry you will see my
white<00:01:43.860> balance<00:01:44.250> changes<00:01:45.140> very<00:01:46.140> quickly<00:01:46.280> now

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
white balance changes very quickly now

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.030 
white balance changes very quickly now
normally<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.390> Lightroom<00:01:51.439> we<00:01:52.439> need<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.829> adjust

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
normally in Lightroom we need to adjust

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.730 
normally in Lightroom we need to adjust
white<00:01:53.610> balance<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.270> then<00:01:54.479> or<00:01:55.140> temperature

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
white balance and then or temperature

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.469 
white balance and then or temperature
core<00:01:56.040> temperature<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.520> then<00:01:56.640> tint<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.299> get

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
core temperature and then tint to get

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.530 
core temperature and then tint to get
the<00:01:57.600> correct<00:01:57.899> why<00:01:58.200> balance<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:59.399> here<00:01:59.729> I've<00:02:00.479> got

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
the correct why balance so here I've got

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.929 
the correct why balance so here I've got
my<00:02:00.810> tin<00:02:01.049> programmed<00:02:01.530> here<00:02:01.979> mywi<00:02:02.490> buns<00:02:02.700> here

my tin programmed here mywi buns here

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.940 
my tin programmed here mywi buns here
and<00:02:03.570> i<00:02:03.689> can<00:02:03.719> let<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.170> fiddle<00:02:04.649> around<00:02:04.710> with

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
and i can let you fiddle around with

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.210 
and i can let you fiddle around with
both<00:02:05.280> at<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.549> same<00:02:05.790> time<00:02:06.170> to<00:02:07.170> get<00:02:07.409> very

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
both at the same time to get very

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.580 
both at the same time to get very
quickly<00:02:08.610> get<00:02:09.390> accurate

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
quickly get accurate

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.649 
quickly get accurate
white<00:02:12.590> pants<00:02:12.800> so<00:02:13.550> I<00:02:13.580> find<00:02:13.849> it<00:02:13.940> very<00:02:14.000> very<00:02:14.360> cool

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:14.659
