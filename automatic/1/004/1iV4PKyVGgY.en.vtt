00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.110
 Hello everyone, today we will talk 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:12.580
 how to remove ads in google chrome 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.070
 for this we need to install 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.670
 a small plugin link to it is possible 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:23.050
 find in the description of the video plugin this 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:25.320
 free it installs quickly and 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.390
 easy to set up 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.989
 clicking on the link you will find yourself in 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.230
 google chrome plugin store further 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:38.650
 need to click free 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:45.460
 our add and wait for it to load 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:47.950
 plugin plugin loaded about this us 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.090
 Notify the page that now we have 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.090
 have adblock 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:01:00.420
 This page can be closed and now 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.420
 let's reload our google chrome 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.050
 so 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.360
 Download Now let's move on themselves 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:14.020
 plugin settings top right 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.180
 We press the palm now it is gray 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:21.400
 color since none of 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:25.690
 Internet resources we are not open so 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:30.100
 push the parameters and let's go over 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:33.340
 the main settings opens on 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.650
 fold common perhaps here I would have noted 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.580
 only the second item 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.619
 no problems with us and with 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:48.210
 possibility to enter not in certain 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:48.210
 channels go further in the list of filters 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.030
 Immediately I want to note that the plugin itself is already 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.860
 configured to work properly and therefore 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.590
 you can enter some snakes only in person 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:04.750
 for myself for my some demands a 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.200
 in this case here I would choose and there 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.509
 paragraph 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.970
 malware protection and 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:13.660
 last point departure from ecu valley 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:17.650
 preconceptions this block go on 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.560
 the setting tab here also becomes 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.630
 everything is intuitively admissible if we 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.380
 we want ads about displayed on 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:31.239
 any site just enter its address 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:33.070
 ships or vice versa below enter the address 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:37.180
 the site in which we do not want to see 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:39.220
 advertising and in all others we want now 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.209
 let's see how it looks like 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:48.380
 example for example go to the site let 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:51.550
 this will increase the block further 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:56.120
 go to any topic but by example 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:03:00.470
 network scan if we reverse 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:03.580
 focus on the right corner of the browser then we 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.600
 we will see that during our visit 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:10.520
 he has already blocked four ads 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.290
 so if we now look at our 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.140
 the page that opens we see that 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.390
 there is no advertisement on it only 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:22.880
 social button 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:23.960
 video picture but if we had this 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.650
 bath plug was 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.150
 or for example my turn off now and 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.940
 reload the page then we will see that 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:38.480
 present on page 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:49.160
 there is advertising here on the left side 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:52.100
 and in the text here it is so that if you 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.930
 advertising is very annoying I think that 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.540
 This tool will be very useful. 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.540
 for your work on the Internet
