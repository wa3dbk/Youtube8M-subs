to<00:01:15.700> our<00:01:15.880> studio<00:01:16.090> she<00:01:17.080> had<00:01:17.200> seen<00:01:17.440> some<00:01:17.710> of<00:01:17.800> the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
to our studio she had seen some of the

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.440 
to our studio she had seen some of the
possibilities<00:01:18.729> and<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:18.970> different<00:01:19.270> options

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
possibilities and the different options

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.359 
possibilities and the different options
available<00:01:19.810> with<00:01:20.289> these<00:01:20.440> decorative<00:01:20.740> concrete

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
available with these decorative concrete

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.760 
available with these decorative concrete
flooring<00:01:21.789> systems<00:01:22.209> and<00:01:22.420> she<00:01:22.899> chose<00:01:23.140> a<00:01:23.170> stamped

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
flooring systems and she chose a stamped

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.880 
flooring systems and she chose a stamped
overlay<00:01:24.220> and<00:01:24.369> so<00:01:24.520> basically<00:01:24.880> this<00:01:25.149> floor<00:01:25.479> is

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
overlay and so basically this floor is

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.889 
overlay and so basically this floor is
roughly<00:01:26.890> 3/4<00:01:27.550> of<00:01:27.580> an<00:01:27.789> inch<00:01:27.910> thick<00:01:28.030> and<00:01:28.599> what<00:01:28.750> we

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
roughly 3/4 of an inch thick and what we

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:30.779 
roughly 3/4 of an inch thick and what we
did<00:01:29.110> to<00:01:29.619> get<00:01:29.740> some<00:01:29.979> of<00:01:30.069> these<00:01:30.160> elements<00:01:30.399> we

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
did to get some of these elements we

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:32.460 
did to get some of these elements we
actually<00:01:31.090> use<00:01:31.239> pink<00:01:31.539> foam<00:01:31.810> three<00:01:32.110> quarters<00:01:32.380> of

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470
