flip<00:01:42.159> the<00:01:42.310> switch<00:01:42.550> and<00:01:42.729> it<00:01:42.880> generally<00:01:43.240> takes<00:01:43.479> 5

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
flip the switch and it generally takes 5

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.230 
flip the switch and it generally takes 5
seconds<00:01:44.679> for<00:01:44.890> it<00:01:45.009> to<00:01:45.130> fire<00:01:45.310> from<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.759> moment<00:01:46.149> I

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
hit the switch as you can see it's both

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:55.020 
hit the switch as you can see it's both
loud<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:49.539> fast<00:01:49.720> so<00:01:50.049> use<00:01:50.259> iron<00:01:50.649> ear<00:01:50.799> protection
