it<00:02:00.450> all<00:02:00.570> but<00:02:00.689> one<00:02:00.840> thing<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.079> was<00:02:01.200> like<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.500> know

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
it all but one thing I was like you know

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.050 
it all but one thing I was like you know
I<00:02:01.649> think<00:02:01.950> an<00:02:02.040> ipod<00:02:02.399> would<00:02:02.520> be<00:02:02.610> really<00:02:02.759> cool

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
I think an ipod would be really cool

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.179 
I think an ipod would be really cool
some<00:02:03.659> people<00:02:03.930> might<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.350> just<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.799> nano<00:02:05.040> or

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
some people might have just the nano or

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.410 
some people might have just the nano or
they<00:02:05.340> might<00:02:05.430> have<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.670> chef<00:02:05.880> or<00:02:06.090> they<00:02:06.180> may<00:02:06.329> be

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
they might have the chef or they may be

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.320 
they might have the chef or they may be
always<00:02:06.540> wearing<00:02:06.780> ipod<00:02:07.170> touch<00:02:07.910> so<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:08.940> thought

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
always wearing ipod touch so I thought

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.270 
always wearing ipod touch so I thought
it<00:02:09.420> would<00:02:09.509> be<00:02:09.569> really<00:02:09.720> cool<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:10.080> give<00:02:10.379> away<00:02:10.590> and

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
it would be really cool to give away and

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.760 
it would be really cool to give away and
16<00:02:11.640> gigabyte<00:02:12.030> ipod<00:02:12.270> touch<00:02:12.810> it's<00:02:13.080> white<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:13.410> if

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
16 gigabyte ipod touch it's white and if

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.500 
16 gigabyte ipod touch it's white and if
you<00:02:13.920> want<00:02:14.190> this<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.610> can<00:02:14.790> maybe<00:02:14.940> win<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.300> and

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
you want this you can maybe win it and

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.870 
you want this you can maybe win it and
last<00:02:16.110> but<00:02:16.319> certainly<00:02:16.470> not<00:02:17.040> least<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.700> guess

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
last but certainly not least is I guess

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.160 
last but certainly not least is I guess
you<00:02:18.030> could<00:02:18.150> call<00:02:18.300> it<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.569> grand<00:02:18.870> prize

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
you could call it the grand prize

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.900 
you could call it the grand prize
because<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.950> biggest<00:02:20.310> again

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
because it is the biggest again

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.580 
because it is the biggest again
something<00:02:21.300> I<00:02:21.569> wanted<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.959> be<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.080> little<00:02:22.380> bit

buy getting all this stuff and I saw

buy getting all this stuff and I saw
this<00:02:41.970> laptop<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.510> was<00:02:42.600> like<00:02:42.690> wow<00:02:42.870> how<00:02:43.170> cool

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.030 
would that be I know a lot of you
probably<00:02:44.910> only<00:02:45.300> have<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.570> family<00:02:46.080> computer<00:02:46.560> you

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
probably only have a family computer you

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.410 
probably only have a family computer you
know<00:02:47.130> just<00:02:47.220> one<00:02:47.400> computer<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.820> family<00:02:48.150> shares
