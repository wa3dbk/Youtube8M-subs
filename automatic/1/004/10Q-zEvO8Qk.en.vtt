00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
you can see that decimal sensor over

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.470 
you can see that decimal sensor over
here<00:00:51.840> but<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.620> sensor<00:00:52.980> does<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:54.239> goes

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
here but this sensor does is it goes

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.500 
here but this sensor does is it goes
inside<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.930> ear<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:56.149> okay<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.360> that

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
inside the ear like this okay and that

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.110 
inside the ear like this okay and that
sense<00:00:57.690> or<00:00:57.809> touches<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.379> inner<00:00:58.850> side<00:00:59.850> of<00:01:00.030> you

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
on the phone it has a button right here

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.390 
on the phone it has a button right here
that<00:01:05.450> activates<00:01:06.450> stealth<00:01:07.140> mode<00:01:07.409> what<00:01:08.130> stealth

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
that activates stealth mode what stealth

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.340 
that activates stealth mode what stealth
mode<00:01:08.610> does<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.680> it<00:01:10.680> reads<00:01:11.010> add<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.640> vibration

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
mode does is it reads add the vibration

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.660 
mode does is it reads add the vibration
generated<00:01:13.350> from<00:01:13.500> your<00:01:13.710> jaw<00:01:14.010> movements

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
generated from your jaw movements

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.910 
generated from your jaw movements
basically<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.659> your<00:01:15.780> ear<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:15.930> compare<00:01:16.619> stats

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
basically to your ear and compare stats

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.130 
basically to your ear and compare stats
into<00:01:17.159> sound<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.090> same<00:01:18.390> technology<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:18.930> uses

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
into sound the same technology that uses

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.410 
into sound the same technology that uses
the<00:01:19.350> military<00:01:19.770> when<00:01:20.369> they<00:01:20.490> talk<00:01:20.759> over<00:01:21.390> you

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
know in the loud area that's how you can

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.660 
know in the loud area that's how you can
actually<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.650> communicate<00:01:25.650> with<00:01:25.920> people

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
actually can communicate with people

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.819 
actually can communicate with people
around<00:01:26.790> here<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.780> what<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.380> does<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.619> it

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
around here and what it does is it

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.749

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
cancels all the background noise and it

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.670 
cancels all the background noise and it
also<00:01:32.880> has<00:01:33.150> dual<00:01:33.720> microphones<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.530> know

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
also has dual microphones so you know

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.800 
also has dual microphones so you know
call<00:01:35.250> quality<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.729> be<00:01:35.970> actually<00:01:36.390> way<00:01:36.780> better

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
call quality a be actually way better

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.350 
call quality a be actually way better
than<00:01:37.350> all<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.740> google<00:01:38.009> consoles<00:01:38.369> better<00:01:39.060> life
