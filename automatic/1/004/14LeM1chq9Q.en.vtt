this the other Claude had nothing I've

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.869 
this the other Claude had nothing I've
never<00:03:05.040> seen<00:03:05.160> out<00:03:05.430> of<00:03:05.459> my<00:03:05.670> life<00:03:07.220> here<00:03:08.220> is<00:03:08.430> your

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
never seen out of my life here is your

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.330 
never seen out of my life here is your
different<00:03:09.750> connectors<00:03:10.290> this<00:03:10.560> is<00:03:10.739> you<00:03:11.250> don't

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
different connectors this is you don't

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.229 
different connectors this is you don't
have<00:03:11.459> it<00:03:11.640> a<00:03:11.700> 6-pin<00:03:12.120> connector<00:03:13.549> and<00:03:15.500> we<00:03:16.500> got<00:03:16.829> the

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
have it a 6-pin connector and we got the

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.460 
have it a 6-pin connector and we got the
DVI<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:18.900> VGA<00:03:19.500> connector<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.900> I'm<00:03:22.230> sure<00:03:22.349> this

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
DVI to VGA connector and I'm sure this

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.509 
DVI to VGA connector and I'm sure this
is<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.709> are<00:03:23.280> probably<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.420> 810<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.130> is<00:03:26.280> so

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
is the are probably the 810 and it is so

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.009 
is the are probably the 810 and it is so
there's<00:03:26.700> an<00:03:26.850> 8-pin<00:03:27.239> connector<00:03:27.269> that<00:03:27.780> comes

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
there's an 8-pin connector that comes

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.750 
there's an 8-pin connector that comes
with<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.579> that's<00:03:29.579> it<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.680> then<00:03:31.680> when<00:03:32.519> it<00:03:32.579> comes

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
with it that's it and then when it comes

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:40.400 
with it that's it and then when it comes
with<00:03:33.000> is<00:03:33.269> your<00:03:33.480> card<00:03:38.359> here<00:03:39.359> it<00:03:39.480> is<00:03:39.599> I'll
