00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.870
 contrast between the northern half where the 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.820

 franche-comté and rhône-alpes on the north 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.200
 Western Loire country until 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.680
 contentin it's the return of some 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.080
 holes 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.909
 but with some showers locally 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.950
 possible while the south winds 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.540
 West will remain sensitive between 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.700
 two the weather will remain covered and 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.439
 locally older but on the other hand 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.540
 moors around the Mediterranean 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.759
 Corsican until the time to be rather 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.470
 hot and heavy with even beautiful 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.850
 thinning around the Mediterranean 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.329

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.829
 on the Corsican side for Monday we 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.630
 let's move on to the south cops so this is to 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.280
 the hot and unstable air that will go up 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.140
 important thus a new 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.530
 well elective disruption on the north 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.729
 Where is 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.369
 so there will be again a real 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.219
 contrast it's a damp softness to the north 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.829
 is a lot more heat to the south but 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.440
 a heat that will sometimes be unstable at 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.420
 the few storms possible 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.400
 from the west of the Pyrenees to the massif 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.830
 central and north of the Alps and a 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.080
 heat well dry but a lot 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.550
 a lot of heaviness and temperatures 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.680
 above the seasonal normal 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.960
 on these areas since we will go 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.690
 sometimes up to 26 often even from 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.500
