00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.860 

first<00:00:08.370> drop<00:00:08.760> I'm<00:00:08.940> just<00:00:09.150> going<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.389> be<00:00:09.540> dropping

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
first drop I'm just going to be dropping

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.930 
first drop I'm just going to be dropping
at<00:00:10.139> how<00:00:10.320> you<00:00:10.380> would<00:00:10.620> normally<00:00:10.830> drop<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.519> device

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
at how you would normally drop a device

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.700 
at how you would normally drop a device
like<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:12.599> so<00:00:13.049> it's<00:00:13.170> going<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.469> be<00:00:13.559> at<00:00:13.679> about

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
like this so it's going to be at about

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.919 
like this so it's going to be at about
waist<00:00:14.219> level<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:14.969> will<00:00:15.120> be<00:00:15.330> on<00:00:15.480> its<00:00:15.690> side

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
waist level and it will be on its side

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.859 
waist level and it will be on its side
because<00:00:16.350> most<00:00:16.619> drops<00:00:16.980> do<00:00:17.369> occur<00:00:17.730> on<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.970> devices

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
because most drops do occur on a devices

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.870 
because most drops do occur on a devices
side<00:00:19.170> so<00:00:19.439> let's<00:00:19.619> go<00:00:19.770> ahead<00:00:19.890> with<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.369> drop

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
side so let's go ahead with this drop

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:29.330 
side so let's go ahead with this drop
and<00:00:21.180> three<00:00:21.779> two<00:00:22.650> one<00:00:27.230> and<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.920> looks<00:00:29.070> like<00:00:29.130> it

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
and three two one and it looks like it

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.620 
and three two one and it looks like it
may<00:00:29.460> have<00:00:29.580> taken<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.939> worst<00:00:30.090> hit<00:00:30.330> on<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
may have taken the worst hit on the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.659 
may have taken the worst hit on the
display<00:00:30.960> itself<00:00:31.320> but<00:00:31.740> we<00:00:32.160> don't<00:00:32.340> have<00:00:32.460> any

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
display itself but we don't have any

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.209 
display itself but we don't have any
sort<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.059> cracking<00:00:33.660> whatsoever<00:00:34.320> as<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:35.070> can

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
sort of cracking whatsoever as you can

let's get a close-up of this as you can

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.270 
let's get a close-up of this as you can
see<00:01:42.119> here<00:01:42.420> really<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.049> only<00:01:43.409> damage<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.009> on

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
see here really the only damage is on

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.130 
see here really the only damage is on
the<00:01:44.430> display<00:01:44.880> itself<00:01:45.450> we<00:01:45.630> do<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:45.960> some

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
the display itself we do have some

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.899 
the display itself we do have some
significant<00:01:46.710> scuffing<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.399> bottom<00:01:47.729> right

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
significant scuffing in the bottom right

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.249 
significant scuffing in the bottom right
hand<00:01:47.939> corner<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.450> can<00:01:48.720> definitely<00:01:48.960> be

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
hand corner that can definitely be

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.710 
hand corner that can definitely be
attributed<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.130> second<00:01:50.640> fall<00:01:50.909> but<00:01:51.509> other

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
attributed to that second fall but other

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.030 
attributed to that second fall but other
than<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.020> everything<00:01:52.649> seems<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.950> be

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
than that everything seems to be

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.399 
than that everything seems to be
functioning<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:54.000> fine<00:01:54.180> there<00:01:54.990> are<00:01:55.170> some

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
functioning just fine there are some

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.530 
functioning just fine there are some
small<00:01:55.710> shards<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.280> glass<00:01:56.340> coming<00:01:57.000> out<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.420> the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
small shards of glass coming out of the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.870 
small shards of glass coming out of the
display<00:01:58.020> too<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.560> these<00:01:58.950> panes<00:01:59.310> could<00:01:59.670> come

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
display too and these panes could come

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.580 
display too and these panes could come
loose<00:02:00.090> at<00:02:00.270> any<00:02:00.479> point<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.049> as<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.229> can<00:02:01.380> see

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
loose at any point so as you can see

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.440 
loose at any point so as you can see
there's<00:02:01.799> some<00:02:01.979> significant<00:02:02.670> cracking<00:02:03.270> going

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
there's some significant cracking going

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.630 
there's some significant cracking going
on<00:02:03.689> here<00:02:04.079> but<00:02:04.740> if<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.189> were<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.430> get<00:02:05.549> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
on here but if you were to get the

on here but if you were to get the
display<00:02:06.060> replaced<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.960> appears<00:02:07.320> as<00:02:07.469> though

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
display replaced it appears as though

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.469

this<00:02:07.770> device<00:02:08.099> would<00:02:08.310> be<00:02:08.459> just<00:02:08.910> fine<00:02:09.209> if<00:02:09.390> you

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
this device would be just fine if you

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.959 
this device would be just fine if you
