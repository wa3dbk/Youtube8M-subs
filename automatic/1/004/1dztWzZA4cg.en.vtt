00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
this brain which is another great reason

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.510 
this brain which is another great reason
why<00:02:52.870> single<00:02:53.200> arm<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:53.590> single<00:02:53.830> leg<00:02:53.950> exercises

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
all the way to that side saying use this

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.470 
all the way to that side saying use this
use<00:03:05.290> this<00:03:05.470> it's<00:03:06.100> teaching<00:03:06.970> you<00:03:07.120> how<00:03:07.420> to

basically<00:03:07.720> turn<00:03:08.200> up<00:03:08.320> all<00:03:08.440> these<00:03:08.560> muscles<00:03:08.920> so

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
basically turn up all these muscles so

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.910 
basically turn up all these muscles so
