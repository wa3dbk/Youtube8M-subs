00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.040
 here are the guys a review of 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:21.119
 android 5.0.2 lollipop on sony xperia z3 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:25.230
 compact music and box 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:28.160
 see the interface has changed a little 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.800
 let's mark the settings you see 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:37.320
 interface settings is made a hair 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:40.050
 the curtain of the curtains is more minimal 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.090
 notifications so this time see everything 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.760
 all on a single curtain while before 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.969
 you had that you were down and there was 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.449
 first passion and there was all the stuff that 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.120
 the telephone type messages etc e 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.109
 in the second part of hera 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.989
 mind setting now you have it all 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.760
 here penis much more comfortable and here 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.479
 you can choose the various configurations 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.720
 to put yours on your own 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.720
 notification dropdown 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.400
 it's called modifying 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.020
 you can choose see example ti 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.320
 we want we want the stamina mode 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.350
 we hold and put modes 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.470
 stamina let's try close like now 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.890
 you see you have a lot of stamina mode 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:33.990
 more comfortable and changed for a moment 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.549
 also age faces messages too 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.979
 the interface here at the top right and a 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:44.369
 even the interface has changed 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:47.159
 initial as you see then it is made a little 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.930
 more minimal and in the sense you if you want 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.780
 take a picture for me since he made the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.670
 Notch photo as mentioned has also changed 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.469
 a bit the camera interface 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.909
 rice from a little more minimal now you have 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:09.020
 a bit more of effects snap 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.020
 multiple seems to have been added to us 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:16.150
 let's take sori self-timer 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.580
 some scene like soft and non leather 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.660
 I've never seen soft skin either 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.910
 animals may be that there is also 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:30.970
 been before I never saw for busco 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:33.550
 with tripod yes anyway you will notice 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.780
 during use that has changed in something 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.000
 that how the focus 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.970
 it seems to me that you focus on that 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.950
 faster than before 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.540
 it would cost here to test it and I have it 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.890
 tested but it doesn't seem to be 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.890
 a lot changed compared to before 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.640
 maybe a little more fluid what that was 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.069
 addition and measurement of the face neither 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.200
 success of taking a picture and vip or fa 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.569
 see the smile immediately and the face if 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.940
 the guy is laughing half the better a 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.920
 fire the photograph and it seems to me that it is 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.980
 therefore improved detection of 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.010
 however, respect that before 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.760
 almost nothing changes 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.830
 allows here where the swipe phone is 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.329
 you already have your phone 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.900
 the phone interface is a bit 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:28.180
 changed also made a little more 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:31.900
 minimal then you see makes you directly 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.900
 immediately tell where you want to put it in 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.640
 in the skin of the mail instead first 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.350
 you had to do another procedure first 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.359
 to tell him 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.140
 allow over immense track and you have 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:47.620
 your not so numb then 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.120
 like this all blue so it's a little more 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.609
 nice to even put a little more 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.810
 than before but not to change it 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:57.150
 practically equal not 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.070
 working to that trying state 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.420
 revised but more design definitely a 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.450
 I like this guarin a little more 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:08.100
 shows before and also the store of 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:11.900
 the google has been a bit laughed it seems 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:14.550
 more fluid should be here 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.500
 maniacally watching but not me 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.959
 seems to have changed 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.519
 then it has changed considerably 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.740
 as you see the notifications from the pagan 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.880
 right here those photographs too 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:29.570
 so a bit more comfortable if 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.130
 do you want to close a chrome window 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:36.180
 this time just press the key in 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:38.490
 lower right and swipe than in addition to 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.160
 closing applications allows you to 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:45.090
 also close the tabs opened in 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:51.480
 chrome something a little more comfortable this 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:55.680
 time there is only movie walkman album while 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:58.820
 before there was also video arezzo 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.970
 has been incorporated into one 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.140
 on the application then we say that sony 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.660
 music 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:10.430
 no longer exists, not removed, given that 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:15.750
 nobody was downloading music and sony 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:19.860
 and finally and I say I'm corporate 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.660
 spotify then now also spotify 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.669
 so just accept the proven e 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.669
 spotify and above you see all the music 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.500
 that you also have in the computer with spotify 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:31.650
 a more comfortable thing and a good thing he has it 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.330
 removed his sony music in the time e 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.450
 because he did n't know a dick he didn't use 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:40.169
 no one and now with this one it turns out 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:42.419
 being seems to be more appreciated 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:44.310
 also by many people and therefore others 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.530
 applications are not changed 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:50.330
 more than that this short video vi 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:52.950
 illustrate for a moment how the 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.200
 new android operating system compared 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.090
 the previous one has not changed 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.030
 so much so you can come back 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.280
 quietly it does not crash; 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:05.820
 seems to be almost faster than compared 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.110
 to the previous one I highly recommend 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.290
 update 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.300
 because it has a set of 3 or even the whole 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.650
 z scene of sony but above all that 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.830
 annotates track but that being nice 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.810
 powerful and you will see in my opinion the 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.880
 there are not so many differences 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.720
 however you will notice it during use 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.700
 this short video is over and we are there 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.460
 see you at the next video sign up 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.110
 as always I 'm tatami will never write 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.620
 none as always 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:37.080
 repeat like if you liked it there 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.850
 made useful, in short, I like the page 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.990
 facebook I recommend so you will not put 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:45.920
 none the same and this video finished 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.920
 see you at the next video guys 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.920
