00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:08.400
 Hi everyone, I'm going to teach you there today. 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.610
 to make a battery charger 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:16.710
 automatically turns off 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:19.100
 very simple is exponential in the areas of 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.100
 tour 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:38.129
 these are from other nbz 0 3 6 and 15 with 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:51.079
 the resistance of a car resulted a and b 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:51.079
 of 140 here the battery and 15 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:01:02.430
 the operation is very simple the source 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:10.350
 greater than 14 volts 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:14.220
 I put three more positive here of him 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:19.650
 here in the real is the relay at this moment is 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:24.540
 loading triggered and gets it produced 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.890
 even off on the pin 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.329
 when triggered on the other 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.880
 so let's go for parts 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:39.380
 The positive here is going inside 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.380
 battery positive relay 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:52.640
 now the negative is the negative is the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.640
 negative 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.270
 then at that moment when the drummer 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:03.479
 loading the circuit now let's put 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.490
 circuit to see how the 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.490
 battery charges 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.650
 to reach 3.8 volts 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:15.530
 this system that disarms here in reality is 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.900
 negative tyler is already here o negative 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.270
 January is now have to get here 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.880
 when you hit when you hit 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.690
 reach correct voltage which is 3.8 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.900
 volts 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:30.230
 have to get to the good here and when 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:34.670
 device will arrive when positive 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.489
 arrive and if this positive source here 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.400
 O will be directed to here prince 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:43.160
 no more current will pass from the 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.480
 The positive battery was not going to go any further. 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.120
 a battery 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.959
 the positive is to go to the beginning and when 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:55.600
 there is prince in pi and discipline that 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.600
 will be connected to the positive relay 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.760
 when that drummer grandpa taj 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.860
 battery positive come here 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.700
 automatically it will hold the relay 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.660
 connected to the chain that should 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.620
 to have a clue will only stay in that one now 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.680
 disconnecting the charging of the 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.680
 drums 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:23.950
 Ok, so it's very simple, the 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:30.700
 components are only those and others are neither 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:34.190
 connected here on the battery negative 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:39.670
 Battery negative here, you see. 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:44.299
 battery negative and positive 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:46.870
 the positive connected here the positive not 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.870
 sorry the 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:54.420
 the golden ceni comes here on the register 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.220
 when I arrived I would return to vote of 3.8 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.990
 volts 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.520
 it will allow the passage of current 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:06.300
 here will pass a resistor to relate the 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:10.050
 obeying traffic triggering the 40 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.510
 traffic here look only traffic 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.570
 is on positive 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.130
 the positive battery that will feed 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.310
 the battery 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.160
 This chain will come here. 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:27.330
 off right here so that only 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:30.240
 When it's fired here, he's golden. 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.620
 allow the passage of the chain drives 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.200
 this transit 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.180
 this traffic is triggered then allow the 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:40.170
 passing the chain here 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:43.230
 come the chain comes here and fires 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.610
 relay when related I already said what 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.860
 he does here 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.660
 this current that was in principle 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.440
 will come to the one that automatically goes 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:58.430
 hold the relay and the connected ke is cutting 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:05:02.520
 so the battery power is ok 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.630
 so it's the only one on the circuit that works 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.270
 I'm sure 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:10.470
 the only doubt I have here in 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:14.850
 relation to these components here but 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:17.820
 You can be there and look for 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.840
 redirect thank you so much because 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.840
 watch and thanks
