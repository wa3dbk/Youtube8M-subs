00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
it flying because it's hidden behind

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.069 
it flying because it's hidden behind
petals<00:03:22.000> of<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.920> Magnolia<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:24.730> it<00:03:25.299> takes<00:03:25.540> six

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
petals of the Magnolia and it takes six

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.000 
petals of the Magnolia and it takes six
seconds<00:03:26.590> for<00:03:26.950> those<00:03:27.069> petals<00:03:27.340> to<00:03:28.410> display<00:03:29.410> the

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
seconds for those petals to display the

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.129 
seconds for those petals to display the
the<00:03:30.280> tour<00:03:30.609> beyond<00:03:30.850> cage<00:03:31.030> but<00:03:31.209> that<00:03:31.389> would<00:03:31.989> be

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
the tour beyond cage but that would be

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:32.940 
the tour beyond cage but that would be
almost<00:03:32.319> too<00:03:32.650> easy

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
almost too easy

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.970 
almost too easy
okay<00:03:33.190> when<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.329> petals<00:03:34.690> are<00:03:34.930> open<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:35.739> tour

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
okay when the petals are open the tour

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.449 
okay when the petals are open the tour
beyond<00:03:36.310> actually<00:03:37.500> rises<00:03:38.500> from<00:03:38.709> one<00:03:39.130> little

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
beyond actually rises from one little

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.910 
beyond actually rises from one little
millimeter<00:03:40.150> and<00:03:40.510> it<00:03:40.870> just<00:03:41.170> gives<00:03:41.380> it<00:03:41.530> a<00:03:41.709> bit

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
millimeter and it just gives it a bit

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.390 
millimeter and it just gives it a bit
more<00:03:42.160> dynamic<00:03:42.489> to<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.840> automata<00:03:44.739> dimension

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
more dynamic to the automata dimension

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.740 
more dynamic to the automata dimension
