notice my pace has dropped a bit
obviously<00:02:14.410> I'm<00:02:14.500> trying<00:02:14.740> my<00:02:14.830> best<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.160> stick<00:02:15.490> to

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
obviously I'm trying my best to stick to

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.550 
obviously I'm trying my best to stick to
the<00:02:16.660> limit<00:02:16.960> both<00:02:17.590> such<00:02:17.860> an<00:02:17.980> amazing<00:02:18.430> engine

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
the limit both such an amazing engine

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.380 
the limit both such an amazing engine
it's<00:02:20.560> pretty<00:02:20.860> hard<00:02:21.100> not<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:22.150> floor<00:02:22.360> the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
it's pretty hard not to floor the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.610 
it's pretty hard not to floor the
throttle<00:02:22.510> now<00:02:22.960> and<00:02:23.080> again<00:02:23.260> there's<00:02:23.500> the

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
throttle now and again there's the

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.380 
throttle now and again there's the
famous<00:02:23.800> Flint<00:02:24.250> wool

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390

that<00:02:25.780> you're<00:02:25.930> told<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.230> avoid<00:02:26.500> at<00:02:26.710> all<00:02:26.800> costs

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
that you're told to avoid at all costs

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.920 
that you're told to avoid at all costs
especially<00:02:28.000> in<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.150> car<00:02:28.330> like<00:02:28.360> this<00:02:28.540> when

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
especially in a car like this when

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.760 
especially in a car like this when
there's<00:02:29.050> only<00:02:29.200> one<00:02:29.470> example<00:02:30.130> in<00:02:30.310> Europe<00:02:31.770> it's

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
there's only one example in Europe it's

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.170 
there's only one example in Europe it's
not<00:02:32.920> actually<00:02:33.280> as<00:02:33.340> narrow<00:02:33.550> as<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.819> think<00:02:34.060> it

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
not actually as narrow as you think it

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:41.540 
not actually as narrow as you think it
is<00:02:34.209> going<00:02:34.540> from<00:02:34.720> there

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.950 

there's<00:02:42.550> only<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.850> handful<00:02:43.180> of<00:02:43.270> marshals<00:02:43.690> after

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
there's only a handful of marshals after

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.070 
there's only a handful of marshals after
this<00:02:44.080> top<00:02:44.440> end<00:02:44.650> of<00:02:44.770> the<00:02:44.800> course<00:02:45.660> one<00:02:46.660> or<00:02:46.780> two<00:02:46.960> of

this top end of the course one or two of

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.990 
this top end of the course one or two of
them<00:02:47.200> since<00:02:48.160> you<00:02:48.250> can<00:02:48.400> see<00:02:48.580> I'm<00:02:48.670> waiting<00:02:48.970> for

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
them since you can see I'm waiting for

them to go past

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.630 
them to go past
and<00:02:51.860> then<00:02:52.010> given<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.370> cargo<00:02:54.310> you'll<00:02:55.310> see<00:02:55.519> when

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
and then given the cargo you'll see when

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.039 
and then given the cargo you'll see when
I<00:02:55.700> change<00:02:55.969> gear<00:02:56.239> on<00:02:56.359> full<00:02:56.569> throttle<00:02:56.599> the

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
I change gear on full throttle the

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:58.599 
I change gear on full throttle the
ferocity<00:02:57.439> of<00:02:57.469> the<00:02:57.799> gear<00:02:58.040> change<00:02:58.340> really

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
ferocity of the gear change really

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.530 
ferocity of the gear change really
throws<00:02:58.969> me<00:02:59.000> forward<00:02:59.769> in<00:03:00.769> the<00:03:01.340> seat<00:03:01.579> it's<00:03:02.450> a

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
throws me forward in the seat it's a

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:14.080 
throws me forward in the seat it's a
real<00:03:02.719> mechanical<00:03:03.290> physical<00:03:03.829> gear<00:03:04.069> change

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.910 

it's<00:03:14.420> a<00:03:14.480> big<00:03:14.750> long<00:03:14.989> straight<00:03:15.349> hair<00:03:15.560> some<00:03:15.739> very

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
it's a big long straight hair some very

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.740 
it's a big long straight hair some very
undulating<00:03:16.690> ups<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:17.959> downs<00:03:18.200> dips<00:03:18.650> dips<00:03:19.370> and

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
undulating ups and downs dips dips and

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.540 
undulating ups and downs dips dips and
crests<00:03:20.750> which<00:03:21.709> I<00:03:21.830> can<00:03:21.950> imagine<00:03:22.129> at<00:03:22.340> full

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
crests which I can imagine at full

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.720 
crests which I can imagine at full
throttle<00:03:22.819> and<00:03:23.239> a<00:03:24.170> car<00:03:24.379> this<00:03:24.560> quick<00:03:24.860> there's<00:03:25.640> a

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
throttle and a car this quick there's a

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.040 
throttle and a car this quick there's a
good<00:03:25.879> chance<00:03:26.150> you<00:03:26.330> could<00:03:26.420> actually<00:03:26.569> get<00:03:26.810> some

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
good chance you could actually get some

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.470 
good chance you could actually get some
air<00:03:27.200> and<00:03:27.410> there<00:03:28.220> we<00:03:28.340> are<00:03:28.459> into<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.790> paddock<00:03:29.209> at

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
air and there we are into the paddock at

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:38.289 
air and there we are into the paddock at
the<00:03:29.870> end<00:03:29.989> of<00:03:30.080> the<00:03:30.170> run

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.000 

so<00:03:39.299> there<00:03:39.510> is<00:03:39.540> I<00:03:39.959> made<00:03:40.319> it<00:03:40.470> to<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.680> top<00:03:40.830> of<00:03:40.890> the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
so there is I made it to the top of the

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.800 
so there is I made it to the top of the
hill<00:03:41.159> in<00:03:41.370> one<00:03:41.580> piece<00:03:41.849> but<00:03:42.120> more<00:03:42.299> importantly

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
hill in one piece but more importantly

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.380 
hill in one piece but more importantly
so<00:03:43.680> did<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:43.950> car<00:03:44.190> it<00:03:44.640> was<00:03:44.790> a<00:03:44.819> fantastic

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390

experience it's just like racing car the

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.330 
experience it's just like racing car the
