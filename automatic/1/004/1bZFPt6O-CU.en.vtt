00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.260
 to have it is very special for me 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.750
 because he has a single hour there is a 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.300
 air bubble actually 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.230
 and if we lose it if it will sink and if we 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.809
 the loses spyware float so here I am 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.820

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.860
 a video 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:46.580
 and according to what I think of this 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.909

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.259

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.490
 post I'm going fishing with what I 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.590
 will go to a small river and 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.340
 I sinned it's with this fish it's me 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.580
 art is a good idea 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.710
 with this wide of fishing chub and 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.410
 after the barbots there are a lot of 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.130
 barbosa get to that surely bite at 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:10.130
 so that's it, remember that 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.880
 china job the ex1 billions 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.880
 while I know 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.010
 having seen the comments I read on 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.780
 internet so I had to buy it 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.819
 what you can look at others 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.610
 videos on this lure you can be 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:30.620
 that more pleased already he has plenty of 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:34.100
 small little odds to do more for 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.540
 to do more natural and of and that's like 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.820
 an ace on his skin is like a 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.700
 accordion to make a lot of vibrations 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.380
 when we shoot him and on top of that he has 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.110
 an air pocket to float if one 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.880
 loses 6 on the persian it will sink so 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.739
 it really is really very 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.850
 ingenious alain find themselves for the 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:55.370
 video fishing stockings with saddle that I 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.840

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.200
 their extreme a style and I find it 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.510
 really worked well it was really 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.060
 more than I expected I took 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.700
 other takes that I did not film the 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.950
 more than that it was enough for me three years is 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.250
 good evidence that it works 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.960
 well 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:51.950
