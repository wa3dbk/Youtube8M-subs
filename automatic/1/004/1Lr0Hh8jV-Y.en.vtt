00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
and I did all of this the smaller red

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.840 
and I did all of this the smaller red
road<00:04:52.080> similar<00:04:52.590> to<00:04:52.710> that<00:04:52.860> there<00:04:53.160> except<00:04:53.520> four

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
road similar to that there except four

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.430 
road similar to that there except four
times<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.270> size<00:04:54.450> isn't<00:04:54.780> seen<00:04:55.050> for<00:04:55.260> those

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
times the size isn't seen for those

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.310 
times the size isn't seen for those
would<00:04:55.620> fit<00:04:55.650> into<00:04:55.890> one<00:04:56.070> of<00:04:56.100> this<00:04:57.050> the<00:04:58.050> reason<00:04:58.260> I

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
would fit into one of this the reason I

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.770 
would fit into one of this the reason I
did<00:04:58.500> that<00:04:58.530> is<00:04:58.680> because<00:04:58.970> Gotham<00:04:59.970> City<00:05:00.240> downtown

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
did that is because Gotham City downtown

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.530 
did that is because Gotham City downtown
it<00:05:01.650> would<00:05:01.920> be<00:05:02.100> in<00:05:02.220> around<00:05:02.490> this<00:05:02.790> block<00:05:03.120> here<00:05:03.510> so

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
it would be in around this block here so

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.090 
it would be in around this block here so
in<00:05:03.870> order<00:05:04.080> to<00:05:04.140> get<00:05:04.260> these<00:05:04.350> really<00:05:04.860> big

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
in order to get these really big

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.700 
in order to get these really big
buildings<00:05:05.580> I<00:05:05.910> not<00:05:06.630> have<00:05:06.810> to<00:05:06.930> worry<00:05:07.170> about<00:05:07.290> the

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
buildings I not have to worry about the

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.210 
buildings I not have to worry about the
roads<00:05:07.980> always<00:05:08.520> being<00:05:08.730> perfect<00:05:09.450> I<00:05:10.040> made<00:05:11.040> these

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
roads always being perfect I made these

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.010 
roads always being perfect I made these
areas<00:05:11.580> a<00:05:11.610> lot<00:05:11.820> larger<00:05:12.330> so<00:05:12.510> I<00:05:12.540> can<00:05:12.690> put<00:05:12.840> like

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
areas a lot larger so I can put like

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.810 
areas a lot larger so I can put like
maybe<00:05:13.560> a<00:05:13.740> few<00:05:14.010> different<00:05:14.250> buildings<00:05:14.640> but<00:05:14.760> I

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
maybe a few different buildings but I

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.090 
maybe a few different buildings but I
don't<00:05:14.970> have<00:05:15.060> to<00:05:15.150> worry<00:05:15.300> about<00:05:15.330> the<00:05:15.540> footprint

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
don't have to worry about the footprint

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.740 
don't have to worry about the footprint
in<00:05:17.100> these<00:05:17.310> blocks<00:05:17.610> I<00:05:17.910> don't<00:05:18.150> imagine<00:05:18.330> one

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
in these blocks I don't imagine one

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.900 
in these blocks I don't imagine one
building<00:05:19.080> will<00:05:19.200> take<00:05:19.380> up<00:05:19.500> an<00:05:19.590> entire<00:05:19.910> block

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
building will take up an entire block

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.490 
building will take up an entire block
like<00:05:21.180> this<00:05:21.360> like<00:05:21.510> I<00:05:21.660> would<00:05:22.020> consider<00:05:22.230> these

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
like this like I would consider these

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.620 
like this like I would consider these
smaller<00:05:22.830> ones<00:05:22.920> a<00:05:23.280> city<00:05:23.520> block<00:05:23.700> where<00:05:24.450> these

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
smaller ones a city block where these

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.400 
smaller ones a city block where these
ones<00:05:24.900> are<00:05:25.200> I<00:05:25.950> don't<00:05:26.940> know<00:05:27.030> bigger<00:05:27.690> than<00:05:28.140> a<00:05:28.170> city

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
ones are I don't know bigger than a city

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.890 
ones are I don't know bigger than a city
block<00:05:28.590> I<00:05:28.980> guess<00:05:29.520> they<00:05:30.300> won't<00:05:30.450> like<00:05:30.630> I<00:05:30.720> said

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
block I guess they won't like I said

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.930 
block I guess they won't like I said
they<00:05:30.960> will<00:05:31.080> be<00:05:31.200> divided<00:05:31.560> up<00:05:31.830> when<00:05:32.730> necessary

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
they will be divided up when necessary

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.140 
they will be divided up when necessary
but<00:05:33.419> I<00:05:34.110> don't<00:05:34.590> want<00:05:34.919> the<00:05:35.220> city<00:05:35.430> block<00:05:35.730> to

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
but I don't want the city block to

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.870 
but I don't want the city block to
dictate<00:05:36.600> the<00:05:37.460> footprint<00:05:38.460> of<00:05:38.610> the<00:05:38.850> building

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
dictate the footprint of the building

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.080 
dictate the footprint of the building
like<00:05:39.750> over<00:05:40.020> here<00:05:40.380> the<00:05:41.310> buildings<00:05:41.700> are<00:05:41.820> kind<00:05:42.000> of

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
like over here the buildings are kind of

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.909 
like over here the buildings are kind of
dictated<00:05:42.450> by<00:05:42.750> the<00:05:42.810> size<00:05:43.140> of<00:05:43.260> the<00:05:43.380> city<00:05:43.530> block<00:05:43.770> I

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
dictated by the size of the city block I

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.440 
dictated by the size of the city block I
don't<00:05:44.100> want<00:05:44.250> that<00:05:44.400> over<00:05:44.580> here<00:05:44.790> I<00:05:44.820> want<00:05:45.090> smaller

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
don't want that over here I want smaller

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.860 
don't want that over here I want smaller
roads<00:05:45.810> you<00:05:46.200> know<00:05:46.230> going<00:05:46.830> in<00:05:47.130> between<00:05:47.550> and<00:05:47.880> kind

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
roads you know going in between and kind

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.180 
roads you know going in between and kind
of<00:05:48.930> winding<00:05:49.200> their<00:05:49.500> way<00:05:49.530> through<00:05:49.860> the<00:05:49.950> large

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
of winding their way through the large

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.150 
of winding their way through the large
tall<00:05:50.550> buildings<00:05:51.060> so<00:05:51.500> that's<00:05:52.500> what<00:05:52.890> I<00:05:52.919> did

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
tall buildings so that's what I did

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.090 
tall buildings so that's what I did
there<00:05:53.520> um<00:05:53.820> and<00:05:54.390> that's<00:05:54.690> gonna<00:05:55.050> be<00:05:55.230> it<00:05:55.500> for<00:05:55.530> this

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
there um and that's gonna be it for this

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.130 
there um and that's gonna be it for this
episode<00:05:56.460> that's<00:05:57.060> what<00:05:57.270> I<00:05:57.300> built<00:05:57.540> I<00:05:57.810> know<00:05:57.870> it

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.140 
episode that's what I built I know it

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:59.930 
episode that's what I built I know it
took<00:05:58.290> me<00:05:58.350> a<00:05:58.470> week<00:05:58.680> and<00:05:58.860> I<00:05:58.980> know<00:05:59.130> it<00:05:59.790> doesn't

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
took me a week and I know it doesn't

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.140 
took me a week and I know it doesn't
seem<00:06:00.210> like<00:06:00.450> I<00:06:00.480> accomplished<00:06:01.020> very<00:06:01.169> much<00:06:02.150> but

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
seem like I accomplished very much but

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.120 
seem like I accomplished very much but
that's<00:06:03.450> cuz<00:06:03.930> that's<00:06:04.140> all<00:06:04.260> I<00:06:04.320> did<00:06:04.440> is<00:06:04.650> like<00:06:04.890> I

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
that's cuz that's all I did is like I

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.650 
that's cuz that's all I did is like I
guess<00:06:05.640> it<00:06:05.730> was<00:06:05.850> a<00:06:05.880> little<00:06:06.120> bit<00:06:06.210> bigger<00:06:06.390> than<00:06:06.600> a

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
guess it was a little bit bigger than a

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.870 
guess it was a little bit bigger than a
city<00:06:06.930> block<00:06:07.110> but<00:06:07.650> I<00:06:07.950> feel<00:06:08.430> like<00:06:08.520> I<00:06:08.580> should<00:06:08.790> have

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
city block but I feel like I should have

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.010 
city block but I feel like I should have
been<00:06:09.000> able<00:06:09.090> to<00:06:09.210> do<00:06:09.360> more<00:06:09.570> cuz<00:06:09.720> there's<00:06:09.870> not

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
been able to do more cuz there's not

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.150 
been able to do more cuz there's not
much<00:06:10.200> to<00:06:10.440> it<00:06:10.470> you<00:06:10.650> know<00:06:10.740> what<00:06:10.830> I<00:06:10.860> mean<00:06:11.010> there's

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
much to it you know what I mean there's

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.830 
much to it you know what I mean there's
not<00:06:11.280> much<00:06:11.460> detail<00:06:11.700> there<00:06:12.240> so<00:06:12.450> I<00:06:12.480> feel<00:06:12.690> like<00:06:12.780> I

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
not much detail there so I feel like I

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.690 
not much detail there so I feel like I
should<00:06:12.960> have<00:06:13.050> done<00:06:13.140> more<00:06:13.350> that<00:06:14.070> was<00:06:14.280> mostly

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
should have done more that was mostly

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.180 
should have done more that was mostly
done<00:06:14.970> by<00:06:15.870> hand<00:06:16.230> telling<00:06:16.590> the<00:06:16.710> truth

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
done by hand telling the truth

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:23.240 
done by hand telling the truth
I<00:06:17.510> used<00:06:18.510> mcedit<00:06:19.230> for<00:06:19.530> the<00:06:19.650> sphere<00:06:20.070> and<00:06:22.250> cutting

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
I used mcedit for the sphere and cutting

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.720 
I used mcedit for the sphere and cutting
out<00:06:23.400> the<00:06:23.850> large<00:06:24.240> area<00:06:24.780> underneath<00:06:25.370> so<00:06:26.370> just

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:26.730 
out the large area underneath so just

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.300 
out the large area underneath so just
deleting<00:06:27.270> this<00:06:27.419> large<00:06:27.810> block<00:06:28.230> all<00:06:28.980> these

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
deleting this large block all these

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.100 
deleting this large block all these
smaller<00:06:29.669> sections<00:06:30.210> like<00:06:30.360> the<00:06:30.480> stuff<00:06:30.720> near<00:06:30.960> the

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
smaller sections like the stuff near the

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.050 
smaller sections like the stuff near the
roof<00:06:31.290> that<00:06:32.010> was<00:06:32.190> all<00:06:32.280> put<00:06:32.460> in<00:06:32.550> by<00:06:32.669> hand<00:06:32.850> all

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
roof that was all put in by hand all

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.550 
roof that was all put in by hand all
that<00:06:33.180> stones<00:06:33.450> put<00:06:33.660> in<00:06:33.750> by<00:06:33.870> hand<00:06:34.050> all<00:06:34.350> this

that stones put in by hand all this

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.110 
that stones put in by hand all this
stone<00:06:34.770> was<00:06:34.919> put<00:06:35.039> in<00:06:35.160> by<00:06:35.220> hand<00:06:35.490> all<00:06:35.729> that<00:06:35.880> dirt

was<00:06:36.300> put<00:06:36.479> in<00:06:36.570> by<00:06:36.600> hand<00:06:36.960> this<00:06:37.830> building<00:06:38.250> was<00:06:38.370> put

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
was put in by hand this building was put

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.610 
was put in by hand this building was put
in<00:06:38.640> by<00:06:38.669> hand

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
in by hand

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.530 
in by hand
down<00:06:40.520> here<00:06:41.210> this<00:06:41.600> was<00:06:41.810> all<00:06:41.960> dug<00:06:42.290> out<00:06:42.470> by<00:06:42.500> hand<00:06:43.540> a

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.540 
down here this was all dug out by hand a

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.810 
down here this was all dug out by hand a
small<00:06:45.320> section<00:06:45.710> of<00:06:45.949> this<00:06:46.070> was<00:06:46.310> done<00:06:46.550> with

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:46.820 
small section of this was done with

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.770 
small section of this was done with
mcedit<00:06:47.979> and<00:06:48.979> this<00:06:49.910> was<00:06:50.090> all<00:06:50.270> done<00:06:50.300> by<00:06:50.600> hand

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:50.780 
mcedit and this was all done by hand

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.830 
mcedit and this was all done by hand
here<00:06:51.650> and<00:06:52.220> by<00:06:52.669> by<00:06:52.970> hand<00:06:53.180> I<00:06:53.270> mean<00:06:53.419> just<00:06:53.570> using

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 
here and by by hand I mean just using

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:59.110 
here and by by hand I mean just using
the<00:06:53.960> Minecraft<00:06:55.810> program<00:06:56.810> itself<00:06:57.850> just<00:06:58.850> using

00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 
the Minecraft program itself just using

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.450 
the Minecraft program itself just using
creative<00:06:59.540> mode<00:06:59.780> yeah<00:07:00.260> so<00:07:00.590> mostly<00:07:01.070> it<00:07:01.160> was<00:07:01.250> done

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:01.460 
creative mode yeah so mostly it was done

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.860 
creative mode yeah so mostly it was done
by<00:07:01.580> hand<00:07:01.760> I<00:07:01.880> think<00:07:01.940> that's<00:07:02.270> why<00:07:02.389> it<00:07:02.479> took<00:07:02.630> me<00:07:02.690> so

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:02.870 
by hand I think that's why it took me so

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.610 
by hand I think that's why it took me so
long<00:07:04.780> because<00:07:05.780> you<00:07:05.870> know<00:07:05.990> those<00:07:06.139> those

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:06.620 
long because you know those those

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.230 
long because you know those those
buildings<00:07:07.100> over<00:07:07.310> there<00:07:07.340> are<00:07:07.699> pretty<00:07:07.940> quick

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 
buildings over there are pretty quick

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.100 
buildings over there are pretty quick
they're<00:07:09.020> just<00:07:09.260> like<00:07:09.790> paste<00:07:10.790> it's<00:07:11.360> a<00:07:11.510> it's<00:07:12.050> just

these<00:07:14.060> would<00:07:14.330> these<00:07:14.570> would<00:07:14.720> have<00:07:14.810> done<00:07:14.960> been

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:15.380 
these would these would have done been

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.310 
these would these would have done been
done<00:07:15.530> by<00:07:15.650> hand<00:07:15.860> as<00:07:15.979> well<00:07:16.190> though<00:07:16.400> but<00:07:17.330> yeah
