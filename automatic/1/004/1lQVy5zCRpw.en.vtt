00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.559
 the roll is ok and you I asked you to 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.030
 come for a test on our racket 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.620
 play we will make a series of moves 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.719
 series rights 2 setbacks and try 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.369
 of service for after being able to analyze 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.289
 data with the racket 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.939
 we begin with the flat that services 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.939
 walk well go 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.590
 the bowyer ways that are there 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.540
 around you we share that with what 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.670
 measure the racket inside and that 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.310
 allows at the same time to finish putting 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.560
 to the point the measurement accuracy that we are going 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.650
 with the instruments that are in the 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.650
 handle 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.200
 we do not know it's actually a 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.150
 maximum number of people with profiles 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.580
 different to be able to put take 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.140
 the best possible algorithms that 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.120
 are in the racket and that calculates 6 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.470
 passes 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.390
 so yeah what did you think about it michel 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.290
 I really feel like I have 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.610
 played with a racket with my racket 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.080
 not something that I also found is 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.020
 that we looked at values ​​at wall and 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.430
 especially to see if I feel very humble 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.080
 of antenna because that's where we get 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.540
 does not necessarily reflect the place 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.700
 where Santa Claus is clearly I think 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.790
 that he never wanted to try to 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.909
 correct what this case is not fair 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.799
 a question here 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.840
 or must I love is given to me on 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.450
 my forehand is talking about angels could the 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.460
 compare in another party will 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.159
 platform where you can go for 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.259
 compare been given to that of others 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.030
 you can tell me now I'm going to look 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.429
 what will give more right compared 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.319
 to that of nadal for example and not that 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:41.329
 nadal tell you that's it if I want to 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:42.079
 compare me to a friend you to consider 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.909
 to do 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.009
 the idea yeah that's right it's just 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.210
 facilitate exchanges between people 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.409
 who will have the racket and who will measure 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.409
 the stake with the rule 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.470
 good
