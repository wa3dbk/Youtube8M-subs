00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
hopes on to their spring down here so

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.280 
hopes on to their spring down here so
it's<00:03:55.580> like<00:03:55.640> Justin<00:03:56.090> days<00:03:56.240> open<00:03:56.630> in<00:03:56.990> this

the team on this look there it goes

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.000 
the team on this look there it goes
that's<00:04:49.010> a<00:04:49.070> perfect<00:04:49.460> one<00:04:49.550> right<00:04:49.730> there

that's a perfect one right there

00:04:51.010 --> 00:05:00.730 
that's a perfect one right there

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
so that's cut out in there right there

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.740
