00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
trace an image which was drawn in pencil

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.980 
trace an image which was drawn in pencil
and<00:00:08.849> then<00:00:09.420> colored<00:00:09.870> in<00:00:10.139> CorelDraw<00:00:10.580> x3<00:00:11.719> so<00:00:12.719> if

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
and then colored in CorelDraw x3 so if

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.599 
and then colored in CorelDraw x3 so if
you<00:00:13.139> notice<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:14.179> this<00:00:15.179> picture<00:00:15.690> here<00:00:16.609> you

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609

you notice the this picture here you
know<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:17.850> still<00:00:18.119> has<00:00:18.270> those<00:00:18.480> pencil<00:00:18.960> marks<00:00:18.990> so

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
know it still has those pencil marks so

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.010 
know it still has those pencil marks so
it's<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.710> scanned<00:00:20.100> image<00:00:20.660> what<00:00:21.660> we're<00:00:21.810> going<00:00:21.960> to

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
it's a scanned image what we're going to

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.840 
it's a scanned image what we're going to
do<00:00:22.140> here<00:00:22.350> we're<00:00:22.560> going<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.859> color<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.580> one

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
do here we're going to color this one

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.290 
do here we're going to color this one
using<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.930> smart<00:00:25.260> fill<00:00:25.500> tool<00:00:26.029> okay<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.090> the

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
using the smart fill tool okay so the

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.000 
using the smart fill tool okay so the
first<00:00:27.480> thing<00:00:27.689> we<00:00:27.779> have<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.019> do<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.980> know

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
scan D sketch of course and then once it

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.080 
scan D sketch of course and then once it
scanned<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.630> import<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.790> CorelDraw<00:00:35.790> and

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
scanned you import it to CorelDraw and

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.080 
scanned you import it to CorelDraw and
then<00:00:36.780> when<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.140> go<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.380> bed<00:00:38.100> maps<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.790> click

then when you go to bed maps and click
on<00:00:39.300> trace<00:00:39.960> bitmap<00:00:40.760> okay<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.600> once<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.960> select

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
on trace bitmap okay so once you select

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.880 
on trace bitmap okay so once you select
the<00:00:43.640> bitmap<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.789> then<00:00:44.850> click<00:00:45.090> on<00:00:45.180> line<00:00:45.450> art<00:00:45.890> so

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the bitmap and then click on line art so

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.380 
the bitmap and then click on line art so
in<00:00:47.250> line<00:00:47.610> art<00:00:48.800> once<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.890> notice<00:00:50.250> here<00:00:50.670> you

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
in line art once you notice here you

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.920 
in line art once you notice here you
have<00:00:51.960> an<00:00:52.140> option<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:53.809> okay<00:00:54.809> what<00:00:55.050> kind<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:56.930> like

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
have an option of okay what kind of like

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.700 
have an option of okay what kind of like
smoothing<00:00:58.710> or<00:00:58.920> detail<00:00:59.520> do<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.879> want<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
smoothing or detail do you want the

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.889 
smoothing or detail do you want the
other<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.280> are<00:01:02.520> drawing<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.480> one<00:01:03.719> let's

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
other you are drawing this one let's

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.280 
other you are drawing this one let's
make<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.559> smaller<00:01:05.540> it's<00:01:06.540> difficult<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.140> see

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
make this smaller it's difficult to see

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.160 
make this smaller it's difficult to see
anyway<00:01:08.010> here<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.060> smoothing<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.930> cannot

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
anyway here is the smoothing you cannot

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.560 
anyway here is the smoothing you cannot
just<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.530> smoothing<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.880> detail<00:01:12.330> more

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
just a smoothing in the detail more

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.130 
just a smoothing in the detail more
detail<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.619> more<00:01:13.890> lines<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.810> yeah<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:15.990> just

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
detail it's more lines and yeah so just

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.010 
detail it's more lines and yeah so just
play<00:01:16.380> around<00:01:16.500> here<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:18.600> thing<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.810> I'm

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
play around here and the thing that I'm

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.780 
play around here and the thing that I'm
concerned<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> colors<00:01:20.100> here<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:20.460> when<00:01:20.700> you

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
concerned is the colors here so when you

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.359 
concerned is the colors here so when you
click<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.090> colors<00:01:21.420> these<00:01:21.659> are<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.869> colors<00:01:22.369> so

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
click on colors these are the colors so

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.100 
click on colors these are the colors so
if<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.640> click<00:01:23.909> here<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.540> all<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.960> would

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
marks but it's really up to you if you

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.179 
marks but it's really up to you if you
want<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.000> make<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.390> as<00:01:30.630> your<00:01:30.810> effect<00:01:31.189> well

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
want to make that as your effect well

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
anyway you can always you know when you

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.069 
anyway you can always you know when you
go<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.130> ops<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.579> can<00:01:35.729> always<00:01:36.090> decrease<00:01:36.930> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
go to ops you can always decrease the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.039 
go to ops you can always decrease the
numbers<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.619> color<00:01:37.890> number<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.520> colors<00:01:39.049> say

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
numbers of color number of colors say

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.719 
numbers of color number of colors say
I'll<00:01:40.110> go<00:01:40.290> for<00:01:40.560> six<00:01:40.920> one<00:01:41.189> six<00:01:42.150> colors<00:01:43.130> okay<00:01:44.130> if

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
I'll go for six one six colors okay if

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.789 
I'll go for six one six colors okay if
I'm<00:01:45.060> happy<00:01:45.600> with<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.899> then<00:01:46.200> I'll<00:01:46.380> just<00:01:46.619> click

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
I'm happy with that then I'll just click

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:54.730 
I'm happy with that then I'll just click
on<00:01:47.040> OK<00:01:47.460> here<00:01:47.759> or<00:01:48.060> apply<00:01:50.659> okay<00:01:52.130> now<00:01:53.570> here's<00:01:54.570> my

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
on OK here or apply okay now here's my

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.319 
on OK here or apply okay now here's my
now<00:01:56.719> now<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.950> already<00:01:59.189> vectorize<00:01:59.850> if<00:02:00.149> you

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
now now this is already vectorize if you

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.310 
now now this is already vectorize if you
if<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.020> go<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.200> wire<00:02:01.560> view<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.790> then<00:02:03.630> simple

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
if you go to wire view and then simple

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.800 
if you go to wire view and then simple
wireframe<00:02:05.030> you<00:02:06.030> would<00:02:06.210> see<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.600> it's

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
wireframe you would see that it's

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.570 
wireframe you would see that it's
vectorized<00:02:07.469> now<00:02:07.770> right<00:02:08.179> so<00:02:09.179> now<00:02:10.580> that's

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
vectorized now right so now that's

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.550 
vectorized now right so now that's
because<00:02:11.879> we<00:02:12.090> applied<00:02:12.660> trace

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.729 

now<00:02:16.560> we<00:02:17.159> are<00:02:17.280> now<00:02:17.489> ready<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:18.049> you<00:02:19.049> know<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.560> can

go in the middle of this one and then

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.979 
go in the middle of this one and then
click<00:03:05.700> here<00:03:06.590> see<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.680> notice<00:03:08.040> it's<00:03:08.310> it<00:03:09.000> fills

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
random see colors okay so let's say we

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.949 
random see colors okay so let's say we
change<00:03:35.729> the<00:03:35.970> hat<00:03:37.010> say<00:03:39.949> let's<00:03:40.949> just<00:03:41.159> make<00:03:41.430> that

00:03:59.179 --> 00:03:59.189 
gloves this one put in the center there

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.390 
gloves this one put in the center there

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
with this now now looking at this one

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.159 
with this now now looking at this one
here<00:04:07.439> it's<00:04:08.040> it's<00:04:08.970> kind<00:04:09.209> of<00:04:09.239> stylized<00:04:09.750> already

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
here it's it's kind of stylized already

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:11.960 
here it's it's kind of stylized already
it's<00:04:10.409> from<00:04:10.560> a<00:04:10.590> scandi<00:04:11.069> a<00:04:11.250> sketch<00:04:11.639> and<00:04:11.819> it

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
it's from a scandi a sketch and it

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.210 
it's from a scandi a sketch and it
scanned<00:04:12.239> into<00:04:12.599> coordinate<00:04:13.590> trace<00:04:13.889> and<00:04:14.129> then

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
scanned into coordinate trace and then

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.490 
scanned into coordinate trace and then
applied<00:04:14.549> it<00:04:14.579> with<00:04:14.939> the<00:04:15.030> smart<00:04:15.329> feeling<00:04:15.840> now

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
you can still make this quite realistic

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.259 
you can still make this quite realistic
for<00:04:19.320> example<00:04:19.829> here<00:04:20.099> when<00:04:20.609> I<00:04:20.699> click<00:04:20.759> on<00:04:21.060> this

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
for example here when I click on this

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.839 
for example here when I click on this
flash<00:04:22.109> here<00:04:22.680> I<00:04:22.830> just<00:04:22.950> move<00:04:23.310> it<00:04:23.400> over<00:04:23.700> there

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
flash here I just move it over there

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:25.810 
flash here I just move it over there
just<00:04:24.300> for<00:04:24.450> you<00:04:24.599> to<00:04:24.779> see

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
okay so it's separate objects now what I

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.550 
okay so it's separate objects now what I
can<00:04:28.040> do<00:04:28.250> here<00:04:28.640> if<00:04:29.330> I<00:04:29.540> click<00:04:29.600> on<00:04:29.840> the<00:04:29.960> plus<00:04:30.110> sign

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
move here there see what you can do it

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.270 
move here there see what you can do it
can<00:05:10.970> make<00:05:11.120> a<00:05:11.150> realistic<00:05:14.260> shadow<00:05:15.260> because<00:05:16.160> I

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
can make a realistic shadow because I

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.670 
can make a realistic shadow because I
use<00:05:16.460> the<00:05:16.610> transparency<00:05:17.180> tool<00:05:17.510> so<00:05:18.380> once<00:05:18.560> again

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
use the transparency tool so once again

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.980 
use the transparency tool so once again
like<00:05:18.980> for<00:05:19.100> example<00:05:19.220> this<00:05:19.640> one<00:05:19.880> I<00:05:19.910> hope<00:05:20.180> I<00:05:20.420> click

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
like for example this one I hope I click

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.200 
like for example this one I hope I click
on<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:21.230> plus<00:05:21.440> sign<00:05:21.470> I<00:05:21.950> get<00:05:22.400> two<00:05:22.550> objects<00:05:22.970> there

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
on the plus sign I get two objects there

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.170 
on the plus sign I get two objects there
I'll<00:05:23.750> make<00:05:23.960> that<00:05:24.110> black<00:05:24.640> now<00:05:25.640> click<00:05:25.880> on<00:05:26.000> my

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
I'll make that black now click on my

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.290 
I'll make that black now click on my
transparency<00:05:26.810> tool<00:05:27.080> and<00:05:27.350> then<00:05:28.250> click<00:05:28.430> and

you<00:06:05.980> can<00:06:06.160> just<00:06:06.190> play<00:06:06.520> around<00:06:06.550> with<00:06:06.880> the

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
you can just play around with the

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.120 
you can just play around with the
transparency<00:06:07.540> it's<00:06:08.230> a<00:06:08.350> great<00:06:08.560> tool<00:06:08.860> because

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
transparency it's a great tool because

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.500 
transparency it's a great tool because
it's<00:06:09.630> it<00:06:10.630> makes<00:06:10.990> one<00:06:11.410> drawing<00:06:12.510> quite

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
it's it makes one drawing quite

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:27.210 
it's it makes one drawing quite
realistic<00:06:17.430> there<00:06:25.050> and<00:06:26.050> then<00:06:26.230> if<00:06:26.920> you<00:06:27.040> don't

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
realistic there and then if you don't

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.430 
realistic there and then if you don't
want<00:06:27.400> black<00:06:27.730> you<00:06:28.120> can<00:06:28.210> always<00:06:28.390> change<00:06:28.900> it<00:06:29.230> so

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
want black you can always change it so

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.580 
want black you can always change it so
for<00:06:29.650> example<00:06:30.160> here<00:06:30.700> I<00:06:30.880> want<00:06:31.390> to<00:06:31.810> make<00:06:32.020> it<00:06:32.200> dark

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
for example here I want to make it dark

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.840 
for example here I want to make it dark
brown<00:06:33.010> because<00:06:33.460> of<00:06:33.730> the<00:06:33.850> flesh<00:06:35.190> so<00:06:36.190> I<00:06:36.220> would<00:06:36.640> go

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:36.850 
brown because of the flesh so I would go

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:41.760 
brown because of the flesh so I would go
to<00:06:37.020> let's<00:06:38.020> just<00:06:38.200> a<00:06:38.500> color<00:06:38.800> here<00:06:40.050> or<00:06:41.050> maybe

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:41.770 
to let's just a color here or maybe

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.120 
to let's just a color here or maybe
we'll<00:06:41.980> just<00:06:42.010> choose<00:06:42.430> a<00:06:42.460> color<00:06:42.820> from<00:06:43.060> there

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.130 
we'll just choose a color from there

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.680 
we'll just choose a color from there
okay<00:06:45.130> so<00:06:45.520> because<00:06:45.730> I'm<00:06:45.910> making<00:06:46.180> the<00:06:46.270> darker

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:46.690 
okay so because I'm making the darker

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.220 
okay so because I'm making the darker
tone<00:06:46.960> of<00:06:47.170> the<00:06:47.410> of<00:06:48.160> the<00:06:48.880> flesh<00:06:49.180> so<00:06:49.510> I<00:06:49.570> could<00:06:49.810> say

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:50.230 
tone of the of the flesh so I could say

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.090 
tone of the of the flesh so I could say
like<00:06:50.470> that<00:06:50.740> and<00:06:51.160> then<00:06:51.280> click<00:06:51.460> OK<00:06:52.470> there<00:06:53.470> so<00:06:54.010> you

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.100 
like that and then click OK there so you

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.880 
like that and then click OK there so you
know<00:06:54.250> this<00:06:54.460> is<00:06:54.670> the<00:06:54.850> different<00:06:55.530> same<00:06:56.530> as<00:06:56.710> this

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:56.890 
know this is the different same as this

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:02.010 
know this is the different same as this
one<00:06:57.160> here<00:06:57.640> I'll<00:06:58.630> just<00:06:58.900> go<00:06:59.110> file<00:06:59.820> edit<00:07:01.020> copy

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.020

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:22.990 
since it's already I'm factory in which

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:29.150 
since it's already I'm factory in which
an<00:07:23.380> object<00:07:24.630> so<00:07:25.630> I<00:07:25.690> can<00:07:25.930> make<00:07:26.110> that<00:07:26.350> us<00:07:27.420> see<00:07:28.420> here

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.160 
an object so I can make that us see here

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:34.860 
an object so I can make that us see here
say<00:07:30.160> that<00:07:30.460> green<00:07:31.830> ok<00:07:32.830> put<00:07:33.160> it<00:07:33.190> to<00:07:33.490> black<00:07:33.870> and

say that green ok put it to black and
then<00:07:35.650> I<00:07:35.710> can<00:07:36.010> remove<00:07:36.370> the<00:07:36.810> outline<00:07:38.070> and<00:07:39.070> then<00:07:39.160> I

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:39.250 
then I can remove the outline and then I

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:45.670 
then I can remove the outline and then I
can<00:07:39.430> also<00:07:39.580> put<00:07:39.880> transparency

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:51.219 

here<00:07:47.949> pretty<00:07:48.949> cool<00:07:49.630> so<00:07:50.630> that's<00:07:50.840> it<00:07:50.960> for<00:07:51.139> the

00:07:51.219 --> 00:07:51.229 
here pretty cool so that's it for the

tutorial so scan your drawing put it in
corral<00:07:54.919> and<00:07:55.280> then<00:07:55.669> trace<00:07:55.970> it<00:07:56.240> and<00:07:56.570> put<00:07:57.500> a<00:07:57.530> smart

00:07:57.879 --> 00:07:57.889 
corral and then trace it and put a smart

field<00:07:58.220> and<00:07:58.690> duplicate<00:07:59.690> the<00:07:59.810> object<00:08:00.259> and<00:08:00.530> put

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:00.770 
field and duplicate the object and put

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.970 
field and duplicate the object and put
some<00:08:01.009> transparency<00:08:01.610> feel
