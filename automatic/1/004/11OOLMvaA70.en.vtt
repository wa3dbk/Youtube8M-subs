that I'm writing such a recognizable

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.450 
that I'm writing such a recognizable
bike<00:05:22.280> but<00:05:23.060> he<00:05:23.840> hadn't<00:05:24.290> seen<00:05:24.590> my<00:05:24.890> bike<00:05:25.100> between

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
bike but he hadn't seen my bike between

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.430 
bike but he hadn't seen my bike between
before<00:05:26.150> the<00:05:26.420> mods<00:05:26.600> and<00:05:26.810> now<00:05:26.960> and<00:05:27.170> obviously

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
before the mods and now and obviously

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.600 
before the mods and now and obviously
it's<00:05:27.620> just<00:05:27.770> hang<00:05:27.920> gods<00:05:28.130> and<00:05:28.310> stuff<00:05:28.430> so<00:05:28.520> it

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
it's just hang gods and stuff so it

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.830 
it's just hang gods and stuff so it
looks<00:05:28.730> generally<00:05:29.060> the<00:05:29.120> same<00:05:29.270> bike<00:05:29.450> but<00:05:29.630> I<00:05:29.660> bet

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
looks generally the same bike but I bet

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.390 
looks generally the same bike but I bet
he<00:05:29.930> was<00:05:30.110> going<00:05:30.380> on<00:05:30.500> the<00:05:30.590> fact<00:05:30.800> that<00:05:31.130> it<00:05:31.280> was

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
he was going on the fact that it was

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.850 
he was going on the fact that it was
orange<00:05:31.760> so<00:05:32.540> if<00:05:32.690> you<00:05:32.840> ride<00:05:33.020> an<00:05:33.200> orange<00:05:33.440> myocyte

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
orange so if you ride an orange myocyte

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.640 
orange so if you ride an orange myocyte
