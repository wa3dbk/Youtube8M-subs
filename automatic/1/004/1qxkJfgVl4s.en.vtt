00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.549
 the qualification and continued training of military firefighters as 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.959
 emergency vehicle drivers 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.329
 based on hierarchy and discipline 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.529
 the military fire brigades to public organizations 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:26.099
 with its supporting pillars in the preservation of the life of the patrimony 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.269
 and the environment 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.800
 the missions constitutionally assigned to these organizations 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.280
 acting in diversified activities of an emergency character 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.930
 like fire fighting 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.860
 rescue prevention and relief if 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.850
 polytraumatized victims 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.620
 requires much from the military firefighter 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.510
 that is 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.710
 requires technical preparation 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.270
 physical and mental qualification 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.350
 besides the disposition and knowledge to handle 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.860
 a considerable set of specialized equipment 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.050
 used in different cases 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.470
 it is therefore a professional who needs good training 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.270
 constant training 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.580
 the permanent update 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.210
 currently the firefighter requires not only multiple comprehensive training 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.750
 more secure and accurate 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.900
 from there the deficiency of this professional 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.260
 human lives and material assets are at stake 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.410
 speed and competence are also indissoluble attributes of 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:34.620
 qualification 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.720
 that guarantee the success the 'failure' damages 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.500
 in this context 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.890
 the use of breast 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.200
 the automotive 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.100
 in the execution of emergency activities 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.369
 is directly related to the different technical characteristics 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.450
 such as fire trucks 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.250
 ambulances motorcycles mechanic 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.630
 according to the complexity of the tasks involving this 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.630
 singular 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.249
 driving light or heavy vehicles 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:11.550
 in a specialized activity such as 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.949
 the speakers with thousands of liters of water 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:16.529
 requires expertise 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:21.760
 since in most cases the heavy fire-fighting vehicles 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:24.289
 talking on streets of intense traffic 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:29.209
 or in densely populated areas exceeding the maximum permitted limit 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:33.269
 with the goal of reaching the mind at the place of occurrence 

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:37.589
 factor that requires knowledge of the driver 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:40.589
 prudence and caution when driving 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:47.230
 faced with this complexity of protecting and saving lives the military firefighter driver 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.269
 when in the performance of their emergency activities and in order to carry out 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.339
 in response time of the equator 

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:57.619
 often does it automatically 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:03.150
 ends up not observing the necessary precautions for traffic safety 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.140
 of the members of the garrison 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.339
 and other users of the route 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:10.589
 in some cases even compromising the relief actions 

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:16.499
 the need to qualify and train continuously 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:18.219
 these professionals 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.359
 with the support of the transit executive agencies of the 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.650
 implementing 5 traffic education centers in 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:28.859
 firemen 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.129
 already having a training system of its own 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:36.619
 in accordance with the legal provisions of the transit code 

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:37.760
 Brazilian 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.529
 of its resolutions 

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:43.489
 allows these professionals to adapt if the UN resolution 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:44.549
 the stocking 8 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.909
 of the national transit council 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:52.569
 attending the specialized course for drivers of emergency vehicles 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:59.239
 This will certainly bring additional 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:00.199
 that perform 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:01.360
 therefore 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.670
 this responsibility to provide a public service of 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.410
 illegal immoral compulsion of institutions and their agents

 interests. 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.689
 to protect society 

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:19.249
 of misfortunes that may occur 

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:20.180
 the final 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.850
 driving specialized vehicles requires theoretical and practical learning 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.670
 continuity so that security can be transmitted to society. 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.270
 essential factors in social coexistence 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.180
 the activity of well-driving emergency vehicles concrete 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.670
 with nine more than other activities performed by fire brigades 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.300
 military 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.289
 the other social organizations carry out 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:51.340
 when it is in perfect balance 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.890
 and when the professional representing it 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.970
 put into practice in different situations norms and teachings 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.590
 technicians and theoreticians based on the legal order in ethical and moral precepts 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.339
 of course

 always respecting and spreading the rights of citizenship 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.120
 he released a more human and safe transit
