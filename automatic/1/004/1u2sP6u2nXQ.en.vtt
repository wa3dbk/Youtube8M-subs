quite shame to see I think if I were

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.210 
quite shame to see I think if I were
back<00:05:08.480> at<00:05:08.630> school<00:05:08.840> and<00:05:09.170> you<00:05:09.650> know<00:05:09.800> choosing<00:05:10.010> my

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
back at school and you know choosing my

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.340 
back at school and you know choosing my
career<00:05:10.520> options<00:05:10.880> again<00:05:11.180> when<00:05:12.020> i<00:05:12.050> was<00:05:12.320> there

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
career options again when i was there

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.500 
career options again when i was there
originally<00:05:13.150> manual<00:05:14.150> trades<00:05:14.300> weren't

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
originally manual trades weren't

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:15.730 
originally manual trades weren't
presented<00:05:14.660> to<00:05:14.990> me<00:05:15.020> as<00:05:15.170> an<00:05:15.260> option<00:05:15.560> and

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
presented to me as an option and

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.410 
presented to me as an option and
actually<00:05:16.160> now<00:05:16.310> I<00:05:16.340> think<00:05:16.550> knowing<00:05:17.120> what<00:05:17.270> I<00:05:17.300> know

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
actually now I think knowing what I know

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.180 
actually now I think knowing what I know
now<00:05:17.540> I<00:05:17.690> would<00:05:17.870> go<00:05:18.140> back<00:05:18.320> and<00:05:18.350> I<00:05:18.560> would<00:05:18.770> take<00:05:19.040> up

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
now I would go back and I would take up

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.520 
now I would go back and I would take up
a<00:05:19.310> manual<00:05:19.580> trade<00:05:19.790> because<00:05:20.150> I<00:05:20.390> wasn't<00:05:21.110> meant

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
a manual trade because I wasn't meant

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.870 
a manual trade because I wasn't meant
for<00:05:21.770> office<00:05:22.040> work<00:05:22.220> and<00:05:22.460> I<00:05:22.520> think<00:05:22.700> I<00:05:22.790> would

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
for office work and I think I would

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.930 
for office work and I think I would
really<00:05:23.030> enjoy<00:05:23.090> it<00:05:23.540> and<00:05:23.720> I<00:05:24.080> hope<00:05:24.440> that<00:05:24.470> the

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
really enjoy it and I hope that the

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.130 
really enjoy it and I hope that the
industry<00:05:25.940> is<00:05:26.090> changing<00:05:26.180> in<00:05:26.720> such<00:05:26.870> a<00:05:26.900> way<00:05:27.110> that

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
industry is changing in such a way that

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.870 
industry is changing in such a way that
there<00:05:27.440> are<00:05:27.590> apprenticeships<00:05:28.220> available<00:05:28.700> for

there are apprenticeships available for

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.190 
there are apprenticeships available for
women<00:05:29.150> because<00:05:29.300> I<00:05:29.630> think<00:05:29.840> more<00:05:30.020> and<00:05:30.110> more

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200
