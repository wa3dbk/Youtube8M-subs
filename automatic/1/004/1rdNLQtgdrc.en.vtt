00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.880
 Talk to me, maicon beauty guys here. 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:13.339
 starting another video of gta5 online 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.070
 For you guys, I do not play the whole game at 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:19.310
 I live survival to talk a little 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.980
 about the 1.5 update and it also talks 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.710
 about the bonus that rockstar promised 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.360
 who finally left for some police 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.530
 so if you have not received do not need 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.200
 get desperate 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.239
 Let's talk a little bit about the update. 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.460
 it's the update they fixed 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:38.570
 especially some loss banks 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.570
 by car is from loss of characters who 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.320
 there were not some penalties 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:48.590
 that they were still rolling and I think 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.690
 they understood that they already managed 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:57.410
 correct stabilize the game then already 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:59.060
 began releasing is ooo package 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.239
 stimuli is that they promised to 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:07.870
 It's for the people who went there and for that 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:11.210
 phase in the beginning is that it was totally 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.100
 absurd that was to lose character 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.659
 that you were in front of the nose of the 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.780
 fade character 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.030
 so the guys who went through this with 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.990
 sure will get the last one out 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.670
 beauty is if you did not do not need 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.520
 be desperate and me too 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.320
 It took me a while to update because I 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.290
 I updated and did not receive 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.600
 so I figured it would not 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.909
 even because every year doing things 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.590
 very wrong and show cooking 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.930
 so I do not think so 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.320
 give me and if that bonus of some people 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.920
 that they had received but then neither 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.860
 coconut and the problem is that will later 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.850
 State 1-1 realizes a passage that 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.790
 it's taking time 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:02.830
 so if you did not get calm you did not 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:06.580
 Expected that I did not even stay because it 's early 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.039
 or later they will deposit into the account 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.250
 You of course if you entered the ninth 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.239
 game now I believe you will not 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.650
 to receive 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:19.780
 and if that bonus but if you love space 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.350
 for all those problems at the beginning of the 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.350
 game will surely receive and the 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.080
 business money bar not yet 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.640
 I tested everyone so I can not tell which one 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.630
 is working with alfie is not 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.870
 working 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.989
 understood but those who are 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.880
 Running I redo a video and I put it 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.959
 the channel to facilitate for you is 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.600
 Because there are enough people staying in 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.299
 Doubt is asking but I do not know 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:55.110
 did not like I said in too much work 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:57.670
 and I have no way to record much then 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:02.650
 I even apologize to you for this. 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.209
 delivered the case yesterday at day 5 but as 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.640
 Because of the work I'm doing 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.930
 Can you show it today? 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.000
 so this is it people I hope you 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.890
 have liked it if you liked let it 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.510
 force happened there and that your favorite 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.120
 beyond disclosure 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:20.070
 It's no more, that's a hug, stay in peace. 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.070
 and even the shepherd spoke
