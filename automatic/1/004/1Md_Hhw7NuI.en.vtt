in about 20 or 30 minutes which will

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.029 
in about 20 or 30 minutes which will
give<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.149> about<00:00:45.390> 10<00:00:45.840> or<00:00:45.989> 15<00:00:46.079> minutes<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.800> drive

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
give you about 10 or 15 minutes of drive

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.810 
give you about 10 or 15 minutes of drive
time<00:00:47.809> number<00:00:48.809> for<00:00:49.460> proportional<00:00:50.460> steering

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
time number for proportional steering

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.600 
time number for proportional steering
and<00:00:51.239> throttle<00:00:51.949> this<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.129> something<00:00:53.489> you

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
and throttle this is something you

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.959 
and throttle this is something you
almost<00:00:53.789> never<00:00:54.270> get<00:00:54.629> on<00:00:54.809> toys<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.469> small

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
almost never get on toys this small

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.160 
almost never get on toys this small
proportional<00:00:56.969> steering<00:00:57.180> means<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.840> if<00:00:57.989> you

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
proportional steering means that if you

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.049 
proportional steering means that if you
turn<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.590> steering<00:00:58.800> wheel<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.100> little<00:00:59.280> bit<00:00:59.789> you

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
turn the steering wheel a little bit you

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.599 
turn the steering wheel a little bit you
make<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> slow<00:01:00.780> steady<00:01:01.140> turn<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.160> more<00:01:02.430> you

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
make a slow steady turn and the more you

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.399 
make a slow steady turn and the more you
turn<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.090> steering<00:01:03.149> wheel<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.809> quicker<00:01:04.170> and

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
turn the steering wheel the quicker and

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.770 
turn the steering wheel the quicker and
tighter<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.920> turn<00:01:05.100> becomes<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:06.240> means<00:01:06.570> you

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
tighter the turn becomes it means you

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.929 
tighter the turn becomes it means you
can<00:01:06.960> navigate<00:01:07.229> into<00:01:07.799> tight<00:01:08.010> spots<00:01:08.310> really

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
can navigate into tight spots really

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.539 
can navigate into tight spots really
quickly<00:01:09.360> turn<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.200> dime<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.770> keep<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
quickly turn on a dime and keep the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.390 
quickly turn on a dime and keep the
vehicle<00:01:11.939> under<00:01:12.299> control<00:01:12.689> at<00:01:12.869> all<00:01:12.990> speeds<00:01:13.560> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
vehicle under control at all speeds the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.730 
vehicle under control at all speeds the
proportional<00:01:15.150> throttle<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.780> also<00:01:16.259> very

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
proportional throttle is also very

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.940 
proportional throttle is also very
precise<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.909> hyper<00:01:18.150> Trax<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.810> very<00:01:19.290> fast<00:01:19.650> and

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
precise the hyper Trax is very fast and

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.920 
precise the hyper Trax is very fast and
it<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.250> even<00:01:20.549> drift<00:01:21.119> on<00:01:21.420> smooth<00:01:21.900> surfaces

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
it can even drift on smooth surfaces

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.490 
it can even drift on smooth surfaces
which<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.189> lot<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.850> fun<00:01:24.060> by<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.330> way<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:25.290> can

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
which is a lot of fun by the way it can

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.190 
which is a lot of fun by the way it can
also<00:01:25.770> drive<00:01:26.340> very<00:01:26.909> slow<00:01:27.270> with<00:01:27.540> extreme

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
also drive very slow with extreme

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.050 
also drive very slow with extreme
precision<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.189> can<00:01:29.430> easily<00:01:29.640> navigate

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060
