00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.170
 welcome to this new episode la 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.240
 Today's question is what the lens hood is used for 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.800
 the lens hood is a simple piece of 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.630
 plastic that hooks onto the part 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.220
 front of our goal 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.529
 the main function of the lens hood is 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.539
 that of covering the lens from 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.300
 from the light that could enter 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.250
 inside the lens and provoke 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.399
 a type of aberration known as lens 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.649
 flare the lens player due to the strips 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.530
 of light or also of the pallets of 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.780
 light with a general lowering of the 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.699
 contrast of our photographs is a 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.160
 effect that originally was 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.649
 considered unpleasant in the photographs 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.109
 but above all in recent times 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.339
 he is also sometimes recreated researchers 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:52.230
 in post production 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:53.429
 anyway if we don't want this kind of 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.069
 effect in our photographs is 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:58.159
 important to use a lens hood that you 

00:00:56.069 --> 00:01:00.479
 latching usually is 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:03.479
 the indicator that there are his goal e 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:05.850
 on the hood we hook and then turn it 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:08.520
 in this way for the light is fixed on 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.560
 our goal however light have several 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.390
 forms mainly we find the for the 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.850
 light with species of lateral wings 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.799
 and these are designed for goals 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.259
 creative to a bit of focal lengths 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.409
 wide-angle in this way is the 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.180
 lens hood studied so as not to enter 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.090
 in the field in our photographs and al 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.880
 at the same time protect them as much as possible 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.530
 ours our photos another 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.860
 form that we can find instead that 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.180
 simply with a tube cylinder e 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.670
 this is found above all on 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.460
 lenses with longer focal lengths 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.200
 and on normal fixed focal length lenses 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.509
 another form 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.369
 always for the wide-angle ones a little more 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.799
 rare to find a little less frequent from 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.719
 to see and the one instead square and up 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.880
 always designed to minimize 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:56.159
 the effect of lens layer to protect 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.609
 the goal, however, without entering the field 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.859
 and the objectives the hoods sorry i 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:05.039
 branded lens hoods usually cost 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:07.439
 around even at 10 euros while it is 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.470
 easy to find on the internet 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.290
 imitations from Chinese retailers 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.700
 especially of the lens hood and being 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.260
 this is a simple piece of plastic that 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.450
 does not need mechanical parts not 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.580
 it must be particularly resistant 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.800
 we can safely buy 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.409
 hoods cheaper and when too 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.140
 without having to worry about losing it 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:30.239
 which is particularly valuable and 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.909
 lens hoods can also be fitted to the 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:36.180
 otherwise some people prefer 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:38.970
 use store them this way when 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.860
 put them in your backpack as well in your bag 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.470
 in this way we protect slightly 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.599
 our goal is approved of 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.170
 protection and lens hood can also 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.760
 provide additional protection from 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.409
 unnoticed stretched fingers we are using 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.260
 the photographic mark and lens hood 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:57.360
 also slightly protects the lens 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.830
 in fact, in front of fingerprints or bumps yes 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.510
 bangs something can dementia 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.049
 slam first on the opinion on hood and 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.900
 not on the lens and not an accessory 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:09.750
 however mandatory to use also 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.700
 if we didn't use it if we don't want to 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.120
 bring it to you soon to have it with us in the 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.280
 backpack 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.599
 actually the same effect we have 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.909
 with the hood we can replicate it 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.530
 with just a hat or even 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.870
 the moment we are taking the 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.159
 photos we commit a harem a hand in 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.569
 way to be covered 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.189
 actually the light source that 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.379
 could bother us for the photo 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:31.470
 for this episode it's all if you have 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.420
 do not hesitate to ask any more questions 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.870
 via e-mail through the various communities 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.400
 or on the site of losing riding 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.900
 www.plef.org but thanks for following 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.439
 this episode and I'll see you at 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.439
 next question
