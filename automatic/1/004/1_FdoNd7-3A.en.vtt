00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.610
 There are different types of boxers 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.440
 already the most common one is for sure 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.360
 traditional boxing gloves in all 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.710
 boxer use boxing there it is 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.470
 again different sizes here the 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.529
 below show how much weight the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.260
 I have eight gloves 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.380
 from normal bavaria to over 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.900
 even possibility 24 ounces are on 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.990
 such devices with those on the name 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.700
 Nothing can drive it have happened 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.110
 Such baring gloves should only be one 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.170
 to use for sparring or for the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.850
 competition and not from saturday 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.440
 fundamentally on Saturday it be normal 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.930
 not filled with sand because that's for 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.809
 hardware but with which garment has 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.489
 one with them on the saturday on it 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.140
 often then uses him on the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.760
 Padding off that is here is one 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.280
 nice halfway soft padding 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.989
 mostly and if you often go for it 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.969
 beats then uses itself as the 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.649
 padding off and then the two 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.199
 hit home blow holes with the man 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.360
 should someone be free and captain on the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.210
 partner on it then he suddenly comes 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.470
 blue eye because you not only with him 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.390
 the called soft cushion 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.040
 you want to be like that 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.740
 gloves rent for Saturday it 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.189
 cut then it is best to sandbag 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.770
 Gloves are just right 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.610
 for that give a short conclusion 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.770
 so you do not open your fingers 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.990
 the finger here is free they are 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.299
 much smaller and you feel like clubs 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.650
 Strikes are allowed when you get up from sun 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.509
 advise the ability to sense serve as 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.210
 Do not hit it back, you can do that 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.240
 play on it and man 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.340
 Feels nothing when talking to the flat 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.170
 hand on sunday on it skin or on 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.110
 the partner then you notice pretty much 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.790
 fast that it is pretty painful 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.979
 at Sargans already have an advantage 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.350
 that one changes one feels the beats 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.969
 through you are too hurt but you feel 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.320
 the blows through and then can 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.659
 get used to it 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.240
 therefore I recommend for salsa cleaning 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.790
 just can already the next progression 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.090
 then the alleys become 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.009
 gloves you can also use these 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.720
 The only problem is that you are here 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.220
 on it the possible can open up if 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.790
 one to beat, they have not so 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.140
 many to the people as well as the point and man 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.650
 You can stay with thumbs now and then 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.480
 hang 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.880
 that can happen , too 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.750
 Lock gloves should first 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.540
 basically only for the competition 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.320
 be used for sma competition 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:34.310
 sparring is also available from chrome 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.080
 here very soft mma gloves quite 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.630
 but you should really practical 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.900
 use only for cakes for saturday 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.190
 Training is too thick 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.310
 that means you play the ankle 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:52.820
 one is therefore a bad shock feeling 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:54.560
 I recommend here only as a grab 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.310
 match gloves use that 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.209
 use the factory at schools and 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.459
 therefore only the right ones 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.940
 use gloves for 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.360
 have different gloves 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.360
 different possibilities 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.360
 Thank you very much
