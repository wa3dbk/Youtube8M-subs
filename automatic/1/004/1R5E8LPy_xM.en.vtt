second<00:01:20.979> which<00:01:21.159> is<00:01:21.190> great<00:01:22.050> still<00:01:23.050> has<00:01:23.289> the<00:01:23.500> 30<00:01:23.740> x

00:01:24.059 --> 00:01:24.069 
second which is great still has the 30 x

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:28.080 
second which is great still has the 30 x
oom<00:01:24.369> and<00:01:24.990> has<00:01:25.990> like<00:01:26.200> a<00:01:26.229> little<00:01:26.610> not<00:01:27.610> swivel

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090

screen<00:01:28.210> but<00:01:28.600> uh<00:01:28.630> i<00:01:29.110> guess<00:01:29.619> like<00:01:29.649> a<00:01:29.800> tilt<00:01:30.130> screen

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310
