i'll play me a little bit then I had to
to<00:00:28.390> find<00:00:29.140> a<00:00:29.200> way<00:00:29.320> to<00:00:29.850> tweak<00:00:30.850> wise<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:33.309> at<00:00:34.030> some

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
to find a way to tweak wise and at some

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.330 
to find a way to tweak wise and at some
point<00:00:34.510> he<00:00:34.870> /<00:00:35.170> pressed<00:00:35.559> was<00:00:35.739> he<00:00:35.829> playing<00:00:36.039> for<00:00:36.309> a

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
point he / pressed was he playing for a

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.340 
point he / pressed was he playing for a
win<00:00:36.489> I<00:00:37.260> don't<00:00:38.260> know<00:00:38.350> I<00:00:38.530> think<00:00:38.859> he<00:00:39.039> he<00:00:39.670> just<00:00:40.350> he

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
win I don't know I think he he just he

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.840 
win I don't know I think he he just he
just<00:00:41.379> missed<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:44.219> Queenie<00:00:45.219> for<00:00:45.460> Bishop<00:00:45.730> e2

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
just missed this Queenie for Bishop e2

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.770 
just missed this Queenie for Bishop e2
idea<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:48.309> I<00:00:48.699> don't<00:00:49.089> know<00:00:49.149> if<00:00:49.300> it<00:00:49.420> was<00:00:49.539> playing

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
idea but I don't know if it was playing

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.989 
idea but I don't know if it was playing
for<00:00:49.960> when<00:00:50.170> but<00:00:50.350> I<00:00:50.379> think<00:00:50.679> there<00:00:51.249> is<00:00:51.280> there<00:00:51.909> are

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:51.999 
for when but I think there is there are

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:54.270 
for when but I think there is there are
no<00:00:52.059> grounds<00:00:52.359> for<00:00:52.569> white<00:00:52.960> to<00:00:52.989> play<00:00:53.319> for<00:00:53.379> four

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
no grounds for white to play for four

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.809 
no grounds for white to play for four
wins<00:00:54.489> is<00:00:54.729> his<00:00:55.239> king<00:00:55.449> is<00:00:55.600> to<00:00:55.989> weaken<00:00:56.639> many<00:00:57.639> ways

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:57.819 
wins is his king is to weaken many ways

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:59.849 
wins is his king is to weaken many ways
sponsor<00:00:58.269> are<00:00:58.569> weak<00:00:58.780> so<00:00:59.050> even<00:00:59.440> though<00:00:59.679> he

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
sponsor are weak so even though he

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.770 
sponsor are weak so even though he
nominally<00:01:00.579> has<00:01:00.699> a<00:01:00.729> good<00:01:01.179> night<00:01:01.329> against<00:01:01.629> my

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
nominally has a good night against my

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.100 
nominally has a good night against my
bishop<00:01:02.109> then<00:01:02.319> doesn't<00:01:03.069> matter<00:01:03.159> so<00:01:03.280> much<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
bishop then doesn't matter so much the

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.870 
bishop then doesn't matter so much the
number<00:01:05.350> of<00:01:05.440> victories<00:01:05.770> in<00:01:06.040> a<00:01:06.100> row<00:01:06.130> is<00:01:06.400> now<00:01:06.549> five

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
number of victories in a row is now five

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.780 
number of victories in a row is now five
what<00:01:07.510> is<00:01:07.630> your<00:01:08.070> largest<00:01:09.070> string<00:01:09.580> of<00:01:09.670> victories

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
what is your largest string of victories

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.210 
what is your largest string of victories
I<00:01:10.740> think<00:01:11.740> I've<00:01:12.840> scored<00:01:13.840> more<00:01:14.230> before<00:01:14.680> but<00:01:14.890> only

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
I think I've scored more before but only

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.440 
I think I've scored more before but only
and<00:01:15.460> in<00:01:16.860> children's<00:01:17.860> tournament<00:01:18.340> okay<00:01:19.180> I

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
and in children's tournament okay I

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.990 
and in children's tournament okay I
wasn't<00:01:19.960> referring<00:01:20.170> to<00:01:20.560> those<00:01:20.770> know<00:01:21.160> and<00:01:22.860> I

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
wasn't referring to those know and I

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.760 
wasn't referring to those know and I
guess<00:01:25.000> I<00:01:25.030> start<00:01:25.390> with<00:01:25.510> it<00:01:25.660> five<00:01:26.200> out<00:01:26.230> of<00:01:26.470> five

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
guess I start with it five out of five

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.410 
guess I start with it five out of five
in<00:01:26.980> a<00:01:27.210> open<00:01:28.210> tournament<00:01:28.630> into<00:01:28.900> the<00:01:29.070> 2005<00:01:30.070> and<00:01:30.310> I
