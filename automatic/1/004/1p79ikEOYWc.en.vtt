in<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.679> starts<00:00:31.949> making<00:00:32.070> alcohol<00:00:32.759> it's

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
in that it starts making alcohol it's

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.290 
in that it starts making alcohol it's
really<00:00:34.230> wanted<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.500> worry<00:00:34.710> about<00:00:35.059> too<00:00:36.059> many

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300

really wanted to worry about too many
things<00:00:36.600> as<00:00:36.840> far<00:00:37.050> as<00:00:37.079> contaminating<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.850> one

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
things as far as contaminating the one

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
of see how it works this is the airlock

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.160 
of see how it works this is the airlock
I<00:01:02.760> went<00:01:02.940> ahead<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.120> put<00:01:03.300> some<00:01:03.329> water<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.960> so

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
I went ahead and put some water in it so

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.390 
I went ahead and put some water in it so
you<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.439> see<00:01:04.619> but<00:01:05.010> there's<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.309> little

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
you can see but there's a little

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.200 
you can see but there's a little
umbrella<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.659> goes<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.770> top<00:01:08.070> two<00:01:08.729> melon

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
umbrella that goes in the top two melon

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.760 
umbrella that goes in the top two melon
that<00:01:10.110> comes<00:01:10.439> up<00:01:10.710> here<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.420> a<00:01:12.420> little<00:01:12.750> cap<00:01:12.990> it's

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
that comes up here and a little cap it's

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.670 
that comes up here and a little cap it's
floating<00:01:14.549> right<00:01:14.850> now<00:01:15.000> but<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.810> air<00:01:16.020> comes<00:01:16.470> up

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
floating right now but the air comes up

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.760 
floating right now but the air comes up
it's<00:01:16.920> actually<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.280> co2<00:01:17.580> comes<00:01:18.090> up<00:01:18.299> here<00:01:18.509> and

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
it's actually the co2 comes up here and

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.760 
it's actually the co2 comes up here and
it<00:01:19.770> builds<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.310> then<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.990> raises<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.619> a

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
it builds and then it raises this a

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.380 
it builds and then it raises this a
little<00:01:22.950> bit<00:01:23.159> but<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.520> pressure<00:01:23.759> pushes<00:01:24.240> it

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
little bit but the pressure pushes it

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.630 
little bit but the pressure pushes it
back<00:01:24.420> down<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.200> forces<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.220> back<00:01:26.340> into<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
back down and forces it back into the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.609 
back down and forces it back into the
water<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.000> then<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.150> comes<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:28.200> know<00:01:28.290> it

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
water and then it comes you know it

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.100 
water and then it comes you know it
releases<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.549> purges<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.900> keeps

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
releases it it purges it and that keeps

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.749 
releases it it purges it and that keeps
the<00:01:32.040> co2<00:01:32.400> from<00:01:33.650> essentially<00:01:34.650> building<00:01:35.400> up<00:01:35.579> to

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
the co2 from essentially building up to

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.330 
the co2 from essentially building up to
where<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.000> just<00:01:36.030> blows<00:01:36.600> up<00:01:36.900> but<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.009> keeps<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
where it just blows up but it keeps the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.260 
where it just blows up but it keeps the
oxygen<00:01:38.850> from<00:01:39.060> getting<00:01:39.150> inside<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.470> bucket

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
oxygen from getting inside the bucket

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.300 
oxygen from getting inside the bucket
you<00:01:42.270> don't<00:01:42.420> want<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.689> with<00:01:42.960> one<00:01:43.140> because<00:01:43.619> it

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
you don't want that with one because it

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.480 
you don't want that with one because it
ends<00:01:44.579> up<00:01:44.670> oxidizing<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.689> will<00:01:46.369> turn<00:01:47.369> to

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
ends up oxidizing it will turn to

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.850 
ends up oxidizing it will turn to
vinegar<00:01:47.869> but<00:01:48.869> I'll<00:01:48.960> show<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.350> lid<00:01:49.560> here

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
vinegar but I'll show you the lid here

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.020 
vinegar but I'll show you the lid here
the<00:01:50.790> seal<00:01:51.119> it's<00:01:51.840> got<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> little<00:01:52.170> ol<00:01:52.350> ring<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.770> it

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
the seal it's got a little ol ring in it

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.399 
the seal it's got a little ol ring in it
so<00:01:54.030> it's<00:01:54.960> all<00:01:55.110> airtight<00:01:57.079> and<00:01:58.079> then<00:01:58.200> what's

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
so it's all airtight and then what's

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.999 
so it's all airtight and then what's
gonna<00:01:58.530> go<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:58.920> there<00:01:59.100> is<00:02:00.290> these<00:02:01.290> two<00:02:01.500> bags<00:02:01.680> of

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
what you call it I just call it a beaker

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.460 
what you call it I just call it a beaker
but<00:02:47.879> you<00:02:48.000> put<00:02:48.150> your<00:02:48.269> hydrometer<00:02:48.629> in<00:02:48.989> that<00:02:49.169> to

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
but you put your hydrometer in that to

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.879 
but you put your hydrometer in that to
measure<00:02:49.849> your<00:02:50.849> specific<00:02:51.450> gravity<00:02:51.859> you<00:02:52.859> can

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
measure your specific gravity you can

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:57.679 
measure your specific gravity you can
figure<00:02:53.220> out<00:02:53.340> your<00:02:55.669> alcohol<00:02:56.669> content<00:02:56.970> if<00:02:57.480> you

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:57.689 
figure out your alcohol content if you

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:59.990 
figure out your alcohol content if you
you<00:02:58.139> know<00:02:58.260> read<00:02:58.620> if<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.129> do<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.310> reading<00:02:59.790> before

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
you know read if you do a reading before

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.740 
you know read if you do a reading before
and<00:03:00.450> after<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:01.019> start<00:03:01.519> fermenting<00:03:02.519> and<00:03:03.180> then

and after you start fermenting and then

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.309 
and after you start fermenting and then
there's<00:03:03.959> something<00:03:04.200> else<00:03:04.439> I<00:03:04.739> think<00:03:04.799> it's<00:03:05.129> your

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
there's something else I think it's your

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.289 
there's something else I think it's your
sugar<00:03:07.319> your<00:03:07.769> alcohol<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.400> then<00:03:08.939> you<00:03:09.120> can

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
sugar your alcohol and then you can

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.849 
sugar your alcohol and then you can
measure<00:03:09.569> something<00:03:09.989> else<00:03:10.200> I'm<00:03:10.439> not<00:03:10.680> sure

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
measure something else I'm not sure

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.000

guess<00:04:37.330> like<00:04:37.750> sure<00:04:38.050> gel<00:04:38.350> ends<00:04:39.190> up<00:04:39.340> Ken<00:04:40.270> gelling

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
guess like sure gel ends up Ken gelling

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.540 
guess like sure gel ends up Ken gelling
off<00:04:42.340> of<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.290> the<00:04:44.290> skins<00:04:44.650> of<00:04:44.860> the<00:04:44.920> grapes<00:04:45.220> and

off of the the skins of the grapes and

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.270 
off of the the skins of the grapes and
it<00:04:46.120> will<00:04:46.390> gel<00:04:46.930> at<00:04:47.170> the<00:04:47.320> top<00:04:47.500> of<00:04:47.680> the<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:48.070> glass

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
it will gel at the top of the the glass

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.890 
it will gel at the top of the the glass
carboy<00:04:48.790> here<00:04:49.150> and<00:04:49.740> you<00:04:50.740> don't<00:04:50.890> want<00:04:51.070> that<00:04:51.900> so

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
carboy here and you don't want that so

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.380 
carboy here and you don't want that so
this<00:04:53.500> will<00:04:53.740> help<00:04:54.010> it<00:04:54.160> move<00:04:54.760> along<00:04:55.060> in<00:04:55.300> the

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
this will help it move along in the

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.140 
this will help it move along in the
process<00:04:55.900> and<00:04:56.170> then<00:04:56.920> I<00:04:57.340> got<00:04:58.030> some<00:04:58.530> bentonite

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
process and then I got some bentonite

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.620 
process and then I got some bentonite
also<00:05:01.150> to<00:05:01.210> help<00:05:01.570> it<00:05:01.690> clear<00:05:01.960> at<00:05:02.170> the<00:05:02.290> end<00:05:02.970> and<00:05:03.970> I

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
also to help it clear at the end and I

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.300 
also to help it clear at the end and I
picked<00:05:05.020> that<00:05:05.080> up<00:05:05.170> all<00:05:05.500> this<00:05:05.650> up<00:05:05.860> at<00:05:06.010> the<00:05:06.130> local

information out there but I just kind of
show<00:05:49.570> you<00:05:49.630> how<00:05:49.840> this<00:05:49.990> works<00:05:50.970> when<00:05:51.970> you<00:05:52.090> put

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
show you how this works when you put

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.840 
show you how this works when you put
your<00:05:52.450> wine<00:05:52.600> in<00:05:52.870> there<00:05:53.340> you'll<00:05:54.340> go<00:05:54.490> ahead<00:05:54.580> and

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
your wine in there you'll go ahead and

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.640 
your wine in there you'll go ahead and
drop<00:05:55.000> this<00:05:55.210> down<00:05:55.450> and<00:05:55.930> by<00:05:56.020> the<00:05:56.080> way<00:05:56.290> the<00:05:56.500> guys

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
drop this down and by the way the guys

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.440 
drop this down and by the way the guys
are<00:05:56.830> formidable<00:05:57.070> said<00:05:57.520> I<00:05:57.700> probably<00:05:58.150> should

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
are formidable said I probably should

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.510 
are formidable said I probably should
buy<00:05:58.600> one<00:05:59.290> more<00:05:59.530> these<00:05:59.680> because<00:06:00.010> this<00:06:00.160> is<00:06:00.340> the

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
buy one more these because this is the

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.800 
buy one more these because this is the
most<00:06:00.730> retail<00:06:01.150> item<00:06:01.480> they<00:06:01.630> have<00:06:02.400> well<00:06:03.400> I<00:06:04.030> don't

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
most retail item they have well I don't

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.000 
most retail item they have well I don't
have<00:06:04.900> enough<00:06:05.110> water<00:06:05.320> in<00:06:05.530> there<00:06:05.620> because<00:06:05.830> it's

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
have enough water in there because it's

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.610 
have enough water in there because it's
hitting<00:06:06.190> bottom<00:06:06.570> but<00:06:07.570> actually<00:06:08.200> what<00:06:08.320> it<00:06:08.440> does

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
hitting bottom but actually what it does

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.680 
hitting bottom but actually what it does
it'll<00:06:09.220> will<00:06:09.310> float<00:06:09.670> and<00:06:09.970> wherever<00:06:10.150> the<00:06:10.450> water

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690 
it'll will float and wherever the water

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.650 
it'll will float and wherever the water
touches<00:06:11.470> the<00:06:12.430> measurement<00:06:13.210> here<00:06:13.360> that's

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660 
touches the measurement here that's

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.950 
touches the measurement here that's
where<00:06:13.900> you<00:06:14.110> know<00:06:14.260> your<00:06:14.440> specific<00:06:14.920> gravity

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
where you know your specific gravity

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.910 
where you know your specific gravity
it's<00:06:16.960> just<00:06:17.110> pretty<00:06:17.470> cool

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:17.920 
it's just pretty cool

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.070 
it's just pretty cool
and<00:06:18.520> that's<00:06:18.850> how<00:06:19.000> all<00:06:19.150> those<00:06:19.390> guys<00:06:19.570> figure<00:06:19.960> out

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
and that's how all those guys figure out

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.920 
and that's how all those guys figure out
what<00:06:20.260> the<00:06:20.380> alcohol<00:06:20.530> content<00:06:21.100> is<00:06:21.750> how<00:06:22.750> much

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
what the alcohol content is how much

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.590 
what the alcohol content is how much
more<00:06:23.140> sugar<00:06:23.410> they<00:06:23.650> need<00:06:23.800> to<00:06:23.890> add<00:06:24.420> stuff<00:06:25.420> like

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.600 
more sugar they need to add stuff like

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.500 
more sugar they need to add stuff like
that<00:06:25.780> the<00:06:25.990> only<00:06:26.110> thing<00:06:26.380> I<00:06:26.470> don't<00:06:26.530> have<00:06:26.950> here<00:06:27.510> is

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
that the only thing I don't have here is

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.760 
that the only thing I don't have here is
my<00:06:29.550> acidity<00:06:30.550> kit<00:06:30.790> which<00:06:31.690> they<00:06:31.930> did<00:06:32.170> not<00:06:32.410> have

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770 
my acidity kit which they did not have

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.410 
my acidity kit which they did not have
so<00:06:33.580> these<00:06:34.620> muscadines<00:06:35.620> are<00:06:35.910> really<00:06:36.910> ripe<00:06:37.120> I

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:37.420 
so these muscadines are really ripe I

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.300 
so these muscadines are really ripe I
don't<00:06:37.600> see<00:06:38.080> like<00:06:38.740> it's<00:06:38.980> going<00:06:39.100> to<00:06:39.130> be<00:06:39.280> a

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:39.310 
don't see like it's going to be a

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.430 
don't see like it's going to be a
problem

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
problem

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.930 
problem

but come Monday I'm gonna go and just
get<00:06:43.240> some<00:06:43.449> test<00:06:43.720> strips<00:06:44.050> and<00:06:44.819> measure<00:06:45.819> and<00:06:46.150> see

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
get some test strips and measure and see

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.830 
get some test strips and measure and see
out<00:06:46.539> how<00:06:47.289> it's<00:06:47.470> doing<00:06:48.370> as<00:06:48.550> far<00:06:48.639> as<00:06:48.789> acidity<00:06:49.360> and

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 
out how it's doing as far as acidity and

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.080 
out how it's doing as far as acidity and
the<00:06:50.590> last<00:06:50.800> thing<00:06:51.009> I<00:06:51.099> have<00:06:51.280> to<00:06:51.400> show<00:06:51.580> y'all<00:06:51.819> is

the last thing I have to show y'all is
the<00:06:52.800> juicer<00:06:54.030> yeah<00:06:55.030> I<00:06:55.060> got<00:06:55.360> several<00:06:56.169> months

00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:56.409 
the juicer yeah I got several months

00:06:56.409 --> 00:07:01.249 
the juicer yeah I got several months
back<00:06:56.560> but<00:06:57.720> not<00:06:58.720> a<00:06:58.780> lot<00:06:58.960> to<00:06:59.139> this<00:06:59.289> you<00:06:59.560> put<00:06:59.830> the

00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:01.259 
back but not a lot to this you put the

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:04.710 
back but not a lot to this you put the
the<00:07:02.259> muscadines<00:07:02.710> in<00:07:02.860> here<00:07:03.069> the<00:07:03.419> grapes<00:07:04.419> fruit

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.720 
the muscadines in here the grapes fruit

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.020 
the muscadines in here the grapes fruit
whatever<00:07:04.960> in<00:07:05.169> here<00:07:05.349> it<00:07:06.220> comes<00:07:06.460> down<00:07:06.669> this<00:07:06.759> tube

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:07.030 
whatever in here it comes down this tube

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.559 
whatever in here it comes down this tube
there's<00:07:07.389> a<00:07:07.449> little<00:07:08.400> bottom<00:07:09.400> plate<00:07:09.639> here<00:07:09.940> that

00:07:10.559 --> 00:07:10.569 
there's a little bottom plate here that

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:13.830 
there's a little bottom plate here that
I<00:07:10.720> stainless<00:07:11.139> steel<00:07:11.379> has<00:07:11.710> very<00:07:12.550> subtle<00:07:13.240> little

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 
I stainless steel has very subtle little

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.260 
I stainless steel has very subtle little
blades<00:07:14.110> on<00:07:14.379> it<00:07:14.409> it's<00:07:15.310> more<00:07:15.460> like<00:07:15.639> teeth<00:07:15.909> it's

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:16.270 
blades on it it's more like teeth it's

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.170 
blades on it it's more like teeth it's
spinning<00:07:16.810> around<00:07:16.930> very<00:07:17.650> high<00:07:17.860> revolution<00:07:18.580> in

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:19.180 
spinning around very high revolution in

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.850 
spinning around very high revolution in
it<00:07:19.680> it<00:07:21.629> has<00:07:22.629> a<00:07:22.659> screen<00:07:23.110> on<00:07:23.289> here<00:07:23.440> too<00:07:23.650> a<00:07:23.680> little

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:23.860 
it it has a screen on here too a little

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.499 
it it has a screen on here too a little
filter<00:07:24.190> and<00:07:24.520> the<00:07:24.969> juice<00:07:26.250> sinks<00:07:27.250> down<00:07:27.460> but<00:07:28.270> as

00:07:28.499 --> 00:07:28.509 
filter and the juice sinks down but as

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:30.300 
filter and the juice sinks down but as
the<00:07:28.870> momentum<00:07:29.259> of<00:07:29.620> the<00:07:29.740> blade<00:07:30.009> is<00:07:30.219> spinning

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:30.310 
the momentum of the blade is spinning

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:34.050 
the momentum of the blade is spinning
that<00:07:30.639> inertia<00:07:31.210> throws<00:07:31.750> out<00:07:32.129> all<00:07:33.129> the<00:07:33.400> runs<00:07:33.669> the

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:34.060 
that inertia throws out all the runs the

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.879 
that inertia throws out all the runs the
skins<00:07:34.419> and<00:07:34.629> everything<00:07:35.190> off<00:07:36.190> the<00:07:36.550> bowl<00:07:36.759> and<00:07:37.120> in

skins and everything off the bowl and in
spinning<00:07:38.889> around<00:07:38.979> through<00:07:39.340> here<00:07:39.370> and<00:07:39.789> empties

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:40.449 
spinning around through here and empties

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:42.719 
spinning around through here and empties
all<00:07:40.750> the<00:07:40.900> pulp<00:07:41.139> in<00:07:41.319> this<00:07:41.469> container<00:07:41.800> which<00:07:42.550> I'm
