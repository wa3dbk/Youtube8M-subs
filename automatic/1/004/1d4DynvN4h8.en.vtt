00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
where the reservoir was going to be so

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.100 
where the reservoir was going to be so
we<00:01:37.920> had<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.220> literally<00:01:39.030> dig<00:01:39.750> into<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
we had to literally dig into the
