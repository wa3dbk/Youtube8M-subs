00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
it ships with mountain lion I was

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.229 
it ships with mountain lion I was
curious<00:02:37.250> about<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:37.670> weight<00:02:37.819> of<00:02:37.940> this<00:02:38.000> thing

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
curious about the weight of this thing

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.940 
curious about the weight of this thing
so<00:02:38.420> I<00:02:38.450> brought<00:02:38.540> down<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.989> 13-inch<00:02:39.380> macbook

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
so I brought down the 13-inch macbook

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.860 
so I brought down the 13-inch macbook
air<00:02:40.160> to<00:02:40.400> compare<00:02:40.819> and<00:02:41.090> I<00:02:41.390> have<00:02:41.569> to<00:02:41.690> say<00:02:41.720> that

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
air to compare and I have to say that

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.840 
air to compare and I have to say that
they<00:02:42.230> actually<00:02:42.410> feel<00:02:42.980> pretty<00:02:43.010> similar<00:02:43.819> in

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
they actually feel pretty similar in

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.750 
they actually feel pretty similar in
weight<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:45.590> macbook<00:02:45.950> pro<00:02:46.160> is<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.400> little

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
weight and the macbook pro is a little

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.150 
weight and the macbook pro is a little
more<00:02:46.910> compact<00:02:47.450> than<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.410> air<00:02:48.560> look<00:02:48.890> at<00:02:49.010> that

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
more compact than the air look at that

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.740 
more compact than the air look at that
it's<00:02:49.400> like<00:02:49.580> a<00:02:49.610> little<00:02:49.910> bit<00:02:50.000> wider<00:02:50.269> because<00:02:50.569> of

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
it's like a little bit wider because of

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.440 
it's like a little bit wider because of
all<00:02:50.870> that<00:02:50.900> skinny<00:02:51.380> bezel<00:02:51.799> I<00:02:51.950> guess<00:02:52.450> obviously

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
all that skinny bezel I guess obviously

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.390
