that mega evolutions are temporary that

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.730 
that mega evolutions are temporary that

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
well the fans will take this idea I mean

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.830 
well the fans will take this idea I mean
I<00:01:43.130> was<00:01:44.130> dreaming<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.790> forth<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.420> pollutions

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
I was dreaming of forth and pollutions

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.109 
I was dreaming of forth and pollutions
of<00:01:45.899> starters<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.950> now<00:01:47.070> we<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> Blaziken

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
of starters and now we have a Blaziken

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.230 
of starters and now we have a Blaziken
mega<00:01:48.360> evolution<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.250> I<00:01:50.250> certainly<00:01:51.060> think

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
mega evolution and I certainly think

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.210 
mega evolution and I certainly think
that<00:01:51.780> they<00:01:51.990> will<00:01:52.140> add<00:01:52.259> mega<00:01:52.619> evolutions<00:01:53.070> to

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
that they will add mega evolutions to

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.149 
that they will add mega evolutions to
the<00:01:54.000> other<00:01:54.119> starters<00:01:54.600> as<00:01:54.810> well<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.380> actually

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
the other starters as well I actually

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.959 
the other starters as well I actually
hope<00:01:56.579> they<00:01:56.939> do<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:58.040> also<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.280> have<00:01:59.640> heard

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
hope they do this and also I have heard

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.530 
hope they do this and also I have heard
that<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.990> leaked<00:02:01.380> document<00:02:02.060> copy<00:02:03.060> writing

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
that a leaked document copy writing

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.459
