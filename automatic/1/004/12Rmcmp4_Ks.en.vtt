hi<00:00:04.319> welcome<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.799> videojug<00:00:05.130> I'm<00:00:05.520> Russell<00:00:05.879> Nash

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
hi welcome to videojug I'm Russell Nash

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.310 
hi welcome to videojug I'm Russell Nash
I'm<00:00:07.140> going<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:07.379> show<00:00:07.500> you<00:00:07.529> how<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:07.740> play<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.309> d7

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.379 

now<00:00:13.320> if<00:00:13.740> we<00:00:13.860> just<00:00:13.889> recap<00:00:14.400> first<00:00:14.699> of<00:00:14.910> all<00:00:15.000> always

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
now if we just recap first of all always

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.179 
now if we just recap first of all always
check<00:00:15.840> that<00:00:15.869> the<00:00:16.139> guitars<00:00:16.439> in<00:00:16.650> tune<00:00:16.920> so

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:17.189 
check that the guitars in tune so

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.460 
check that the guitars in tune so
remember<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:17.580> go<00:00:17.699> up<00:00:17.759> to<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.000> fifth<00:00:18.990> fret<00:00:19.110> here

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
remember we go up to the fifth fret here

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:32.200 
remember we go up to the fifth fret here
first<00:00:20.070> finger

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.540 

now<00:00:33.020> let's<00:00:33.200> recap<00:00:33.680> on<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:34.100> call<00:00:34.250> of<00:00:34.370> D

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
now let's recap on the call of D

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.160 
now let's recap on the call of D
remember<00:00:34.820> it<00:00:35.030> was<00:00:35.120> the<00:00:35.149> triangle<00:00:35.719> here<00:00:36.020> we

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
remember it was the triangle here we

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.420 
remember it was the triangle here we
play<00:00:36.320> from<00:00:36.500> the<00:00:36.590> D<00:00:36.770> string<00:00:36.980> upwards

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
play from the D string upwards

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.630 
play from the D string upwards
now<00:00:40.180> the<00:00:40.240> d7<00:00:40.870> very<00:00:41.260> similar<00:00:41.740> except<00:00:42.370> I'm<00:00:42.490> going

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
now the d7 very similar except I'm going

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.670 
now the d7 very similar except I'm going
to<00:00:42.700> call<00:00:42.880> this<00:00:43.030> the<00:00:43.450> backward<00:00:43.900> triangle<00:00:44.440> so

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
to call this the backward triangle so

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.020 
to call this the backward triangle so
we've<00:00:44.800> got<00:00:44.890> a<00:00:44.920> forward<00:00:45.250> triangle<00:00:45.700> this<00:00:45.820> way

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
we've got a forward triangle this way

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.090 
we've got a forward triangle this way
and<00:00:46.270> instead<00:00:46.870> we're<00:00:47.260> going<00:00:47.380> to<00:00:47.440> reverse<00:00:47.740> the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
and instead we're going to reverse the

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.250 
and instead we're going to reverse the
triangle<00:00:48.610> playing<00:00:49.150> the<00:00:49.300> first<00:00:49.540> finger<00:00:50.020> here

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
triangle playing the first finger here

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.250 
triangle playing the first finger here
playing<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:50.920> seventh<00:00:51.750> here

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
playing the seventh here

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.320 
playing the seventh here
so<00:00:54.890> it's<00:00:55.010> a<00:00:55.040> backward<00:00:55.460> triangle<00:00:55.880> let's<00:00:56.000> recap

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
so it's a backward triangle let's recap

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
so it's a backward triangle let's recap
again<00:00:56.540> from<00:00:56.750> D

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
again from D

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.050 
again from D
back<00:00:59.130> was<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.580> d7<00:01:01.130> one<00:01:02.130> more<00:01:02.340> time<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:02.790> we<00:01:02.910> get

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.060 
back was the d7 one more time so we get

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.050 
back was the d7 one more time so we get
D<00:01:04.160> backward<00:01:05.160> triangle<00:01:06.380> d7<00:01:07.670> so<00:01:08.670> now<00:01:08.790> let's<00:01:08.940> look

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
D backward triangle d7 so now let's look

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.790 
D backward triangle d7 so now let's look
at<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.210> progression<00:01:09.540> I'm<00:01:09.930> going<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.230> go<00:01:10.350> from<00:01:10.560> D

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
at a progression I'm going to go from D

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.539 
at a progression I'm going to go from D
to<00:01:11.900> d7

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
to d7

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.679 
to d7
-<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> G<00:01:15.509> let's<00:01:16.020> recap<00:01:16.350> on<00:01:16.469> the<00:01:16.590> G<00:01:17.539> and<00:01:18.539> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
- a G let's recap on the G and the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.029 
- a G let's recap on the G and the
second<00:01:19.049> thing<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.200> comes<00:01:19.469> across<00:01:19.590> into<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
second thing that comes across into the

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.029 
second thing that comes across into the
third<00:01:20.280> fret<00:01:20.549> here<00:01:20.820> first<00:01:21.329> fingers<00:01:22.039> playing

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
third fret here first fingers playing

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:25.550 
third fret here first fingers playing
here<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.610> fifth<00:01:24.179> string<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.689> then<00:01:25.170> down

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
here on the fifth string and then down

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.959 
here on the fifth string and then down
here<00:01:25.770> we've<00:01:25.890> got<00:01:25.979> both<00:01:26.100> fingers<00:01:26.520> playing<00:01:26.850> in

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:26.969 
here we've got both fingers playing in

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:28.700 
here we've got both fingers playing in
the<00:01:27.060> third<00:01:27.270> fret

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710

seven if you listen to this it's not

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.700 
seven if you listen to this it's not
very<00:01:53.580> bluesy<00:01:53.820> it's<00:01:54.240> much<00:01:54.360> more<00:01:54.570> soulful<00:01:54.900> if

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
more of a flow it's not as rigid as the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.640 
more of a flow it's not as rigid as the
blues<00:02:02.430> progression<00:02:03.320> let's<00:02:04.320> look<00:02:04.440> at<00:02:04.530> all

blues progression let's look at all
these<00:02:04.800> chords<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.190> more<00:02:05.340> detail<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.660> a<00:02:06.810> d

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
these chords in more detail this is a d

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
these chords in more detail this is a d
remember<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.100> triangle<00:02:08.929> this<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.110> d7<00:02:10.770> the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
remember the triangle this is a d7 the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.970 
remember the triangle this is a d7 the
backward<00:02:11.670> triangle<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.530> let's<00:02:13.530> recap<00:02:13.830> on

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
backward triangle and let's recap on

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.610 
backward triangle and let's recap on
that<00:02:14.160> G<00:02:14.370> again<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:15.080> now<00:02:16.080> let's<00:02:16.290> look<00:02:16.410> at<00:02:16.500> the
