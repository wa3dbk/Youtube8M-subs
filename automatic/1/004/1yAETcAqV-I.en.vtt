00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
are like amazingly accurate and i think

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:36.930 
are like amazingly accurate and i think
without<00:00:35.829> these<00:00:36.190> we<00:00:36.400> wouldn't<00:00:36.610> have<00:00:36.699> been<00:00:36.820> able

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
without these we wouldn't have been able

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.850 
without these we wouldn't have been able
to<00:00:37.180> do<00:00:37.269> this<00:00:37.420> game<00:00:37.690> because<00:00:37.900> we<00:00:38.470> do<00:00:38.590> a<00:00:38.620> lot<00:00:38.800> of

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
to do this game because we do a lot of

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.740 
to do this game because we do a lot of
stuff<00:00:39.220> that<00:00:39.460> require<00:00:39.879> one<00:00:40.150> to<00:00:40.180> one<00:00:40.449> tracking

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
stuff that require one to one tracking

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.200 
stuff that require one to one tracking
and<00:00:41.080> these<00:00:41.680> ones<00:00:41.890> are<00:00:42.010> great<00:00:42.250> at<00:00:42.430> all<00:00:42.610> and<00:00:42.910> also

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
and these ones are great at all and also

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.640 
and these ones are great at all and also
because<00:00:43.660> it's<00:00:43.780> like<00:00:43.900> a<00:00:43.930> fighting<00:00:44.230> game<00:00:44.350> it's

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650

stuff with gameplay over women as able
to<00:00:55.780> go<00:00:55.869> otherwise<00:00:56.080> no<00:00:56.979> the<00:00:57.610> lights<00:00:57.760> on<00:00:57.879> the<00:00:57.970> end

to go otherwise no the lights on the end

00:00:58.089 --> 00:00:59.340 
to go otherwise no the lights on the end
of<00:00:58.180> those<00:00:58.269> relevant<00:00:58.659> or<00:00:58.930> is<00:00:59.019> that<00:00:59.110> kind<00:00:59.260> of

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
of those relevant or is that kind of

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.520 
of those relevant or is that kind of
aesthetic<00:00:59.680> or<00:00:59.979> a<00:01:00.010> little<00:01:00.220> bit<00:01:00.309> of<00:01:00.400> both<00:01:01.530> it's

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
aesthetic or a little bit of both it's

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.259 
aesthetic or a little bit of both it's
for<00:01:02.650> the<00:01:02.710> camera<00:01:03.040> tracking<00:01:03.280> right<00:01:03.790> so<00:01:04.180> it

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
for the camera tracking right so it

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.120 
for the camera tracking right so it
picks<00:01:04.420> a<00:01:04.570> color<00:01:04.780> that<00:01:05.049> sticks<00:01:05.560> out<00:01:05.710> well<00:01:05.950> from

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
picks a color that sticks out well from

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.730 
picks a color that sticks out well from
the<00:01:06.250> background<00:01:06.990> also<00:01:07.990> sometimes<00:01:08.229> in<00:01:08.590> some

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
the background also sometimes in some

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.020 
the background also sometimes in some
games<00:01:08.920> they<00:01:09.159> can<00:01:09.369> change<00:01:09.549> the<00:01:09.729> color<00:01:09.880> to

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
games they can change the color to

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.929 
games they can change the color to
indicate<00:01:10.510> start<00:01:11.020> and<00:01:11.140> stuff<00:01:11.320> but<00:01:12.250> for<00:01:12.880> the

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
indicate start and stuff but for the

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:14.490 
indicate start and stuff but for the
most<00:01:13.060> part<00:01:13.180> it's<00:01:13.479> just<00:01:13.689> like<00:01:13.900> trying<00:01:14.320> to<00:01:14.350> pick

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
most part it's just like trying to pick

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.800 
most part it's just like trying to pick
a<00:01:14.530> color<00:01:14.770> that's<00:01:14.830> nice<00:01:15.100> out<00:01:15.340> it<00:01:15.460> most<00:01:16.030> pretty

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
detail about how accurate is it really

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.060 
detail about how accurate is it really
like<00:01:19.930> will<00:01:20.110> pick<00:01:20.350> up<00:01:20.439> almost<00:01:20.650> all<00:01:20.890> of<00:01:21.040> my

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
like will pick up almost all of my

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.360 
like will pick up almost all of my
movements<00:01:21.610> or<00:01:21.850> oh<00:01:22.150> yeah<00:01:22.750> I<00:01:22.930> mean<00:01:23.049> in<00:01:23.980> our<00:01:24.130> game

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
movements or oh yeah I mean in our game

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.190 
movements or oh yeah I mean in our game
we've<00:01:24.610> got<00:01:24.730> a<00:01:24.760> lot<00:01:24.820> of<00:01:25.060> physics<00:01:25.540> going<00:01:25.840> on<00:01:25.960> so

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
we've got a lot of physics going on so

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.810 
we've got a lot of physics going on so
sometimes<00:01:26.620> there's<00:01:26.860> you<00:01:27.130> know<00:01:27.160> you're<00:01:27.730> going

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
sometimes there's you know you're going

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.760 
sometimes there's you know you're going
to<00:01:27.880> get<00:01:28.000> hit<00:01:28.300> and<00:01:28.570> sometimes<00:01:29.410> you're<00:01:29.530> going<00:01:29.710> to

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
to get hit and sometimes you're going to

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.410 
to get hit and sometimes you're going to
get<00:01:29.860> the<00:01:30.010> impression<00:01:30.250> that<00:01:30.520> you<00:01:30.700> might<00:01:31.000> not<00:01:31.240> be

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
get the impression that you might not be

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.090 
get the impression that you might not be
following<00:01:31.780> you<00:01:31.870> but<00:01:32.320> I<00:01:32.530> mean<00:01:32.860> these<00:01:33.040> things

following you but I mean these things
are<00:01:33.460> super<00:01:33.820> super<00:01:34.150> accurate<00:01:34.450> it's<00:01:34.930> just<00:01:35.110> like

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
are super super accurate it's just like

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.899 
are super super accurate it's just like
in<00:01:35.470> in<00:01:35.830> a<00:01:35.950> game<00:01:36.130> like<00:01:36.159> that<00:01:36.340> there's<00:01:36.670> so<00:01:36.790> much

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
in in a game like that there's so much

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.370 
in in a game like that there's so much
chaos<00:01:37.150> going<00:01:37.480> on<00:01:37.600> so<00:01:37.810> sometimes<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:38.260> might

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
chaos going on so sometimes you might

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.080 
chaos going on so sometimes you might
get<00:01:38.590> stuck<00:01:38.740> you<00:01:38.890> know<00:01:39.010> but<00:01:39.550> they're<00:01:39.670> super

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
get stuck you know but they're super

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.060 
get stuck you know but they're super
fast<00:01:40.300> catching<00:01:40.630> up<00:01:40.900> and<00:01:41.260> like<00:01:41.650> basically

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
fast catching up and like basically

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.280 
fast catching up and like basically
they're<00:01:42.370> almost<00:01:42.850> impossible<00:01:43.150> to<00:01:43.630> trace<00:01:43.840> it's

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
they're almost impossible to trace it's

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.410 
they're almost impossible to trace it's
very

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
very

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.560 
very
I<00:01:46.040> mean<00:01:47.040> as<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.189> game<00:01:47.430> developer<00:01:47.580> you<00:01:47.970> get<00:01:48.330> used

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
I mean as a game developer you get used

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.570 
I mean as a game developer you get used
to<00:01:48.659> trying<00:01:48.900> to<00:01:49.020> cheat<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.350> technology<00:01:50.100> but

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
to trying to cheat the technology but

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.940 
to trying to cheat the technology but
these<00:01:50.820> ones<00:01:51.030> are<00:01:51.150> really<00:01:51.299> hard<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.720> cheat<00:01:51.990> it's

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
these ones are really hard to cheat it's

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.620 
these ones are really hard to cheat it's
pretty<00:01:53.100> cool<00:01:53.280> though<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:54.000> guess<00:01:54.360> it's<00:01:54.390> good

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
pretty cool though so I guess it's good

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.700 
pretty cool though so I guess it's good
for<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.840> players<00:01:55.049> as<00:01:55.320> well<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.619> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
for the players as well in the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.070 
for the players as well in the
competition<00:01:55.860> oh<00:01:56.430> yeah<00:01:56.729> definitely<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.360> think

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
competition oh yeah definitely I think

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.600 
competition oh yeah definitely I think
that's<00:01:58.470> one<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> cool<00:01:58.950> parts<00:01:59.280> about<00:01:59.369> the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
that's one of the cool parts about the

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.700 
that's one of the cool parts about the
game<00:01:59.790> is<00:01:59.939> like<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.270> it's<00:02:00.630> like<00:02:00.810> very<00:02:00.960> very<00:02:01.290> pick

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
game is like it it's like very very pick

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.990 
game is like it it's like very very pick
up<00:02:01.830> and<00:02:01.979> play<00:02:02.159> but<00:02:02.369> also<00:02:02.549> like<00:02:02.820> very

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
up and play but also like very

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.240 
up and play but also like very
skill-based<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:04.110> it's<00:02:04.229> basically<00:02:04.409> it's<00:02:05.100> as

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
skill-based so it's basically it's as

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.180 
skill-based so it's basically it's as
good<00:02:05.430> as<00:02:05.580> you<00:02:05.729> are<00:02:05.759> right<00:02:06.630> it's<00:02:07.289> it<00:02:07.560> detects

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
good as you are right it's it detects

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.800 
good as you are right it's it detects
your<00:02:08.340> moves<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.850> it<00:02:08.910> replicates<00:02:09.450> your<00:02:09.630> moves

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
your moves and it replicates your moves

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.770 
your moves and it replicates your moves
and<00:02:10.590> like<00:02:11.009> it's<00:02:11.970> not<00:02:12.180> about<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.569> learning

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
and like it's not about you learning

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.449 
and like it's not about you learning
come<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.290> understand<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.769> game<00:02:13.980> better<00:02:14.220> just

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
come to understand the game better just

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.100 
come to understand the game better just
like<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.880> learning<00:02:15.269> to<00:02:15.480> understand<00:02:16.019> the

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
like you learning to understand the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.080 
like you learning to understand the
point<00:02:16.319> better<00:02:16.680> so<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.670> make<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:17.880> good<00:02:18.030> point

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
point better so you make a good point

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.670 
point better so you make a good point
about<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.510> physics<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:19.230> game<00:02:19.380> you<00:02:19.560> go

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
about the physics of the game you go

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.020 
about the physics of the game you go
into<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.920> little<00:02:20.010> bit<00:02:20.160> of<00:02:20.280> detail<00:02:20.760> about<00:02:20.970> that

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
into a little bit of detail about that

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.750 
into a little bit of detail about that
like<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:21.900> re<00:02:22.230> actually<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.680> fully<00:02:23.310> physics-based

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
like I re actually a fully physics-based

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.490 
like I re actually a fully physics-based
animation<00:02:24.450> system<00:02:24.600> so<00:02:24.900> like<00:02:25.049> everything<00:02:25.290> you

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
animation system so like everything you

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.890 
animation system so like everything you
see<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:25.799> like<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:25.980> dynamic<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:27.420> result<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:27.810> a

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
see is like a dynamic the result of a

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.900 
see is like a dynamic the result of a
dynamic<00:02:28.260> stimulation<00:02:28.769> so<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.400> can<00:02:29.580> do<00:02:29.670> things

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
dynamic stimulation so I can do things

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.699 
dynamic stimulation so I can do things
like<00:02:30.000> if<00:02:30.239> I<00:02:30.330> hit<00:02:30.510> him<00:02:30.600> if<00:02:30.959> I<00:02:31.110> hit<00:02:31.260> him<00:02:31.319> low<00:02:31.470> he's

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
like if I hit him if I hit him low he's

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.020 
like if I hit him if I hit him low he's
kind<00:02:31.890> of<00:02:31.950> crouched<00:02:32.100> over<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.580> side<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:32.940> I

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
kind of crouched over to the side and I

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.090 
kind of crouched over to the side and I
can<00:02:33.209> push<00:02:33.450> him<00:02:33.600> down<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.049> I<00:02:34.080> keep<00:02:34.230> keep

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
can push him down and I keep keep

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.350 
can push him down and I keep keep
feeding<00:02:35.430> them<00:02:35.519> down<00:02:35.640> like<00:02:35.819> that's<00:02:36.030> right<00:02:36.239> I

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
feeding them down like that's right I

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.509 
feeding them down like that's right I
can<00:02:36.510> really<00:02:36.690> kind<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.930> exploit<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.769> physics

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
can really kind of exploit the physics

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.340 
can really kind of exploit the physics
system<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:38.970> like<00:02:39.150> basically<00:02:39.600> invent<00:02:40.140> my<00:02:40.319> own

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
system to like basically invent my own

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.830 
system to like basically invent my own
moves<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:41.069> I<00:02:41.400> like<00:02:41.970> get<00:02:42.180> silly<00:02:42.450> with<00:02:42.630> it<00:02:42.660> as

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
moves and I like get silly with it as

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.809 
moves and I like get silly with it as
well<00:02:43.049> since<00:02:43.799> we<00:02:43.890> have<00:02:43.920> this<00:02:44.160> one<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.489> one<00:02:44.580> track

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
well since we have this one to one track

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.699 
well since we have this one to one track
and<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.030> can<00:02:45.180> do<00:02:45.269> like<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.810> crocodile<00:02:46.230> puns<00:02:46.500> are

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
and I can do like the crocodile puns are

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.890 
and I can do like the crocodile puns are
like<00:02:46.890> whatever<00:02:47.190> like<00:02:47.400> once<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.269> weird<00:02:48.480> stuff<00:02:48.750> if

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
like whatever like once a weird stuff if

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.810 
like whatever like once a weird stuff if
I<00:02:48.989> want<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.319> it<00:02:49.500> but<00:02:49.799> also<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:50.430> can<00:02:50.549> be<00:02:50.670> like

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
I want to it but also it can be like

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.699 
I want to it but also it can be like
very<00:02:51.030> useful<00:02:51.450> like<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.810> can<00:02:52.079> sweep<00:02:52.350> this<00:02:52.440> card

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
very useful like I can sweep this card

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.880 
very useful like I can sweep this card
away<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.190> hit<00:02:53.370> him<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:53.970> know<00:02:54.709> it's<00:02:55.709> an

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
away and hit him and you know it's an

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.949 
away and hit him and you know it's an
incredibly<00:02:56.549> dynamic<00:02:56.760> like<00:02:57.480> most<00:02:57.660> fighting

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
incredibly dynamic like most fighting

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.810 
incredibly dynamic like most fighting
games<00:02:58.079> are<00:02:58.350> quite<00:02:58.500> static<00:02:58.920> but<00:02:59.100> we<00:02:59.670> basically

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
games are quite static but we basically

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.390 
games are quite static but we basically
just<00:03:00.120> allow<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.900> do<00:03:00.989> anything<00:03:01.280> well<00:03:02.280> that

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
just allow you to do anything well that

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.530 
just allow you to do anything well that
sounds<00:03:02.519> really<00:03:02.790> great<00:03:02.910> maybe<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.269> can<00:03:03.390> show

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
sounds really great maybe you can show

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.699 
sounds really great maybe you can show
us<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.660> little<00:03:03.780> bit<00:03:03.900> of<00:03:03.989> detail<00:03:04.290> about<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.560> game
