outs<00:03:06.260> of<00:03:06.470> 50<00:03:06.860> meters<00:03:07.460> so<00:03:07.760> this<00:03:08.300> is<00:03:08.480> a<00:03:08.630> ranged

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
outs of 50 meters so this is a ranged

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.430 
outs of 50 meters so this is a ranged
ammo<00:03:09.530> type<00:03:09.830> and<00:03:10.040> you<00:03:10.130> should<00:03:10.370> use<00:03:10.790> it<00:03:10.820> as<00:03:11.090> such

ammo type and you should use it as such
how<00:03:12.440> I<00:03:12.470> like<00:03:12.680> to<00:03:12.800> think<00:03:12.950> of<00:03:13.070> it<00:03:13.160> is<00:03:13.280> use<00:03:13.880> maybe

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
how I like to think of it is use maybe

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.830

range but you know try to think of it

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.449 
range but you know try to think of it
like<00:03:44.600> you're<00:03:44.840> using<00:03:45.020> arranged<00:03:45.650> assault<00:03:46.070> rifle

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
using these slow grounds on the spaz 12

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.530 
using these slow grounds on the spaz 12
or<00:03:53.540> 870<00:03:54.170> is<00:03:54.320> that<00:03:55.220> you<00:03:55.340> need<00:03:55.610> to<00:03:55.790> take<00:03:55.970> an<00:03:56.150> extra

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139 
started running them behind those three

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:10.719 
started running them behind those three
guys<00:06:09.289> and<00:06:09.529> just<00:06:09.650> spamming<00:06:10.069> the<00:06:10.279> trigger<00:06:10.520> as

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:10.729

fast as I could but I didn't I kind of

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:15.219 
fast as I could but I didn't I kind of
slowed<00:06:13.370> down<00:06:13.550> took<00:06:13.909> my<00:06:14.089> time<00:06:14.389> to<00:06:14.599> align<00:06:14.990> the

slowed down took my time to align the
shots<00:06:15.469> up<00:06:15.680> and<00:06:15.860> I<00:06:16.339> drop<00:06:16.610> the<00:06:16.729> enemies<00:06:16.969> because

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:17.389 
shots up and I drop the enemies because

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:19.629 
shots up and I drop the enemies because
of<00:06:17.659> the<00:06:17.779> power<00:06:18.110> behind<00:06:18.409> the<00:06:18.919> slug<00:06:19.219> round<00:06:19.460> in

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639 
of the power behind the slug round in

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:23.320 
of the power behind the slug round in
the<00:06:19.819> spass<00:06:20.089> 12<00:06:20.449> or<00:06:20.569> 870<00:06:21.289> you<00:06:21.860> will<00:06:22.189> drop<00:06:22.849> your

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
the spass 12 or 870 you will drop your
