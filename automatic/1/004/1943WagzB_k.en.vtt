00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.240
 hello and welcome to the 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.500
 get to know the question why today 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.660
 I do not remember past lives 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.500
 do not we deal with Buddhism anymore 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.380
 employ 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.880
 then hear about rebirth and 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.980
 maybe not so in the beginning 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.510
 familiar to buddhism then arises 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.250
 and it is perhaps a kind of doubt 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.690
 very strange when I live so many 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.370
 why can not I then 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.410
 once the previous life remember 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.480
 you have to understand that the memory 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.710
 is very limited in this alone 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.320
 life is our memory very much 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.329
 limited we barely know what we did yesterday 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.280
 have eaten the day before yesterday or what we 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.780
 We have noticed on TV 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.489
 Then it is already unclear if we too 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.649
 if that someone asks him two weeks ago 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.030
 Tuesdays at 14 o'clock what do you have there 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.590
 made because they do not know it anymore 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.600
 not unless it was ours 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.460
 birthday person is therefore as a 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.290
 appointment but otherwise we can remember 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.420
 Do not remember us if we did 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.979
 Looking back into our lives, we notice 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.539
 that we have some distinctive point there 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.100
 which we can remember but the 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:11.810
 rest is completely lost 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.520
 now you could say yes his 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.110
 Rebirth is such a distinctive 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.600
 point then I had to turn myself 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.319
 recall 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.450
 dr stevens said 2000 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:26.030
 investigated cases of rebecca nations 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.610
 and noticed that children themselves 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.590
 often still the first four five years 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.380
 can remember their previous lives 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.209
 but then the choice had been considered 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.979
 Experiences of this life the problems 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:38.750
 this lives the wishes of this life 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.640
 the choice let impact the old ones 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.679
 impressions and often is like that 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.929
 you can not go inside the culture circle 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.670
 or Tibet or something like that was born 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:48.319
 but born in the west was then do 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.899
 the parent is a nonsense not 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:53.240
 if in five he says yes my uncle so 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.770
 and so and my brother son to and in 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.660
 Last dm was the and my mother 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.610
 then the parents think often child 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.110
 just does not play and if you are 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.760
 then not really attentive and 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.590
 it could be something 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.000
 it was not then go to these impressions 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.030
 just lost you lose it 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.530
 just do it and the new ones 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.250
 experiences of this life overlap 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.770
 run into 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.330
 now you could say yes but you can 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.250
 yes, that must also be reborn as an animal 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.020
 become or as priest or something 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.450
 why I do not care 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.770
 why can people care if he does 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.660
 not people can repatriate you 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.520
 human lives again because of that 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.340
 Difference from the animal to the human 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.380
 very much bigger now 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.370
 the thought can no longer be imagined 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.530
 to speak a language 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.470
 we could turn as a human without 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.160
 We can speak our language 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.510
 do not really sort thoughts 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.430
 his thoughts are not really here 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.510
 Sort because you need to speak 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.040
 sort things 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.660
 so is the difference from the animal to the 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.370
 People are too big for you 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.930
 you can even remember it and 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.209
 the difference from the praet to people 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.010
 is this big too though the turn 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.810
 But language to language have the 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.120
 Experiences are completely different from that 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.770
 experience we do so these things 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.770
 Let's forget the things that are similar 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.570
 the leave so piece by piece far 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.050
 remember but then we lose 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.630
 also 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.750
 but what we definitely do about him 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.640
 is not worn as a continuum please 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.700
 as a matter of course not something from a to 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.890
 B as a piece of transport so fun 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.660
 not now but as a continuum are the 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.300
 Tilt 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:27.200
 That's why we have children with 405 years 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.360
 the piano genies are children aged 45 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.340
 years the perfect party do not speak 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.080
 there are children who speak party so 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.640
 a language it would be the same if 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.459
 and now to go to the holidays 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.870
 would perfect Latin if we speak 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.290
 very surprising because in particular 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.610
 if the parents do not 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.459
 could not and there are children 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:47.519
 talk paris the language of the brother 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.379
 or the old language derb ali khan 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.049
 written according to perfect partie 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.810
 without the wrong directly to the 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.609
 for example where something comes forth that are 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.909
 tend to take you from earlier 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.319
 you have brought skills out of you 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:03.510
 former life with this kind of 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.700
 We will not let any more prodigies off 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.159
 wonder if we understood how 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.389
 These things can work on me 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.849
 former lives just do not remember 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:13.769
 because the difference is too big and 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.229
 because our memory already lives on this 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.370
 is quite doubtful 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:20.449
 Thanks for turning on until 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.449
 know next buddhism
