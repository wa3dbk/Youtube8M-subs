00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:51.609 
downtown areas and people seem to be

downtown areas and people seem to be
enjoying<00:01:51.729> with<00:01:52.090> us<00:01:52.209> all<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.979> art<00:01:53.979> you<00:01:54.729> think

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.520 
enjoying with us all the art you think
so<00:01:55.060> i<00:01:55.090> think<00:01:55.209> the<00:01:55.420> side<00:01:55.659> of<00:01:55.689> the<00:01:55.840> sides<00:01:56.140> just

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
so i think the side of the sides just

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.830 
so i think the side of the sides just
like<00:01:56.649> the<00:01:57.280> sheer<00:01:57.549> and<00:01:58.030> then<00:01:58.450> also<00:01:58.569> when<00:01:58.750> you

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
like the sheer and then also when you

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.330 
like the sheer and then also when you
see<00:01:58.990> like<00:01:59.140> an<00:01:59.229> open<00:01:59.500> door<00:01:59.679> and<00:01:59.890> then<00:02:00.009> there's

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
see like an open door and then there's

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.490 
see like an open door and then there's
this<00:02:00.459> whole<00:02:00.700> world<00:02:00.969> of<00:02:01.479> you<00:02:02.229> know<00:02:02.259> i<00:02:02.349> think

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
this whole world of you know i think

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.260 
this whole world of you know i think
there<00:02:02.979> there's<00:02:03.369> a<00:02:03.429> lot<00:02:03.549> of<00:02:03.579> variety<00:02:04.060> in<00:02:04.090> each

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
there there's a lot of variety in each

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.209 
there there's a lot of variety in each
room<00:02:04.479> you<00:02:04.659> go<00:02:04.780> into<00:02:05.109> i<00:02:05.319> think<00:02:05.829> that<00:02:05.950> was<00:02:06.039> pretty

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
room you go into i think that was pretty

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.040 
room you go into i think that was pretty
impressive

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.650 

i<00:02:09.110> think<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:10.010> space<00:02:10.040> itself<00:02:10.520> made<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.360> huge

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
i think the space itself made a huge

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.280 
i think the space itself made a huge
impact<00:02:12.370> and<00:02:13.370> it<00:02:14.330> was<00:02:14.570> fantastic<00:02:14.750> a<00:02:15.260> great

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
impact and it was fantastic a great

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.040
