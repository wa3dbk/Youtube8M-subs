hunting they're looking for food but you
can<00:02:53.950> definitely<00:02:54.129> see<00:02:54.639> that<00:02:55.090> even<00:02:55.359> though<00:02:55.510> this

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
can definitely see that even though this

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.170 
can definitely see that even though this
is<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.620> close<00:02:56.859> relative<00:02:57.099> to<00:02:57.579> the<00:02:57.669> Copperhead

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
is a close relative to the Copperhead

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.119 
is a close relative to the Copperhead
there<00:02:59.019> is<00:02:59.139> a<00:02:59.169> difference<00:02:59.590> in<00:02:59.739> pattern

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
there is a difference in pattern

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.280 
there is a difference in pattern
although<00:03:00.549> when<00:03:00.760> they're<00:03:00.939> juveniles<00:03:01.810> they<00:03:02.139> can

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
although when they're juveniles they can

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.050 
although when they're juveniles they can
actually<00:03:02.439> be<00:03:02.680> confused<00:03:03.069> quite<00:03:03.250> a<00:03:03.280> bit<00:03:03.489> and<00:03:03.939> I'm

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
actually be confused quite a bit and I'm

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.970 
actually be confused quite a bit and I'm
about<00:03:04.239> to<00:03:04.389> show<00:03:04.510> you<00:03:04.599> that<00:03:04.780> right<00:03:04.959> now<00:03:07.980> alright

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
about to show you that right now alright

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.190 
about to show you that right now alright
now<00:03:09.219> this<00:03:09.459> little<00:03:09.879> guy<00:03:10.060> is<00:03:10.359> actually<00:03:10.930> the

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
now this little guy is actually the

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.740 
now this little guy is actually the
juvenile<00:03:11.769> cottonmouth<00:03:12.459> or<00:03:13.000> water<00:03:13.510> mark

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
juvenile cottonmouth or water mark

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.149 
juvenile cottonmouth or water mark
moccasin<00:03:14.319> just<00:03:14.500> like<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.739> other<00:03:14.919> two<00:03:15.069> that

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
moccasin just like the other two that

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.309 
moccasin just like the other two that
you<00:03:15.250> just<00:03:15.459> saw<00:03:15.669> but<00:03:16.659> the<00:03:16.780> difference<00:03:17.169> with

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
you just saw but the difference with

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.920 
you just saw but the difference with
this<00:03:17.470> one<00:03:17.530> is<00:03:17.739> because<00:03:18.220> it's<00:03:18.430> so<00:03:18.579> small<00:03:18.930> it

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
this one is because it's so small it

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.780 
this one is because it's so small it
actually<00:03:20.349> has<00:03:20.530> a<00:03:20.560> lot<00:03:20.829> of<00:03:20.889> its<00:03:21.129> pattern<00:03:21.549> still

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
actually has a lot of its pattern still

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.129 
actually has a lot of its pattern still
and<00:03:21.909> it<00:03:21.970> doesn't<00:03:22.209> have<00:03:22.329> all<00:03:22.359> of<00:03:22.659> that<00:03:22.840> black

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
and it doesn't have all of that black

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:26.099 
and it doesn't have all of that black
well<00:03:24.069> you<00:03:24.159> could<00:03:24.340> still<00:03:24.609> see<00:03:24.909> the<00:03:25.180> markings<00:03:25.870> on

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
well you could still see the markings on

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:27.750 
well you could still see the markings on
the<00:03:26.229> side<00:03:26.440> of<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.620> face<00:03:26.829> pretty<00:03:27.129> good<00:03:27.430> and

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
the side of the face pretty good and

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.729 
the side of the face pretty good and
there<00:03:28.419> is<00:03:28.449> a<00:03:28.569> big<00:03:28.840> difference<00:03:29.199> between<00:03:29.349> these

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
there is a big difference between these

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.460 
there is a big difference between these
and<00:03:29.799> the<00:03:30.069> copperheads<00:03:30.750> some<00:03:31.750> similarities

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
and the copperheads some similarities

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.770 
and the copperheads some similarities
but<00:03:32.650> also<00:03:32.709> a<00:03:32.979> lot<00:03:33.159> of<00:03:33.250> differences<00:03:33.780> they're

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
but also a lot of differences they're

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.050 
but also a lot of differences they're
usually<00:03:34.959> much<00:03:35.530> darker<00:03:36.040> they're<00:03:36.280> Banta<00:03:36.669> darker

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
usually much darker they're Banta darker

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.059 
usually much darker they're Banta darker
there's<00:03:37.269> a<00:03:37.329> lot<00:03:37.479> more<00:03:37.629> Browns<00:03:37.989> and<00:03:38.500> tans<00:03:38.560> in

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
there's a lot more Browns and tans in

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.949
