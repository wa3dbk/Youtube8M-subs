00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
crazy if you don't keep control of it

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.520 
crazy if you don't keep control of it
it's<00:03:23.580> not<00:03:23.760> really<00:03:24.150> it's<00:03:24.720> kind<00:03:24.990> of<00:03:25.110> course

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
it's not really it's kind of course

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.050 
it's not really it's kind of course
filling<00:03:25.980> it's<00:03:26.130> kind<00:03:26.310> of<00:03:26.400> thicker<00:03:26.640> it's<00:03:26.880> not

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
filling it's kind of thicker it's not

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.940 
filling it's kind of thicker it's not
really<00:03:27.390> I<00:03:27.570> don't<00:03:27.630> think<00:03:27.900> it's<00:03:28.020> as<00:03:28.140> fine<00:03:28.680> as

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
really I don't think it's as fine as

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.070 
really I don't think it's as fine as
like<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.250> Monster<00:03:29.580> High<00:03:29.760> hair<00:03:30.000> it's<00:03:30.720> probably

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080

close up look of her face here

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.940 
close up look of her face here
so<00:04:24.300> here's<00:04:24.630> Princess<00:04:24.990> Lunas<00:04:25.350> face<00:04:25.560> she<00:04:25.920> got

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
mostly like blue hair with logic bunch

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.900 
mostly like blue hair with logic bunch
of<00:04:28.320> little<00:04:28.470> purple<00:04:28.770> highlights<00:04:28.890> and<00:04:29.250> then

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
of little purple highlights and then

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.490 
of little purple highlights and then
there's<00:04:30.180> brighter<00:04:30.390> pink<00:04:30.690> and<00:04:30.900> darker<00:04:31.170> purple

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
there's brighter pink and darker purple

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.230 
there's brighter pink and darker purple
highlight<00:04:31.770> right<00:04:31.950> here<00:04:32.190> and<00:04:32.370> her<00:04:32.970> hair<00:04:33.210> is

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
highlight right here and her hair is

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.840 
highlight right here and her hair is
about<00:04:33.480> the<00:04:33.570> same<00:04:33.780> texture<00:04:34.310> so<00:04:35.310> really<00:04:35.670> it's

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
about the same texture so really it's

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.750 
about the same texture so really it's
it's<00:04:36.150> not<00:04:37.140> as<00:04:37.320> like<00:04:37.740> smooth<00:04:38.130> as<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.430> Monster

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
it's not as like smooth as the Monster

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.940 
it's not as like smooth as the Monster
High<00:04:38.910> hair<00:04:39.450> it's<00:04:39.690> more<00:04:40.020> like<00:04:40.230> a<00:04:40.410> thicker<00:04:40.650> hair

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
High hair it's more like a thicker hair

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.190 
High hair it's more like a thicker hair
more<00:04:41.130> coarse<00:04:41.520> hair<00:04:41.790> so<00:04:42.690> it's<00:04:42.780> probable<00:04:43.080> but

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
more coarse hair so it's probable but

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.870 
more coarse hair so it's probable but
cheaper<00:04:43.620> so<00:04:43.860> I<00:04:43.890> can<00:04:44.130> just<00:04:44.280> see<00:04:44.370> it<00:04:44.460> getting<00:04:44.670> if

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
cheaper so I can just see it getting if

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.550 
cheaper so I can just see it getting if
