00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.220
 quattro rallye is a very fast one 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.010
 rally 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.050
 that means you have to let it go too 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.670
 This is scary when I do too 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.800
 The car is so strong 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.770
 a study cranach on the brake and 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.699
 who just has the necessary feeling that 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.699
 will be right up front 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.640
 So the people and in the southern part of 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.530
 dÃ¶ring are all sitting in a good mood the 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.700
 sidewalks but falls completely 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.700
 say great experience 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.380
 we had 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.290
 yes, of course it was absolutely fun 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.510
 and so I have the feedback now too 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.060
 from all the hustle and bustle has received 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.680
 that's just great fun and me 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.680
 I'm really looking forward to the future 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.670
 It was super exciting again now 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:58.930
 times in the cup then looking for a tight story 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.420
 At the end of the julius 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.889
 enforced july is a tradition to 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.629
 that great job done until the end 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:06.159
 No mistakes were super fast 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.109
 be therefore obtained by the 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.689
 so to get up close and personal the whole 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.400
 time has unfortunately been proclaimed 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:14.700
 Now we have to move forward to the next one 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.700
 to run
