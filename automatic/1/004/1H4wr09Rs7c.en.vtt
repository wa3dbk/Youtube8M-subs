00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.529
 in alcobaça now with very huge asymmetry in grana 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.630
 He that 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.330
 is a lecture today at the event that ends today in araçatuba roseana 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.169
 he will talk about the theme 2012 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:17.880
 other themes and at the end of time 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.009
 very good if teacher is fine 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.609
 Good morning, Brazil. I want to make a 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.980
 the proviso is an example of correction and the circumstantial moment 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.310
 work in the clubs 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.149
 but I did engineering in the polytechnic school of the physical usp and also 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.130
 I'm graduated from college of medicine from usp 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.850
 in the field of physiotherapy 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.400
 Hypnosis is part of a walk while men run as well 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.520
 are among those processes are infected 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.230
 failed because this 2012 theme or smoke and in the end what 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.000
 it's in 2011 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.540
 avoid some time 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.890
 we will have lots of media and lots of people groups from all over the world 

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:05.840
 he prepares for a 2012 turnaround 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.100
 in terms of Mayan prophecies of prophecies around the world 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.100
 like other day prophecies or 20 meters 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.240
 in the past 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.310
 looking for land to hire 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.350
 idea of ​​what will happen next year in the year 2000 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.240
 the year 2012 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.380
 what's there 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.390
 has particular ' 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.770
 a lot of things 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.190
 based 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.510
 on me because if the Mayan calendar calls 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.140
 so on our basis 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.850
 our idea is to demystify places the year 2012 as human as another 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.480
 but I want to prove scientifically that it has nothing to do 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.439
 involve collaro 2012 with ufology with 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.770
 the appearance more and more frequent and more intense 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.700
 of unidentified flying objects around the world used small radars 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.740
 witnessed 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.200
 talk about the end of time what it has to do with it 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.200
 in 2005 is a year-end year 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:17.290
 the world will end this fact 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.390
 in a few billion years 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.589
 because in the history of the universe the stars as for example in the social 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:26.679
 You're born. 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:32.040
 I have a growth has an evolution and one day this star will end 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.539
 One day my father's crisis is going from one 

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:42.109
 a star like ours for 1 step in a stage of a red giant and 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.109
 when that happened planet earth 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:46.979
 will be involved 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:48.509
 by the salt itself 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:52.679
 but this would take billions has nothing to do with which of them best days 

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:53.529
 behind 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:55.899
 Why do not you drop so much comment? 

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:57.859
 the fight of prophecy 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.859
 in all the year 2012 teacher 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:04.740
 has a lot to do with the so-called Mayan calendar 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.859
 which is actually a calendar with the foot 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.479
 who were few who should 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:13.149
 nothing in the mexico region 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:15.999
 currently 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:19.079
 Central America and that they 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.109
 5 thousand years ago 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.769
 already made impressive astronomical calculations 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.549
 in particular one of the calculations they made 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:28.659
 the reason 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.269
 so see what he can comment on but it will be tonight 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.689
 these astronomical calculations for example 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.529
 he spoke appreciation of the equinoxes 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:44.079
 the precession of the equinoxes is one of the movements of planet earth 

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:48.009
 and this precision of the equinoxes that they calculated see 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:51.009
 a long time ago girls 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:55.909
 It concerns a pity that can go from 25 thousand years approximately 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:58.549
 that the axis of the earth 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.019
 in this amazing and wonderful movement of our planet our home 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:05.520
 delay 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.709
 to make a complete lap about 26 thousand years 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.129
 around 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.129
 and the fairest stones and then the Mayans and Aztecs 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.349
 and the Indians also 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:21.150
 divided in September and October 26 and 21 years in five of them 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.960
 and realized that in each 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.220
 end of this zeros there were some 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.669
 occurrence 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.460
 scholars pick up on these occurrences 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.379
 this calendar 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:35.639
 and began to realize that we are now in 2012 at the end 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:37.490
 give wings 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.020
 these funds and therefore began to 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.210
 to prophesy now in 2012 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.990
 in December at the end of the cup 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.240
 this era 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.900
 of one leg 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.150
 all touch of the USA appreciation doe that one of the equinoxes that is the 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.850
 planet earth if you start talking then there's something 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:00.809
 would be 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:02.919
 So I think this is a 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.600
 Indomitable a calendar change as is our calendar change 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.360
 as 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.900
 But today we are going to detail and come, but they are good. 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.029
 approaches that are seen 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:21.580
 the planet nibiru I become what you talk about the planet of creation 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.790
 the planet 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.770
 sucks on the planet xix 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.099
 the defender kolo touré bodies that talk so much 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:30.819
 We want to fight for this. 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:32.419
 and placing 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:34.530
 academic science 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.160
 to explain why he
