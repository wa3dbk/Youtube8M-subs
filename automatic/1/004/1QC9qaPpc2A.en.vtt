we've<00:00:00.599> now<00:00:00.930> heard<00:00:01.199> about<00:00:01.500> crime<00:00:02.100> and<00:00:02.129> we've

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
we've now heard about crime and we've

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.370 
we've now heard about crime and we've
heard<00:00:02.790> about<00:00:02.939> interrogations<00:00:03.780> and<00:00:04.020> that

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
heard about interrogations and that

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.650

naturally leads us into our next talk
which<00:00:07.589> is<00:00:07.740> about<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.099> way<00:00:08.189> in<00:00:08.309> neuroscience

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
which is about the way in neuroscience

many<00:00:28.800> people<00:00:28.980> think<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.490> astonishing<00:00:30.179> new

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
many people think the astonishing new

many people think the astonishing new

already<00:00:36.270> today<00:00:36.809> my<00:00:37.559> message<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.190> very<00:00:38.399> simple

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
already today my message is very simple

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.170 
already today my message is very simple
it<00:00:39.180> doesn't<00:00:39.809> certainly<00:00:40.739> not<00:00:40.950> yet<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.550> maybe

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
it doesn't certainly not yet and maybe

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.470 
it doesn't certainly not yet and maybe
never<00:00:43.100> before<00:00:44.100> i<00:00:44.129> get<00:00:44.430> into<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.670> body<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.329> my

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
never before i get into the body of my

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.270 
never before i get into the body of my
talk<00:00:45.690> i<00:00:45.840> should<00:00:46.079> say<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:47.039> far

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
talk i should say that so far

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.040 
talk i should say that so far
neuroscience<00:00:47.969> does<00:00:48.090> not<00:00:48.239> seem<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.539> be<00:00:48.690> used

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
neuroscience does not seem to be used

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.010 
neuroscience does not seem to be used
all<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.739> much<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.640> courtroom<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.510> said

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
all that much in the courtroom it said

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.569 
all that much in the courtroom it said
anecdotally<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.710> it's<00:00:52.980> used<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.430> death

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
anecdotally that it's used in death

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.150 
anecdotally that it's used in death
penalty<00:00:53.760> cases<00:00:54.030> but<00:00:54.809> again<00:00:55.559> there<00:00:55.890> are<00:00:56.010> no

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
penalty cases but again there are no

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.920 
penalty cases but again there are no
hard<00:00:56.190> data<00:00:56.550> about<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.390> think<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
hard data about that I think in the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.849 
hard data about that I think in the
future<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.500> will<00:00:58.590> certainly<00:00:58.949> be<00:00:59.219> used<00:00:59.250> more

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859
