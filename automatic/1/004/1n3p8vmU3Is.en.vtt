00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.460 

let's<00:00:01.380> look<00:00:01.560> at<00:00:01.740> the<00:00:01.800> effects<00:00:02.159> of<00:00:02.399> flavonoid

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:03.470 
let's look at the effects of flavonoid

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.660 
let's look at the effects of flavonoid
before<00:00:04.470> we<00:00:04.589> get<00:00:04.740> to<00:00:04.859> know<00:00:05.009> more<00:00:05.609> about

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
before we get to know more about

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.150 
before we get to know more about
flavonoid<00:00:06.540> let's<00:00:06.960> discuss<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.500> little<00:00:07.919> of<00:00:08.040> the

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
flavonoid let's discuss a little of the

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.299 
flavonoid let's discuss a little of the
importance<00:00:08.730> of<00:00:08.910> blood<00:00:09.360> vessels<00:00:09.960> as<00:00:10.830> we<00:00:11.099> know

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
importance of blood vessels as we know

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.749 
importance of blood vessels as we know
our<00:00:11.759> lives<00:00:12.150> depend<00:00:12.809> on<00:00:12.990> blood<00:00:13.519> that<00:00:14.519> is

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
our lives depend on blood that is

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.269 
our lives depend on blood that is
because<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.450> blood<00:00:15.660> carries<00:00:16.289> nutrients<00:00:16.980> to

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
because the blood carries nutrients to

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.390 
because the blood carries nutrients to
all<00:00:17.460> parts<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:17.970> our<00:00:18.090> body<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:19.350> every<00:00:20.039> cell

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
all parts of our body and to every cell

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.970 
all parts of our body and to every cell
the<00:00:21.000> blood<00:00:21.210> brings<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:22.170> nutrients<00:00:22.710> and

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
the blood brings the nutrients and

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.400 
the blood brings the nutrients and
carries<00:00:23.730> away<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.000> waste<00:00:24.449> products<00:00:25.050> from<00:00:25.170> the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
carries away the waste products from the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.980 
carries away the waste products from the
cells<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.099> living<00:00:26.400> process<00:00:26.820> we<00:00:27.720> therefore

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
cells in the living process we therefore

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.290 
cells in the living process we therefore
know<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.619> importance<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.580> proper<00:00:30.060> blood

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
know the importance of proper blood

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.450 
know the importance of proper blood
circulation<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.170> flows<00:00:31.500> within<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.250> blood

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
circulation that flows within the blood

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.810 
circulation that flows within the blood
cells<00:00:32.730> we<00:00:33.719> also<00:00:33.960> know<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:35.160> there<00:00:35.399> are<00:00:35.489> so

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
cells we also know that there are so

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.850 
cells we also know that there are so
many<00:00:35.850> blood<00:00:36.329> vessels<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:36.870> our<00:00:36.989> body<00:00:37.230> namely

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
many blood vessels in our body namely

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.430 
many blood vessels in our body namely
the<00:00:37.980> arteries<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.489> veins<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.270> capillaries

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
the main vessels the branches and all

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.760 
the main vessels the branches and all
those<00:00:42.629> tiny<00:00:43.050> vessels<00:00:44.329> if<00:00:45.329> we<00:00:45.930> were<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.260> connect

those tiny vessels if we were to connect

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.420 
those tiny vessels if we were to connect
it<00:00:46.950> up<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.430> would<00:00:47.670> produce<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.270> length<00:00:48.539> of

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
it up it would produce a length of

100,000 kilometers this length equals to

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.860 
100,000 kilometers this length equals to
rounding<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.149> earth<00:00:54.390> for<00:00:55.289> 3<00:00:55.739> times<00:00:56.510> can<00:00:57.510> you

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
rounding the earth for 3 times can you

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.979 
rounding the earth for 3 times can you
imagine<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.640> is<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.270> length<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.750> all

our blood vessel is having a problem as
mentioned<00:01:20.180> before<00:01:20.600> when<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:21.260> level<00:01:21.590> of

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
mentioned before when the level of

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.340 
mentioned before when the level of
cholesterol<00:01:22.160> is<00:01:22.370> too<00:01:22.580> high<00:01:22.970> it<00:01:23.780> gradually

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
cholesterol is too high it gradually

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.380 
cholesterol is too high it gradually
hardens<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.220> blood<00:01:25.430> vessel<00:01:25.790> lining<00:01:25.970> and

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
hardens the blood vessel lining and

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.670 
hardens the blood vessel lining and
eventually<00:01:27.290> loses<00:01:28.070> its<00:01:28.520> elasticity<00:01:29.560> just<00:01:30.560> as

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
eventually loses its elasticity just as

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.160 
eventually loses its elasticity just as
the<00:01:30.830> vessel<00:01:31.160> becomes<00:01:31.430> stiff<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.750> passage

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
the vessel becomes stiff the passage

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.100 
the vessel becomes stiff the passage
becomes<00:01:33.560> narrow<00:01:34.220> and<00:01:34.610> in<00:01:35.090> some<00:01:35.360> parts<00:01:35.600> even

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
becomes narrow and in some parts even

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.390 
becomes narrow and in some parts even
blockage<00:01:36.979> is<00:01:37.400> experienced<00:01:38.350> this<00:01:39.350> is<00:01:39.830> the

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
blockage is experienced this is the

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.660 
blockage is experienced this is the
reason<00:01:40.820> behind<00:01:41.030> what<00:01:41.900> causes<00:01:42.290> illnesses<00:01:43.280> to

the main functions of flavonoid are as

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.140 
the main functions of flavonoid are as
follows<00:01:50.150> one<00:01:51.170> in<00:01:52.170> recent<00:01:52.680> studies<00:01:53.150> flavonoid

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
follows one in recent studies flavonoid

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.600 
follows one in recent studies flavonoid
is<00:01:54.330> able<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.900> expand<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.680> blood<00:01:55.920> vessels<00:01:56.340> and

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
is able to expand the blood vessels and

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.300 
is able to expand the blood vessels and
increase<00:01:57.240> its<00:01:57.600> elasticity<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.590> therefore

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
increase its elasticity and therefore

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.710 
increase its elasticity and therefore
improving<00:02:00.150> the<00:02:00.270> blood<00:02:00.510> circulation<00:02:02.720> this

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
improving the blood circulation this

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.960 
improving the blood circulation this
essentially<00:02:04.560> helps<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.100> treat<00:02:05.370> adult
