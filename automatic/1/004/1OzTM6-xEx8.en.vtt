00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
the drag are going to allow us to throw

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.229 
the drag are going to allow us to throw
either<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.870> those<00:00:52.020> hot<00:00:52.350> against<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.890> blitz

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
now of course it doesn't mean that you

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.080 
now of course it doesn't mean that you
can't<00:00:55.860> throw<00:00:56.100> other<00:00:56.250> roads<00:00:56.550> as<00:00:56.699> well<00:00:56.730> you're

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
can't throw other roads as well you're

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.160 
can't throw other roads as well you're
still<00:00:57.360> going<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.690> able<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.899> throw<00:00:58.109> to

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
what we can do then is wait a little

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.030 
what we can do then is wait a little

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
few zones of course so likely dropping

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.080 
few zones of course so likely dropping
eight<00:01:28.680> guys<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.130> coverage<00:01:29.460> for<00:01:29.850> them

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
eight guys in the coverage for them

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.660 
eight guys in the coverage for them

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
likely in zone and the rest of them will

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.910 
likely in zone and the rest of them will
be<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:32.939> man<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:34.020> going<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.259> be<00:01:34.350> tough<00:01:34.650> to

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
be in man so it's going to be tough to

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.380 
be in man so it's going to be tough to
throw<00:01:35.070> those<00:01:35.250> corners<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.000> those<00:01:36.150> whips

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
throw those corners and those whips

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.200 
throw those corners and those whips
underneath<00:01:36.840> with<00:01:37.439> all<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.829> coverage<00:01:38.340> but
