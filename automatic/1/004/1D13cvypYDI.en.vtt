lantern battery and open it up you can

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.049 
lantern battery and open it up you can
get<00:00:40.590> out<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.120> 32<00:00:42.290> double-a<00:00:43.290> sized

batteries<00:00:47.570> let's<00:00:48.570> see<00:00:48.809> if<00:00:49.140> that's<00:00:49.500> true<00:00:49.860> I

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
batteries let's see if that's true I

00:00:51.199 --> 00:01:03.590 
batteries let's see if that's true I
have<00:00:52.199> here<00:00:53.090> one<00:00:54.090> at<00:00:54.270> lantern<00:00:56.000> working

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:11.190 

six<00:01:04.350> volt<00:01:05.270> lantern<00:01:06.270> battery

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.120 

now

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
now

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.870 
now
what<00:01:13.729> else<00:01:13.880> runs<00:01:14.180> off<00:01:14.360> of<00:01:14.390> six<00:01:14.750> volts<00:01:15.880> little

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
what else runs off of six volts little

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.800 
what else runs off of six volts little
drill

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.090 

actually<00:01:22.710> it's<00:01:23.659> four<00:01:24.659> double<00:01:25.619> A<00:01:25.710> batteries

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.580 

now<00:01:30.229> let's<00:01:31.229> see<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:32.180> this<00:01:33.200> large<00:01:34.200> enough<00:01:34.560> to

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
now let's see is this large enough to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:46.530 
now let's see is this large enough to
hold<00:01:34.979> 32<00:01:35.780> double-a<00:01:36.780> batteries<00:01:38.689> let's<00:01:39.689> see

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.270 

it's<00:01:46.750> too<00:01:47.050> wide

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.740 

three-wide

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
three-wide

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.570 
three-wide
for<00:01:55.380> wide

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.360 

not<00:02:00.240> quite<00:02:00.600> five<00:02:01.020> wide<00:02:02.390> but<00:02:03.530> we<00:02:04.530> can<00:02:04.740> look<00:02:05.190> at

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
not quite five wide but we can look at

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.520 
not quite five wide but we can look at
say<00:02:05.580> four<00:02:06.330> wide<00:02:06.860> by<00:02:07.860> four<00:02:08.280> wide<00:02:09.260> sixteen<00:02:10.260> in

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
say four wide by four wide sixteen in

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.770 
say four wide by four wide sixteen in
two<00:02:11.460> layers<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:12.000> 32

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
two layers is 32

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.300 
two layers is 32
it<00:02:13.560> may<00:02:13.830> be<00:02:13.970> big<00:02:14.970> enough<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.390> hold<00:02:15.510> 32<00:02:16.310> but

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
it may be big enough to hold 32 but

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.950 
it may be big enough to hold 32 but
let's<00:02:17.520> check<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.940> this<00:02:18.090> way<00:02:18.330> it's<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.690> tall

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
let's check it this way it's a tall

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.340 
let's check it this way it's a tall
enough<00:02:20.060> set<00:02:21.060> this<00:02:21.270> on<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.570> ground<00:02:21.870> remember

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
enough set this on the ground remember

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.510 
enough set this on the ground remember
there<00:02:22.590> will<00:02:22.650> be<00:02:22.710> a<00:02:22.830> layer<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.250> plastic

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
there will be a layer of plastic

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.130 
there will be a layer of plastic
underneath<00:02:24.150> this<00:02:24.480> 6-volt<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:26.250> hold<00:02:26.460> them<00:02:26.640> in

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
underneath this 6-volt to hold them in

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.060 
underneath this 6-volt to hold them in
set<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.290> second-straight<00:02:29.190> on<00:02:29.340> top<00:02:29.580> of<00:02:29.790> it<00:02:31.070> and

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
set the second-straight on top of it and

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.470 
set the second-straight on top of it and
it's<00:02:32.340> difficult<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:33.030> see<00:02:33.120> from<00:02:33.420> here<00:02:33.810> but

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
it's difficult to see from here but

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.830 
it's difficult to see from here but
these<00:02:36.480> six<00:02:37.020> felt<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:38.340> double<00:02:39.300> legs<00:02:39.480> are

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
these six felt the double legs are

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.560 
these six felt the double legs are
slightly<00:02:40.680> higher<00:02:40.890> than<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.670> top<00:02:41.850> of<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.210> six

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
slightly higher than the top of the six

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:50.570 
slightly higher than the top of the six
volt<00:02:43.130> so<00:02:44.130> won't<00:02:44.520> fit<00:02:44.820> that<00:02:45.090> way<00:02:46.580> now<00:02:49.580> since

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
volt so won't fit that way now since

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.650 
volt so won't fit that way now since
they<00:02:51.060> opened<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.630> up<00:02:51.780> in<00:02:51.990> the<00:02:52.080> video<00:02:53.660> we'll

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
they opened it up in the video we'll

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.360 
they opened it up in the video we'll
open<00:02:54.810> this<00:02:55.110> one<00:02:55.290> up<00:02:55.350> too<00:02:56.570> now<00:02:58.100> they<00:02:59.100> rip<00:02:59.340> the

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
open this one up too now they rip the

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.930 
open this one up too now they rip the
label<00:02:59.640> off<00:03:00.350> but<00:03:01.350> I'm<00:03:01.980> not<00:03:02.280> going<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.670> worry

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
label off but I'm not going to worry

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.699 
label off but I'm not going to worry
about<00:03:03.120> taking<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.870> label<00:03:04.290> off<00:03:04.440> of<00:03:04.590> this

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
about taking the label off of this

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.640 
about taking the label off of this
because<00:03:05.040> it's<00:03:05.280> not<00:03:05.370> really<00:03:05.790> in<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.000> way<00:03:06.180> I<00:03:06.650> can

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
because it's not really in the way I can

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.860 
because it's not really in the way I can
take<00:03:08.340> off<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.550> top<00:03:08.910> without<00:03:09.180> ripping<00:03:09.750> into

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
take off the top without ripping into

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.780 
take off the top without ripping into
the<00:03:10.080> label

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:21.630 

let's<00:03:13.390> proceed

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.250 

it's<00:03:22.120> maybe<00:03:22.360> a<00:03:22.480> little<00:03:22.540> more<00:03:22.780> difficult<00:03:23.230> than

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
it's maybe a little more difficult than

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.360 
it's maybe a little more difficult than
I<00:03:23.470> thought<00:03:23.500> I<00:03:25.380> do<00:03:26.380> have<00:03:26.560> a<00:03:26.590> knife<00:03:26.830> right<00:03:27.100> here

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
I thought I do have a knife right here

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.930 
I thought I do have a knife right here
somewhere

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
somewhere

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:41.160 
somewhere
maybe<00:03:28.210> I<00:03:28.360> could<00:03:28.540> use<00:03:28.690> it

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:49.440 

now<00:03:43.270> let's<00:03:44.270> try<00:03:45.170> to<00:03:45.230> open<00:03:45.350> this<00:03:45.740> thing<00:03:45.800> up

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.380 

no<00:03:50.080> probably<00:03:50.980> requires<00:03:51.790> a<00:03:51.940> little<00:03:52.180> more

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
no probably requires a little more

00:03:52.390 --> 00:04:45.820 
no probably requires a little more
finesse<00:03:52.629> than<00:03:52.870> this<00:03:56.370> so<00:03:57.370> let's<00:03:57.610> use<00:03:57.879> a<00:03:57.910> knife

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.470 

we<00:04:46.490> go
