 he has lost the job he wants to relocate 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.429
 in working life 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:15.129

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:21.520
 in its seventh edition when the first 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.779
 it's temple that is a recognized 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.359
 executive of the sector of 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:28.570
 Conceptuality of human resources is 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.520
 with us this afternoon to talk in 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.739
 his book but fundamentally the 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.629
 things that says in it that are very 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.010
 interesting and thank you very much for 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.230
 come thank you very much for the invitation 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.899
 if someone 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:44.520
 lost the job and wants to reintegrate 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:46.840
 in working life what steps must follow 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.720
 I think the most important thing is 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:54.240
 prepare ourselves to realize within the 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:57.300
 preparation that we can not walk 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.820
 asking for work the friends we can not 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.860
 to talk badly about the previous boss 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.660
 but rather we have to focus 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.750
 our attention first inward 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.990
 in us and then where we want 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.310
 go in us to know what we are 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.110
 good we like to do 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.210
 what is our experience our 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.159
 achievements our results and then 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.320
 really think what we want to do to 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.210
 where are we going what kind of work 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.939
 we would like to have in what kind of company 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.039
 what kind organization and then have it in 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.490
 prepare the tools very good 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:32.130
 resume two pages with one 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.450
 that is perfect one can not put 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.829
 mistakes in a resume and then 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.229
 practice your job interviews 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:41.799
 because that's like all life with the 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.960
 practice better now you say something that is 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.560
 important and that is probably a 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.869
 habit 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.420
 many that have to do with asking 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.939
 I work for friends but in the book you 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.689
 You make mention of not losing contact with 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.189
 those key contacts clear what 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:02.270
 heritage, please contact 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:04.520
 and friends to see what happens is that when 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.220
 one asks for work friends contacts 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.380
 related family family politics what 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.569
 what is doing is transferring the 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.220
 responsibility to another is guiding 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.890
 the friends because nobody can 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.769
 get a job the contacts the 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.180
 friends relations what serve us 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.160
 for what they can help us is for 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.170
 be attentive in the market to 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.510
 listen if any position that could 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.050
 interest us to refer us 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.120
 and recommend us to 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.460
 to introduce other people to more people 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.560
 in such a way to expand to cuarte all 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.990
 those who work for third parties to 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.000
 others what we are doing is selling 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.890
 Our professional services by 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.740
 so much do we need to be referred to 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.150
 positively they give good that they say 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.130
 good things about us because 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.770
 finally everyone does not want to work with 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.050
 people you can trust people with 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.240
 good reputation people who are from 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.880
 confidence then for that is that we 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.190
 they serve in quotes the friends do not stop 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.740
 get us work to spread the word 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.190
 curriculum talked sometimes there 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:12.390
 people who believe that by presenting a 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:15.240
 huge curriculum full of diplomas and 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.459
 full of acknowledgments does well does 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.860
 wrong to make a resume to have no more 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.650
 of two pages if a person is young 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.560
 with one is enough is a résumé 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.480
 that should detail achievements and responsible 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.970
 of responsibilities and achievements ie 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.100
 if they entrusted me with such a task that I did 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.290
 respect how to contribute to the result 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.480
 and it must be a document of more as you 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.020
 I said requested without any super bug 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.750
 well diagrammed and you have to start 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:46.270
 chronologically since the last job 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.550
 back and finish in education today 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.740
 Many people from Peru make it wrong 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.960
 backwards upside down what we want to know 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.360
 is what is the last thing you have done if 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.950
 is that you are a good student in what 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.080
 part of your studies are you or when you 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.580
 you graduate but here the subject in a 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.740
 curriculum is not the time to 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.810
 present the supporting documents 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.330
 because it is your word that you are 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.790
 putting and remember that the curriculum 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.770
 will compete with hundreds and many times 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.570
 with thousands of others so you have to 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.970
 cause a good impact so 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:19.120
 professional what serious what good armadito 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.320
 that is how one gets to become 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.690
 a company and because you yourself 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.250
 as a worker and with the expertise that 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.980
 was acquiring in life is a 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.300
 company because as you have a little bit of time 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.200
 all of us who sell our 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.330
 services 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.490
 we live selling our services is 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.890
 say are organizations companies the 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.290
 that they pay us for not being able to work 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.420
 but for doing well the work that we 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:46.020
 have ordered then this is a theme 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.940
 of change of focus because if I 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.980
 I look at myself as a company that 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.380
 sells his services I understand then 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.600
 that the company is my client that my boss 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.370
 it's my client who pays me not to go to 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.340
 work and sit in my chair but 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.050
 to do agreed coordinated things 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.569
 with the boss in which I go to 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:07.029
 meet results I will accomplish tasks 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:08.559
 and I'm going to do it right, I'm the one who 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:09.879
 I'm going to worry about having my skills 

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:11.309
 current 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:14.020
 I will be worried about always having 

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:16.149
 contacts and relationships and be in force 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.219

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:20.349
 a current reputation that if the day of 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:22.899
 tomorrow they do not want my services anymore and I 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:25.059
 I want to get another job 

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:27.159
 I have a validity I have a reputation 

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:29.229
