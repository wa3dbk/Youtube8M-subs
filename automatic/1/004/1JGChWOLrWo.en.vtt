00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 
would I just barely made it in no that's

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.390 
would I just barely made it in no that's
that's<00:07:05.730> the<00:07:05.880> way<00:07:06.000> I<00:07:06.030> see<00:07:06.300> it<00:07:06.560> he<00:07:07.560> can<00:07:07.710> take<00:07:07.890> he

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 
that's the way I see it he can take he

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.190 
that's the way I see it he can take he
can<00:07:08.550> take<00:07:08.700> bad<00:07:08.940> teams<00:07:09.300> and<00:07:09.540> make<00:07:09.690> them<00:07:09.900> great

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.200 
can take bad teams and make them great

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.650 
can take bad teams and make them great
that's<00:07:10.440> what<00:07:10.620> makes<00:07:10.830> LeBron<00:07:11.160> James<00:07:11.490> just<00:07:12.120> he's

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.660 
that's what makes LeBron James just he's

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.590 
that's what makes LeBron James just he's
the<00:07:12.780> best<00:07:12.960> player<00:07:13.110> in<00:07:13.260> the<00:07:13.320> world<00:07:13.410> right<00:07:13.770> now
