absolutely<00:04:23.550> I<00:04:23.940> think<00:04:24.270> it's<00:04:24.630> kind<00:04:24.840> of<00:04:24.900> like<00:04:25.050> the

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
absolutely I think it's kind of like the

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.060 
absolutely I think it's kind of like the
survivor<00:04:26.760> scenario<00:04:27.540> so<00:04:27.810> every<00:04:28.500> few<00:04:28.680> weeks<00:04:28.740> the

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
survivor scenario so every few weeks the

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.860 
survivor scenario so every few weeks the
couple<00:04:29.400> will<00:04:29.550> get<00:04:29.670> voted<00:04:30.030> off<00:04:30.120> some<00:04:30.510> of<00:04:30.540> you

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
couple will get voted off some of you

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.330 
couple will get voted off some of you

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
are fewer to choose from so we narrow

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.580
