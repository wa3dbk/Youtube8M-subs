we<00:00:01.099> were<00:00:01.250> training<00:00:01.550> him<00:00:01.879> to<00:00:01.940> identify<00:00:02.899> all

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:03.080 
we were training him to identify all

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.269 
we were training him to identify all
these<00:00:03.229> different<00:00:03.530> objects<00:00:03.889> he<00:00:04.009> learned<00:00:04.190> to

00:00:04.269 --> 00:00:04.279 
these different objects he learned to

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:06.940 
these different objects he learned to
identify<00:00:04.490> like<00:00:05.420> 50<00:00:05.780> objects<00:00:06.350> in<00:00:06.440> seven<00:00:06.740> colors

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:06.950 
identify like 50 objects in seven colors

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.339 
identify like 50 objects in seven colors
and<00:00:07.640> five<00:00:07.850> shapes<00:00:08.179> and<00:00:08.629> quantities<00:00:09.049> up<00:00:09.230> to

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:09.349 
and five shapes and quantities up to

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:11.980 
and five shapes and quantities up to
about<00:00:09.469> six<00:00:09.830> over<00:00:10.070> the<00:00:10.190> years<00:00:10.690> but<00:00:11.690> the<00:00:11.839> issue

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
about six over the years but the issue

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.839 
about six over the years but the issue
was<00:00:12.320> we<00:00:12.530> started<00:00:12.589> with<00:00:13.190> objects<00:00:13.639> that<00:00:13.730> he

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:13.849 
was we started with objects that he

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.750 
was we started with objects that he
wanted<00:00:14.240> to<00:00:14.419> obtain<00:00:15.079> so<00:00:16.010> it<00:00:16.100> was<00:00:16.190> very<00:00:16.340> easy<00:00:16.580> to

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
wanted to obtain so it was very easy to

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.519 
wanted to obtain so it was very easy to
teach<00:00:17.060> him<00:00:17.240> to<00:00:17.420> label<00:00:17.779> those<00:00:17.929> things<00:00:18.230> because

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
teach him to label those things because

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.169 
teach him to label those things because
hey<00:00:18.679> these<00:00:18.920> were<00:00:19.070> fun<00:00:19.310> he<00:00:19.519> wanted<00:00:19.820> the<00:00:19.910> wood<00:00:20.029> to

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:20.179 
hey these were fun he wanted the wood to

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:21.880 
hey these were fun he wanted the wood to
chew<00:00:20.359> on<00:00:20.570> and<00:00:20.599> the<00:00:20.840> paper<00:00:21.019> to<00:00:21.230> tear<00:00:21.439> apart<00:00:21.679> and

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
chew on and the paper to tear apart and

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.769 
chew on and the paper to tear apart and
things<00:00:22.070> then<00:00:22.730> we<00:00:22.849> started<00:00:23.150> getting<00:00:23.300> two

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
things then we started getting two

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.140 
things then we started getting two
objects<00:00:24.140> that<00:00:24.230> weren't<00:00:24.439> quite<00:00:24.529> as<00:00:24.650> much<00:00:24.830> fun

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
objects that weren't quite as much fun

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.650 
objects that weren't quite as much fun
so<00:00:26.150> we<00:00:26.269> had<00:00:26.449> to<00:00:26.570> teach<00:00:26.779> him<00:00:27.050> the<00:00:27.800> label<00:00:27.980> want<00:00:28.660> so

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
so we had to teach him the label want so

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.720 
so we had to teach him the label want so
that<00:00:29.900> he<00:00:30.109> could<00:00:30.289> ask<00:00:30.529> us<00:00:30.830> for<00:00:31.009> what<00:00:31.160> he<00:00:31.279> wanted

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
that he could ask us for what he wanted

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.549 
that he could ask us for what he wanted
his<00:00:31.849> his<00:00:32.029> reward<00:00:32.570> two<00:00:33.140> separate

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
his his reward two separate

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.549 
his his reward two separate
identification<00:00:34.340> from<00:00:34.489> requests<00:00:35.559> but

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
identification from requests but

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.270 
identification from requests but
sometimes<00:00:37.039> he<00:00:37.250> still<00:00:37.520> just<00:00:37.910> didn't<00:00:38.629> want<00:00:38.840> to

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
sometimes he still just didn't want to

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.770 
sometimes he still just didn't want to
work<00:00:40.280> and<00:00:40.579> he<00:00:40.760> started<00:00:41.120> with<00:00:41.210> this<00:00:41.300> Illumina

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
work and he started with this Illumina

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.840 
work and he started with this Illumina
pack<00:00:42.770> thing<00:00:42.980> what<00:00:43.100> he<00:00:43.190> didn't<00:00:43.430> want<00:00:43.579> to<00:00:43.670> work

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
pack thing what he didn't want to work

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.910 
pack thing what he didn't want to work
or<00:00:44.390> he'd<00:00:44.660> do<00:00:44.780> things<00:00:45.020> like<00:00:45.199> we'd<00:00:45.559> show<00:00:45.770> me

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
or he'd do things like we'd show me

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.939 
or he'd do things like we'd show me
object<00:00:46.399> and<00:00:46.609> if<00:00:47.090> he<00:00:47.210> were<00:00:47.390> not<00:00:48.379> working<00:00:48.829> with

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
object and if he were not working with

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.200 
object and if he were not working with
us<00:00:48.980> we'd<00:00:49.190> say<00:00:49.309> well<00:00:49.460> I'm<00:00:49.609> gonna<00:00:49.730> go<00:00:49.940> away<00:00:50.090> I'm

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
us we'd say well I'm gonna go away I'm

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.509 
us we'd say well I'm gonna go away I'm
gonna<00:00:50.359> give<00:00:50.539> you<00:00:50.600> a<00:00:50.660> timeout<00:00:50.960> so<00:00:51.920> he<00:00:52.219> learned

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
gonna give you a timeout so he learned

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.060 
gonna give you a timeout so he learned
to<00:00:52.760> say<00:00:52.910> I'm<00:00:53.120> gonna<00:00:53.300> go<00:00:53.510> away<00:00:53.600> and<00:00:53.780> he<00:00:54.019> walk<00:00:54.289> to

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
to say I'm gonna go away and he walk to

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.990 
to say I'm gonna go away and he walk to
the<00:00:55.160> edge<00:00:55.250> of<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:55.519> perch<00:00:55.730> and<00:00:55.910> away<00:00:56.120> from<00:00:56.180> us

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
the edge of the perch and away from us

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.099 
the edge of the perch and away from us
sometimes<00:00:59.000> he'd<00:00:59.179> give<00:00:59.359> us<00:00:59.480> all<00:00:59.690> the<00:00:59.960> wrong

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
sometimes he'd give us all the wrong

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.619 
sometimes he'd give us all the wrong
answers<00:01:00.140> so<00:01:01.039> if<00:01:01.280> the<00:01:01.460> answer<00:01:01.760> was<00:01:02.059> one<00:01:02.329> color

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
answers so if the answer was one color

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.760 
answers so if the answer was one color
he<00:01:03.410> would<00:01:03.590> repeat<00:01:03.980> the<00:01:04.160> six<00:01:04.400> wrong<00:01:05.000> colors

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
he would repeat the six wrong colors

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.510 
he would repeat the six wrong colors
like<00:01:06.770> that

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
like that

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.609 
like that
I<00:01:07.700> think<00:01:08.210> it<00:01:08.299> was<00:01:08.390> more<00:01:08.540> fun<00:01:08.869> for<00:01:09.200> him<00:01:09.320> you<00:01:09.470> made

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
I think it was more fun for him you made

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.440 
I think it was more fun for him you made
it<00:01:09.740> more<00:01:09.830> interesting<00:01:09.890> I<00:01:10.400> mean<00:01:10.520> I<00:01:10.759> think<00:01:11.330> at

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
it more interesting I mean I think at

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.820 
it more interesting I mean I think at
some<00:01:11.479> point<00:01:11.689> if<00:01:12.110> he<00:01:12.259> could<00:01:12.409> have<00:01:12.500> said<00:01:12.680> I've

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
some point if he could have said I've

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.940 
some point if he could have said I've
already<00:01:13.159> done<00:01:13.490> that<00:01:14.140> he<00:01:15.140> would<00:01:15.170> have<00:01:15.500> because

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
already done that he would have because

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.310 
already done that he would have because
I<00:01:16.159> would<00:01:16.790> need<00:01:17.000> you<00:01:17.270> know<00:01:17.390> 60<00:01:17.900> sometimes<00:01:18.110> a

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
I would need you know 60 sometimes a

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.380 
I would need you know 60 sometimes a
hundred<00:01:18.650> trials<00:01:18.920> for<00:01:19.790> statistical

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
hundred trials for statistical

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.719 
hundred trials for statistical
significance<00:01:20.960> he<00:01:21.860> would<00:01:22.040> zip<00:01:22.340> through<00:01:22.579> the

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
significance he would zip through the

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.910 
significance he would zip through the
first<00:01:22.970> dozen<00:01:23.360> or<00:01:23.659> an<00:01:23.780> even<00:01:24.049> 20<00:01:24.380> trials<00:01:24.680> because

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
first dozen or an even 20 trials because

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.440 
first dozen or an even 20 trials because
it<00:01:25.040> was<00:01:25.130> fine<00:01:25.340> it<00:01:25.460> was<00:01:25.520> a<00:01:25.610> new<00:01:25.790> project<00:01:26.060> and

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
it was fine it was a new project and

it was fine it was a new project and
then<00:01:26.930> it<00:01:27.020> was<00:01:27.110> like<00:01:27.290> hello<00:01:27.970> yeah<00:01:28.970> we've<00:01:29.149> done

that during your years at Purdue you and
Alex<00:01:46.520> are<00:01:46.670> like<00:01:46.939> vagabonds<00:01:47.659> as<00:01:48.079> I<00:01:48.290> recall<00:01:48.649> well

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
Alex are like vagabonds as I recall well

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.090 
Alex are like vagabonds as I recall well
we<00:01:49.369> you<00:01:50.000> know<00:01:50.119> we<00:01:50.270> we<00:01:50.960> did<00:01:51.320> not<00:01:51.500> have<00:01:51.740> our<00:01:51.950> own

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
we you know we we did not have our own

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.240 
we you know we we did not have our own
lab<00:01:52.490> space<00:01:52.909> basically<00:01:53.689> they<00:01:54.259> shifted<00:01:54.770> us<00:01:54.920> from

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
lab space basically they shifted us from

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.429 
lab space basically they shifted us from
whatever<00:01:55.670> was<00:01:56.119> convenient<00:01:56.659> from<00:01:57.079> one<00:01:57.229> place

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
whatever was convenient from one place

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.130 
whatever was convenient from one place
to<00:01:57.469> another<00:01:57.680> I<00:01:58.360> think<00:01:59.360> we<00:01:59.450> had<00:01:59.659> I<00:01:59.840> don't<00:01:59.990> know

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
to another I think we had I don't know

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.319 
to another I think we had I don't know
if<00:02:00.200> at<00:02:00.469> least<00:02:00.740> three<00:02:01.219> maybe<00:02:01.460> four<00:02:01.820> different

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
if at least three maybe four different

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.420 
if at least three maybe four different
laboratories<00:02:03.110> depending<00:02:03.950> on<00:02:04.039> who<00:02:04.219> needed

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
laboratories depending on who needed

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.200 
laboratories depending on who needed
what<00:02:04.759> space<00:02:05.140> so<00:02:06.399> you<00:02:07.399> know<00:02:07.490> it<00:02:07.640> was<00:02:07.759> just<00:02:07.850> okay

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
what space so you know it was just okay

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.670 
what space so you know it was just okay
whatever<00:02:08.630> you<00:02:08.900> know<00:02:09.020> as<00:02:09.110> long<00:02:09.230> as<00:02:09.350> you<00:02:09.440> let<00:02:09.530> me

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:09.680 
whatever you know as long as you let me

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.280 
whatever you know as long as you let me
do<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.920> work<00:02:10.130> we'll<00:02:11.030> do<00:02:11.180> it<00:02:11.360> but<00:02:12.080> it<00:02:12.200> was

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
do the work we'll do it but it was

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.540 
do the work we'll do it but it was
really<00:02:12.500> difficult<00:02:12.830> because

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
really difficult because

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.630 
really difficult because
time<00:02:13.760> we<00:02:13.880> moved<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.240> lab<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:15.050> interrupted<00:02:15.950> the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
time we moved the lab it interrupted the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.340 
time we moved the lab it interrupted the
training<00:02:17.030> oh<00:02:17.150> sure<00:02:17.540> it<00:02:17.600> did<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:18.140> I<00:02:18.290> would

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
training oh sure it did and I would

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.920 
training oh sure it did and I would
imagine<00:02:18.590> that<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.550> was<00:02:19.700> difficult<00:02:19.910> for<00:02:20.300> Alex

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
imagine that it was difficult for Alex

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.050 
imagine that it was difficult for Alex
initially<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:21.650> make<00:02:21.830> those<00:02:22.040> transitions<00:02:22.340> am<00:02:22.940> I

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
initially to make those transitions am I

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.640 
initially to make those transitions am I
wrong<00:02:23.210> about<00:02:23.420> that<00:02:23.690> no<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:24.110> was<00:02:24.290> you<00:02:24.410> know<00:02:24.530> it

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
wrong about that no it was you know it

wrong about that no it was you know it
was<00:02:24.770> hey<00:02:24.950> you<00:02:25.490> know<00:02:25.580> this<00:02:25.760> was<00:02:25.940> different

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
was hey you know this was different

was hey you know this was different
space<00:02:26.540> is<00:02:26.780> it<00:02:26.930> safe<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:28.370> know<00:02:28.490> and<00:02:28.520> it<00:02:28.730> took

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
space is it safe you know and it took

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.200 
space is it safe you know and it took
him<00:02:29.030> a<00:02:29.120> while<00:02:29.270> to<00:02:29.330> get<00:02:30.050> used<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.380> each<00:02:30.440> space

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
him a while to get used to each space

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.090 
him a while to get used to each space
describe<00:02:32.210> some<00:02:32.630> of<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.960> tests<00:02:33.470> for<00:02:33.650> colors

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
describe some of the tests for colors

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.860 
describe some of the tests for colors
and<00:02:34.370> shapes<00:02:34.670> tell<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.150> audience<00:02:35.300> a<00:02:35.690> little

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
and shapes tell the audience a little

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.200 
and shapes tell the audience a little
bit<00:02:36.020> what<00:02:36.470> that<00:02:36.680> was<00:02:36.980> all<00:02:37.190> about<00:02:37.220> well<00:02:38.000> the

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
bit what that was all about well the

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.250 
bit what that was all about well the
idea<00:02:38.600> was<00:02:38.660> could<00:02:39.260> an<00:02:39.380> animal<00:02:39.590> understand

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
idea was could an animal understand

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.840 
idea was could an animal understand
categories<00:02:42.260> okay<00:02:42.680> and<00:02:43.130> categories<00:02:43.670> in<00:02:43.700> a

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
categories okay and categories in a

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.270 
categories okay and categories in a
hierarchical<00:02:44.480> sense<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.650> idea<00:02:45.830> is<00:02:46.070> not<00:02:46.220> just

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
hierarchical sense the idea is not just

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.220 
hierarchical sense the idea is not just
that<00:02:46.640> this<00:02:46.790> is<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.210> know<00:02:47.330> what's<00:02:47.630> green<00:02:47.900> and

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
that this is you know what's green and

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.920 
that this is you know what's green and
what's<00:02:48.410> not<00:02:48.800> green<00:02:49.190> but<00:02:49.940> that<00:02:50.120> green<00:02:50.390> and<00:02:50.750> blue

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
what's not green but that green and blue

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.920 
what's not green but that green and blue
and<00:02:51.320> yellow<00:02:51.560> etc<00:02:52.220> formed<00:02:52.520> a<00:02:52.610> category<00:02:53.300> that

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
and yellow etc formed a category that

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.010 
and yellow etc formed a category that
could<00:02:54.140> be<00:02:54.230> lumped<00:02:54.530> under<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.980> term<00:02:55.220> color<00:02:55.610> and

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
could be lumped under the term color and

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.690 
could be lumped under the term color and
another<00:02:57.020> category<00:02:57.770> like<00:02:58.100> two<00:02:58.310> three<00:02:58.520> four

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
another category like two three four

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.010 
another category like two three four
five<00:02:58.880> six<00:02:59.030> corner<00:02:59.450> that<00:02:59.570> could<00:02:59.690> be<00:02:59.750> lumped

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
five six corner that could be lumped

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.860 
five six corner that could be lumped
under<00:03:00.170> shape<00:03:00.710> and<00:03:01.070> paper<00:03:01.970> wood<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:02.480> rawhide

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
under shape and paper wood and rawhide

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.710 
under shape and paper wood and rawhide
under<00:03:03.350> material<00:03:04.190> so<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:05.000> idea<00:03:05.270> was<00:03:05.360> learning

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
under material so the idea was learning

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.140 
under material so the idea was learning
a<00:03:05.780> categorical<00:03:06.260> concept<00:03:07.190> label<00:03:07.640> collars

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
a categorical concept label collars

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.360 
a categorical concept label collars
shape<00:03:08.390> matter<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:09.140> then<00:03:09.800> learning<00:03:10.040> which

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
shape matter and then learning which

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.760 
shape matter and then learning which
colors<00:03:10.880> went<00:03:11.180> under<00:03:11.480> that<00:03:11.600> so<00:03:12.350> that<00:03:12.530> I<00:03:12.560> could

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
colors went under that so that I could

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.350 
colors went under that so that I could
show<00:03:12.980> him<00:03:13.160> an<00:03:13.280> object<00:03:13.640> that<00:03:13.730> had<00:03:13.880> color<00:03:14.150> and

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
show him an object that had color and

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.060 
show him an object that had color and
shape<00:03:14.540> and<00:03:14.690> material<00:03:14.810> and<00:03:15.380> say<00:03:15.470> Alex<00:03:15.860> what's

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
shape and material and say Alex what's

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.449 
shape and material and say Alex what's
this<00:03:16.280> block<00:03:16.940> what<00:03:17.750> color<00:03:17.989> green<00:03:18.470> what<00:03:19.160> shape

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
this block what color green what shape

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.570 
this block what color green what shape
for<00:03:19.820> a<00:03:19.850> corner<00:03:20.270> what<00:03:20.810> matter<00:03:21.140> would<00:03:21.560> so<00:03:22.489> he

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
for a corner what matter would so he

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.340 
for a corner what matter would so he
understood<00:03:22.970> all<00:03:23.120> those<00:03:23.330> concepts<00:03:23.959> and<00:03:24.140> it

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
understood all those concepts and it

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.190 
understood all those concepts and it
also<00:03:24.590> meant<00:03:24.980> that<00:03:25.160> I<00:03:26.060> was<00:03:26.330> getting<00:03:26.840> away<00:03:26.959> from

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
also meant that I was getting away from

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.520 
also meant that I was getting away from
rote<00:03:27.980> responses<00:03:28.790> so<00:03:29.660> that<00:03:29.690> when<00:03:30.080> I<00:03:30.110> showed<00:03:30.410> him

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
rote responses so that when I showed him

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.460 
rote responses so that when I showed him
this<00:03:30.709> object<00:03:30.890> he<00:03:31.250> never<00:03:31.459> knew<00:03:31.730> oh<00:03:32.090> I<00:03:32.600> get<00:03:32.959> what

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
this object he never knew oh I get what

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.610 
this object he never knew oh I get what
to<00:03:33.620> say<00:03:33.830> until<00:03:34.400> he<00:03:34.550> heard<00:03:34.760> me<00:03:35.060> ask<00:03:35.660> a<00:03:36.080> question

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
to say until he heard me ask a question
