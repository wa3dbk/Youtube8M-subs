00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.269

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:28.289

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:39.059
 on reviews on unpacking 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.230
 so what is it but because 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.100
 gadgets are so frequent 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.100
 Yes, this watch is nothing more 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:58.800
 Now the land is the same needle will become their 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.809
 These are the years the clock floor 8 1 led clock 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:07.229
 which I ordered although there were not yet 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:09.570
 Thing is a thin strap from such a 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:16.979
 nice rubber as they are there 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:19.020
 here it goes 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.710
 we are configured but very mean 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.590
 even fun members like that 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:29.040
 I liked the little white strap it something 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:33.000

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.829
 Here are such a watch I do not know what else about 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.270
 they say they are worth something in the area 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.680
 two bucks came for about 15 days 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.100
 let's go to the second package 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.590
 here I hope something more interesting 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:55.350
 like that interesting link somewhere in 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:59.340
 China got lost it's not gud yes here's one 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.460
 one of them is a mouse yes I thought she didn't 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.840
 here comes such a mouse 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:10.410
 what is it like let's all in the comments 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:15.110
 yes yes olya apple magic mouse 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.910
 so 10 bucks it cost about 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.070
 According to the description, it is a type of sensory, that is 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.680
 really like a real make there 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:26.280
 so here so manage that is exactly 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:32.180
 With a sensor, let's see whether or not 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:34.590
 it is so well the type of coin from the button 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.670
 look really so she is very 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.980
 easy but you can see that you donâ€™t crawl 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:49.050
 for costa is really such a well 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:54.030
 cool packaging somehow so it is with us 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:57.660
 that but it's probably carrying something 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:04.020
 here's bullshit pulls us out of the goal I'm something 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:08.820
 don't catch up since we have all this here 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.890
 The case opens here in the face for the adapter 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.750
 as I understand it, we are being shoved here 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.690
 here it is to what it once was not 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:20.940

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:23.490

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.800
 here is the signal so here are three 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.800

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.780

 No there is nothing that double braid 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.390

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.330

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.980
