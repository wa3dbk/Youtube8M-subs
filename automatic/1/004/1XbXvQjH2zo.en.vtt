00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.740
 hello friends for our recipe 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.140
 today the cake of three milks the s a 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.660
 very simple recipe very simple but it is 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.639
 very very tasty and very easy to make and 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.220
 for this we are going to occupy the following 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.029
 we are going to occupy two boxes of mixed cake 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.710
 of cake already with the flour ready and 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.659
 you are going to occupy the ingredients 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.329
 that I indicated in his back box of the 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:29.659
 back we will also occupy 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:33.660
 our three milks that are being 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:36.600
 condensed milk evaporated milk the 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.300
 half cream and we're also going to occupy the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.090
 whipped cream that is or is also 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.970
 this cream chantilly that comes already 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.290
 ready we will also occupy strawberries 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:52.950
 fresh strawberry frosting 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.960
 and a cream cheese bar and if you 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.570
 they ask where I got the glaze from 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.470
 this strawberry I got it in a 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.120
 supermarket in the part of 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:07.080
 refrigeration and there you can find it 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.910
 Well, they're going to start by preparing their 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.940
 cake and you are going to follow the 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:16.280
 instructions that your box indicates 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.380
 and they are going to be the two boxes of 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.740
 cake for a single mold 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.910
 so if your box asks for a glass of 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.250
 milk or water you will occupy two 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:31.190
 glasses and so they will be with the rest of 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.630
 the good ingredients once 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.180
 their cake comes prepared 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.340
 they're going to put it aside on the table and 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.720
 they will let cool by approximately 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.850
 30 minutes 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.800
 and good now for this cake what 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.170
 let's go 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.010
 let's cut a little bit only 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.180
 here in half 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.550
 why 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.620
 because we want the part above that 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:03.500
 is completely flat and not like that 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.280
 this form 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.170
 and they 're cutting him out all around 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.650
 We will carefully remove the 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.790
 over so that the part remains 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:19.380
 completely flat 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.640
 and ready so we will be 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.740
 and now let's start doing the 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.440
 peron and now let's cut the cake 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.020
 in half we are going to do what 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.810
 we did here over worse here towards the 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.840
 half and base to fill our 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.450
 cake 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.840
 and this is how we will stay and 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.510
 I recommend that your cake at the time of 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.970
 do all this process be what 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.819
 Cool enough for your cake 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.379
 they will not be disrupted not only 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.910
 Sparta 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.910
 good and now let's leave here our 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.269
 cake in one piece and let's start 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.850
 liquefy our three milks and now yes 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:05.550
 let's liquefy for about 25 seconds 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:09.120
 ready and now let's beat our 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.580
 whipped cream or chantilly with our 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.190
 cream cheese bar and let's beat 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.890
 until our cream cheese is 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.340
 Incorporate completely with the cream 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:23.280
 whipped and I'm just going to add the 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.840
 half of this boat and so they would be 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.060
 approximately 8 ounces 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.430
 and I'm also going to add half of the 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.630
 cream cheese only half of the 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.430
 bar 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.430
 and now let's beat it 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.120
 well now let's put our 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.510
 Chantilly cream all over this 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.390
 part of our cake 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:58.129
 now with a fork or like a stick 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:01.489
 like these we will start to make 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:03.200
 holes all over our 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.010
 cake 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.010
 all all 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.590
 and I remind you that you can also 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.590
 do with a fork 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:21.769
 and ready and now with a ladle we are going to 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:25.360
 start to carefully put our 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.980
 milk mix of three dates and let's 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:31.630
 approximately half of the mixture 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.630
 for this part of the cake 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.840
 yes 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.980
 so for everything around the cake 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:49.570
 and I remind you that I am not a professional in 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.630
 this of the bakery but I did love them 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:55.360

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.330
 Three milks cake because it's made to me 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.810
 very a very easy recipe and it is very 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.810
 rich 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.550
 and well now we are going to start 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.100
 fill our cake with strawberries 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.160
 fresh but I also remind you that 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:15.820

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:19.330
 you can use peach or pineapple kiwi or 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.490

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.430
 case I'm going to put strawberries and I'm going to 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:27.940
 put everything around the cake 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.190

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.080
 the order or the way you put 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.259
