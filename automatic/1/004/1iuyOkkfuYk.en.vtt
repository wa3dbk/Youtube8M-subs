about twenty thousand dollars to buy and

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.889 
about twenty thousand dollars to buy and
it's<00:02:02.369> sort<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.610> an<00:02:02.700> IQ<00:02:03.060> test<00:02:03.090> they<00:02:03.509> want<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.780> to

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.059 

so<00:02:09.209> we<00:02:09.330> created<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.750> more<00:02:09.959> convenient<00:02:10.319> car<00:02:10.679> that

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
so we created a more convenient car that

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.369 
so we created a more convenient car that
is<00:02:11.190> actually<00:02:11.610> cheaper<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.780> build<00:02:12.900> we<00:02:13.170> didn't

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
is actually cheaper to build we didn't

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.760 
is actually cheaper to build we didn't
build<00:02:13.500> a

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
build a

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.350
