00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello everyone I propose now 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.339
 a little lesson to understand a little 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.890
 little how can one move the queen 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.019
 on a chessboard so are worth all of 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.880
 open this file in which I 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.309
 made a screenshot so here 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.109
 you have the black queen and by 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.490
 black pellets represent each 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.340
 possible displacements of this queen 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.859
 so the queen is the most 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.630
 powerful of the game okay the queen can 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.090
 Go forward go backward 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.789
 go right to go left 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.070
 move diagonally we advance in 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.780
 cooing the number of boxes that we 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.579
 therefore wishes to agree to this m 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.070
 rule in application I propose you 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.280
 to open chisty time and simulate a 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.890
 part so I'm going to play with the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.320
 whites and I would basically move 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.899
 the queen okay 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.850
 so I'll start by clearing 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.789
 godmother then here is the white queen 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.829
 who is here and here is the black queen 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.510
 alright I remember one thing in the beginning 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.980
 of each part the rules must be 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.500
 on their colors that is to say that the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.290
 black queen and on a dark king box 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.600
 and the white queen and on a square 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.049
 clerck the white ok so I 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.820
 moved for example this pawn to do of 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.860
 power 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.370
 disengage godmother and yet move her 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.140
 so before moving this pawn we have a 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.729
 very interesting option in the gisti 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.350
 time this option finds him 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.860
 by the way in many games 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.080
 chess 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.500
 it's the valid cost display so 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.320
 so we will go away option show the 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.640
 movements valida okay and so that's 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.690
 allows beginners to know well 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.100
 what are the shots that we can play 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.869
 on the left so I'm going to launch for example 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.320
 this one in order to move 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.210
 godmother who is there so here is the queen 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.200
 I click here nothing a little bit 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.820
 possible displacements are 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.259
 models of agreement so I can not 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.160
 move forward because I'll know if I can 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.330
 not go right because I have the 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.830
 left wheel drive left because I have the 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.330
 crazy and I can not go on this 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:02:00.380
 diagonal because I support okay 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.380
 so for example I will come here 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.040
 ok my opponent moved his rider 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.200
 so if I click on the arena here all 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.430
 the possible displacements of agreement in 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:17.180
 front behind left to right pardon 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.620
 left and so on et cetera on 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.300
 diagonals etc etc 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.650
 okay so I can possibly 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.590
 take this pawn I will not do it 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.250
 because otherwise godmother is going to be at the 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.020
 thank you for this pawn but that I can 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.520
 possibly also take this pawn 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.950
 but I will not do it why 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.320
 because I am at the mercy of the king 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.000
 adverse or crazy or also of art 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.050
 is anyway so I'm going by 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.050
 example of coming here 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.780
 so even harel here she is here all 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.700
 displacements possible to send kahn 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.140
 has a lot so right to left in 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.670
 to have a back when backward choice 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:01.080
 because jesus pawns and on the diagonal 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:06.489
 okay so I'll come for example 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:08.560
 here so I can I position myself 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.769
 so you can take the tower here 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.970
 so my opponent defended his tower 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.400
 advancing his pieces 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.190
 okay he advanced his pawns and at if 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.450
 I can not take the tower anymore 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.470
 so I click here on the arena 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.500
 the possible displacements 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.450
 I will come here look a little bit 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.760
 ate the opponent's pawn and come back 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.079
 eat the opposing pawn I'm going to put the 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.470
 opposing king in check 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:35.049
 indeed when marc raynaud is going to be here 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.970
 I can I will be able to eat 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:40.170
 the opposing king okay so this is it 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.170
 I'll do right now 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.180
 failure 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.700
 you see mahogany wants to go 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.489
 but their failures my opponent has 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.190
 defended his king by positioning here the 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.989
 Queen to cool and agree 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.430
 so I can not take the king anymore 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.100
 can possibly take his red for 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.209
 if I take this reindeer I sacrifice the 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.389
 mine why because he goes all of 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.639
 next come eat godmother with his king 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:08.280
 alright i'm going to decide for example from 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:08.280
 come eat his hat and there 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.690
 ok so here several solutions I can 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.640
 come eat riders agree a 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.930
 little bit if I go to eat jumpers 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.430
 good opponent will come back to eat 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.200
 godmother with his king 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.310
 I can come for example to eat his 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.310
 pawns everything i'm going to do 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.530
 I will continue to move godmother 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.940
 so obviously in a part 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.320
 chess we do not always move the same 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.120
 piece but here I move 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.200
 basically the queen for good you 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.760
 explain what are the displacements 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.870
 possible then always the same for the 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.750
 queen back and forth on the 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.100
 diagonals right on the left so here 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.200
 I have several possibilities 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.360
 I can come eat the rider who is 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.660
 here but if I do it I would do myself 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.520
 to eat godmother by the opposing king I 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:00.010
 can come to eat this pawn but I 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:03.860
 will also eat my godmother here and 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.660
 here I can come eat this pawn without 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.770
 nothing to fear from my opponent 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:12.380
 if I eat the fool here I will make myself 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:15.530
 eat by this rider who moves in 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.210
 are you remember 1 2 3 okay so 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.560
 I mean for example like to eat this 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:23.360
 plan what stupidity 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.130
 obviously I will not think I have not 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.770
 pay attention to the opponent who had 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.590
 his pure there came to eat here so what 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.530
 be it to sum up the queen can 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:36.950
 move forward right back 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.030
 left on the diagonals of the number of 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.650
 boxes that we wish 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.650
 I thank you
