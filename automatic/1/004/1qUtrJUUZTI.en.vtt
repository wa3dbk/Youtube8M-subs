00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
to be the only bomb spot that I'm using

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.890 
to be the only bomb spot that I'm using
strong-arm<00:00:14.040> for<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.519> just<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.480> rest<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.750> them

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
strong-arm for and just the rest of them

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.840 
strong-arm for and just the rest of them
I'm<00:00:16.049> not<00:00:16.289> going<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.529> use<00:00:16.619> strong<00:00:16.800> arm<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.520> here

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
I'm not going to use strong arm so here

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.490 
I'm not going to use strong arm so here
we<00:00:17.880> go<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.060> just<00:00:18.180> run<00:00:18.449> into<00:00:18.570> this<00:00:18.750> corner<00:00:18.990> look

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
we go you just run into this corner look

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.500 
we go you just run into this corner look
straight<00:00:19.770> up<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.220> throw<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.210> spot<00:00:21.420> was

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
straight up and throw it this spot was

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.509 
straight up and throw it this spot was
really<00:00:21.840> cool<00:00:21.990> because<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.380> lands<00:00:22.769> right<00:00:23.490> on

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
really cool because it lands right on

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.099 
really cool because it lands right on
the<00:00:23.699> bomb<00:00:23.880> there's<00:00:24.180> no<00:00:24.359> way<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.510> escape<00:00:24.689> it

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
the bomb there's no way to escape it

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.599 
the bomb there's no way to escape it
they<00:00:25.289> can<00:00:25.439> be<00:00:25.529> laying<00:00:25.800> down<00:00:26.039> crouching

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
they can be laying down crouching

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.859 
they can be laying down crouching
standing<00:00:26.939> up<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.150> it's<00:00:27.300> still<00:00:27.449> going<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.750> hit

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
standing up and it's still going to hit

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.240 
standing up and it's still going to hit
them<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.890> probably<00:00:29.039> my<00:00:29.220> favorite

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
them and this is probably my favorite

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.190 
them and this is probably my favorite
one<00:00:29.849> on<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.119> map<00:00:30.529> and<00:00:31.529> now<00:00:32.189> like<00:00:32.430> like<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.910> said

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
one on this map and now like like I said

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.569 
one on this map and now like like I said
the<00:00:34.200> rest<00:00:34.410> are<00:00:34.620> not<00:00:34.829> going<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.100> use<00:00:35.190> strong<00:00:35.399> arm

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
the rest are not going to use strong arm

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.549 
the rest are not going to use strong arm
and<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.850> downside<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.630> they<00:00:37.380> don't

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
and the downside of that is they don't

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.920 
and the downside of that is they don't
they<00:00:37.770> don't<00:00:37.800> go<00:00:38.070> as<00:00:38.190> high<00:00:38.370> but<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.540> mean<00:00:39.809> they

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
they don't go as high but I mean they

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.750 
they don't go as high but I mean they
still<00:00:40.110> look<00:00:40.290> cool<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.500> my<00:00:40.710> opinion<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.700> you

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
still look cool in my opinion so you

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.459 
still look cool in my opinion so you
just<00:00:42.180> run<00:00:42.329> into<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.629> corner<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.170> corner<00:00:43.230> is

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
just run into this corner that corner is

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.990 
just run into this corner that corner is
pretty<00:00:43.680> secluded<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.219> know<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.550> was<00:00:44.700> there

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
pretty secluded I know that was there

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.389 
pretty secluded I know that was there
until<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.780> was<00:00:45.899> like<00:00:46.200> looking<00:00:46.920> four<00:00:47.100> corners<00:00:47.340> to

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
until I was like looking four corners to

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.010 
until I was like looking four corners to
find<00:00:47.579> spots<00:00:47.820> for<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.450> don't<00:00:48.600> know<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.750> find

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
find spots for so I don't know you find

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.000 
find spots for so I don't know you find
new<00:00:49.110> things<00:00:49.140> when<00:00:49.469> you're<00:00:49.559> looking<00:00:49.739> for<00:00:49.800> stuff

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
new things when you're looking for stuff

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.700 
new things when you're looking for stuff
so<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.940> now<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.600> plan<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.320> corner

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
so and now you plan it on this corner

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.680 
so and now you plan it on this corner
it's<00:00:53.280> actually<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.730> same<00:00:53.760> place<00:00:54.300> as<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
it's actually the same place as the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.029 
it's actually the same place as the
other<00:00:55.230> once<00:00:55.410> they<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:55.739> two<00:00:55.860> people

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
other once they can have two people

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.740 
other once they can have two people
going<00:00:56.280> for<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.579> one<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.789> hopefully<00:00:57.420> you

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
going for this one and hopefully you

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.240 
going for this one and hopefully you
have<00:00:57.870> double<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.530> chance<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.859> hitting<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.129> and

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
have double a chance of hitting it and

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.209 
have double a chance of hitting it and
for<00:00:59.820> this<00:00:59.850> corner<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.480> slid<00:01:01.109> over<00:01:01.500> just<00:01:01.980> a

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
for this corner I slid over just a

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.070 
for this corner I slid over just a
little<00:01:02.250> bit<00:01:02.579> because<00:01:02.820> if<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.690> want<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.899> get<00:01:03.989> it

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
little bit because if you want to get it

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.600 
little bit because if you want to get it
directly<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.710> middle<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.250> stay<00:01:05.519> in

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
directly in the middle and you stay in

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.740 
directly in the middle and you stay in
that<00:01:05.700> corner<00:01:05.939> it'll<00:01:06.119> hit<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.450> but<00:01:06.540> if<00:01:06.659> you

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
that corner it'll hit it but if you

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.899 
that corner it'll hit it but if you
slide<00:01:06.990> over<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.530> an<00:01:07.650> inch<00:01:07.860> then<00:01:08.430> it'll<00:01:08.790> go

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
slide over just an inch then it'll go

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.190 
slide over just an inch then it'll go
directly<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.420> middle<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.900> didn't<00:01:10.170> even

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
directly in the middle and I didn't even

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.600 
directly in the middle and I didn't even
know<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.560> hit<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> wall<00:01:11.040> when<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.220> first<00:01:11.460> found

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
know it hit the wall when I first found

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.870 
know it hit the wall when I first found
this<00:01:11.820> spot<00:01:12.030> until<00:01:12.350> I<00:01:13.350> got<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.310> until<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.670> got

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
this spot until I got it until I got

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.010 
this spot until I got it until I got
this<00:01:14.970> killcam<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.450> don't<00:01:15.570> realize<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.930> actually

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
this killcam I don't realize it actually

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.929 
this killcam I don't realize it actually
hit<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.320> wall<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.680> that's<00:01:16.860> pretty<00:01:17.009> cool<00:01:17.100> so

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
hit the wall so that's pretty cool so

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.700 
hit the wall so that's pretty cool so
now<00:01:18.090> moving<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.750> be<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.409> when<00:01:19.500> I'm<00:01:19.590> playing

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
now moving on to be you when I'm playing

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.800 
now moving on to be you when I'm playing

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
it on this side and none of these are

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.980 
it on this side and none of these are
going<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.380> use<00:01:22.470> strong<00:01:22.740> arm<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.909> yeah<00:01:24.720> sorry

going to use strong arm so yeah sorry
about<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.170> but<00:01:25.830> anyway<00:01:26.180> hopefully<00:01:27.180> no<00:01:27.330> one

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
about that but anyway hopefully no one

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.090 
about that but anyway hopefully no one
sees<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:27.869> corner<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.290> kind<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.009> in

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
sees you in this corner it is kind of in

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.469 
sees you in this corner it is kind of in
the<00:01:29.130> middle<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> map<00:01:29.700> but<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.119> mean

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
the middle of the map but I mean

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.560 
the middle of the map but I mean
hopefully<00:01:30.659> no<00:01:30.900> one<00:01:31.020> looks<00:01:31.170> right<00:01:31.290> there<00:01:31.470> but

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
hopefully no one looks right there but

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.749 
hopefully no one looks right there but
directly<00:01:33.570> Alan<00:01:33.840> bomb<00:01:33.990> hits<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.380> guy<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:35.369> now

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
directly Alan bomb hits the guy so now

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.469 
directly Alan bomb hits the guy so now
you<00:01:35.820> want<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.180> plant<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.540> here<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:38.479> sprint

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
you want to plant it here and sprint

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.960 
you want to plant it here and sprint
over<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.770> corner<00:01:41.220> make<00:01:41.430> sure<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.670> slide

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
or it won't work true story ah so though

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.210 
or it won't work true story ah so though

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
it here look straight up and throw it

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.340 
it here look straight up and throw it
get<00:01:51.790> that<00:01:51.940> nice<00:01:52.150> kill<00:01:52.450> cam<00:01:52.660> and<00:01:52.930> it<00:01:53.170> lands

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
get that nice kill cam and it lands

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.690 
get that nice kill cam and it lands
right<00:01:53.710> on<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:53.890> bomb<00:01:54.010> pretty<00:01:54.220> much<00:01:54.430> like<00:01:54.580> all

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
right on the bomb pretty much like all

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.580 
right on the bomb pretty much like all
these<00:01:54.940> all<00:01:55.090> these<00:01:55.120> usually<00:01:55.450> no<00:01:55.840> bombs<00:01:56.020> like

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
these all these usually no bombs like

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.370 
these all these usually no bombs like
usually<00:01:57.280> I<00:01:57.310> find<00:01:57.430> some<00:01:57.880> and<00:01:58.090> they<00:01:58.270> don't<00:01:58.450> like

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
usually I find some and they don't like

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.990 
usually I find some and they don't like
they<00:01:59.680> don't<00:01:59.830> land<00:02:00.070> perfectly<00:02:00.310> in<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.700> middle

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
they don't land perfectly in the middle

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.700 
they don't land perfectly in the middle
but<00:02:01.360> all<00:02:01.510> of<00:02:01.630> these<00:02:01.720> pretty<00:02:01.990> much<00:02:02.110> land<00:02:02.380> right

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
but all of these pretty much land right

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.470 
but all of these pretty much land right
where<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:02.980> bombs<00:02:03.190> planted<00:02:03.460> so<00:02:03.910> you<00:02:04.300> should

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
where the bombs planted so you should

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.030 
where the bombs planted so you should
have<00:02:04.510> a<00:02:04.660> pretty<00:02:04.840> good<00:02:04.870> chance<00:02:04.990> of<00:02:05.740> hitting

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
have a pretty good chance of hitting

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.820 
have a pretty good chance of hitting
them<00:02:06.250> and<00:02:06.430> yeah<00:02:07.180> that<00:02:07.600> awkward<00:02:08.200> moment<00:02:08.259> when

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
them and yeah that awkward moment when

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.370 
them and yeah that awkward moment when
you<00:02:08.950> go<00:02:09.130> into<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.520> wrong<00:02:09.729> spot<00:02:10.240> but<00:02:11.110> anyway

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
you go into the wrong spot but anyway

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.750 
you go into the wrong spot but anyway

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760
