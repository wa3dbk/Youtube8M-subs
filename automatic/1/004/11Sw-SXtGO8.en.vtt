00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.879
 by lrp 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.879
 flower is better 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.390
 with special 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.940
 thanks to lrp we view in this arsi 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:57.890
 blog.nl video this nice one 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.540
 lp s10 blast 2 x 2 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.730
 it is a 1 in 10 scale 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.920
 four-wheel drive so-called pressure that 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.470
 a combination of a puppy and a 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.330
 monster or stage truck 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.010
 This is the original packaging in which the 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.010
 blanc steaks two is supplied 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.770
 and what's in this 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.100
 packaging 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.420
 a bag with three black things 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.250
 there is no one anywhere in the manual 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.320
 word said about it but it looks like it 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.780
 that outputs square adapters for 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.640
 aftermarket servos are so if you 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.259
 another surly sure you install 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.660
 one of these used to control the servo arm 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.520
 of the car to fit then 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.009
 two pieces of double-sided tape and 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.289
 tie-raps always handy 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.830
 two extra of the steel cvd if they are from 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:44.509
 the car also always handy and 6 cells 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.210
 lrp some work 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:50.450
 nicole metal hydride or nimh battery pack 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.130
 capacity 6 200 milligrams per 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.100
 and therefore of course also the charger for it 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.869
 linpack of course also a big one 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.630
 comprehensive manual of both the 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.340
 car as the channel and an lrp advertising 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.170
 guide 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.610
 The included gun transmitter is one 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:11.649
 2.4 gigahertz lrp a2 stx pro provided 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.649
 of the digital proportional steering wheel 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.310
 on the left side of the channel 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.600
 analog so-called potentiometers for 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.350
 for example, setting the 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.090
 steering result and gas or brake sensitivity 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:27.230
 and on the right two large knobs at the front 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.060
 the calibration of handlebars and gas trims 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.360
 antenna on top of the transmitter is in a corner 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.920
 from 0 to 90 degrees 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.560
 the channel works with only 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.239
 no less than 8 aa batteries and this makes the 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.190
 channel again heavier and some people 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.470
 find this just nice but you have 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.250
 So you need 8 batteries and those are 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.400
 not included 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:51.300
 and then of course the car itself the lrp 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.160
 s10 blast 2 x 2 nice thing to see 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.090
 fully assembled and 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.640
 ready to run which is ready to ride 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.400
 take a closer look 4 pieces 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.290
 offroad studs felt like one 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.350
 medium rubber composition on beautiful 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.260
 white plastic 7-spoke wheels 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.790
 with 12 mm plastic wheel behind it 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.380
 flights 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.050
 the body is made of lexane 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.630
 features a lexan wing and appears 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.130
 the farmer sat us firmly in principle 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.440
 attach to it in four places 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.410
 chassis with the included metal body 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.209
 clips and if we remove the farmer 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.550
 then we come to the plastic chassis 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.170
 and the wheel suspension 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.420
 the two leaf steaks do it with one 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.760
 traditional suspension arm suspension with 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.950
 kester and send blocks in front and as 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.590
 supports at the back supported by steel 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.780
 forests around the car is in addition 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.630
 equipped with steel constant 'velocity 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.110
 drive shafts simply CDs and also two 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.600
 bars 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.690
 or tyrol beams on both front 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.880
 if the back of each sewer is provided with 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.980
 an oil filled shock absorbers 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.110
 the housing is or sock buddies are from 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.390
 plastic but the docks officially caps 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.500
 fortunately from aluminum 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.930
 the dampers are equipped with 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.670
 screw thread so the pilot or ride height 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.260
 is easy to adjust by pressing the 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.769
 set screw under the shock app too 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.260
 then turning the chassis itself plastic 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.510
 like we said double deck like you 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.180
 can see with that box to start 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.459
 with that antenna on top of this box 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.100
 lp is the receiver box waterproof 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:26.100
 yes, the car and the electronics are 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.080
 intended as very water resistant 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.880
 if we open the receiver box then 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.010
 you can see the rubber gasket to water 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.390
 to keep out the door and in the boxed 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.880
 lp a3 rx deluxe 3 channel 2.4 gigahertz 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.770
 receiver 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.870
 the controller in the loads x 2 is the 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.320
 also waterproof lrp 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.690
 rider reavers it is a brast controller 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.389
 and it is suitable for 6 ellen impacts 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.280
 or two cell lipos 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.260
 a disadvantage to the controller this one 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.970
 tamiya molecule sticker 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.800
 little electricity can pass through them 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.900
 its rickety becomes electric 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.740
 connection is not really optimal us 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.810
 advice 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.360
 tamiya always cut and better 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.720
 plug solder 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.150
 then the engine nrps loaded s10 carbon brush 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:16.139
 or brast DC motor 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:18.090
 20,000 and 500 idle 23 burns 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:21.389
 nice motor for the car and so was 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.340
 with max 8.4 feel and to the engine during 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.020
 to keep driving cool is the chassis 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.530
 provided with a large one at the bottom 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:33.419
 cool opening and of course the 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:36.389
 steering servo it is a lrp there 7103 wp 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:38.010
 waterproof 3 kilogram servo with plastic 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.560
 gears but again with one 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.180
 aluminum case 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.950
 furthermore there is of course in chelsea 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.419
 place for the battery 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.220
 it is in the battery tray on its 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.560
 held in place by this large battery 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.090
 clamp which you with body posts on two 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.550
 fix points 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.020
 that can be fixed in multiple positions 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:58.080
 so that the clamp is adjustable in height 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.370
 so you can lose the thicker battery packs 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.620
 bin is big enough for the most 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.750
 common 6 l and m and two lipo cells 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.590
 pax and includes a cool trip 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:10.139
 holes in the bottom of the chassis the lrp 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.570
 s10 blast x 2 is as stated before 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:14.789
 provided with a full time 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:17.160
 the car has four-wheel drive 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:18.840
 a front and rear differential 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.300
 the motor threatened stuff here or 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.610
 main gear to which directly through this 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.680
 blue aluminum block residential exchange 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.520
 drive shaft the front and rear wheels 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.130
 drives 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.650
 the spur gear is of course equipped with 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.120
 a slipper clutch or slip clutch and 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.070
 the murder is set to this 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.720
 slip clutch is as you see easy 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:40.620
 accessible 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:44.130
 all in all, this lrp s10 blast is 2 x 2 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:46.200
 a very well equipped 1 in 10 tricky 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.730
 and he therefore seems very capable of 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.630
 to handle long pieces 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.480
 asphalt 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:53.880
 cross-country tracks and or large terrain and that 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.830
 so for a very friendly price 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.380
 because for even under 200 euros 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.780
 lrp looks like a very complete hobby 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.430
 quality car in the house and that makes it 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:06.180
 so again a very attractive arsi 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:10.490
 car especially for the beginner and how 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.490
