00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
streamline camo you are wondering why do

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.789 
streamline camo you are wondering why do
we<00:01:33.240> have<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.360> streamlight<00:01:33.750> camo<00:01:34.020> well<00:01:34.680> the

streamline camo is um basically it may I

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.350 
streamline camo is um basically it may I
think<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.159> goes<00:01:41.280> farther<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:41.970> let's<00:01:42.210> go<00:01:42.329> ahead

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
think it goes farther so let's go ahead

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.969 
think it goes farther so let's go ahead
and<00:01:42.540> set<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:42.869> baby<00:01:43.170> up<00:01:43.290> we're<00:01:43.590> going<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.770> load

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
and set this baby up we're going to load

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.980 
and set this baby up we're going to load
it<00:01:46.009> careful<00:01:47.009> not<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.220> shoot<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.490> blank<00:01:47.990> okay

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
it careful not to shoot it blank okay

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.450 
it careful not to shoot it blank okay
we're<00:01:49.110> going<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.259> test<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.799> distance<00:01:50.189> from

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
we're going to test on the distance from

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.999 
we're going to test on the distance from
backing<00:01:50.790> up<00:01:51.060> into<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.659> fence<00:01:51.869> over<00:01:52.170> here<00:01:52.470> so

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
backing up into the fence over here so

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.170 
backing up into the fence over here so
let's<00:01:53.159> go<00:01:53.250> ahead<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.460> do<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.640> really<00:01:53.880> quick

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
let's go ahead and do that really quick

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.469 
let's go ahead and do that really quick
all<00:01:54.860> right<00:01:55.860> there<00:01:56.250> are<00:01:56.369> mind<00:01:56.579> because<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.270> have
