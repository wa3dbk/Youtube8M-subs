then<00:00:44.309> building<00:00:44.870> room<00:00:45.870> will<00:00:46.200> be<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> left

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
then building room will be to the left

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.569 
then building room will be to the left
of<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.760> system<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.829> first<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.340> all

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.710 
ball which you people in the u.s. do a
lot<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:23.290> the<00:01:23.740> meshing<00:01:24.330> can<00:01:25.330> either<00:01:25.480> be<00:01:25.690> done

here<00:01:26.400> solely<00:01:27.400> or<00:01:28.300> it<00:01:28.600> can<00:01:28.810> be<00:01:28.930> flipped<00:01:29.260> like<00:01:29.680> a

pedal<00:01:32.500> and<00:01:32.950> a<00:01:33.100> part<00:01:33.400> is<00:01:33.520> pumped<00:01:34.000> over<00:01:34.240> to<00:01:34.270> the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
mesh a lot of ton that now you could

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.940 
mesh a lot of ton that now you could
actually<00:01:36.880> decoction<00:01:37.600> mash<00:01:37.990> which<00:01:38.290> which

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
actually decoction mash which which

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.580 
actually decoction mash which which
means<00:01:39.220> you<00:01:39.880> know<00:01:40.000> you<00:01:40.060> boil<00:01:40.780> part<00:01:41.140> of<00:01:41.230> the<00:01:41.350> mash

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
means you know you boil part of the mash

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.640 
means you know you boil part of the mash
to<00:01:42.220> break<00:01:42.820> open<00:01:43.000> to<00:01:43.270> start<00:01:43.510> physically<00:01:44.140> and

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
to break open to start physically and

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.530 
to break open to start physically and
then<00:01:44.770> you<00:01:44.950> boil<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.910> boiled<00:01:46.900> in<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.850> starch

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
then you boil the boiled in the starch

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.390 
then you boil the boiled in the starch
that<00:01:49.630> you<00:01:49.900> build<00:01:50.140> anew<00:01:50.350> you<00:01:50.620> pump<00:01:50.890> over<00:01:51.010> to<00:01:51.250> the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
that you build anew you pump over to the

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.030 
that you build anew you pump over to the
lauter<00:01:51.610> tun<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:52.120> in<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.690> lot<00:01:52.870> of<00:01:52.990> time<00:01:53.170> the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
lauter tun and in the lot of time the

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.710 
lauter tun and in the lot of time the
conversion<00:01:54.550> will<00:01:54.700> be<00:01:54.760> done<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.270> convert<00:01:55.600> the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
conversion will be done to convert the

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.280 
conversion will be done to convert the
starch<00:01:55.960> into<00:01:56.110> sugar<00:01:56.410> so<00:01:56.979> mashed<00:01:57.640> on<00:01:58.290> lauter

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
starch into sugar so mashed on lauter

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.800 
starch into sugar so mashed on lauter
tun<00:01:59.590> and<00:02:01.950> we<00:02:02.950> have<00:02:03.130> not<00:02:03.400> really<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:04.090> rakes<00:02:04.450> are

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
tun and we have not really the rakes are

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.160 
tun and we have not really the rakes are
missing<00:02:05.470> there<00:02:05.620> they're<00:02:05.950> still<00:02:06.660> over<00:02:07.660> at<00:02:08.050> the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
missing there they're still over at the

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.419 
missing there they're still over at the
other<00:02:08.260> shellfish<00:02:08.649> we've<00:02:08.830> just<00:02:09.070> seen<00:02:09.220> in<00:02:09.399> the

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
other shellfish we've just seen in the

other shellfish we've just seen in the
other<00:02:09.550> building<00:02:10.030> so<00:02:10.570> the<00:02:10.750> rates<00:02:11.290> would<00:02:11.470> have

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
other building so the rates would have

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.510 
other building so the rates would have
to<00:02:11.740> be<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:13.420> sample<00:02:13.630> inside<00:02:14.040> left<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.250> false

after<00:04:48.130> it's<00:04:48.400> been<00:04:48.550> aerated<00:04:52.200> start<00:04:53.200> the
