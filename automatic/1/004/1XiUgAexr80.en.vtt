00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hi sorry you should have seen something 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.589
 is today's video about being insecure 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.750
 in other subjects doan make up 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.330
 usually a shoplog etcetera why 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.670
 because it is something that I do quite a lot 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.049
 suffer and I really had last week 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.449
 just a dip 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.070
 that I was incredibly uncertain and whole 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.640
 very sad and really a base one 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.039
 kind 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.420
 almost breaks i really gotta have it 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.000
 heard of 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.560
 who am I, and I do no one goes 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.769
 more like nobody likes me like 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.809
 what i do and yes i'll be just as whole 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.340
 very dark in gloom 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.489
 luckily I am on top of that again 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.649
 actually come through a few simple ones 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.950
 things and here still really okay 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.660
 I want to make a video about this because 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.579
 the moment I felt so bad I felt 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.460
 it really just didn't see a real one anymore 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.390
 even thought yes how did I ever get here 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.329
 out again 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.020
 so hence today uncertain video 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.420
 to be 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.579
 no can be uncertain about a lot 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.379
 I do things to be uncertain about you 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.140
 For example, appearance but also your 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.309
 so how smart you are how good you are 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.310
 doing at work at school 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.900
 also in the future i think there often 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.049
 become uncertain by others 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.460
 certainly because of comments from others 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.540
 when you are not completely comfortable in you 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.130
 skin 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.950
 or you can see that in your sensitive place 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.140
 that others tell us something 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.450
 fool or product other 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.689
 intense saying from goh what are you 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.729
 arrived or hey how are you going there 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.380
 your education to sit some 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.140
 future, you can go into career 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.180
 find out later and I think that's why 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.369
 a kind of blue can 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.930
 develop if you hear it more often 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.820
 it becomes none with a bruise 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.110
 that is pretty tight on your skin 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.220
 was all people of 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.290
 say something like that again you will be hit 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.390
 on that bruise but on a blue one 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.430
 spot bruises can also go away 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.189
 and how am I going to leave now 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.219
 also important because if someone has something 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.710
 says what makes you unsure how am I doing this 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.450
 say i find very hard to be correct 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.390
 find a word 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.659
 do you know if someone says something about you 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.670
 weight then that is something i care about it 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.679
 very entertaining I need a arrived and 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.290
 everyone could do that 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.090
 but I am more focused than that 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.159
 when people judge mine on mine 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.959
 weight something unsure about then 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:19.340
 says a lot more about him than about me 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.609
 and that is easy to say 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.670
 if I'm 10 times harder to make too 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:27.170
 say yet no less fun 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.420
 but that should not be less nice 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.920
 doesn't make me any less smart 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.950
 on the one hand i think you shouldn't see it 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.540
 you let him happiness depend on others 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.269
 so actually you need something as someone 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.030
 rock really where you're uncertain of that 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.269
 you don't attract it but if you do it anyway 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.489
 is doing 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.629
 because we are all people i would 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.430
 want to be able to say that it is not me 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.810
 but it certainly does if 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.519
 it is something that is already sensitive 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.010
 do you think you say anything else there 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.349
 must fight over and that's all greasy 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.049
 Dear reactions that have received all 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.639
 comments that you do take good care of it 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.469
 Remember that and I know it's super 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.299
 easy is said and much harder 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:04.489
 done i also know i have one on 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.019
 response to is what touches me true 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.969
 I am unsure about it then remember that 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.469
 reaction she had opposite a lot 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:10.579
 good response 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:11.959
 And that's why I think we have another one 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.729
 wrong idea is that if someone has something 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.840
 sweet says someone say something from you 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:16.459
 simple 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.319
 thank you the top you come with a group me 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.479
 good at write it down 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.819
 take a picture of it take screenshot 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:24.650
 make a kind of folder on your computer 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.790
 for example there on your phone with that 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.519
 things that make you feel good again 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.659
 that is not really possible 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.729
 has been focused on you but the can 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:34.040
 for example also something else I would be there 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:35.780
 a striker he a ted also a youtube 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.409
 video then also be an article in one 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.299
 magazine 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:39.919
 if this is what gives you a positive boost 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.989
 gives you confidence again 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:43.609
 give effe the kik that you work in it 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.699
 so you feel stuck here when you 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:48.530
 you just have a feeling of happiness there 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:50.180
 in its importance so save and save 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.579
 put them on your computer 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.009
 macro photo of so you can watch them 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:58.040
 at the weaker moment I really whole 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:04:00.590
 be very uncertain about what i do what i do 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.329
 last week for example I had known 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.489
 not exactly what word came i was on 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:07.430
 that moment just more sensitive and then 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.870
 every response comes as a blow 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.000
 then I heard something very simple too 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.970
 I often heard but only now realized 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.079
 I think so yes I have to do that 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.660
 and that is what you pay attention to that 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.250
 grows and 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.470
 I had never looked at it like me 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.810
 watch it now but if so I all 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.540
 attention 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.090
 so i might read times i reply 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.130
 it grows which I feel to 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.050
 much better by quickly that I all 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.510
 negative reactions then give attention 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.190
 grows day then I feel spent there 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.930
 rot and rot 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.120
 then shouldn't do that should be just one 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.370
 give more positive attention because then 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.960
 so that what I just said is growing 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.900
 someone to compliment you 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.400
 write it down make sure I remember it 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.220
 I give it to thought and then it grows and 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.780
 then hopefully that will keep you better 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.610
 then remember those those negative things 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.600
 that rotten comments where uncertain of 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.800
 and that is something simple and I have 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.520
 of this that I have to much earlier 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.230
 understand 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.670
 because I just notice now that I have it 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.770
 use since a few days that it 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.140
 it really works and i put the jsf number in one 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.540
 good flow is band on the positive 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.610
 reactions I will respond and there I am 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.460
 super happy with it you can also see it as 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.530
 someone gives you a compliment 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.810
 sincere course one returns but also 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.970
 thank you, you know that is too 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.440
 give attention and grows through and as well 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.570
 someone who really proudly really try 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.580
 shrug your shoulders and like me in 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.500
 the best video said what i still have 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.270
 how is making a tree around me and it 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.310
 sounds like, but it works for me 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.930
 so if someone says something god 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.780
 you make it all around you you map it 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.640
 stop paying attention and try 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.030
 to the good things I like to positive ones 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.850
 stuff 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.290
 I also often know that uncertainty a lot 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.669
 is harder than this, 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.470
 and I know there are people out there 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:51.610
 really much more bothered than me 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.290
 for example, really had a lot of problems 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.730
 from and when cried puberty was then 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.800
 it's actually about right but I know 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.330
 that that does not apply to everyone now 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.370
 have more showers but we are 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.240
 simply people who he insecure 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.100
 to be 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.990
 which can make me sad because of me 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:08.770
 sometimes you see that they had someone 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.510
 off and then I think you know 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.310
 it just doesn't have to be and at all 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.900
 it's super easy said I want you 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.880
 we really know that you just give this to us 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.320
 all suffer from it is 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.669
 All of us are more concerned than the one 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.529
 others 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:22.589
 where I 

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:23.549
 among women who are not unsure mano 

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:26.249
 than me from 

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:27.479
 I also think they have their little uncertain 

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:29.309
 to have 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:30.749
 I hope this video is helpful 

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:32.969
 been 

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:34.619
 yes again I have made a wish but 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:35.579
 I find it pretty hard to do everything right 

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:37.769
 for the 

00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:39.509
 so i hope you have had something to me 

00:06:37.769 --> 00:06:41.849
 want to thank unwise for watching and 

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:43.019
 if you have any questions or if you have one 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:44.819
 want to see a different kind of video 

00:06:43.019 --> 00:06:45.239
 suggestions please leave below 

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:47.279
