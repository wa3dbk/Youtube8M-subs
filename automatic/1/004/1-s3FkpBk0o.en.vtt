00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.770
 hello everyone with you channel 1 and i have 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.810
 there are some good news 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.789
 Firstly, I purchased a HD camera. Secondly 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.630
 recently released a toy from the company 1c 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.369
 called brothers pilots and today I 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.479
 I want to make a review on this toy 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.789
 this toy is familiar to some from childhood 

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:40.370
 we played on computers this is a quest that 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:43.489
 very rarely happens when a suitable quest 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:48.139
 in Russian goes so try 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.819
 play with you click play and start 

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:53.600
 from the first level to be clear 

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:56.089
 the point of the game here is small 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.569
 indra zapasochka where we have 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:05.080
 tells about the idea itself 

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:07.460
 games and preface we skip this and 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.090
 start playing no learning and 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.890
 I will not go for it so 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.420
 first we need to take a teapot and 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.940
 pickaxe 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:25.530
 control of two characters here 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:28.230
 brothers pilots in a green suit who 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.640
 knows who watched the cartoon fool 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:35.180
 we can do it alone 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.729
 all sorts of cool things for example 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:42.390
 click on the barrel and nothing happens 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:48.690
 it means you have to push the second brother in this 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:53.040
 the whole trick of the game turned out to be a meeting and 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:55.410
 money for what we need maggots 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.590
 I'll tell you a little later for a start. 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:04.649
 let's break the wall with a pickaxe 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:08.160
 so it will be the easiest way was not easy 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.770
 here the hippo prevents us from hammering in 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.360
 hippo I think is meaningless therefore 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.360
 try to ring the bell 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:32.319
 and give the money here is actually the first 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:36.670
 the level of this game we went through and let me 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.630
 I will help you so this is a rating in the appstore 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.519
 we will not bet 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.200
 now I will show you how to pass the second 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.110
 level and on this perhaps we finish 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:50.230
 our review so for the beginning we see here 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:52.900
 piano compass and tablets in direction 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.120
 we need an elephant well who but me so 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.019
 I suspect we will not pass therefore us 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.330
 you need immediately these pianos are capaciously pianos in 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:08.260
 game provided hints here they are 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:11.230
 if it’s very difficult they don’t help us this 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.360
 the melody does not fit we need now 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:18.090
 choose a melody from which jump our 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.090
 green idiot brother 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.420
 also does not fit 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:37.390
 and here it will be right now we go 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:41.049
 green brother under the nameplate to elephant 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:46.950
 right u seemed and click on 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:48.129
 piano up what 's actually 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.200
 everything 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.940
 There are a lot of levels in the game 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.980
 some levels will have very much 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.799
 to sweat 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.909
 not the very first time in the game will be very 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.700
 high-quality soundtracks 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:04.000
 the game of the act is deported from the computer i'm 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.250
 played her in the year so 2000 it was 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.790
 probably one of the first quests in which 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.459
 I played 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:13.870
