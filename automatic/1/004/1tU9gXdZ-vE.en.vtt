00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
heavy cream so a really kind of light

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.620 
heavy cream so a really kind of light
brown<00:03:23.410> very<00:03:24.410> much<00:03:24.650> like<00:03:25.060> cardboard<00:03:26.060> brown<00:03:26.600> I

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
brown very much like cardboard brown I

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.360 
brown very much like cardboard brown I
would<00:03:26.959> say<00:03:27.140> it's<00:03:27.380> a<00:03:27.440> little<00:03:27.709> hard<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.070> see<00:03:28.340> here

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
would say it's a little hard to see here

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.470 
would say it's a little hard to see here
because<00:03:28.880> of<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.090> different<00:03:29.330> type<00:03:29.450> of

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
because of the different type of

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.360 
because of the different type of
lighting<00:03:29.780> but<00:03:29.930> and<00:03:30.200> of<00:03:30.470> cardboard<00:03:31.010> brown

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370

lighting but and of cardboard brown
cardboard<00:03:32.150> box<00:03:32.540> Brown<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.910> you<00:03:34.910> know<00:03:35.000> pretty

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
cardboard box Brown and you know pretty

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.810 
cardboard box Brown and you know pretty
easy<00:03:35.540> to<00:03:35.720> read<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.920> crown<00:03:37.160> here<00:03:37.459> which

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
easy to read the the crown here which

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.670 
easy to read the the crown here which
should<00:03:38.000> just<00:03:38.180> pull<00:03:38.390> out<00:03:38.420> and<00:03:38.870> it<00:03:39.380> just<00:03:39.560> the

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
should just pull out and it just the

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
should just pull out and it just the
time<00:03:39.890> will<00:03:40.130> give<00:03:40.250> it<00:03:40.340> to<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.489> obligatory

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
time will give it to the obligatory

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.509 
time will give it to the obligatory
10/10<00:03:41.540> and<00:03:41.720> then<00:03:42.410> I<00:03:42.440> assume<00:03:42.680> you<00:03:43.040> move<00:03:43.250> it<00:03:43.400> all

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
10/10 and then I assume you move it all

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:44.710 
10/10 and then I assume you move it all
the<00:03:43.640> way<00:03:43.700> around<00:03:43.970> it<00:03:44.030> doesn't<00:03:44.209> seem<00:03:44.450> to<00:03:44.540> copy

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
the way around it doesn't seem to copy

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.720 
the way around it doesn't seem to copy
though<00:03:44.989> stop<00:03:45.320> so<00:03:45.920> you<00:03:45.950> probably<00:03:46.220> move<00:03:46.489> all<00:03:46.640> the

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
though stop so you probably move all the

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.550 
though stop so you probably move all the
way<00:03:46.760> around<00:03:47.000> the<00:03:47.090> midnight<00:03:47.269> position<00:03:47.870> to<00:03:48.049> to

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
way around the midnight position to to

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.199 
way around the midnight position to to
rotate<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.160> date<00:03:49.310> window<00:03:49.549> which<00:03:49.700> is<00:03:49.730> at<00:03:49.940> the<00:03:50.060> 3

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
rotate the date window which is at the 3

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.910 
rotate the date window which is at the 3
o'clock<00:03:50.239> but<00:03:50.900> then<00:03:51.019> it<00:03:51.140> does<00:03:51.290> have<00:03:51.320> a<00:03:51.530> light

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
o'clock but then it does have a light

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.310 
o'clock but then it does have a light
and<00:03:54.010> there<00:03:55.010> you<00:03:55.190> can<00:03:55.310> see<00:03:55.489> the<00:03:55.670> Indiglo<00:03:56.390> light

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
and there you can see the Indiglo light

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.770 
and there you can see the Indiglo light
back<00:03:57.620> light<00:03:57.890> goes<00:03:58.130> on<00:03:58.370> it's<00:03:58.970> only<00:03:59.269> on<00:03:59.510> when<00:03:59.690> you

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
back light goes on it's only on when you

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.270 
back light goes on it's only on when you
push<00:03:59.989> it<00:04:00.140> so<00:04:00.290> you<00:04:00.350> don't<00:04:00.560> get<00:04:00.680> a<00:04:00.739> little<00:04:00.920> bit<00:04:01.190> of

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
push it so you don't get a little bit of

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.039 
push it so you don't get a little bit of
you<00:04:01.430> don't<00:04:01.579> get<00:04:01.700> a<00:04:01.760> like<00:04:01.910> a<00:04:02.060> five-second<00:04:02.989> delay

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
you don't get a like a five-second delay

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.060 
you don't get a like a five-second delay
but<00:04:04.030> those<00:04:05.110> the<00:04:06.110> back<00:04:06.260> lights<00:04:06.530> for<00:04:06.680> watches

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
but those the back lights for watches

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.900 
but those the back lights for watches
are<00:04:07.340> very<00:04:07.820> very<00:04:08.390> useful<00:04:08.630> and<00:04:09.700> especially<00:04:10.700> when

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
are very very useful and especially when

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.870 
are very very useful and especially when
you're<00:04:11.030> out<00:04:11.209> in<00:04:11.480> the<00:04:11.630> in<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:12.680> woods<00:04:12.860> so<00:04:13.130> this
