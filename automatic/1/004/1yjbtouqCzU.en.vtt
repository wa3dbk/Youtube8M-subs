type<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.289> not<00:00:46.649> suited<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.219> Premier<00:00:47.579> League

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
so he's the first to go he's gone that's

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.330 
so he's the first to go he's gone that's
all<00:00:51.750> wrinkly<00:00:52.079> yeah<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.469> could<00:00:52.739> if<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:52.949> can<00:00:53.129> flog

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
in my would I just I don't think after

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.510 
in my would I just I don't think after
his<00:00:57.199> inconsistent<00:00:58.199> season<00:00:58.500> again<00:00:58.770> with<00:00:58.980> yet

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.979 
and anyone's gonna want the sign of Jack
so<00:01:02.430> you're<00:01:02.820> not<00:01:02.910> thinking<00:01:03.300> he<00:01:03.390> can<00:01:03.600> go<00:01:03.780> back<00:01:03.960> to

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
so you're not thinking he can go back to

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.990 
so you're not thinking he can go back to
holliston<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.769> do<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> good<00:01:05.100> job<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.460> mean<00:01:05.640> he

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
holliston and do a good job I mean he

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.899 
holliston and do a good job I mean he
could<00:01:06.270> do<00:01:06.510> but<00:01:06.900> his<00:01:07.590> agent<00:01:07.950> seems<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.820> be

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
could do but his agent seems to be

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.969 
could do but his agent seems to be
fairly<00:01:09.090> arrogant<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.960> thinks<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.590> he<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:10.890> a

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
fairly arrogant and thinks that he is a

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.490 
fairly arrogant and thinks that he is a
friendly<00:01:11.280> player<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.210> would<00:01:12.990> quite<00:01:13.229> like<00:01:13.439> to

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
friendly player so I would quite like to

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.630 
friendly player so I would quite like to
keep<00:01:13.740> Ricky<00:01:13.979> for<00:01:14.220> one<00:01:14.310> more<00:01:14.460> season

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
keep Ricky for one more season

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.990 
keep Ricky for one more season
personally<00:01:15.450> because<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.960> think<00:01:16.580> really<00:01:17.580> he

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
personally because I think really he

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.219 
personally because I think really he
needs<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.270> put<00:01:18.420> money<00:01:18.720> where<00:01:18.780> his<00:01:18.960> mouth<00:01:19.020> is

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
needs to put money where his mouth is

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.280 
needs to put money where his mouth is
and<00:01:19.680> he<00:01:20.460> used<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> fair<00:01:21.210> shot<00:01:21.240> under<00:01:22.170> an

attacking manager and canal he doesn't

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.170

the lift that he's a good striker those

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.560 
the lift that he's a good striker those
need<00:02:04.039> it<00:02:04.250> just<00:02:04.460> seems<00:02:04.729> like<00:02:04.850> we<00:02:05.060> could<00:02:05.210> get<00:02:05.359> in

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
need it just seems like we could get in

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.330 
need it just seems like we could get in
a<00:02:05.630> price<00:02:05.960> though<00:02:06.200> it<00:02:06.350> might<00:02:06.469> get<00:02:06.799> scored<00:02:07.070> a<00:02:07.159> lot

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
a price though it might get scored a lot

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.589 
a price though it might get scored a lot
of<00:02:07.460> goals<00:02:07.670> in<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:07.820> Premier<00:02:08.149> League<00:02:08.179> it's

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
of goals in the Premier League it's

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.809 
of goals in the Premier League it's
difficult<00:02:08.840> because<00:02:09.170> we<00:02:09.500> have<00:02:09.739> got<00:02:10.069> so<00:02:10.670> many

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
difficult because we have got so many

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.850 
difficult because we have got so many
good<00:02:11.030> strikers<00:02:11.569> now<00:02:11.780> it'd<00:02:12.290> be<00:02:12.680> interesting

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
good strikers now it'd be interesting

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.610 
good strikers now it'd be interesting
for<00:02:13.250> me<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.760> see<00:02:13.879> how<00:02:14.540> Jerome<00:02:15.019> before<00:02:15.230> busy

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
for me to see how Jerome before busy

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.470 
for me to see how Jerome before busy
lately<00:02:15.860> because<00:02:16.190> obviously<00:02:16.340> Jerome<00:02:16.910> jobs<00:02:17.239> off

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
lately because obviously Jerome jobs off

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.390 
lately because obviously Jerome jobs off
then<00:02:17.989> obviously<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:18.650> bring<00:02:18.890> Gary<00:02:19.099> deeper

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
then obviously you bring Gary deeper

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.759 
then obviously you bring Gary deeper
into<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.670> mix<00:02:19.879> I<00:02:20.150> think<00:02:20.720> I<00:02:20.900> was<00:02:21.080> gonna<00:02:21.200> he<00:02:21.650> is
