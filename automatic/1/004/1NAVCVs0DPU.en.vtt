00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.320 

okay<00:00:01.500> so<00:00:01.560> in<00:00:02.100> this<00:00:02.220> video<00:00:02.399> I'm<00:00:02.970> going<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.179> talk

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
okay so in this video I'm going to talk

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.030 
okay so in this video I'm going to talk
a<00:00:03.360> little<00:00:03.570> bit<00:00:03.780> about<00:00:04.009> significant<00:00:05.009> figures

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
a little bit about significant figures

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.639 
a little bit about significant figures
and<00:00:05.730> how<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.060> apply<00:00:06.330> them<00:00:06.600> when<00:00:07.080> it<00:00:07.170> comes<00:00:07.379> to

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
and how to apply them when it comes to

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.540 
and how to apply them when it comes to
logarithms<00:00:08.580> so<00:00:10.070> I'm<00:00:11.070> just<00:00:11.219> going<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.400> head

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
logarithms so I'm just going to head

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.890 
logarithms so I'm just going to head
going<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.000> go<00:00:12.059> ahead<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.420> start<00:00:12.630> with<00:00:12.780> an

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
going to go ahead and start with an

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.740 
going to go ahead and start with an
arbitrary<00:00:13.290> example<00:00:14.130> here<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:15.089> chose<00:00:15.509> the

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
arbitrary example here I chose the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.439 
arbitrary example here I chose the
logarithm<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.859> five<00:00:17.369> point<00:00:17.760> two<00:00:17.820> three<00:00:18.270> zero

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
logarithm of five point two three zero

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.490 
logarithm of five point two three zero
times<00:00:18.960> ten<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.529> six<00:00:20.060> so<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.689> basic<00:00:22.470> rule

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
times ten to the six so the basic rule

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.700 
times ten to the six so the basic rule
here<00:00:23.100> if<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.660> want<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.960> apply<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.500> right

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
here if you want to apply the right

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.050 
here if you want to apply the right
amount<00:00:25.769> significant<00:00:26.550> figures<00:00:26.789> in<00:00:26.970> the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
amount significant figures in the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.640 
amount significant figures in the
logarithm<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:28.199> you're<00:00:28.320> going<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.470> look

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
logarithm is that you're going to look

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.470 
logarithm is that you're going to look
at<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.859> number<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.160> significant<00:00:29.849> figures<00:00:29.880> in

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
at the number of significant figures in

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.870 
at the number of significant figures in
the<00:00:31.230> number<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.710> which<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.340> are<00:00:32.369> taking<00:00:32.790> a

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
the number of which you are taking a

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.310 
the number of which you are taking a
logarithm<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:33.510> whatever<00:00:33.780> you're<00:00:33.899> taking<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
logarithm so whatever you're taking the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.470 
logarithm so whatever you're taking the
logarithm<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.980> you're<00:00:35.730> going<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.910> identify

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
logarithm of you're going to identify

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.110 
logarithm of you're going to identify
that<00:00:37.440> number<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.890> significant<00:00:38.489> figures<00:00:38.520> and

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
that number of significant figures and

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.209 
that number of significant figures and
you're<00:00:39.270> going<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.450> keep<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:40.010> and<00:00:41.010> you're<00:00:41.129> going

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
you're going to keep it and you're going

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.830 
you're going to keep it and you're going
to<00:00:41.280> keep<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.550> mind<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.940> number<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.480> you're

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
to keep in mind that number and you're

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.200 
to keep in mind that number and you're
going<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:42.989> retain<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.770> what's<00:00:44.579> called<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
going to retain it in what's called the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:55.459 
going to retain it in what's called the
mantissa<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:47.129> logarithm<00:00:51.590> so<00:00:54.469> this

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
mantissa of the logarithm so this

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.840 
mantissa of the logarithm so this
section<00:00:56.129> right<00:00:56.280> here<00:00:58.489> is<00:00:59.489> called<00:00:59.699> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
section right here is called the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.779 
section right here is called the
mantissa<00:01:00.949> trick<00:01:01.949> my<00:01:02.100> arrow<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.399> little<00:01:02.670> bit

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
mantissa trick my arrow a little bit

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.219 
mantissa trick my arrow a little bit
better<00:01:04.040> and<00:01:05.150> just<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.240> little<00:01:06.330> jargon<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
better and just a little jargon the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.830 
better and just a little jargon the
mantissa<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.040> logarithm<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:09.510> just

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
mantissa of the logarithm is is just

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.260 
mantissa of the logarithm is is just
another<00:01:10.680> word<00:01:10.890> for<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.520> know<00:01:11.640> whatever<00:01:11.850> comes

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
another word for you know whatever comes

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.710 
another word for you know whatever comes
after<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> decimal<00:01:12.930> point<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.950> logarithm

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
after the decimal point in a logarithm

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.999 
after the decimal point in a logarithm
so<00:01:15.720> for<00:01:16.380> example<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.130> example<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.880> says

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
so for example in this example it says

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.499 
so for example in this example it says
five<00:01:20.009> point<00:01:20.310> two<00:01:20.670> three<00:01:20.820> zero<00:01:21.090> times<00:01:21.299> ten<00:01:21.450> to

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
five point two three zero times ten to

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.609 
five point two three zero times ten to
the<00:01:21.540> negative<00:01:21.630> six<00:01:21.930> well<00:01:22.170> how<00:01:22.229> many<00:01:22.380> sig<00:01:22.590> figs

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
the negative six well how many sig figs

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.940 
the negative six well how many sig figs
does<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.159> have<00:01:24.110> looks<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.290> me<00:01:25.439> like<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.770> has

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
does that have looks to me like this has

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.719 
does that have looks to me like this has
four<00:01:29.960> notice<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.650> mantissa<00:01:32.040> ie

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
four notice that in the mantissa ie

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.120 
four notice that in the mantissa ie
whatever<00:01:33.659> comes<00:01:33.960> after<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.439> decimal<00:01:34.619> point

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
whatever comes after the decimal point

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.030 
whatever comes after the decimal point
and<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.490> answer<00:01:35.909> here<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.869> also<00:01:37.049> has<00:01:37.350> four

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
and this answer here that also has four

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.260 
and this answer here that also has four
significant<00:01:38.670> figures<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:41.090> it's<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> little

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
significant figures so it's a little

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.420 
significant figures so it's a little
tricky<00:01:42.479> at<00:01:42.750> first<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:43.140> if<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.040> have<00:01:44.189> one<00:01:44.340> of

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
tricky at first but if you have one of

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.800 
tricky at first but if you have one of
those<00:01:44.490> professors<00:01:44.850> that's<00:01:45.149> really<00:01:45.329> nitpicky

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
those professors that's really nitpicky

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.030 
those professors that's really nitpicky
on<00:01:45.930> getting<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.290> right<00:01:46.470> number<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.770> sig<00:01:47.009> figs

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
on getting the right number of sig figs

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
on getting the right number of sig figs
every<00:01:47.490> time<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.049> you'll<00:01:49.049> definitely<00:01:49.200> want<00:01:49.619> to

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
every time and you'll definitely want to

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.660 
every time and you'll definitely want to
commit<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.360> memory<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:52.340> also<00:01:53.340> when<00:01:53.579> it

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
commit this to memory and also when it

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.569 
commit this to memory and also when it
comes<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.090> anti<00:01:54.659> logarithms<00:01:55.369> you're<00:01:56.369> going<00:01:56.490> to

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
comes to anti logarithms you're going to

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.959 
comes to anti logarithms you're going to
apply<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.790> same<00:01:57.149> rule<00:01:58.009> but<00:01:59.009> in<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.250> opposite

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
apply the same rule but in the opposite

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.190 
apply the same rule but in the opposite
direction<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.570> instead<00:02:00.869> you're<00:02:01.020> going<00:02:01.140> to

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
direction so instead you're going to

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.539 
direction so instead you're going to
look<00:02:01.290> at<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.469> mantissa<00:02:01.860> first<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.430> then

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
look at the mantissa first and then

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.980 
look at the mantissa first and then
you're<00:02:02.640> going<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.790> carry<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.180> out<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.630> then

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
you're going to carry that out and then

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.749 
you're going to carry that out and then
whatever<00:02:04.380> your<00:02:04.860> number<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.369> that's<00:02:05.549> going<00:02:05.700> to

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
whatever your number is that's going to

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.429 
whatever your number is that's going to
have<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.909> same<00:02:06.210> number<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.869> significant

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
have the same number of significant

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.270 
have the same number of significant
figures<00:02:07.680> as<00:02:07.829> whatever<00:02:08.009> your<00:02:08.310> mantissa<00:02:08.670> had<00:02:09.259> in

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
figures as whatever your mantissa had in

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.339 
figures as whatever your mantissa had in
the<00:02:11.280> beginning

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
the beginning

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.989 
the beginning
so<00:02:12.859> that<00:02:13.129> might<00:02:13.249> turn<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.459> little<00:02:13.670> confusing

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:13.999 
so that might turn a little confusing

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:15.039 
so that might turn a little confusing
but<00:02:14.180> I'll<00:02:14.299> take<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:14.569> through<00:02:14.719> a<00:02:14.749> couple<00:02:14.900> of

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
but I'll take you through a couple of

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.479 
but I'll take you through a couple of
examples<00:02:15.349> just<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.859> show<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:16.159> what<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.310> mean

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
examples just to show you what I mean

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:24.550 
examples just to show you what I mean
okay<00:02:20.709> so<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.829> first<00:02:21.980> example<00:02:22.129> here<00:02:23.560> says

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
okay so the first example here says

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.509 
okay so the first example here says
we're<00:02:24.709> just<00:02:24.739> going<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.010> take<00:02:25.159> the<00:02:25.310> logarithm

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
we're just going to take the logarithm

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:34.750 
we're just going to take the logarithm
of<00:02:26.030> two<00:02:26.810> point<00:02:27.379> zero<00:02:27.530> zero<00:02:27.859> zero<00:02:30.370> now<00:02:33.670> when<00:02:34.670> we

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
of two point zero zero zero now when we

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.490 
of two point zero zero zero now when we
take<00:02:34.939> this<00:02:35.060> logarithm<00:02:35.480> generally<00:02:36.349> what<00:02:36.469> I

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
take this logarithm generally what I

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.259 
take this logarithm generally what I
like<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.799> do<00:02:36.950> is<00:02:37.159> I<00:02:37.250> like<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.430> just<00:02:37.819> carry<00:02:38.120> out

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
like to do is I like to just carry out

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.449 
like to do is I like to just carry out
the<00:02:38.419> calculation<00:02:38.989> first<00:02:39.319> in<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.919> calculator

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
the calculation first in the calculator

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.770 
the calculation first in the calculator
and<00:02:40.609> then<00:02:40.700> worry<00:02:40.939> about<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.510> know<00:02:41.629> the

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
and then worry about you know the

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.909 
and then worry about you know the
correct<00:02:41.989> number<00:02:42.260> of<00:02:42.290> significant<00:02:42.889> figures

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:42.919 
correct number of significant figures

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:45.789 
correct number of significant figures
and<00:02:43.310> stuff<00:02:43.459> like<00:02:43.609> that<00:02:43.849> later<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:45.439> may<00:02:45.590> want

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
and stuff like that later you may want

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:46.990 
and stuff like that later you may want
to<00:02:45.859> do<00:02:45.980> it<00:02:46.069> the<00:02:46.159> other<00:02:46.189> way<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:46.609> identify

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
to do it the other way and identify

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.940 
to do it the other way and identify
significant<00:02:47.510> figures<00:02:47.750> first<00:02:47.959> that's<00:02:48.680> fine

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
significant figures first that's fine

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.089 
significant figures first that's fine
either<00:02:49.519> way<00:02:49.730> you'll<00:02:49.879> get<00:02:49.939> the<00:02:50.090> same<00:02:50.269> answer<00:02:51.099> so

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
either way you'll get the same answer so

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.459 
either way you'll get the same answer so
if<00:02:52.430> we<00:02:52.519> put<00:02:52.699> this<00:02:52.819> into<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.120> calculator<00:02:53.469> I've

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:54.469 
if we put this into the calculator I've

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.179 
if we put this into the calculator I've
already<00:02:54.859> done<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.189> so<00:02:55.629> that's<00:02:56.629> going<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:56.870> be

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
already done it so that's going to be

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:05.740 
already done it so that's going to be
zero<00:02:58.389> point<00:02:59.859> three<00:03:00.859> zero<00:03:01.579> one<00:03:01.969> zero<00:03:03.069> two<00:03:04.750> nine

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
zero point three zero one zero two nine

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.429 
zero point three zero one zero two nine
nine<00:03:06.139> nine<00:03:07.000> and<00:03:08.000> there's<00:03:08.569> other<00:03:08.719> decimal

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:09.439 
nine nine and there's other decimal

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.229 
nine nine and there's other decimal
point<00:03:09.680> other<00:03:10.159> decimal<00:03:10.519> places<00:03:10.699> in<00:03:10.939> here<00:03:11.090> but

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
point other decimal places in here but

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.039 
point other decimal places in here but
we're<00:03:11.359> not<00:03:11.449> really<00:03:11.569> going<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:11.810> worry<00:03:11.989> about

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
we're not really going to worry about

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.899 
we're not really going to worry about
carrying<00:03:12.409> out<00:03:12.620> that<00:03:12.859> far<00:03:13.099> we've<00:03:13.549> already<00:03:13.699> gone

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
carrying out that far we've already gone

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:19.059 
carrying out that far we've already gone
far<00:03:14.209> enough<00:03:15.069> so<00:03:17.409> the<00:03:18.409> next<00:03:18.620> step<00:03:18.799> is<00:03:18.949> to

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
far enough so the next step is to

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.189 
far enough so the next step is to
identify<00:03:19.159> the<00:03:19.579> number<00:03:19.759> of<00:03:20.000> sig<00:03:20.209> figs<00:03:20.239> in<00:03:20.720> this

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:21.199 
identify the number of sig figs in this

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:23.589 
identify the number of sig figs in this
number<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:22.790> number<00:03:23.030> that<00:03:23.120> you're<00:03:23.209> taking<00:03:23.509> the

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
number the number that you're taking the

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.580 
number the number that you're taking the
logarithm<00:03:23.900> of<00:03:24.199> and<00:03:25.389> this<00:03:26.389> appears<00:03:27.229> to<00:03:27.319> me<00:03:27.560> to

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
logarithm of and this appears to me to

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.009 
logarithm of and this appears to me to
have<00:03:27.829> four<00:03:29.620> significant<00:03:30.620> figures<00:03:31.629> so<00:03:32.629> since

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
have four significant figures so since

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.140 
have four significant figures so since
that<00:03:33.169> has<00:03:33.319> four<00:03:33.650> significant<00:03:34.159> figures<00:03:34.220> we're

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
that has four significant figures we're

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.640 
that has four significant figures we're
going<00:03:35.269> to<00:03:35.329> keep<00:03:35.509> four<00:03:35.810> significant<00:03:36.349> figures

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
going to keep four significant figures

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.749 
going to keep four significant figures
in<00:03:36.859> the<00:03:37.250> mantissa<00:03:37.669> of<00:03:38.540> our<00:03:38.629> answer

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:39.759 
in the mantissa of our answer

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:41.949 
in the mantissa of our answer
therefore<00:03:40.759> our<00:03:41.000> new<00:03:41.180> answer<00:03:41.479> is<00:03:41.629> going<00:03:41.840> to

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
therefore our new answer is going to

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:48.749 
therefore our new answer is going to
become<00:03:42.790> zero<00:03:43.810> point<00:03:44.810> three<00:03:45.379> zero<00:03:45.590> one<00:03:46.720> zero

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:48.759 
become zero point three zero one zero

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:52.119 
become zero point three zero one zero
four<00:03:49.759> sig<00:03:50.000> figs<00:03:50.239> in<00:03:50.389> the<00:03:50.449> mantissa<00:03:50.810> here<00:03:51.199> four

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
four sig figs in the mantissa here four

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:55.780 
four sig figs in the mantissa here four
sig<00:03:52.370> figs<00:03:52.669> in<00:03:52.939> this<00:03:53.930> number<00:03:54.199> up<00:03:54.349> here<00:03:54.790> pretty

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
sig figs in this number up here pretty

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.959 
sig figs in this number up here pretty
straightforward<00:03:57.099> so<00:03:58.099> maybe<00:03:58.280> go<00:03:58.370> ahead<00:03:58.759> and<00:03:58.879> do

00:03:58.959 --> 00:03:58.969 
straightforward so maybe go ahead and do

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:01.749 
straightforward so maybe go ahead and do
an<00:03:59.060> example<00:03:59.449> of<00:03:59.569> an<00:04:00.169> anti<00:04:00.469> logarithm<00:04:01.009> real

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:01.759 
an example of an anti logarithm real

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:24.800 
an example of an anti logarithm real
quick<00:04:02.019> and<00:04:03.019> then<00:04:03.139> we'll<00:04:03.259> be<00:04:03.379> done

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.420 

the<00:04:25.810> anti<00:04:26.139> logarithm<00:04:26.620> of<00:04:26.770> three<00:04:27.010> point<00:04:27.190> four

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
the anti logarithm of three point four

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.390 
the anti logarithm of three point four
five<00:04:27.610> times<00:04:28.090> ten<00:04:28.600> to<00:04:28.720> the<00:04:28.750> negative<00:04:28.900> four<00:04:29.400> so

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
five times ten to the negative four so

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.430 
five times ten to the negative four so
instead<00:04:30.730> of<00:04:30.790> seeing<00:04:31.510> you<00:04:32.139> know<00:04:32.260> the

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
instead of seeing you know the

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.810 
instead of seeing you know the
significant<00:04:32.950> figures<00:04:33.190> of<00:04:33.370> this<00:04:33.460> entire

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
significant figures of this entire

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.820 
significant figures of this entire
number<00:04:34.139> we're<00:04:35.139> going<00:04:35.260> to<00:04:35.320> apply<00:04:35.440> that<00:04:35.650> in<00:04:35.800> the

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
number we're going to apply that in the

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.960 
number we're going to apply that in the
opposite<00:04:36.220> direction<00:04:36.340> and<00:04:36.669> we're<00:04:36.790> going<00:04:36.910> to

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
opposite direction and we're going to

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.520 
opposite direction and we're going to
focus<00:04:37.120> on<00:04:37.389> the<00:04:37.540> sig<00:04:37.750> figs<00:04:37.960> and<00:04:38.050> the<00:04:38.139> mantissa

focus on the sig figs and the mantissa

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.950 
focus on the sig figs and the mantissa
first<00:04:38.919> but<00:04:39.250> putting<00:04:40.090> it<00:04:40.180> into<00:04:40.360> a<00:04:40.419> calculator

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
first but putting it into a calculator

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.400 
first but putting it into a calculator
that's<00:04:41.530> going<00:04:41.770> to<00:04:41.830> give<00:04:41.950> us<00:04:42.040> this<00:04:42.220> answer<00:04:43.410> one

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
that's going to give us this answer one

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:51.000 
that's going to give us this answer one
point<00:04:45.160> zero<00:04:45.960> zero<00:04:46.960> zero<00:04:48.060> seven<00:04:49.060> nine<00:04:49.680> four<00:04:50.680> and

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
point zero zero zero seven nine four and

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.990 
point zero zero zero seven nine four and
it<00:04:51.520> keeps<00:04:51.730> going<00:04:53.310> but<00:04:54.310> like<00:04:54.520> I<00:04:54.640> said<00:04:54.700> we've

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
it keeps going but like I said we've

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.400 
it keeps going but like I said we've
already<00:04:55.120> carried<00:04:55.510> out<00:04:55.600> it<00:04:55.720> up<00:04:55.810> here<00:04:56.020> too

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
already carried out it up here too

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.620 
already carried out it up here too
so<00:04:59.100> now<00:05:00.100> we<00:05:00.160> focus<00:05:00.520> on<00:05:00.760> significant<00:05:01.300> figures

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
so now we focus on significant figures

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.230 
so now we focus on significant figures
well<00:05:01.810> since<00:05:02.650> this<00:05:02.800> is<00:05:03.040> this<00:05:03.760> number<00:05:04.120> is

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
well since this is this number is

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.909 
well since this is this number is
already<00:05:04.419> a<00:05:04.630> logarithm<00:05:05.230> this<00:05:05.650> is<00:05:05.800> the

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
already a logarithm this is the

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.860 
already a logarithm this is the
logarithm<00:05:06.190> that<00:05:06.640> you're<00:05:06.760> taking<00:05:07.210> you're<00:05:07.660> just

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
logarithm that you're taking you're just

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.719 
logarithm that you're taking you're just
taking<00:05:07.990> the<00:05:08.290> anti<00:05:08.500> log<00:05:08.740> of<00:05:08.890> it<00:05:09.010> so<00:05:09.490> we're<00:05:09.640> going

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
taking the anti log of it so we're going

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.550 
taking the anti log of it so we're going
to<00:05:09.820> look<00:05:09.910> at<00:05:10.030> the<00:05:10.120> mantissa<00:05:10.479> and<00:05:10.960> it<00:05:11.080> looks<00:05:11.260> to

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
to look at the mantissa and it looks to

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.340 
to look at the mantissa and it looks to
me<00:05:11.710> like<00:05:12.060> the<00:05:13.060> mantissa<00:05:13.450> here<00:05:13.750> has<00:05:14.020> two

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
me like the mantissa here has two

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.280 
me like the mantissa here has two
significant<00:05:17.350> figures<00:05:17.650> so<00:05:18.510> that<00:05:19.510> means<00:05:20.080> we're

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
significant figures so that means we're

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.350 
significant figures so that means we're
going<00:05:20.380> to<00:05:20.470> keep<00:05:20.650> two<00:05:21.130> significant<00:05:21.700> figures<00:05:22.000> in

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
going to keep two significant figures in

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.650 
going to keep two significant figures in
our<00:05:23.200> answer<00:05:23.530> so<00:05:23.740> our<00:05:24.490> answer<00:05:24.760> then<00:05:24.940> becomes

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.880 

one<00:05:28.660> point<00:05:28.930> zero<00:05:31.350> like<00:05:32.350> I<00:05:32.470> said<00:05:32.680> pretty

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
one point zero like I said pretty

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.740 
one point zero like I said pretty
straightforward<00:05:33.520> so<00:05:33.850> hopefully<00:05:34.390> this<00:05:34.539> helps

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
straightforward so hopefully this helps

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.640 
straightforward so hopefully this helps
a<00:05:34.810> little<00:05:34.900> bit<00:05:35.140> and<00:05:35.490> good<00:05:36.490> luck
