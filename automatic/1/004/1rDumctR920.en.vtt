you

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.330 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.500 

we<00:00:11.330> have<00:00:11.450> this<00:00:11.570> thing<00:00:11.750> called<00:00:11.809> top-down

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.510 
we have this thing called top-down

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.660 
we have this thing called top-down
constraints<00:00:14.510> which<00:00:14.719> are<00:00:14.900> basically<00:00:15.670> let's

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
constraints which are basically let's

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.519 
constraints which are basically let's
say<00:00:16.759> you've<00:00:17.029> gone<00:00:17.419> to<00:00:17.890> a<00:00:19.180> walk<00:00:20.180> in<00:00:20.810> a<00:00:20.960> park<00:00:20.990> and

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
say you've gone to a walk in a park and

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.440 
say you've gone to a walk in a park and
there's<00:00:21.680> a<00:00:21.740> flower<00:00:21.970> your<00:00:22.970> top-down

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:23.450 
there's a flower your top-down

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.450 
there's a flower your top-down
constraint<00:00:23.869> would<00:00:24.050> go<00:00:24.259> flower<00:00:24.710> the<00:00:25.279> word

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
constraint would go flower the word

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.900 
constraint would go flower the word
flower<00:00:25.849> FL<00:00:26.570> OWR<00:00:27.290> flower<00:00:27.739> so<00:00:28.489> instead<00:00:28.849> of

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
flower FL OWR flower so instead of

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.760 
flower FL OWR flower so instead of
stopping<00:00:29.630> and<00:00:30.189> pausing<00:00:31.189> and<00:00:32.649> smelling<00:00:33.649> the

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
stopping and pausing and smelling the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.229 
stopping and pausing and smelling the
aroma<00:00:33.800> of<00:00:34.309> this<00:00:35.379> entity<00:00:36.379> right<00:00:37.309> now<00:00:37.610> right

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
aroma of this entity right now right

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.800 
aroma of this entity right now right
here<00:00:38.539> and<00:00:41.920> just<00:00:42.920> you<00:00:43.850> know<00:00:43.880> taking<00:00:44.690> that

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
here and just you know taking that

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.180 
here and just you know taking that
moment<00:00:45.260> to<00:00:45.380> be<00:00:45.650> there<00:00:46.190> from<00:00:46.460> a<00:00:46.579> bottom-up<00:00:47.420> way

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
moment to be there from a bottom-up way

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.610 
moment to be there from a bottom-up way
um<00:00:49.190> instead<00:00:49.610> you're<00:00:49.850> walking<00:00:50.239> your<00:00:50.329> dog<00:00:50.620> you

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
um instead you're walking your dog you

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.889 
um instead you're walking your dog you
think<00:00:51.860> your<00:00:52.070> thoughts<00:00:52.220> and<00:00:52.610> all<00:00:53.329> you<00:00:53.600> see<00:00:53.780> is<00:00:53.870> a

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
think your thoughts and all you see is a

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.260 
think your thoughts and all you see is a
flower<00:00:54.140> and<00:00:54.350> it's<00:00:54.860> nothing<00:00:55.220> it's<00:00:55.790> literally

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
flower and it's nothing it's literally

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.420 
flower and it's nothing it's literally
nothing<00:00:57.250> so<00:00:58.250> in<00:00:59.200> the<00:01:00.200> same<00:01:00.440> way<00:01:00.590> in<00:01:00.739> romance<00:01:01.190> I

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
nothing so in the same way in romance I

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.259 
nothing so in the same way in romance I
think<00:01:01.640> what<00:01:01.790> can<00:01:01.880> happen<00:01:02.149> is<00:01:02.630> top-down<00:01:04.269> brain

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
think what can happen is top-down brain

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.859 
think what can happen is top-down brain
processes<00:01:06.460> that<00:01:07.460> you<00:01:07.909> know<00:01:08.060> we<00:01:08.450> could<00:01:08.630> talk

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
processes that you know we could talk

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.749 
processes that you know we could talk
about<00:01:09.049> how<00:01:09.680> that<00:01:09.740> happens<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:10.280> brain<00:01:10.430> we<00:01:10.579> know

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
about how that happens the brain we know

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.370 
about how that happens the brain we know
how<00:01:10.939> it<00:01:11.060> happens<00:01:11.299> but<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:11.600> bottom<00:01:12.079> line<00:01:12.229> is

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
how it happens but the bottom line is

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.620 
how it happens but the bottom line is
you<00:01:12.500> have<00:01:12.530> these<00:01:12.920> ways<00:01:13.220> that<00:01:13.450> incoming<00:01:14.450> data

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
you have these ways that incoming data

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.210 
you have these ways that incoming data
which<00:01:14.900> is<00:01:15.020> called<00:01:15.229> bottom-up<00:01:15.650> get

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
which is called bottom-up get

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.149 
which is called bottom-up get
constrained<00:01:16.970> by<00:01:17.210> top-down<00:01:17.900> influences<00:01:18.159> so

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
constrained by top-down influences so

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.990 
constrained by top-down influences so
you<00:01:19.220> say<00:01:19.490> this<00:01:20.030> is<00:01:20.270> my<00:01:20.450> wife<00:01:21.460> this<00:01:22.460> is<00:01:22.520> just<00:01:22.909> a

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
you say this is my wife this is just a

you say this is my wife this is just a

pebble that's just a sunset you know how

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.030 
pebble that's just a sunset you know how
do<00:02:00.110> we<00:02:00.200> actually<00:02:00.560> awaken<00:02:01.310> ourselves<00:02:03.040> to

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
do we actually awaken ourselves to

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.090 
do we actually awaken ourselves to
embrace<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:05.150> miracle<00:02:05.810> of<00:02:05.930> being<00:02:06.079> alive<00:02:06.350> so

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
embrace the miracle of being alive so

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.720 
embrace the miracle of being alive so
the<00:02:07.939> pathway<00:02:08.409> toward<00:02:09.819> freeing<00:02:10.870> ourselves<00:02:11.870> in

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
the pathway toward freeing ourselves in

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.630 
the pathway toward freeing ourselves in
romance<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.060> in<00:02:14.150> any<00:02:14.329> other<00:02:14.450> part<00:02:15.049> of<00:02:15.140> life<00:02:15.640> is

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
romance and in any other part of life is

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.600 
romance and in any other part of life is
to<00:02:16.939> allow<00:02:17.720> yourself<00:02:18.349> to<00:02:18.560> learn<00:02:19.310> how<00:02:19.580> to

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
to allow yourself to learn how to

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.270 
to allow yourself to learn how to
dissolve<00:02:20.209> the<00:02:20.959> top-down<00:02:21.230> constraints

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
dissolve the top-down constraints

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.190 
dissolve the top-down constraints
so<00:02:22.640> in<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.790> mindful<00:02:23.180> brain<00:02:23.390> I<00:02:23.690> actually<00:02:23.900> talk

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
so in the mindful brain I actually talk

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.110 
so in the mindful brain I actually talk
about<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.620> neural<00:02:25.160> mechanisms<00:02:25.190> of<00:02:25.880> doing

about the neural mechanisms of doing

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.030 
about the neural mechanisms of doing
that<00:02:26.270> and<00:02:26.480> here<00:02:27.200> I'll<00:02:27.290> just<00:02:27.320> summarize<00:02:27.680> you

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
that and here I'll just summarize you

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.860 
that and here I'll just summarize you
know<00:02:28.190> that<00:02:28.340> there<00:02:28.910> is<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.120> way<00:02:29.420> through

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
know that there is a way through
