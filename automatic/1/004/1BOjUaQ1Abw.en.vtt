we're<00:00:04.410> changing<00:00:04.830> out<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.009> carbon<00:00:05.609> I<00:00:05.790> have

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
we're changing out the carbon I have

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.200 
we're changing out the carbon I have
some<00:00:07.020> of<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.230> carbon<00:00:07.680> in<00:00:07.710> this<00:00:08.099> water<00:00:08.519> it's

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
some of the carbon in this water it's

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.419 
some of the carbon in this water it's
just<00:00:09.420> RO<00:00:09.660> water<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.320> it's<00:00:10.440> just<00:00:10.679> so<00:00:10.889> can<00:00:11.130> you

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
just RO water and it's just so can you

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.950 
just RO water and it's just so can you
can<00:00:11.610> see<00:00:11.790> it's<00:00:11.940> kind<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.240> black<00:00:12.480> so<00:00:12.809> we're

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
can see it's kind of black so we're

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.730 
can see it's kind of black so we're
trying<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.320> get<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.620> best<00:00:13.799> off<00:00:15.560> so<00:00:16.560> we're

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
trying to get the best off so we're

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.109 
trying to get the best off so we're
going<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.920> cut<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.310> off<00:00:19.039> not<00:00:20.039> off<00:00:20.279> but<00:00:20.640> open

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
going to cut this off not off but open

00:00:21.119 --> 00:01:12.650 
going to cut this off not off but open
rather

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.030 

it's<00:01:13.660> kind<00:01:13.930> of<00:01:14.080> tough<00:01:14.320> further<00:01:14.740> than<00:01:14.920> I

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
it's kind of tough further than I

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:29.030 
it's kind of tough further than I
thought<00:01:15.250> it<00:01:15.310> would<00:01:15.430> be

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.950 

take<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.730> shuttle<00:01:30.210> down<00:01:31.370> that's<00:01:32.370> buttoned

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
take a shuttle down that's buttoned

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:53.530 
take a shuttle down that's buttoned
buddy<00:01:33.960> can<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.650> speak<00:01:34.830> the<00:01:35.090> boy

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:00.100 

okay<00:01:54.410> so<00:01:54.470> we're<00:01:54.890> in<00:01:54.920> there<00:01:55.250> pretty<00:01:55.490> well<00:01:59.110> and

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
okay so we're in there pretty well and

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.780 
okay so we're in there pretty well and
what<00:02:00.890> I'm<00:02:01.010> going<00:02:01.250> to<00:02:01.280> do<00:02:02.500> is<00:02:03.500> put<00:02:04.280> it<00:02:04.400> down<00:02:04.610> the

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
what I'm going to do is put it down the

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.120 
what I'm going to do is put it down the
sink<00:02:05.060> here<00:02:05.420> we<00:02:05.570> got<00:02:05.750> a<00:02:05.780> garbage<00:02:06.260> disposal<00:02:06.440> so

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
sink here we got a garbage disposal so

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:24.760 
sink here we got a garbage disposal so
shouldn't<00:02:07.520> be<00:02:07.610> too<00:02:07.820> bad

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:34.960 

gone<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:25.980> read<00:02:26.520> to

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.589 

and<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.300> seems<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.930> be<00:02:37.849> pretty<00:02:38.849> much<00:02:39.090> all<00:02:39.390> out

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
and it seems to be pretty much all out

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:50.910 
and it seems to be pretty much all out
of<00:02:39.780> there

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.289 

and<00:02:51.920> I'm<00:02:52.189> just<00:02:52.340> going<00:02:52.549> to<00:02:52.640> give<00:02:52.879> it<00:02:53.000> a<00:02:53.060> nice

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
and I'm just going to give it a nice

00:02:53.299 --> 00:03:15.190 
and I'm just going to give it a nice
rinse<00:02:53.659> with<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.140> RO<00:02:54.349> water<00:03:04.930> donkey<00:03:05.930> out

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:24.630 

when<00:03:15.950> our<00:03:16.129> scientific<00:03:16.760> way<00:03:17.120> of<00:03:17.150> strange<00:03:19.989> tola

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.699 

you<00:03:25.640> know<00:03:25.760> what<00:03:26.000> I<00:03:26.300> can<00:03:26.870> probably<00:03:27.080> just<00:03:27.319> pour

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
you know what I can probably just pour

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:40.559 
you know what I can probably just pour
it<00:03:27.830> right<00:03:27.860> in<00:03:28.220> here<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:38.120> this<00:03:38.810> was<00:03:39.080> about<00:03:39.349> two

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
it right in here and this was about two

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:51.280 
it right in here and this was about two
teaspoons

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.220 

it's<00:03:51.799> really<00:03:52.129> cheap<00:03:52.459> it's<00:03:52.730> like<00:03:52.909> five<00:03:53.900> bucks

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
it's really cheap it's like five bucks

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.380 
it's really cheap it's like five bucks
for<00:03:54.680> a<00:03:55.480> pound<00:03:56.480> of<00:03:56.750> it<00:03:56.900> so<00:03:57.549> I'm<00:03:58.549> not<00:03:58.760> too<00:03:58.819> worried

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
for a pound of it so I'm not too worried

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:19.440 
for a pound of it so I'm not too worried
about<00:04:00.340> wasting<00:04:01.340> much

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:33.310 

and<00:04:20.450> then<00:04:20.690> just<00:04:21.050> give<00:04:21.410> you<00:04:21.500> this<00:04:21.620> equation<00:04:22.340> 2

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.380 

and<00:04:33.860> now<00:04:34.160> it's<00:04:34.340> just<00:04:34.460> going<00:04:34.700> to<00:04:34.760> go<00:04:34.910> back<00:04:35.150> in

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
and now it's just going to go back in

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.130 
and now it's just going to go back in
like<00:04:35.600> this<00:04:36.250> you<00:04:37.250> can<00:04:37.460> cut<00:04:37.670> it<00:04:37.700> up<00:04:37.910> here<00:04:38.420> but<00:04:39.020> I

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
like this you can cut it up here but I

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.660 
like this you can cut it up here but I
didn't<00:04:39.440> want<00:04:39.620> to<00:04:39.710> cut<00:04:39.920> it<00:04:40.070> up<00:04:40.190> there<00:04:40.460> because

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
didn't want to cut it up there because

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.070 
didn't want to cut it up there because
right<00:04:41.000> here<00:04:41.030> it's<00:04:41.480> not<00:04:41.690> stitched<00:04:42.400> you<00:04:43.400> know<00:04:44.080> so

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
right here it's not stitched you know so

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.310 
right here it's not stitched you know so
shouldn't<00:04:45.740> be<00:04:45.920> a<00:04:45.950> problem<00:04:47.170> and<00:04:48.170> that's<00:04:49.100> it
