00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
like this as you can see they're very

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.599 
like this as you can see they're very
soft<00:01:01.719> so<00:01:01.989> they<00:01:02.109> don't<00:01:02.320> hurt<00:01:02.559> your<00:01:02.769> ears<00:01:02.949> the

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
soft so they don't hurt your ears the

wire is 1.2 meters long or 4 feet long a

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.429 
wire is 1.2 meters long or 4 feet long a
bad<00:01:07.090> thing<00:01:07.360> about<00:01:07.570> this<00:01:07.780> is<00:01:07.990> that<00:01:08.079> the<00:01:08.259> wire

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
bad thing about this is that the wire

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.649 
bad thing about this is that the wire
takes<00:01:08.799> all<00:01:09.070> the<00:01:09.220> two<00:01:09.400> slots<00:01:09.759> and<00:01:10.060> your<00:01:10.420> friend

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
for example on the beat now let's see

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.090 
for example on the beat now let's see
how<00:01:17.770> flexible<00:01:18.009> the<00:01:18.430> head<00:01:18.640> panel<00:01:19.030> can<00:01:19.210> get<00:01:19.420> as

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
how flexible the head panel can get as

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.859 
how flexible the head panel can get as
you<00:01:21.100> can<00:01:21.220> see<00:01:21.399> here<00:01:21.610> it's<00:01:21.759> very<00:01:21.850> very<00:01:22.600> flexible

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
you can see here it's very very flexible

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.929 
you can see here it's very very flexible
in<00:01:23.229> case<00:01:23.409> if<00:01:23.560> you<00:01:23.649> have<00:01:23.770> a<00:01:23.799> big<00:01:24.250> head<00:01:24.490> or<00:01:24.700> a

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
inside the earphones in case that they

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.880 
inside the earphones in case that they
do<00:01:30.729> it<00:01:30.909> in<00:01:31.060> your<00:01:31.180> bag<00:01:31.390> they<00:01:32.200> won't<00:01:32.439> break<00:01:32.649> at

all and although there is absolutely no

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.670 
all and although there is absolutely no
reason<00:01:35.020> to<00:01:35.229> do<00:01:35.439> that

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
reason to do that

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.920 
reason to do that

this actually represents how flexible
these<00:01:38.110> can<00:01:38.469> get<00:01:38.710> and<00:01:39.070> I<00:01:39.430> must<00:01:39.640> say<00:01:39.820> that<00:01:39.850> not

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
these can get and I must say that not

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.420 
these can get and I must say that not
only<00:01:40.270> they<00:01:40.659> are<00:01:40.689> flexible<00:01:41.380> they're<00:01:41.740> also<00:01:41.950> very

just<00:01:46.930> need<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.320> put<00:01:47.500> your<00:01:47.649> ear<00:01:47.829> pads<00:01:48.100> just<00:01:48.490> like

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
just need to put your ear pads just like

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.940 
just need to put your ear pads just like
this<00:01:48.789> together<00:01:49.030> and<00:01:49.479> fold<00:01:49.899> them<00:01:50.049> in<00:01:50.229> as<00:01:50.439> you

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
this together and fold them in as you

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.039 
this together and fold them in as you
can<00:01:51.100> see<00:01:51.250> they<00:01:51.430> don't<00:01:51.640> take<00:01:51.939> as<00:01:52.180> much<00:01:52.450> space<00:01:52.750> as

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
can see they don't take as much space as

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.469 
can see they don't take as much space as
they<00:01:53.200> would<00:01:53.350> take<00:01:53.939> unfolded<00:01:54.939> you<00:01:55.180> can<00:01:55.329> also

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
they would take unfolded you can also

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.080 
they would take unfolded you can also
roll<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:56.380> wire<00:01:56.979> around<00:01:57.250> them<00:01:57.670> so<00:01:57.850> that<00:01:57.969> it

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
roll the wire around them so that it

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.179 
roll the wire around them so that it
doesn't<00:01:58.509> break<00:01:58.750> or<00:01:59.049> anything<00:01:59.289> in<00:01:59.799> your<00:01:59.979> bag

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
doesn't break or anything in your bag

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.789 
doesn't break or anything in your bag
once<00:02:01.060> you<00:02:01.210> did<00:02:01.359> that<00:02:01.570> you're<00:02:01.810> done<00:02:02.079> now<00:02:02.560> here

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
once you did that you're done now here

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:03.870 
once you did that you're done now here
comes<00:02:03.009> the<00:02:03.100> moment<00:02:03.460> where<00:02:03.609> it<00:02:03.700> should

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
comes the moment where it should

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.599 
comes the moment where it should
actually<00:02:04.680> demonstrate<00:02:05.680> the<00:02:05.859> sound<00:02:06.070> quality

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:06.609 
actually demonstrate the sound quality

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:08.160 
actually demonstrate the sound quality
of<00:02:06.640> these<00:02:06.880> but<00:02:07.210> as<00:02:07.359> you're<00:02:07.570> watching<00:02:07.840> this

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
of these but as you're watching this

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.719 
of these but as you're watching this
video<00:02:08.440> you<00:02:08.619> can't<00:02:08.800> really<00:02:09.070> hear<00:02:09.340> what<00:02:09.580> you

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
video you can't really hear what you

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.880 
video you can't really hear what you
would<00:02:09.879> hear<00:02:10.119> from<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.509> headphones<00:02:10.989> so<00:02:11.620> the

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
would hear from the headphones so the

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.710 
would hear from the headphones so the
only<00:02:12.069> thing<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:12.519> could<00:02:12.580> show<00:02:12.910> you<00:02:12.970> is<00:02:13.300> my

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
only thing I could show you is my

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.940 
only thing I could show you is my
reaction<00:02:14.050> when<00:02:14.379> I<00:02:14.440> first

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
reaction when I first

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:30.440 
reaction when I first
actually<00:02:15.910> listen<00:02:16.090> to<00:02:16.420> these<00:02:16.540> so<00:02:17.230> here<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:17.620> go

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.970 

my<00:02:31.450> second<00:02:31.840> reaction<00:02:31.959> was<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.590> check<00:02:32.769> my

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
my second reaction was to check my

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.979 
my second reaction was to check my
wallet<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:34.150> realize<00:02:34.569> that<00:02:34.750> I<00:02:34.780> almost

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
wallet and to realize that I almost

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.199 
wallet and to realize that I almost
spent<00:02:35.260> fifty<00:02:35.739> dollars<00:02:36.099> and<00:02:36.370> that<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:37.090> was<00:02:37.180> a

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
spent fifty dollars and that it was a

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.839 
spent fifty dollars and that it was a
badass<00:02:37.769> now<00:02:38.769> let's<00:02:38.920> take<00:02:39.069> a<00:02:39.099> look<00:02:39.220> at<00:02:39.370> what<00:02:39.519> is

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
badass now let's take a look at what is

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.820 
badass now let's take a look at what is
happening<00:02:40.120> in<00:02:40.599> the<00:02:40.690> specifications<00:02:41.440> of<00:02:41.620> these

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
happening in the specifications of these

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.589 
happening in the specifications of these
well<00:02:42.459> that<00:02:42.640> frequency<00:02:43.090> response<00:02:43.390> is<00:02:43.540> very

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
well that frequency response is very

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.020 
well that frequency response is very
wide<00:02:44.019> it's<00:02:44.230> from<00:02:44.440> eight<00:02:44.680> Hertz<00:02:44.890> 25<00:02:45.670> kilohertz

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
wide it's from eight Hertz 25 kilohertz

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.199 
wide it's from eight Hertz 25 kilohertz
the<00:02:46.720> sensitivity<00:02:47.440> is<00:02:47.500> 102<00:02:48.430> decibels<00:02:48.880> which<00:02:49.060> is

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
the sensitivity is 102 decibels which is

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.089 
the sensitivity is 102 decibels which is
not<00:02:49.360> that<00:02:49.660> loud<00:02:49.900> but<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:50.319> feels<00:02:50.590> very<00:02:50.739> very

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
not that loud but it feels very very

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.339 
not that loud but it feels very very
loud<00:02:51.489> in<00:02:51.790> these<00:02:52.000> headphones<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.959> nominal

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
loud in these headphones the nominal

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.920 
loud in these headphones the nominal
impedance<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:53.950> these<00:02:54.160> is<00:02:54.430> 36<00:02:55.060> ohms<00:02:55.329> I'm<00:02:55.810> not

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
impedance of these is 36 ohms I'm not

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.300 
impedance of these is 36 ohms I'm not
really<00:02:56.079> sure<00:02:56.290> what<00:02:56.470> that<00:02:56.500> means<00:02:56.769> if<00:02:57.010> somebody

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
really sure what that means if somebody

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.860 
really sure what that means if somebody
could<00:02:57.459> correct<00:02:57.790> me<00:02:57.970> they'll<00:02:58.150> be<00:02:58.180> nice<00:02:58.480> in

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
could correct me they'll be nice in

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.390 
could correct me they'll be nice in
court<00:02:59.140> length<00:02:59.380> as<00:02:59.650> I<00:02:59.799> already<00:02:59.890> mentioned<00:03:00.040> that

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
court length as I already mentioned that

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.680 
court length as I already mentioned that
it's<00:03:01.079> 3.94<00:03:02.079> feet<00:03:02.709> or<00:03:02.980> 1.2<00:03:03.730> meters<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.299> it<00:03:04.480> was

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
it's 3.94 feet or 1.2 meters and it was

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.710 
it's 3.94 feet or 1.2 meters and it was
just<00:03:05.079> slightly<00:03:05.319> more<00:03:06.190> than<00:03:06.220> an<00:03:06.610> iPhone<00:03:07.000> 4s<00:03:07.269> a

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
just slightly more than an iPhone 4s a

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.690 
just slightly more than an iPhone 4s a
thing<00:03:08.170> I<00:03:08.290> forgot<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.620> mention<00:03:08.829> is<00:03:09.340> that<00:03:09.459> it's

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
thing I forgot to mention is that it's

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.390 
thing I forgot to mention is that it's
very<00:03:10.090> cool<00:03:10.450> to<00:03:10.690> wear<00:03:10.870> these<00:03:11.110> on<00:03:11.920> your<00:03:12.130> neck

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
very cool to wear these on your neck

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.640 
very cool to wear these on your neck
which<00:03:13.299> is<00:03:13.450> you<00:03:13.720> just<00:03:13.930> basically<00:03:14.079> put<00:03:14.530> them

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
which is you just basically put them

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.640 
which is you just basically put them
behind<00:03:14.829> your<00:03:15.040> neck<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:15.549> it's<00:03:16.390> very<00:03:16.660> it

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
behind your neck and it's very it

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.129 
behind your neck and it's very it
doesn't<00:03:18.010> feel<00:03:18.280> like<00:03:18.760> it's<00:03:19.030> serving<00:03:19.540> you<00:03:19.630> it's

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
doesn't feel like it's serving you it's

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.440 
doesn't feel like it's serving you it's
very<00:03:20.410> simple<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.069> the<00:03:21.880> only<00:03:22.030> thing<00:03:22.150> which

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
very simple and the only thing which

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.900 
very simple and the only thing which
could<00:03:22.690> disturb<00:03:23.049> you<00:03:23.260> is<00:03:23.440> that<00:03:23.920> moving<00:03:24.250> ear<00:03:24.670> pad

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
could disturb you is that moving ear pad

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.490 
could disturb you is that moving ear pad
since<00:03:25.209> they're<00:03:25.450> very<00:03:25.720> flexible<00:03:26.350> and

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
since they're very flexible and

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.660 
since they're very flexible and
adjustable<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:29.560> I<00:03:29.590> guess<00:03:29.799> formally<00:03:30.220> fifty

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
adjustable so I guess formally fifty

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.330 
adjustable so I guess formally fifty
dollars<00:03:31.030> on<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:31.959> official<00:03:32.410> store<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:32.950> even

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
dollars on the official store and even

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.819 
dollars on the official store and even
less<00:03:33.579> on<00:03:33.790> Amazon<00:03:34.269> or<00:03:34.299> Ebay<00:03:34.630> or<00:03:34.810> other<00:03:35.230> websites

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
less on Amazon or Ebay or other websites

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.710 
less on Amazon or Ebay or other websites
and<00:03:36.100> then<00:03:36.400> you<00:03:36.519> can't<00:03:36.760> really<00:03:37.030> go<00:03:37.299> wrong<00:03:37.660> with

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
and then you can't really go wrong with

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.809 
and then you can't really go wrong with
these<00:03:38.109> ones<00:03:38.380> these<00:03:38.620> are<00:03:38.680> any<00:03:38.980> good<00:03:39.340> quality

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
these ones these are any good quality

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.509 
these ones these are any good quality
headphones<00:03:40.299> they're<00:03:40.959> very<00:03:41.709> flexible<00:03:42.010> as<00:03:42.430> you

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
headphones they're very flexible as you

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.640 
headphones they're very flexible as you
