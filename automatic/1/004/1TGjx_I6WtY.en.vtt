 miriam and good morning 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:24.890

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.759

 how well do you live your life 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.450
 you know one day I avignon told me 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.280
 It's very beautiful but I leave France and I 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.240
 I'm going to the south of Spain because there 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.020
 live very well 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.270
 live very well and I am closer to 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.350
 my mother drawn and here because the 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:49.190
 I was truly Spanish and it was my dream 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.140
 life and I can say a dress to my 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.910

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:58.329
 and who lives in spain santa de gandia 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.330
 for her it was a dream to also live 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:05.470
 here we are now very happy of course 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:08.830
 because in Spain the warmth and other 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.880
 accompanies truth I like it a lot but what 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.979
 What do you like most about Spain in 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.060
 flamenco of los pajaritos certainly the 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:19.110
 flamenco music has always given me the 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.630
 passion opens with music to the grass on 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.140
 all the music of Spain 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.960
 but now I'm following the course of 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.640
 talent in vélez málaga in the academy 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.640
 of antonio dance that was 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.910
 great that is not your passion 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.270
 says antonio war hears mireia because you 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.990
 it costs so much work the French and 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.990
 pronounce the r 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.960
 perfectly sealed thank you very much 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.110
 but there is no famous but I am 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:06.430
 still making many mistakes the verb 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:09.760
 of all but good 20 attempts and 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.460
 We are the Spaniards and companions are very 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:19.090
 welcoming and very well have a lot 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:22.870
 patience with me but if you understand 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:26.490
 well really fully I have cast me 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.490
 of less a good French 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:37.860
 a French man because the French 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:45.220
 they are very passionate too but also 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:46.450
 from france 9 years old you would do the 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.740
 suitcase and directly to me too 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.860
 husband and I also take it to málaga 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.860
 do not 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.459
 hears mireia and when he gives you a 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.049
 try with the Spanish with that of 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.680
 san roque dog does not have a tail because 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:03.209
 Rodriguez has only cut nobody is not the 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.209
 first sentence there 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.659
 as well 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:30.480
 do not use it much but why 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.019
 we are going to give you the diploma 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.489
 and you're already on the radio the other day 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.190
 because I was trying to locate a 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.870
 true song and a song because every 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.709
 Once I go to flamenco I'm 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.280
 listening to the crying and every time 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:58.890
 starting the song because 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:02.010
 I did not say it last Wednesday at 6 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:06.600
 15 hours close to 6 and listen to that 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.640
 song in particular did not seem like passion 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.660
 vega because she has a very voice 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:16.819
 peculiar but they are figures good that the 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.819
 I was trying to look 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.760
 and you something is dependent 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.080
 radio is listening to the radio do not come 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.220
 so dependent because this is going 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.390
 to sound is a gift that we make 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.390
 education team is for you
