00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
bit glitchy my computer is a bit slow

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.350 
bit glitchy my computer is a bit slow
but<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:51.239> is<00:02:51.420> what<00:02:51.570> it<00:02:51.690> should<00:02:51.720> look<00:02:51.870> like

but this is what it should look like

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.030 
but this is what it should look like
you'll<00:02:54.360> be<00:02:54.390> good<00:02:54.690> still<00:02:55.050> roughly<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.830> same

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
you'll be good still roughly the same

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.970 
you'll be good still roughly the same
frames<00:02:56.519> will<00:02:57.480> be<00:02:57.600> good<00:02:57.750> if<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:57.900> had<00:02:58.019> an<00:02:58.350> equal

frames will be good if you had an equal
amount<00:02:59.160> of<00:02:59.310> frames<00:02:59.519> for<00:02:59.790> each<00:03:00.150> gift<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.750> that

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
amount of frames for each gift and that

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.270 
amount of frames for each gift and that
means<00:03:01.410> as<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.280> can<00:03:02.670> see<00:03:02.819> if<00:03:02.940> I<00:03:03.030> quiet<00:03:04.160> one<00:03:05.160> of
