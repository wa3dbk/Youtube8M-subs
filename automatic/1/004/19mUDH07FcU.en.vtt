 planes we recommend eliminating 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.509

 the color of vital itself in this case 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.320
 almost no defect is noticeable but I would 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.410
 recommended to mix the two closest

 our boards using electric 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.890
 battery-powered we can 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.159

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.539
 light more than 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.980
 excess wax removed to sleep 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.560
 remove excess in this case 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.720
 the surface was matt and that shine 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.550
 after waxing is very easy to remove with 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:18.000

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.610
