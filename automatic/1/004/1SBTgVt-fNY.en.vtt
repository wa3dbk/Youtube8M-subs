but<00:00:58.800> again<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.489> could<00:00:59.609> easily<00:00:59.850> go<00:01:00.180> into<00:01:00.600> so

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
but again you could easily go into so

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.000 
but again you could easily go into so
many<00:01:00.840> other<00:01:01.050> things<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.440> could<00:01:01.620> easily<00:01:01.770> take

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
many other things that could easily take

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.369 
many other things that could easily take
a<00:01:02.070> power<00:01:02.340> whip<00:01:02.570> you<00:01:03.570> know<00:01:03.690> ends<00:01:03.930> up<00:01:04.019> going<00:01:04.140> into

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
a power whip you know ends up going into

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.530 
a power whip you know ends up going into
manectric<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.610> fear<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.090> should<00:01:06.479> be

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
manectric and I fear that I should be

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.719 
manectric and I fear that I should be
able<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.720> take<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:06.990> over<00:01:07.080> eat<00:01:07.380> anyways<00:01:07.770> or

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
able to take it over eat anyways or

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.219 
able to take it over eat anyways or
really<00:01:09.030> whatever<00:01:09.210> movie<00:01:09.630> goes<00:01:09.810> for<00:01:10.049> like<00:01:10.140> a

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
really whatever movie goes for like a

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.510 
really whatever movie goes for like a

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
figure that you know well maybe I could

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.230 
figure that you know well maybe I could
get<00:01:43.890> some<00:01:43.950> damage<00:01:44.369> done<00:01:44.549> against<00:01:44.790> politoed
