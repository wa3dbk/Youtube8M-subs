at<00:03:23.560> its<00:03:23.739> core<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.220> town<00:03:24.430> stadium<00:03:24.790> in<00:03:25.209> hemel

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
at its core the town stadium in hemel

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.020 
at its core the town stadium in hemel
we're<00:03:26.500> one<00:03:26.680> of<00:03:26.739> the<00:03:26.829> leading<00:03:27.069> candidates<00:03:27.730> to
