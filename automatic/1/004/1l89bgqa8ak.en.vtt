00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.529 
okay it's Monday after work dropped in
on<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.980> swim<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.760> picked<00:00:24.150> out<00:00:24.300> the

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
on the swim that I picked out the

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.349 
on the swim that I picked out the
twenties<00:00:25.080> on<00:00:25.260> Friday<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.740> Saturday<00:00:26.359> hoping

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
twenties on Friday and Saturday hoping

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.029 
twenties on Friday and Saturday hoping
that<00:00:27.510> they<00:00:27.689> would<00:00:28.170> have<00:00:28.289> moved<00:00:28.470> back<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.890> on

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
that they would have moved back in on

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.759 
that they would have moved back in on
the<00:00:29.130> bait<00:00:29.279> again<00:00:29.869> when<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:30.900> left<00:00:31.140> on<00:00:31.349> Saturday

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
the bait again when I left on Saturday

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.560 
the bait again when I left on Saturday
you<00:00:32.099> know<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.340> wind<00:00:32.550> had<00:00:32.759> swung<00:00:33.180> around<00:00:33.329> to

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
you know the wind had swung around to

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.090 
you know the wind had swung around to
the<00:00:33.719> other<00:00:33.809> side<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.230> lake<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.710> I'm

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the other side of the lake and I'm

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.560 
the other side of the lake and I'm
pretty<00:00:35.309> convinced<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.910> fish<00:00:36.120> moved<00:00:36.390> away

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
pretty convinced the fish moved away

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.260 
pretty convinced the fish moved away
with<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.050> didn't<00:00:37.590> have<00:00:37.739> anything<00:00:37.950> out

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
with it I didn't have anything out

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.490 
with it I didn't have anything out
neither<00:00:39.270> did<00:00:39.510> anybody<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.050> right<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.410> me

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
neither did anybody to the right of me

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.680 
neither did anybody to the right of me
or<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.800> left<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.100> me<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.670> pretty<00:00:42.329> sure<00:00:42.540> they

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
or to the left of me so pretty sure they

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.970 
or to the left of me so pretty sure they
moved<00:00:42.899> over<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.350> other<00:00:43.469> side

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
moved over to the other side

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.549 
moved over to the other side
since<00:00:44.969> then<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.390> wind<00:00:45.600> has<00:00:45.780> swung<00:00:46.020> back<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.440> my

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
since then the wind has swung back in my

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.670 
since then the wind has swung back in my
favor<00:00:46.800> into<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> swim<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.320> yeah<00:00:49.320> I've<00:00:49.440> come

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879

I did last time and hopefully I can pick
out<00:00:54.059> some<00:00:54.239> fish<00:00:54.420> I've<00:00:54.750> decided<00:00:55.079> not<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.410> go

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
out some fish I've decided not to go

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.840 
out some fish I've decided not to go
with<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.890> snow<00:00:56.129> moon<00:00:56.309> makes<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.610> time

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
with the snow moon makes this time

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.119 
with the snow moon makes this time
mainly<00:00:57.660> out<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:57.930> curiosity<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.620> see<00:00:58.739> if<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.070> do

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
mainly out of curiosity to see if I do

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.830 
mainly out of curiosity to see if I do
pick<00:00:59.430> up<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> smaller<00:00:59.910> fish<00:01:00.210> because<00:01:00.539> I'm

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
pick up the smaller fish because I'm

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.209 
pick up the smaller fish because I'm
pretty<00:01:01.109> convinced<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.770> bigger<00:01:01.949> baits

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
pretty convinced that the bigger baits

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.509 
pretty convinced that the bigger baits
did<00:01:02.550> save<00:01:02.789> me<00:01:03.030> any<00:01:03.619> singles<00:01:04.619> or<00:01:04.799> small<00:01:05.100> doubles

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
did save me any singles or small doubles

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.340 
did save me any singles or small doubles
because<00:01:05.640> too<00:01:06.390> honest<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.840> think<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.049> had<00:01:07.170> about

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
because too honest I think I had about

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.100 
because too honest I think I had about
yeah<00:01:08.310> about<00:01:08.430> 25<00:01:08.880> doubles<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.659> end<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:09.990> that

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
yeah about 25 doubles in the end on that

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.340 
yeah about 25 doubles in the end on that
session<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.619> didn't<00:01:10.830> show<00:01:11.010> them<00:01:11.130> all<00:01:11.340> because

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
session I didn't show them all because

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.420 
session I didn't show them all because
obviously<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.409> don't<00:01:13.500> wanna<00:01:13.680> see<00:01:13.830> loads<00:01:14.220> of

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
obviously you don't wanna see loads of

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.130 
obviously you don't wanna see loads of
fish<00:01:14.549> all<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.850> time<00:01:15.150> because<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.540> makes<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.990> bit

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
fish all the time because it makes a bit

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.590 
fish all the time because it makes a bit
of<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.259> boring<00:01:16.470> episode<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.460> thought<00:01:18.390> well

quite<00:02:15.980> bony<00:02:16.280> mouths<00:02:16.640> in<00:02:16.849> places<00:02:17.360> and

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
quite bony mouths in places and

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.030 
quite bony mouths in places and
sometimes<00:02:18.319> you<00:02:18.440> just<00:02:18.470> don't<00:02:18.709> hook<00:02:18.890> them

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
sometimes you just don't hook them

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.130 
sometimes you just don't hook them
properly<00:02:19.569> which<00:02:20.569> is<00:02:20.599> obviously<00:02:20.989> what

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
properly which is obviously what

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.680

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
something pretty reasonable turn the

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.390 
something pretty reasonable turn the
