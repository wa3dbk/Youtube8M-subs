00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.460
 13 hello welcome to this new one 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.280
 looking for a garden show we are in a place a 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.340
 famous very famous because of mine 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.340
 shoulders there is that ignoble construction 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.910
 edged in white and red than the former 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.060
 Montalto di Castro nuclear power plant 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.340
 always an area that offers fish 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:04.050
 I try to fish straight we must there 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.050
 I can do 90 100 meters 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.760
 we wait here for there is a 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.360
 double 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.940
 long paternoster 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.280
 long enough the low baited hook 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.520
 a little piece of eras nicolas is a man 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.370
 of the eight the superior man always love 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.290
 eight 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.360
 however the roof of American often 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.040
 and we do not know where to go to 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.450
 fishing which are conditions of 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.770
 little wind poor air circulation e 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.980
 then we have to look at the map 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.960
 geographically understand literally from where 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.400
 comes the wind is a function of 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.260
 presence of the chin 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.790
 we can understand if a beach can 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.350
 have a minimum wave or be 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.180
 completely dead 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.550
 go on the internet look at the various 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.130
 webcams that are placed in many 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.850
 bathing establishments and through 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.430
 this web 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.520
 if they work you can understand 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.380
 immediately if there is a minimum wave 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.210
 how is the situation 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.220
 even at certain times if the sea 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.460
 is fishable would have a moment of 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.780
 baits that we use enough sea 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.100
 basically calm then rings 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.140
 some boxes of nico areas have them 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:25.380
 bring 4 for this fishing day and 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.000
 three boxes of american box 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.950
 quite full with a lot of worms 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.640
 big that I brought a bunch of 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.640
 canoe niche 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.930
 on the sunset 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.770
 I don't know what it is 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.090
 here it comes 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.090
 looks like a beautiful ratella 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:58.650
 beautiful the queen of our beaches 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.650
