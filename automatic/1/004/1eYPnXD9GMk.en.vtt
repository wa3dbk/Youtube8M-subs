00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.609 
went right into that and I just erased
part<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:38.479> then<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.780> drew<00:01:40.079> back<00:01:40.320> through

clean<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.390> just<00:02:21.629> press<00:02:22.080> it<00:02:22.670> with<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.909> tissue

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
clean you just press it with a tissue

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.339 
clean you just press it with a tissue
and<00:02:26.610> it's<00:02:26.790> not<00:02:27.000> gonna<00:02:27.180> come<00:02:27.480> sparkly<00:02:28.080> weight

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
and it's not gonna come sparkly weight

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.800 
and it's not gonna come sparkly weight
again<00:02:28.709> but<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:29.610> is<00:02:29.760> going<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.120> clean<00:02:30.450> up<00:02:30.599> at

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
again but it is going to clean up at

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.899 
again but it is going to clean up at
this<00:02:30.989> point<00:02:31.379> it's<00:02:31.680> gotten<00:02:32.069> dirty<00:02:32.250> enough<00:02:32.640> that

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
this point it's gotten dirty enough that

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.600 
this point it's gotten dirty enough that
it<00:02:33.090> is<00:02:33.329> not<00:02:34.200> really<00:02:34.620> wanting<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:34.980> clean<00:02:35.280> all

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
it is not really wanting to clean all

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.649 
it is not really wanting to clean all
the<00:02:35.879> way<00:02:36.030> but<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.319> does<00:02:37.980> clean<00:02:38.340> up<00:02:38.659> relatively

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
the way but it does clean up relatively

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.990 
the way but it does clean up relatively
well<00:02:41.360> so<00:02:42.360> still<00:02:43.290> got<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.560> little<00:02:43.950> bit<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.370> black

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
well so still got a little bit of black

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.449 
well so still got a little bit of black
on<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.360> very<00:02:45.569> tip<00:02:45.930> but<00:02:46.590> otherwise<00:02:46.890> not<00:02:47.190> too

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
on the very tip but otherwise not too

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.479 
on the very tip but otherwise not too
bad<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:49.200> only<00:02:49.349> thing<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.739> didn't<00:02:50.099> like<00:02:50.160> this

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
bad the only thing I didn't like this

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.400 
bad the only thing I didn't like this
and<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:50.790> really<00:02:50.970> only<00:02:51.209> happened<00:02:51.780> once<00:02:52.200> or

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
and it really only happened once or

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.309 
and it really only happened once or
twice<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.700> was<00:02:53.910> when<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.090> first<00:02:54.420> got<00:02:54.660> it<00:02:55.079> I

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
twice and that was when I first got it I

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.339 
twice and that was when I first got it I
had<00:02:55.769> used<00:02:56.069> it<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.519> I<00:02:57.180> was<00:02:57.510> going<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.900> clean<00:02:58.140> it

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.130 
had used it and I was going to clean it
and<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:59.159> sort<00:02:59.670> of<00:02:59.790> instead<00:03:00.150> of<00:03:00.269> just<00:03:00.510> rubbing<00:03:00.959> I

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
and I sort of instead of just rubbing I

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.479 
and I sort of instead of just rubbing I
accidentally<00:03:02.010> pulled<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:03.150> as<00:03:03.299> you<00:03:03.480> can<00:03:03.629> see

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
accidentally pulled and as you can see

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.470 
accidentally pulled and as you can see
the<00:03:05.489> whole<00:03:05.760> thing<00:03:06.590> pulled<00:03:07.590> right<00:03:07.950> out<00:03:08.190> of<00:03:08.549> the

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
the whole thing pulled right out of the

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.670 
the whole thing pulled right out of the
stick<00:03:10.040> so<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:12.840> know<00:03:12.959> obviously<00:03:13.290> you<00:03:13.379> get<00:03:13.560> what

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
stick so you know obviously you get what

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.920 
stick so you know obviously you get what
you<00:03:13.799> pay<00:03:13.950> for<00:03:13.980> itself<00:03:14.519> it's<00:03:14.909> you<00:03:15.269> know<00:03:15.390> I<00:03:15.659> don't

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
you pay for itself it's you know I don't

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.839 
you pay for itself it's you know I don't
know<00:03:16.049> what<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:16.590> was<00:03:16.769> a<00:03:17.010> couple<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.340> bucks<00:03:17.549> at

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
know what it was a couple of bucks at

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.629 
know what it was a couple of bucks at
the<00:03:17.880> most<00:03:18.349> I<00:03:19.349> don't<00:03:19.769> know<00:03:19.950> how<00:03:20.069> long<00:03:20.310> this<00:03:20.579> is

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
the most I don't know how long this is

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.379 
the most I don't know how long this is
going<00:03:21.329> to<00:03:21.540> last<00:03:21.720> I've<00:03:22.200> been<00:03:22.530> using<00:03:22.769> it

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
going to last I've been using it

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.750 
going to last I've been using it
probably<00:03:24.389> about<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.720> month<00:03:25.109> and<00:03:25.560> I've<00:03:26.160> not<00:03:26.489> had

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
probably about a month and I've not had

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.050 
probably about a month and I've not had
any<00:03:26.819> problem<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:27.630> will<00:03:27.690> say<00:03:28.079> at<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.380> beginning

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
any problem I will say at the beginning

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.000 
any problem I will say at the beginning
if<00:03:30.060> I<00:03:30.239> handled<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.870> tip<00:03:31.139> with<00:03:31.379> my<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.889> know

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
if I handled the tip with my you know

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.250 
if I handled the tip with my you know
with<00:03:32.160> my<00:03:32.340> bare<00:03:32.579> skin<00:03:32.609> it<00:03:33.269> did<00:03:33.569> it<00:03:33.750> was<00:03:33.930> very

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
with my bare skin it did it was very

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.650 
with my bare skin it did it was very
oily<00:03:34.590> like<00:03:34.919> makeup<00:03:35.340> remover<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:35.970> now<00:03:36.030> it's

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
oily like makeup remover and now it's

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.780 
oily like makeup remover and now it's
not<00:03:36.840> so<00:03:37.109> much<00:03:37.290> so<00:03:37.590> I'm<00:03:37.709> assuming<00:03:38.010> it's<00:03:38.310> sort<00:03:38.669> of

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
not so much so I'm assuming it's sort of

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.860 
not so much so I'm assuming it's sort of
losing<00:03:39.690> its<00:03:40.700> strength<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:42.000> so<00:03:42.269> I<00:03:42.299> don't<00:03:42.720> know

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
losing its strength and so I don't know

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.830 
losing its strength and so I don't know
you<00:03:43.199> know<00:03:43.290> how<00:03:43.530> I<00:03:43.769> don't<00:03:43.949> know<00:03:44.040> if<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.430> comes

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
you know how I don't know if it comes

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.659 
you know how I don't know if it comes
pre-loaded<00:03:45.840> this<00:03:46.739> thing<00:03:47.010> comes<00:03:47.310> pre-loaded

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
pre-loaded this thing comes pre-loaded

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.670 
pre-loaded this thing comes pre-loaded
with<00:03:48.180> a<00:03:48.239> certain<00:03:48.660> amount<00:03:48.780> of<00:03:48.930> product<00:03:49.470> or

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
with a certain amount of product or

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.559 
with a certain amount of product or
whether<00:03:50.220> there's<00:03:50.519> product<00:03:50.970> down<00:03:51.150> in<00:03:51.329> here

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
whether there's product down in here

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.369 
whether there's product down in here
that<00:03:51.750> it<00:03:51.870> feeds<00:03:52.139> from<00:03:52.849> but<00:03:53.849> either<00:03:54.750> way<00:03:55.109> I'd

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
that it feeds from but either way I'd

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.809 
that it feeds from but either way I'd
say<00:03:55.680> after<00:03:56.099> about<00:03:56.579> a<00:03:56.639> month<00:03:57.209> of<00:03:58.819> relatively

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
say after about a month of relatively

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.589 
say after about a month of relatively
frequent<00:04:00.510> use<00:04:01.220> it's<00:04:02.220> it's<00:04:02.699> still<00:04:03.090> working

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
frequent use it's it's still working

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.140 
frequent use it's it's still working
as<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:04.079> could<00:04:04.260> see<00:04:04.319> it<00:04:04.769> took<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:05.310> took<00:04:05.940> that

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
as you could see it took the took that

as you could see it took the took that
piece<00:04:06.389> out<00:04:06.569> of<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.870> line<00:04:07.079> so<00:04:07.799> let's<00:04:07.980> try<00:04:08.220> it

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
piece out of the line so let's try it

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.610 
piece out of the line so let's try it
with<00:04:08.519> this<00:04:08.669> thicker<00:04:08.970> line<00:04:11.930> yep<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:13.169> you<00:04:13.440> can

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
with this thicker line yep and you can

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.800 
with this thicker line yep and you can
see<00:04:13.859> it<00:04:13.980> took<00:04:14.760> a<00:04:14.790> chunk<00:04:14.910> right<00:04:15.359> out<00:04:15.540> of<00:04:15.569> that

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
see it took a chunk right out of that

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.159 
see it took a chunk right out of that
line<00:04:16.049> so<00:04:16.739> it's<00:04:16.979> great<00:04:17.340> for<00:04:17.370> things<00:04:18.000> where<00:04:18.539> you

a<00:04:37.930> lot<00:04:38.260> and<00:04:38.590> it<00:04:39.340> saved<00:04:39.670> me<00:04:39.910> time<00:04:40.180> when<00:04:40.660> there

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
a lot and it saved me time when there

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.920 
a lot and it saved me time when there
are<00:04:41.230> times<00:04:41.830> when<00:04:42.220> I<00:04:42.250> would<00:04:42.520> have<00:04:42.580> had<00:04:42.820> to<00:04:43.090> take

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
are times when I would have had to take

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.960 
are times when I would have had to take
something<00:04:44.200> off<00:04:44.470> and<00:04:44.650> do<00:04:44.800> it<00:04:44.920> again<00:04:45.160> or<00:04:45.430> spend<00:04:45.880> a

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
something off and do it again or spend a

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.690 
something off and do it again or spend a
lot<00:04:46.210> of<00:04:46.240> time<00:04:46.630> getting<00:04:47.080> it<00:04:47.200> you<00:04:47.530> know<00:04:47.700> changed

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
lot of time getting it you know changed

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.910 
lot of time getting it you know changed
and<00:04:48.880> this<00:04:49.510> has<00:04:49.690> really<00:04:50.140> helped<00:04:50.440> me<00:04:50.620> do<00:04:50.770> it

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
and this has really helped me do it

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.580 
and this has really helped me do it
faster<00:04:51.460> so<00:04:51.670> for<00:04:52.540> that<00:04:52.660> reason<00:04:53.260> I<00:04:53.470> would

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
faster so for that reason I would

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.150 
faster so for that reason I would
probably<00:04:54.580> repurchase<00:04:54.790> it<00:04:55.450> and<00:04:55.810> but<00:04:56.770> we<00:04:56.920> will

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
probably repurchase it and but we will

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.390 
probably repurchase it and but we will
have<00:04:57.910> to<00:04:58.090> see<00:04:58.300> how<00:04:58.480> long<00:04:58.720> it<00:04:58.780> lasts<00:04:59.530> if<00:05:00.160> it

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
have to see how long it lasts if it

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.260 
have to see how long it lasts if it
lasts<00:05:01.000> say<00:05:01.800> three<00:05:02.800> months<00:05:03.220> or<00:05:03.340> so<00:05:03.580> I<00:05:03.820> would<00:05:04.090> say

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
lasts say three months or so I would say

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.480 
lasts say three months or so I would say
I<00:05:04.300> would<00:05:04.510> probably<00:05:04.750> repurchase<00:05:05.620> it<00:05:05.800> if<00:05:06.220> I<00:05:06.310> had

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
I would probably repurchase it if I had

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.940 
I would probably repurchase it if I had
to<00:05:06.520> buy<00:05:06.850> a<00:05:06.880> new<00:05:07.150> one<00:05:07.300> every<00:05:07.480> month<00:05:07.780> no<00:05:08.380> probably

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
to buy a new one every month no probably

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.580 
to buy a new one every month no probably
not<00:05:09.040> but<00:05:09.520> so<00:05:10.060> far<00:05:10.270> so<00:05:10.330> good<00:05:10.600> like<00:05:11.050> I<00:05:11.140> said<00:05:11.350> I<00:05:11.380> can

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
not but so far so good like I said I can

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.700 
not but so far so good like I said I can
see<00:05:11.920> that<00:05:12.820> the<00:05:13.240> that<00:05:13.900> it<00:05:14.050> doesn't<00:05:14.410> have<00:05:14.560> as

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
see that the that it doesn't have as

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.770 
see that the that it doesn't have as
much<00:05:14.980> excess<00:05:15.670> fluid<00:05:16.150> as<00:05:16.270> it<00:05:16.300> did<00:05:16.570> in<00:05:16.690> the

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
much excess fluid as it did in the

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.140 
much excess fluid as it did in the
beginning<00:05:16.920> but<00:05:17.920> there<00:05:18.370> is<00:05:18.490> still<00:05:18.850> enough

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
beginning but there is still enough

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.810 
beginning but there is still enough
there<00:05:19.480> to<00:05:20.050> take<00:05:20.290> care<00:05:20.560> of<00:05:20.590> business<00:05:20.790> so<00:05:21.790> that

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
there to take care of business so that

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.890 
there to take care of business so that
is<00:05:22.270> my<00:05:22.570> review<00:05:23.020> of<00:05:23.200> the<00:05:24.010> elf<00:05:24.190> makeup<00:05:24.900> remover
