00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.550 

enabling<00:06:00.550> new<00:06:00.759> structure<00:06:01.479> just<00:06:01.750> arrived

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
enabling new structure just arrived

enabling new structure just arrived
so<00:06:04.160> that's<00:06:04.400> the<00:06:04.520> other<00:06:04.610> two<00:06:04.790> functions<00:06:05.240> we've

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:05.389 
so that's the other two functions we've

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:06.180 
so that's the other two functions we've
gotten<00:06:05.660> there

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
gotten there

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.590 
gotten there
another<00:06:06.850> great<00:06:07.090> thing<00:06:07.300> while<00:06:07.480> we've

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 
another great thing while we've

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.010 
another great thing while we've
incorporated<00:06:07.900> is<00:06:08.380> sense<00:06:08.680> TV<00:06:09.570> so<00:06:10.570> the

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
incorporated is sense TV so the

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.690 
incorporated is sense TV so the
Powerball<00:06:11.470> and<00:06:11.590> a<00:06:11.650> stop<00:06:11.950> here<00:06:11.980> has<00:06:12.550> an

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:12.700 
Powerball and a stop here has an

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.630 
Powerball and a stop here has an
infrared<00:06:12.910> for<00:06:13.300> bill<00:06:13.540> into<00:06:13.810> it<00:06:13.930> so<00:06:14.830> what<00:06:15.520> we

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:15.640 
infrared for bill into it so what we

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.330 
infrared for bill into it so what we
enables<00:06:16.210> us<00:06:16.300> to<00:06:16.360> do<00:06:16.570> is<00:06:16.870> control<00:06:17.440> our<00:06:17.620> TV<00:06:18.040> other
