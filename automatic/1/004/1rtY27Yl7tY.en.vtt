now<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.759> billed<00:01:48.180> as<00:01:48.299> an<00:01:48.420> easy<00:01:48.750> fit<00:01:49.049> and

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
now this is billed as an easy fit and

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.020 
now this is billed as an easy fit and
easy<00:01:49.740> installation<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:50.520> let's<00:01:50.670> take<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> look

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
easy installation so let's take a look

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.050 
easy installation so let's take a look
at<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.270> how<00:01:51.329> easy<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:52.100> obviously<00:01:53.100> cage
