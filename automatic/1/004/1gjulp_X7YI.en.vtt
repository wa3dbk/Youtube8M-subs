00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
people well we did a little bit of

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.800 
people well we did a little bit of
research<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.340> we're<00:01:11.490> not<00:01:11.640> experts<00:01:12.570> on

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
research on it we're not experts on

research on it we're not experts on
airplanes<00:01:13.470> by<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.680> long<00:01:14.070> stretch<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:15.030> what<00:01:15.240> we

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
airplanes by a long stretch so what we

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.240 
airplanes by a long stretch so what we
did<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:15.930> went<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> internet<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.979> we

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
did is we went to the internet and we

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.910 
did is we went to the internet and we
looked<00:01:17.520> up<00:01:17.670> World<00:01:18.030> War<00:01:18.390> two<00:01:18.720> bombers<00:01:19.320> that's

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
looked up World War two bombers that's

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.950 
looked up World War two bombers that's
what<00:01:20.040> we<00:01:20.130> thought<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.490> was<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.060> we<00:01:21.689> ended<00:01:21.869> up

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
what we thought this was and we ended up

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.420 
what we thought this was and we ended up
thinking<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.470> was<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> North<00:01:23.280> American<00:01:24.350> xB

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
thinking this was a North American xB

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.120 
thinking this was a North American xB
policy<00:01:27.080> twenty-eight<00:01:28.080> drag<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.860> think<00:01:29.070> is

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
policy twenty-eight drag and I think is

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.539 
policy twenty-eight drag and I think is
what<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.369> was<00:01:29.490> called<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.950> that<00:01:31.950> seemed<00:01:32.490> to

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
what it was called and that seemed to

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.550 
what it was called and that seemed to
match<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.939> pretty<00:01:33.119> well<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.840> we<00:01:33.990> put<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.290> up<00:01:34.409> on

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
match it pretty well so we put it up on

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.410 
match it pretty well so we put it up on
on<00:01:35.310> eBay<00:01:35.759> as<00:01:36.020> that<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.710> desk<00:01:37.950> model<00:01:38.420> wasn't

too long when all of a sudden we started

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.219
