Pots<00:03:00.480> but<00:03:00.780> those<00:03:00.930> are<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.140> little<00:03:01.319> bit<00:03:01.560> thick

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
Pots but those are a little bit thick

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.320 
Pots but those are a little bit thick
and<00:03:02.310> almost<00:03:02.880> um<00:03:03.739> they<00:03:04.739> make<00:03:04.980> my<00:03:05.160> eyes<00:03:05.190> look<00:03:05.970> a

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
and almost um they make my eyes look a

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.030 
and almost um they make my eyes look a
little<00:03:06.480> bit<00:03:06.690> crazy<00:03:07.110> but<00:03:07.260> this<00:03:07.410> is<00:03:07.590> perfect

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
little bit crazy but this is perfect

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.070 
little bit crazy but this is perfect
it's<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.340> lot<00:03:08.549> thinner<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:09.209> a<00:03:09.299> formula<00:03:09.810> so<00:03:10.049> I

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
it's a lot thinner of a formula so I

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.300 
it's a lot thinner of a formula so I
feel<00:03:10.470> like<00:03:10.500> it<00:03:10.830> just<00:03:10.860> is<00:03:11.489> a<00:03:12.150> thinner<00:03:13.040> it's<00:03:14.040> not

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
feel like it just is a thinner it's not

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.220 
feel like it just is a thinner it's not
as<00:03:14.459> thick<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:14.850> guess<00:03:15.090> so<00:03:15.420> it's<00:03:15.930> just<00:03:16.080> like<00:03:16.110> a

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
as thick I guess so it's just like a

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.110 
as thick I guess so it's just like a
thin<00:03:16.500> layer<00:03:16.680> you<00:03:16.950> put<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.250> on<00:03:17.340> there<00:03:17.609> conceals

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
thin layer you put it on there conceals

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.030 
thin layer you put it on there conceals
everything<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:18.840> just<00:03:18.870> is<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.500> really<00:03:19.859> great

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
everything and just is a really great
