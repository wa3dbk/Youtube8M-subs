00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.670
 a door 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.540
 but disobeyed the advice and opened the door to 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.620

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.450

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:17.910

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:19.980
 so i see and here the hell are you 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.200
 scared of some homeless person who stood 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.330
 your back could be chuck native like 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.610
 schismatics poor old woman instead 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.530
 to build a cowardly bitch 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.580
 but what I liked most was how 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:35.550
 they were killing the shaft to him let's climb 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:41.040

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:43.620
 I let the dogs down 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.990
 I was most embarrassed by the absolute 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.690
 his friend's calm why they asked 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:52.440
 what does the word dawn mean answer seems to me 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:56.480
 There is only one guy a 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:02.850

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:07.010
 overdoing and the door she opened 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:09.940
 open door opened 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:14.530

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.530
 [music] 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.949
 unfortunately he was not shot and I 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.229
 hoping that my video will end 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:34.599
 schoolboy death well in the sense of the game 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.370
 Of course, where else is this video 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:38.320
 caught my attention because in his 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.289
 Kapslok name was written 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.960
 I am the matrix now you probably wonder 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:46.479
 What is the question of what is the matrix ? 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.729
 and I donâ€™t just want a market 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.669
 somewhat hereditary yacocca shy 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:54.099
 the arm falls and this is all the video 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:56.410
 dedicated to one sentence and one 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:58.479
 moment you didn't even see someone 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.300
 shot at you but dodged like 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:03.220
 matrix montell like king know in such 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.800
 moments I don't want to think about anything 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.480

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:12.900
