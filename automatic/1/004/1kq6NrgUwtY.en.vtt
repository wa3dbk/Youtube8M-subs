real world class training that you'd be

real world class training that you'd be

the country the training was realistic

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.299 
the country the training was realistic
enough<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.170> firefighters<00:00:55.920> were<00:00:56.039> dealing

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
enough that firefighters were dealing

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.770 
enough that firefighters were dealing
with<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> same<00:00:56.670> kind<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:57.030> circumstances<00:00:57.660> they

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
with the same kind of circumstances they

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.240 
with the same kind of circumstances they
would<00:00:57.899> find<00:00:58.109> themselves<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.800> real-world

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
would find themselves in in real-world

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.130 
would find themselves in in real-world
scenarios<00:00:59.910> such<00:01:00.180> as<00:01:00.239> heat<00:01:00.570> exhaustion<00:01:00.870> and

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
scenarios such as heat exhaustion and

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.750 
scenarios such as heat exhaustion and
fatigue<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.800> try<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.160> imagine<00:01:02.370> what<00:01:02.640> it'd<00:01:02.730> be

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
fatigue I try to imagine what it'd be

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.579 
fatigue I try to imagine what it'd be
like<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.969> be<00:01:03.120> tied<00:01:03.329> up<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.840> heavy<00:01:04.320> hot

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
like to be tied up in that heavy hot

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.929 
like to be tied up in that heavy hot
suit<00:01:04.920> but<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.129> big<00:01:05.280> tank<00:01:05.519> on<00:01:05.670> your<00:01:05.700> back

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
suit but the big tank on your back

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:06.980 
suit but the big tank on your back
you're<00:01:06.150> having<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.420> wiggle<00:01:06.689> through<00:01:06.840> this

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
you're having to wiggle through this

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.410 
you're having to wiggle through this
thing<00:01:07.280> you<00:01:08.280> got<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> little<00:01:08.610> hypothermia<00:01:09.150> maybe

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
thing you got a little hypothermia maybe

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.359 
thing you got a little hypothermia maybe
your<00:01:10.140> thinking<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.799> becoming<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.220> little

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
your thinking is becoming a little

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.859 
your thinking is becoming a little
clouded<00:01:11.640> your<00:01:11.909> mask<00:01:12.060> has<00:01:12.270> been<00:01:12.299> blocked<00:01:12.689> off

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
clouded your mask has been blocked off

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.300 
clouded your mask has been blocked off
so<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.200> have<00:01:13.320> no<00:01:13.470> idea<00:01:13.740> where<00:01:13.890> you're<00:01:14.010> going

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
so you have no idea where you're going

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.280 
so you have no idea where you're going
and<00:01:14.520> yet<00:01:15.210> somehow<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.659> have<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.900> make<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.200> out

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
and yet somehow you have to make it out

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.990 
and yet somehow you have to make it out
to<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.470> other<00:01:16.619> side<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.890> think<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.490> goal<00:01:17.729> here

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
to the other side I think the goal here

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.240 
to the other side I think the goal here
is<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:18.960> them<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.470> well-trained<00:01:20.040> that

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
is to have them so well-trained that

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.230 
is to have them so well-trained that
even<00:01:20.490> if<00:01:20.580> they<00:01:20.700> get<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.850> little<00:01:21.060> light-headed

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
even if they get a little light-headed

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.330 
even if they get a little light-headed
in<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.630> fire<00:01:21.869> they<00:01:22.470> just<00:01:22.680> automatically

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
in a fire they just automatically

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.700 
in a fire they just automatically
instinctively<00:01:24.119> know<00:01:24.390> what<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.750> do<00:01:24.900> well<00:01:25.320> what

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
instinctively know what to do well what

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.280 
instinctively know what to do well what
do<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.860> think<00:01:26.960> hi

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.290 

the<00:01:31.070> bicycle<00:01:31.490> was<00:01:31.580> named<00:01:31.790> after<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.180> late

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300
