00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:02.419 
ok today we're going to talk about

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:05.510 
ok today we're going to talk about
posture<00:00:03.419> and<00:00:03.600> Heath<00:00:03.840> in<00:00:04.110> corrected<00:00:04.650> and<00:00:04.859> it's

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
posture and Heath in corrected and it's

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.720 
posture and Heath in corrected and it's
actually<00:00:06.140> very<00:00:07.140> simple<00:00:07.620> in<00:00:08.069> many<00:00:08.309> ways<00:00:08.519> they

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
actually very simple in many ways they

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.009 
actually very simple in many ways they
really<00:00:09.059> don't<00:00:09.179> have<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.540> do<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:09.690> lot<00:00:09.990> of

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
really don't have to do a lot of

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.620 
really don't have to do a lot of
exercises<00:00:10.860> just<00:00:11.550> have<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.940> determine<00:00:12.269> which

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
exercises just have to determine which

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.169 
exercises just have to determine which
are<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.840> most<00:00:13.200> important<00:00:13.860> ones<00:00:13.950> or<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.910> key

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
are the most important ones or the key

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.510 
are the most important ones or the key
factors<00:00:16.109> or<00:00:16.320> exercise<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.160> are<00:00:17.310> going<00:00:17.460> to

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
factors or exercise that are going to

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.060 
factors or exercise that are going to
make<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.699> big<00:00:18.029> difference<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.590> well

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
make a big difference to you well

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.630 
make a big difference to you well
however<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.550> core<00:00:21.170> weaknesses<00:00:22.640> tight

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
however the core weaknesses tight

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.460 
however the core weaknesses tight
muscles<00:00:24.119> would<00:00:24.330> need<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.810> be<00:00:24.930> stretched<00:00:25.199> and

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
muscles would need to be stretched and

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.529 
muscles would need to be stretched and
loosen<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.670> weak<00:00:26.849> legs<00:00:27.090> need<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.359> be

loosen and the weak legs need to be

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.839 
loosen and the weak legs need to be
strengthened<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.920> only<00:00:29.220> way<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.699> can

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
strengthened the only way that you can

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.150 
strengthened the only way that you can
have<00:00:30.570> an<00:00:30.689> effective<00:00:31.199> change<00:00:31.529> on<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.890> posture

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
have an effective change on the posture

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.979 
have an effective change on the posture
with<00:00:32.579> time<00:00:32.880> because<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.480> was<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.600> time<00:00:33.960> that

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
with time because it was a time that

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.020 
with time because it was a time that
created<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.980> poor<00:00:35.160> posture<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.700> first

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
created the poor posture in the first

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.780 
created the poor posture in the first
place<00:00:36.300> wasn't<00:00:37.020> like<00:00:37.260> one<00:00:37.530> exercising<00:00:38.309> or<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
place wasn't like one exercising or the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.360 
place wasn't like one exercising or the
one<00:00:39.030> he<00:00:39.719> slid<00:00:39.960> over<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.530> suddenly<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.190> felt

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
one he slid over and suddenly I felt

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.340 
one he slid over and suddenly I felt
full<00:00:41.610> upon<00:00:41.820> job<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.719> was<00:00:42.870> something<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.200> was

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
full upon job it was something that was

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.139 
full upon job it was something that was
creeping<00:00:43.649> up<00:00:43.860> on<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.190> for<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.399> long<00:00:44.550> time<00:00:44.610> from

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
creeping up on you for a long time from

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.940 
creeping up on you for a long time from
repetitive<00:00:45.510> movements<00:00:46.200> they've<00:00:46.379> been<00:00:46.649> doing

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
repetitive movements they've been doing

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.970 
repetitive movements they've been doing
or<00:00:47.129> or<00:00:47.640> activities<00:00:48.329> or<00:00:48.360> actions<00:00:48.770> or<00:00:49.770> even

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
or or activities or actions or even

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.619 
or or activities or actions or even
things<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.399> would<00:00:50.640> weren't<00:00:51.030> doing<00:00:51.449> that

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
things that you would weren't doing that

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.860 
things that you would weren't doing that
probably<00:00:52.289> caused<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:52.969> so<00:00:53.969> if<00:00:54.239> that's<00:00:54.510> true

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
probably caused it so so if that's true

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.010 
probably caused it so so if that's true
that<00:00:54.899> time<00:00:55.800> creates<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.640> it's<00:00:56.820> also<00:00:56.969> too<00:00:57.329> true

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
that time creates it it's also too true

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.299 
that time creates it it's also too true
that<00:00:58.230> time<00:00:59.930> corrects<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.109> right<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.129> way

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
that time corrects it right so the way

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.100 
that time corrects it right so the way
that<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:03.239> need<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.570> do<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.899> is

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
that you you need to do this is

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.010 
that you you need to do this is
determine<00:01:04.619> UK<00:01:04.920> exercise<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.760> then<00:01:06.510> do<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.780> for

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
determine UK exercise and then do it for

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.719 
determine UK exercise and then do it for
a<00:01:07.049> certain<00:01:07.350> amount<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.799> time<00:01:08.010> then<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.340> magic

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
a certain amount of time then the magic

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.420 
a certain amount of time then the magic
number<00:01:09.150> these<00:01:09.900> three<00:01:10.260> minutes<00:01:10.590> now<00:01:11.220> that's

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
number these three minutes now that's

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.640 
number these three minutes now that's
three<00:01:11.610> minutes<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.180> time<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.990> attention<00:01:13.530> if

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
three minutes of time of attention if

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.320 
three minutes of time of attention if
you're<00:01:13.770> trying<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.040> strengthen<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.610> if<00:01:15.090> it's

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
you're trying to strengthen it if it's

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.850 
you're trying to strengthen it if it's
stretching<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.930> doesn't<00:01:16.259> necessarily<00:01:16.830> need

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
stretching it doesn't necessarily need

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.350 
stretching it doesn't necessarily need
to<00:01:17.009> be<00:01:17.130> three<00:01:17.460> minutes<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.880> just<00:01:17.909> needs<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.240> be

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
to be three minutes it just needs to be

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.480 
to be three minutes it just needs to be
done<00:01:18.540> at<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.750> right<00:01:18.780> time<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.470> day<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.979> in

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.990 
this video today I'm just going to show
you<00:01:28.110> two<00:01:28.290> things<00:01:28.320> once<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.979> stretch<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.790> what's

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
you two things once a stretch and what's

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.359 
you two things once a stretch and what's
a<00:01:30.090> strengthen<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:31.530> if<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.890> were<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.100> do<00:01:32.220> this

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
a strengthen and if you were to do this

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.160 
a strengthen and if you were to do this
throughout<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.790> day<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.689> did<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.079> at

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
throughout the day and you did it for at

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.539 
throughout the day and you did it for at
least<00:01:34.229> three<00:01:34.619> minutes<00:01:34.740> it's<00:01:35.040> strengthening

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
least three minutes it's strengthening

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.749 
least three minutes it's strengthening
you<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.020> did<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.259> everyday<00:01:37.560> over<00:01:38.280> period

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
you and you did it everyday over period

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.370 
you and you did it everyday over period
timing<00:01:39.090> been<00:01:39.270> dramatically<00:01:39.840> changing<00:01:40.229> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
timing been dramatically changing the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.200 
timing been dramatically changing the
coaster<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.729> going<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.970> come<00:01:42.090> you

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.840 
coaster so this is going to come you
know<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.600> show<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.840> if<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.140> do<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.670> so<00:01:44.670> this

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
know in a show you if you do it so this

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.460 
know in a show you if you do it so this
is

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
is

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.640 
is
call<00:01:45.980> the<00:01:46.100> cobra<00:01:46.460> and<00:01:46.960> this<00:01:47.960> is<00:01:48.140> an<00:01:48.260> exercice

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
call the cobra and this is an exercice

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.580 
call the cobra and this is an exercice
that's<00:01:49.010> trying<00:01:49.400> to<00:01:49.720> provide<00:01:50.720> strengthen<00:01:51.410> that

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
that's trying to provide strengthen that

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.460 
that's trying to provide strengthen that
back<00:01:52.460> extensors<00:01:53.180> to<00:01:53.630> provide<00:01:54.020> her<00:01:54.230> in<00:01:54.380> a

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
back extensors to provide her in a

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.890 
back extensors to provide her in a
thoracic<00:01:55.430> extension<00:01:55.580> where<00:01:56.330> she<00:01:56.540> can<00:01:56.720> hold

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
thoracic extension where she can hold

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.130 
thoracic extension where she can hold
her<00:01:57.080> posture<00:01:57.650> up<00:01:57.800> nice<00:01:58.640> and<00:01:58.670> tall<00:01:59.090> as<00:01:59.690> opposed

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
her posture up nice and tall as opposed

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.240 
her posture up nice and tall as opposed
to<00:02:00.290> be<00:02:00.580> wiping<00:02:01.600> faces<00:02:02.600> top<00:02:02.900> pusher<00:02:03.140> like<00:02:04.010> that

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
to be wiping faces top pusher like that

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.370 
to be wiping faces top pusher like that
so<00:02:05.120> these<00:02:05.270> muscles<00:02:05.570> become<00:02:06.020> stretched

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
so these muscles become stretched

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.130 
so these muscles become stretched
meaning<00:02:07.160> they<00:02:07.280> become<00:02:07.340> long<00:02:07.850> and<00:02:08.030> weak<00:02:08.210> from

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
meaning they become long and weak from

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.560 
meaning they become long and weak from
the<00:02:09.380> repetitiveness<00:02:10.100> of<00:02:10.520> doing<00:02:10.970> it<00:02:11.090> all<00:02:11.360> the

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
the repetitiveness of doing it all the

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.600 
the repetitiveness of doing it all the
time<00:02:11.840> so<00:02:12.200> we<00:02:12.830> want<00:02:13.070> to<00:02:13.130> have<00:02:13.220> something<00:02:13.490> that

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
time so we want to have something that

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.630 
time so we want to have something that
reverses<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:14.990> has<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.530> repetitiveness<00:02:16.280> of

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
reverses it and has a repetitiveness of

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.420 
reverses it and has a repetitiveness of
holding<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.210> upright<00:02:17.480> all<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.530> time<00:02:18.800> without

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
holding it upright all the time without

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.160 
holding it upright all the time without
even<00:02:19.820> having<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.209> think<00:02:20.480> about<00:02:20.600> it<00:02:20.810> and

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
even having to think about it and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.590 
even having to think about it and
consciously<00:02:22.010> do<00:02:22.280> it<00:02:22.400> just<00:02:22.940> automatically

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
consciously do it just automatically

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.590 
consciously do it just automatically
that's<00:02:23.810> what<00:02:24.050> it<00:02:24.140> does<00:02:24.290> cuz<00:02:24.590> post<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:26.150> gravity

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
that's what it does cuz post the gravity

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.070 
that's what it does cuz post the gravity
of<00:02:26.630> just<00:02:27.440> earth<00:02:27.980> is<00:02:28.910> sort<00:02:29.180> of<00:02:29.209> pretty<00:02:29.420> EDMC

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
of just earth is sort of pretty EDMC

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.020 
of just earth is sort of pretty EDMC
sort<00:02:30.380> of<00:02:30.440> constantly<00:02:31.130> providing<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:31.760> even

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
sort of constantly providing and even

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.120 
sort of constantly providing and even
though<00:02:32.120> you<00:02:32.180> don't<00:02:32.360> see<00:02:33.020> it<00:02:33.140> all<00:02:33.380> right<00:02:33.950> so

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
though you don't see it all right so

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.160 
though you don't see it all right so
these<00:02:34.250> muscles<00:02:34.670> are<00:02:35.180> really<00:02:35.360> already<00:02:35.750> in<00:02:36.080> a

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
these muscles are really already in a

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.310 
these muscles are really already in a
position<00:02:36.440> of<00:02:36.850> like<00:02:37.850> weakness<00:02:38.120> all<00:02:38.870> right<00:02:39.020> so

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
position of like weakness all right so

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.750 
position of like weakness all right so
the<00:02:39.500> way<00:02:39.650> we<00:02:40.040> do<00:02:40.190> it<00:02:40.340> unless<00:02:41.209> it<00:02:41.450> comes<00:02:41.570> up

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
the way we do it unless it comes up

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.100 
the way we do it unless it comes up
extends<00:02:43.760> their<00:02:43.880> chest<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.630> make<00:02:44.780> sure<00:02:44.990> it

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
extends their chest to make sure it

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.110 
extends their chest to make sure it
keeps<00:02:45.260> their<00:02:45.530> head<00:02:45.709> sort<00:02:46.010> of<00:02:46.130> either<00:02:46.670> more<00:02:47.030> of

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
keeps their head sort of either more of

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.690 
keeps their head sort of either more of
a<00:02:47.240> neutral<00:02:47.690> position<00:02:47.780> as<00:02:48.560> such<00:02:48.890> very

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
a neutral position as such very

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.970 
a neutral position as such very
important<00:02:50.209> to<00:02:50.300> keep<00:02:50.480> her<00:02:50.510> hands<00:02:51.260> sort<00:02:51.739> of<00:02:51.830> out

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
important to keep her hands sort of out

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.759 
important to keep her hands sort of out
there<00:02:52.010> that's<00:02:52.880> a<00:02:53.030> good<00:02:53.180> extension<00:02:53.600> and<00:02:53.989> the

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
there that's a good extension and the

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.290 
there that's a good extension and the
way<00:02:54.920> we<00:02:55.100> would<00:02:55.220> get<00:02:55.370> there<00:02:55.580> to<00:02:55.670> do<00:02:55.820> this<00:02:55.970> is<00:02:56.180> you

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
way we would get there to do this is you

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.240 
way we would get there to do this is you
would<00:02:56.450> hold<00:02:56.660> that<00:02:56.780> for<00:02:57.110> say<00:02:57.260> 10<00:02:57.590> seconds<00:02:58.040> you

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
would hold that for say 10 seconds you

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.400 
would hold that for say 10 seconds you
can<00:02:58.400> do<00:02:58.489> it<00:02:58.580> longer<00:02:58.910> if<00:02:59.000> you<00:02:59.030> want<00:02:59.150> to<00:02:59.480> so<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:00.260> be

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
can do it longer if you want to so to be

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.870 
can do it longer if you want to so to be
there<00:03:00.590> 10<00:03:00.769> seconds<00:03:01.190> so<00:03:01.370> she'll<00:03:01.550> come<00:03:01.700> back

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
there 10 seconds so she'll come back

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.440 
there 10 seconds so she'll come back
down<00:03:02.350> take<00:03:03.350> a<00:03:03.410> couple<00:03:03.709> of<00:03:03.890> easy<00:03:04.040> breaths<00:03:04.450> come

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
down take a couple of easy breaths come

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.900 
down take a couple of easy breaths come
back<00:03:05.630> up<00:03:05.780> do<00:03:05.930> it<00:03:06.050> again<00:03:06.370> right<00:03:07.370> now<00:03:07.610> we<00:03:07.760> would

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
back up do it again right now we would

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.930 
back up do it again right now we would
do<00:03:08.030> this<00:03:08.180> six<00:03:08.570> times<00:03:09.010> so<00:03:10.010> six<00:03:10.310> times<00:03:10.550> ten

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
do this six times so six times ten

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.750 
do this six times so six times ten
seconds<00:03:11.450> equals<00:03:11.780> one<00:03:12.200> minute<00:03:12.550> enough<00:03:13.550> for

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
seconds equals one minute enough for

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.130 
seconds equals one minute enough for
that<00:03:13.850> one<00:03:14.060> minute

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
that one minute

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.200 
that one minute
do<00:03:15.470> a<00:03:15.500> stretch<00:03:15.860> so<00:03:16.670> she's<00:03:16.820> going<00:03:16.940> to<00:03:17.000> come<00:03:17.060> up

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
do a stretch so she's going to come up

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.500 
do a stretch so she's going to come up
into<00:03:17.510> a<00:03:17.630> lunging<00:03:17.900> stretch<00:03:18.590> for<00:03:18.920> so<00:03:19.510> kneeling

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
into a lunging stretch for so kneeling

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:27.060 
into a lunging stretch for so kneeling
on<00:03:21.170> our<00:03:21.350> hands<00:03:21.560> and<00:03:22.930> linking<00:03:23.930> flexor<00:03:24.290> stretch

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.550 

so<00:03:28.070> now<00:03:28.220> she's<00:03:28.430> going<00:03:28.550> to<00:03:28.670> do<00:03:28.790> a<00:03:28.820> stretch<00:03:29.560> where

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
so now she's going to do a stretch where

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.220 
so now she's going to do a stretch where
we're<00:03:31.010> trying<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.460> stretch<00:03:31.760> through<00:03:31.970> here

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
we're trying to stretch through here

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.590 
we're trying to stretch through here
she's<00:03:33.230> gonna<00:03:33.380> tuck<00:03:33.650> her<00:03:33.800> pelvis<00:03:34.160> under<00:03:34.600> she's

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
she's gonna tuck her pelvis under she's

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.180 
she's gonna tuck her pelvis under she's
gonna<00:03:35.690> get<00:03:36.080> a<00:03:36.140> belly<00:03:36.440> button<00:03:36.680> to<00:03:36.890> hold<00:03:37.070> that

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
gonna get a belly button to hold that

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.430 
gonna get a belly button to hold that
pelvis<00:03:37.580> in<00:03:37.730> place<00:03:37.940> just<00:03:38.930> gonna<00:03:39.110> bring<00:03:39.320> her

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900

away<00:04:03.080> go<00:04:03.260> back<00:04:03.440> to<00:04:03.590> the<00:04:03.680> Cobra<00:04:04.040> six<00:04:04.489> lots<00:04:04.700> of<00:04:04.820> 10

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
away go back to the Cobra six lots of 10

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.270 
away go back to the Cobra six lots of 10
seconds<00:04:05.480> again<00:04:05.750> that<00:04:06.680> would<00:04:06.800> give<00:04:06.920> us<00:04:07.040> two

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
seconds again that would give us two

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.640 
seconds again that would give us two
minutes<00:04:07.610> of<00:04:07.730> the<00:04:07.790> copper<00:04:08.000> we<00:04:08.900> say<00:04:09.140> a<00:04:09.170> minute<00:04:09.530> of

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
minutes of the copper we say a minute of

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.920 
minutes of the copper we say a minute of
the<00:04:09.770> stretch<00:04:10.040> and<00:04:10.730> then<00:04:11.270> we'd<00:04:11.390> only<00:04:11.540> have<00:04:11.750> one

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
the stretch and then we'd only have one

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.650 
the stretch and then we'd only have one
more<00:04:12.080> time<00:04:12.290> to<00:04:12.440> go<00:04:12.560> around<00:04:12.650> now<00:04:13.360> once<00:04:14.360> we<00:04:14.510> did

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
more time to go around now once we did

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.509 
more time to go around now once we did
that<00:04:14.840> three<00:04:15.080> minute<00:04:15.380> she's<00:04:16.070> going<00:04:16.220> to<00:04:16.310> start

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
that three minute she's going to start

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.880 
that three minute she's going to start
to<00:04:16.640> make<00:04:16.760> postural<00:04:17.239> changes<00:04:17.690> all<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.650> things

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
to make postural changes all the things

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.009 
to make postural changes all the things
now<00:04:19.100> is<00:04:19.459> repetitiveness<00:04:20.060> I'm<00:04:20.390> doing<00:04:20.660> it<00:04:20.750> every

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
now is repetitiveness I'm doing it every

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:21.540 
now is repetitiveness I'm doing it every
day

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:21.550 
day

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.010 
day
for<00:04:22.550> it<00:04:22.610> to<00:04:22.700> start<00:04:22.940> to<00:04:23.030> kick<00:04:23.479> in<00:04:23.630> it<00:04:23.780> to<00:04:23.840> take

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
for it to start to kick in it to take

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.560 
for it to start to kick in it to take
place<00:04:24.200> permanently<00:04:24.790> with<00:04:25.790> never<00:04:26.000> even<00:04:26.360> being

place permanently with never even being

aware<00:04:26.870> that<00:04:26.930> it's<00:04:27.229> changing<00:04:27.650> so<00:04:28.250> she's

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
aware that it's changing so she's

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.770 
aware that it's changing so she's
someone<00:04:28.880> that<00:04:29.000> holds<00:04:29.270> a<00:04:29.300> lot<00:04:29.330> of<00:04:29.510> neck<00:04:29.750> pain

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
someone that holds a lot of neck pain

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.740 
someone that holds a lot of neck pain
and<00:04:30.050> shoulder<00:04:30.260> pain<00:04:30.970> most<00:04:31.970> likely<00:04:32.240> we'll<00:04:32.450> find

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
and shoulder pain most likely we'll find

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.860 
and shoulder pain most likely we'll find
that<00:04:32.960> that<00:04:33.530> will<00:04:33.710> start<00:04:33.950> to<00:04:34.040> disappear<00:04:34.780> for<00:04:35.780> no

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
that that will start to disappear for no

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.690 
that that will start to disappear for no
reason<00:04:36.229> at<00:04:36.350> all<00:04:36.440> while<00:04:37.040> there<00:04:37.190> is<00:04:37.310> a<00:04:37.340> reason

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
reason at all while there is a reason

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.040 
reason at all while there is a reason
that<00:04:37.729> the<00:04:37.970> reason<00:04:38.210> is<00:04:38.330> that<00:04:38.360> she's<00:04:38.690> working

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
that the reason is that she's working

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.040 
that the reason is that she's working
through<00:04:39.200> here<00:04:39.880> and<00:04:40.880> this<00:04:41.180> is<00:04:41.360> this<00:04:41.660> is<00:04:41.720> how<00:04:41.990> you

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
through here and this is this is how you

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.700 
through here and this is this is how you
can<00:04:42.260> really<00:04:42.470> dramatically<00:04:42.979> change<00:04:43.340> injuries

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
can really dramatically change injuries

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.900 
can really dramatically change injuries
because<00:04:45.710> most<00:04:45.919> injuries<00:04:46.280> just<00:04:46.520> happen

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
because most injuries just happen

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.330 
because most injuries just happen
because<00:04:46.970> of<00:04:47.120> postural<00:04:47.540> problems<00:04:47.660> so

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
because of postural problems so

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
because of postural problems so
performance<00:04:49.340> on<00:04:49.520> through<00:04:49.760> she's<00:04:50.090> rather

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
performance on through she's rather

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.400 
performance on through she's rather
she'll<00:04:50.630> be<00:04:50.720> a<00:04:50.750> better

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
she'll be a better

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.050 
she'll be a better
if<00:04:51.830> she's<00:04:52.070> just<00:04:52.100> doing<00:04:52.610> strength<00:04:53.000> training

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
if she's just doing strength training

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.700 
if she's just doing strength training
she<00:04:53.630> will<00:04:53.870> find<00:04:54.080> that<00:04:54.170> you<00:04:54.290> can<00:04:54.410> lift<00:04:54.530> more

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
she will find that you can lift more

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.340 
she will find that you can lift more
weights<00:04:54.950> of<00:04:55.130> up<00:04:55.250> ahead<00:04:55.580> or<00:04:55.730> over<00:04:56.600> just<00:04:56.840> lifting

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
weights of up ahead or over just lifting

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.690 
weights of up ahead or over just lifting
this<00:04:57.440> more<00:04:57.680> in<00:04:57.800> general<00:04:58.100> she's<00:04:58.340> in<00:04:58.460> a<00:04:58.520> better

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
this more in general she's in a better

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.000 
this more in general she's in a better
position<00:04:58.820> to<00:04:59.180> start<00:04:59.420> so<00:05:00.110> basically<00:05:00.890> just

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
position to start so basically just

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.920 
position to start so basically just
everything<00:05:01.640> proves<00:05:01.970> like<00:05:02.240> a<00:05:02.270> bottle<00:05:02.660> chart

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
everything proves like a bottle chart

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.410 
everything proves like a bottle chart
just<00:05:03.590> from<00:05:03.740> doing<00:05:04.010> two<00:05:04.730> simple<00:05:05.150> things<00:05:05.180> like

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
just from doing two simple things like

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.750 
just from doing two simple things like
that<00:05:05.530> right<00:05:06.530> so<00:05:06.800> hopefully<00:05:07.160> it<00:05:07.430> will<00:05:07.490> provide

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
that right so hopefully it will provide

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.730 
that right so hopefully it will provide
you<00:05:07.880> with<00:05:07.910> some<00:05:08.150> great<00:05:08.270> answers<00:05:08.510> if<00:05:09.350> you<00:05:09.560> want
