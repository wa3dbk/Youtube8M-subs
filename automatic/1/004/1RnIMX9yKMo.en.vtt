00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.800 
prefer I think the animation series
Prince<00:03:37.459> Philip<00:03:37.760> we<00:03:37.849> got<00:03:38.030> that<00:03:38.239> had<00:03:38.389> the<00:03:38.540> flared

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
Prince Philip we got that had the flared

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.110 
Prince Philip we got that had the flared
collar<00:03:39.109> around<00:03:39.440> his<00:03:39.560> head<00:03:39.739> but<00:03:40.519> you<00:03:40.849> know<00:03:40.940> this

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
collar around his head but you know this

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.599 
collar around his head but you know this
works<00:03:41.329> better<00:03:41.599> I<00:03:41.959> think<00:03:42.650> for<00:03:43.129> this<00:03:43.250> series

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
works better I think for this series

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.580 
works better I think for this series
since<00:03:43.819> it<00:03:43.970> looks<00:03:44.120> like<00:03:44.299> what<00:03:44.480> we<00:03:44.569> saw<00:03:44.780> in<00:03:45.349> the

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.770 
since it looks like what we saw in the
film<00:03:45.739> that<00:03:46.519> one<00:03:46.669> also<00:03:46.879> had<00:03:47.030> a<00:03:47.060> cape<00:03:47.329> which<00:03:47.540> this

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
violin for me this is one of the

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.880 
violin for me this is one of the
standouts<00:04:26.220> in<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:26.520> series<00:04:27.440> alright<00:04:28.440> and<00:04:28.650> we

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
they're cute as well I think probably

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.000 
they're cute as well I think probably
the<00:04:36.540> best<00:04:36.750> one<00:04:37.020> of<00:04:37.140> these<00:04:37.260> is<00:04:37.470> going<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:37.740> be

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
the best one of these is going to be

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.280 
the best one of these is going to be
Merryweather<00:04:38.790> flora<00:04:39.210> and<00:04:39.360> fauna<00:04:39.540> look<00:04:39.840> you

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
Merryweather flora and fauna look you

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.100

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.560 
know pretty cute as well but you know I
think<00:04:43.470> that<00:04:43.830> Merryweather<00:04:44.580> probably<00:04:45.210> has<00:04:45.360> the

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
think that Merryweather probably has the

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.310 
think that Merryweather probably has the
best<00:04:46.220> overall<00:04:47.220> look<00:04:47.720> look<00:04:48.720> at<00:04:48.810> the<00:04:48.870> back<00:04:49.050> side

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
best overall look look at the back side

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.260 
best overall look look at the back side
therefore<00:04:50.280> you<00:04:50.400> can<00:04:50.520> see<00:04:50.640> their<00:04:50.790> little<00:04:50.940> wings

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
therefore you can see their little wings

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.410 
therefore you can see their little wings
and<00:04:51.780> I<00:04:52.080> really<00:04:52.290> like<00:04:52.440> what<00:04:52.560> they<00:04:52.680> did<00:04:52.860> with<00:04:53.040> the

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
and I really like what they did with the

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.390 
and I really like what they did with the
with<00:04:54.420> the<00:04:54.510> ears<00:04:54.750> just<00:04:55.140> giving<00:04:55.920> up<00:04:56.010> a<00:04:56.130> few

with the ears just giving up a few

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.590 
with the ears just giving up a few
sparkles<00:04:56.940> just<00:04:57.030> to<00:04:57.210> make<00:04:57.330> them<00:04:57.420> look<00:04:57.540> more

the<00:05:21.780> film<00:05:22.020> I<00:05:22.230> don't<00:05:22.920> think<00:05:23.070> this<00:05:23.130> is<00:05:23.190> one<00:05:23.400> of

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
the film I don't think this is one of

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.850 
the film I don't think this is one of
the<00:05:23.580> stronger<00:05:23.880> figures<00:05:24.840> in<00:05:25.080> this<00:05:25.200> areas<00:05:25.620> but

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
the stronger figures in this areas but

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.900 
the stronger figures in this areas but
you<00:05:25.980> know<00:05:26.070> I<00:05:26.130> mean<00:05:26.280> it<00:05:26.370> looks<00:05:26.550> about<00:05:26.790> what

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
you know I mean it looks about what

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.360 
you know I mean it looks about what
you'd<00:05:27.090> expect<00:05:27.450> it<00:05:27.600> to<00:05:27.630> look<00:05:27.900> like<00:05:27.930> so<00:05:28.380> you<00:05:29.250> know

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
you'd expect it to look like so you know

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.400 
you'd expect it to look like so you know
I'm<00:05:29.460> glad<00:05:29.580> they<00:05:29.880> included<00:05:30.270> him<00:05:30.420> and<00:05:31.260> that

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
I'm glad they included him and that

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.200 
I'm glad they included him and that
brings<00:05:31.650> us<00:05:31.800> to<00:05:31.890> Maleficent<00:05:32.610> Maleficent<00:05:33.120> is

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
brings us to Maleficent Maleficent is

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.450 
brings us to Maleficent Maleficent is
pretty<00:05:33.510> nicely<00:05:33.750> done<00:05:34.170> she<00:05:35.070> doesn't<00:05:35.340> look<00:05:35.400> very

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
pretty nicely done she doesn't look very

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.000 
pretty nicely done she doesn't look very
evil<00:05:36.090> to<00:05:36.300> me<00:05:36.450> and<00:05:37.410> it<00:05:37.560> would<00:05:37.650> have<00:05:37.710> been<00:05:37.770> cold

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
evil to me and it would have been cold

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.700 
evil to me and it would have been cold
maybe<00:05:38.190> they<00:05:38.370> included<00:05:38.730> her<00:05:38.940> scepter<00:05:39.570> which<00:05:40.560> of

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
maybe they included her scepter which of

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.830 
maybe they included her scepter which of
course<00:05:40.740> they<00:05:41.010> didn't<00:05:41.419> but<00:05:42.419> she<00:05:42.540> does<00:05:42.690> look

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
course they didn't but she does look

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.050 
course they didn't but she does look
like<00:05:42.900> she<00:05:42.990> did<00:05:43.230> in<00:05:43.320> the<00:05:43.380> film<00:05:43.620> so<00:05:43.919> you<00:05:44.730> know<00:05:44.850> I'm

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
like she did in the film so you know I'm

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.480 
like she did in the film so you know I'm
happy<00:05:45.300> with<00:05:45.510> her<00:05:45.690> I<00:05:46.100> think<00:05:47.100> she<00:05:47.280> could<00:05:47.400> have

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
happy with her I think she could have

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.680 
happy with her I think she could have
been<00:05:47.580> a<00:05:47.610> little<00:05:47.760> bit<00:05:47.970> better<00:05:48.090> though<00:05:48.330> I<00:05:48.360> don't

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
been a little bit better though I don't

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.780 
been a little bit better though I don't
think<00:05:48.870> that<00:05:49.169> she's<00:05:49.410> one<00:05:50.220> of<00:05:50.250> the<00:05:50.430> stronger

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
think that she's one of the stronger

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.970 
think that she's one of the stronger
figures<00:05:51.720> in<00:05:51.900> this<00:05:52.050> set<00:05:52.260> but<00:05:52.470> of<00:05:52.620> course<00:05:52.830> it's
