00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:08.809
 Hello, I want to share with you here 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:15.059
 old such disks Zhigulevsk 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:16.010
 made just such a stove under the hood 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.010
 firewood 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.980
 here you can insert 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:28.349
 insert a griddle in general what 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.539
 wish you have not yet experienced the truth but it means 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.090
 what used two disks see 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.590
 welded 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:42.920
 bottom disc upside down for more 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:46.850
 volume can be seen or not Zhiguli floor axis 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.870
 bolted down 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.809
 put the nuts in order to good 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:56.739
 pressed against 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:01:01.600
 we will return here from this side 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:07.000
 It looks like talking 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:10.430
 stand elementary from the channel for a long time 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.830
 bother choosing nothing not 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:17.509
 counted here such here it turned out 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:21.520
 quite a while ago I already have this 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:25.670
 frying pan made from disk 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:29.270
 disc harrows agricultural 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:36.350
 technicians who know he will understand what I mean 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:45.159
 and that's just convenient this court case 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:45.159
 set and fry 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:56.310
 different goodies on this business 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:59.920
 then I think I'll do a little differently 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.490
 the brazier my homemade already burned out for 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:07.840
 many years I will find I will find such two 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.830
 disk on this roughly option but 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.590
 cut out 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:16.019
 this part and so that you can 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:21.450
 put on the coals 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:24.450
 skewer and fry skewers in this way 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.690
 here is a little finalized 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.690
 welded pipe 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.800
 because I thought that 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.320
 that probably it would be so close 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.650
 completely 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:45.640
 I put the pan on top 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:51.610
 go smoke out 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:54.410
 so I am testing 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:03:01.850
 I thought to cook below 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:05.440
 how would a coal catcher look in 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.440
 general far they fly away 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:16.280
 economical look a little wood laid water 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.280
 already almost boiling pan 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:25.189
 we will look further may try 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:29.760
 Weld the door here but it's already 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:34.909
 look further let them burn from 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:38.010
 paint discs then let's do it 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:40.370
 uluchshayzing well on this until all of 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.370
 slab 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.470

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:50.190
