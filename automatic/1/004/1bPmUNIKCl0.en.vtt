there<00:00:50.149> and<00:00:51.149> they're<00:00:51.480> both<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.780> same<00:00:51.809> we<00:00:52.649> have

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
there and they're both the same we have

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.400 
there and they're both the same we have
the<00:00:53.449> pts<00:00:54.449> on<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.719> corners<00:00:56.989> and<00:00:57.989> they're<00:00:58.289> just

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
the pts on the corners and they're just

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.959 
the pts on the corners and they're just
like<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> Takara<00:00:59.100> cases<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.670> think<00:00:59.850> they

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
like the Takara cases I think they

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.389 
like the Takara cases I think they
probably<00:01:00.059> just<00:01:00.329> remould<00:01:00.890> remoter<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.039> Takara

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
probably just remould remoter the Takara

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.579 
probably just remould remoter the Takara
cases<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:02.940> put<00:01:03.059> their<00:01:03.210> name<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.660> cause

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
cases and put their name on it cause

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.539 
cases and put their name on it cause
everything's<00:01:04.949> exactly<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.369> same<00:01:05.610> but<00:01:07.549> i'll

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
everything's exactly the same but i'll

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.780 
everything's exactly the same but i'll
go<00:01:08.790> ahead<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:08.970> open<00:01:09.060> them<00:01:09.270> up<00:01:10.610> one<00:01:11.610> thing<00:01:11.760> i

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
go ahead and open them up one thing i

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.090 
go ahead and open them up one thing i
noticed<00:01:12.360> they're<00:01:12.780> not<00:01:13.080> totally<00:01:13.500> flat<00:01:13.890> across

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100

the<00:01:14.310> top<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:15.270> head<00:01:15.479> like<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> bow<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.320> is

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
the top the head like a bow to it is

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.840 
the top the head like a bow to it is
right<00:01:17.460> here's<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.700> little<00:01:17.880> higher<00:01:19.549> this<00:01:20.549> sides

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
right here's a little higher this sides

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.210 
right here's a little higher this sides
are<00:01:21.030> lower<00:01:21.240> than<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.659> side<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:23.040> not<00:01:23.159> a

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
are lower than this side so it's not a

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.219 
are lower than this side so it's not a
perfect<00:01:25.250> square<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.490> up<00:01:26.580> shape<00:01:26.930> like<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.049> tape

would be it doesn't really matter I mean

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.130 
would be it doesn't really matter I mean
it<00:01:30.990> fits<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.500> Soundwave<00:01:31.979> good<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:33.020> but<00:01:34.020> anyway

then the tail you want to actually

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.990 
then the tail you want to actually
unfold<00:03:05.650> that<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:06.430> then<00:03:06.519> this<00:03:06.670> right<00:03:06.819> here

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.170 
it has i miss a nice-looking figures
just<00:07:28.919> it<00:07:29.919> is<00:07:30.070> kind<00:07:30.340> of<00:07:30.400> weird<00:07:30.789> with<00:07:31.060> the

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:31.180 
just it is kind of weird with the

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:37.189 
just it is kind of weird with the
backwards<00:07:31.570> front<00:07:31.780> legs<00:07:32.050> here<00:07:35.430> and<00:07:36.430> so<00:07:36.699> my

00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 
backwards front legs here and so my

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:39.420 
backwards front legs here and so my
loosely<00:07:38.199> here<00:07:38.409> I'll<00:07:38.650> show<00:07:38.680> you<00:07:38.949> that<00:07:39.220> right

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:39.430 
loosely here I'll show you that right

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:47.399 
loosely here I'll show you that right
quick<00:07:39.820> right<00:07:43.740> in<00:07:44.740> here<00:07:45.840> this<00:07:46.840> area<00:07:47.199> has<00:07:47.260> been

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:47.409 
quick right in here this area has been

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:51.210 
quick right in here this area has been
drilled<00:07:47.800> out<00:07:48.009> too<00:07:48.220> much<00:07:48.659> it<00:07:49.830> just<00:07:50.830> really<00:07:51.099> is

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:51.220 
drilled out too much it just really is

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.360 
drilled out too much it just really is
too<00:07:51.430> much<00:07:51.610> space<00:07:51.909> in<00:07:52.150> there<00:07:52.330> in<00:07:52.479> that<00:07:52.720> joint

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:53.370 
too much space in there in that joint

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:57.210 
too much space in there in that joint
while<00:07:54.370> these<00:07:54.759> so<00:07:55.419> much<00:07:55.630> how<00:07:55.930> it<00:07:55.960> looks<00:07:56.289> it's

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:57.220 
while these so much how it looks it's

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.990 
while these so much how it looks it's
like<00:07:57.400> solid<00:07:57.820> metal<00:07:58.740> and<00:07:59.740> this<00:08:00.580> shouldn't<00:08:00.880> have

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:01.000 
like solid metal and this shouldn't have

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.070 
like solid metal and this shouldn't have
been<00:08:01.030> used<00:08:01.449> that's<00:08:02.259> the<00:08:02.500> bad<00:08:02.710> part<00:08:03.870> so<00:08:04.870> that's

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:05.080 
been used that's the bad part so that's

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.680 
been used that's the bad part so that's
why<00:08:05.229> it's<00:08:05.259> loose
