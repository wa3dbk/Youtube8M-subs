00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
that did that go well at all yeah that

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.899 
that did that go well at all yeah that
was<00:03:35.659> a<00:03:35.689> really<00:03:36.019> quick<00:03:36.349> game<00:03:36.590> I<00:03:36.919> think<00:03:37.639> it<00:03:37.730> ended

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
was a really quick game I think it ended

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.470 
was a really quick game I think it ended
on<00:03:38.620> only<00:03:39.620> like<00:03:39.829> a<00:03:40.010> minute<00:03:40.370> in<00:03:40.459> for<00:03:40.730> 20<00:03:41.000> seconds

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
on only like a minute in for 20 seconds

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.420 
on only like a minute in for 20 seconds
in<00:03:41.629> and<00:03:41.900> I<00:03:42.169> think<00:03:42.379> something<00:03:43.099> that's<00:03:43.219> really

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
in and I think something that's really

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.970 
in and I think something that's really
funny<00:03:43.730> about<00:03:43.879> that<00:03:43.969> matchup<00:03:44.299> is<00:03:44.709> it's<00:03:45.709> so

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
funny about that matchup is it's so

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.559 
funny about that matchup is it's so
neutral<00:03:46.370> based<00:03:46.579> because<00:03:46.909> neither<00:03:47.090> character

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
neutral based because neither character

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.659 
neutral based because neither character
can<00:03:47.750> really<00:03:48.049> do<00:03:48.769> a<00:03:48.799> lot<00:03:48.889> of<00:03:49.069> their<00:03:49.310> standard

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:49.669 
can really do a lot of their standard
