it's<00:00:43.829> pretty<00:00:44.129> much<00:00:44.219> what<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.460> can<00:00:44.579> expect

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
it's pretty much what you can expect

from<00:00:44.940> AT&amp;T<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.780> terms<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.590> connectivity<00:00:47.280> and

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
from AT&amp;T in terms of connectivity and

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.860 
from AT&amp;T in terms of connectivity and
call<00:00:47.820> quality<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.360> if<00:00:48.420> you're<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> market

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
call quality so if you're in a market

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.600 
call quality so if you're in a market
like<00:00:48.899> Dallas<00:00:49.379> where<00:00:49.559> ATT<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.039> incredibly

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
like Dallas where ATT is incredibly

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.209 
like Dallas where ATT is incredibly
strong<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.329> works<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:51.840> as<00:00:52.230> good<00:00:52.320> as<00:00:52.649> AT&amp;T

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
strong it works just as good as AT&amp;T

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.979 
strong it works just as good as AT&amp;T
service<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.879> for<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.059> matter<00:00:54.270> anywhere<00:00:54.840> as

long<00:00:55.020> as<00:00:55.289> you're<00:00:55.410> ok<00:00:55.649> with<00:00:55.680> going<00:00:56.010> without<00:00:56.280> LTE

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
long as you're ok with going without LTE

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.330 
long as you're ok with going without LTE
if<00:00:57.480> you're<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.780> any<00:00:57.930> ATT<00:00:58.469> market<00:00:58.859> take<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> look

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
if you're in any ATT market take a look

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.619 
if you're in any ATT market take a look
at<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.609> because<00:00:59.940> you're<00:01:00.090> really<00:01:00.329> getting<00:01:00.570> a

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
at this because you're really getting a

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.779 
at this because you're really getting a
very<00:01:00.809> similar<00:01:01.260> proposition<00:01:01.530> here<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.370> terms

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
very similar proposition here in terms

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.000 
very similar proposition here in terms
of<00:01:02.879> AT&amp;T<00:01:03.180> service<00:01:03.690> for<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.110> lot<00:01:04.290> less<00:01:04.470> money<00:01:04.710> so

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
of AT&amp;T service for a lot less money so

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.740 
of AT&amp;T service for a lot less money so
you've<00:01:05.129> got<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.700> ATT<00:01:06.090> network<00:01:06.450> reliability

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
you've got the ATT network reliability

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.719 
you've got the ATT network reliability

I've<00:01:35.850> got<00:01:36.000> currents<00:01:36.390> here<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.960> can<00:01:37.110> flip

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
testing so I can't say that for sure but

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.590 
testing so I can't say that for sure but
what<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.370> will<00:02:38.460> say<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.850> camera<00:02:39.030> images<00:02:39.450> are
