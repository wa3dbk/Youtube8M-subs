00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.780
 amazing of this park you have well 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.209
 so today because my camera 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.089
 so I have the impression that she gives a 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:14.099
 image or image effect or colors 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:16.380
 washed out and I can not find 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.090
 my usual time settings I do not 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.680
 do not think you have a usual setting because 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.230
 that I am simply no one with my 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.700
 cameras but good today sunday 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.120
 Capillary I hope you are delighted 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.010
 like me again advised to speak 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.720
 once again the last hair 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.189
 times so last week you have 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.800
 many have wanted to see a video 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.960
 on good places to buy 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.550
 to obtain hair products 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.289
 except that I realized that the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.820
 task was much more difficult than that 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:42.870
 so it will take a little bit more 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.309
 time to gather all the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.769
 info and make you a nice video 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.390
 but today I'm going to answer a 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.629
 comment that touched me a lot and 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.519
 which also appealed to me so much because 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.249
 that I encountered the same problem and 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.199
 I think we are not me eva finne 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:00.510
 are not the only ones to have this 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.589
 problem there so it's about a few 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.619
 tips for living with your hair 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.649
 dry and how to make them more hydrated 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.869
 more pleasant to touch and therefore encourages 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.369
 five little tips for living with these 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.200
 small dry hair 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.880
 oh yes I have a little sheet where I 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.880
 am a little note my advice is 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.799
 exactly 5 is first of all I wanted 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.189
 especially tell you that you have to understand 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.939
 a thing if your hair is dry there are 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.250
 well a reason 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.259
 so if you have hair like me 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.149
 or curly hair the moment your 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.100
 hair are more or less curly than this 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:38.100
 either big loops or more 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.270
 small tight where a little like me 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.340
 a little zigzag 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.799
 you must know that our scalp 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.070
 sebum product just like our face 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.020
 and it's a kind of oil or something 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.119
 serious thing that helps hydrate our 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.100
 hair this kind of oil or serious 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.390
 must actually descend from the root of 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.240
 their hair up to the tips 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.770
 so if you 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.000
 straight hair is very simple 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.930
 because there is just a line in 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.509
 others right 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.840
 to follow while if your hair is 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.640
 a minimum curly or very curly even 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.530
 it's a lot harder 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.149
 oil or at this grade to go down and 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.010
 moisturize your hair to the tips 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.080
 and that's when it does not 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.840
 goes down more than half or not 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.370
 completely just fight and we will 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.620
 find with dry hair that 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.450
 also breaks and that is the reason for 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.810
 which we sometimes have very hair 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.690
 dry 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.600
 so we have to find a solution 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.850
 external or dehydrated oneself 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.220
 hair all the way down to the bottom sometimes 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.239
 simple products drive once 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.489
 per week a new daily 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.110
 are enough and sometimes it's not enough 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.880
 because our hair needs a little 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.530
 more hydration so I'm going 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.930
 start with my very first advice 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.860
 it's to check if the products that 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.049
 you apply in your hair 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.700
 actually contain products 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.400
 more moisturizing or with virtues 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.470
 moisturizing so just read the 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.640
 composition of your products make 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.549
 search on google 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.120
 also know that the composition of 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.880
 products 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.530
 when you read them if the product that 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.359
 firstly in second or in 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.359
 third place are the products that in 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:09.340
 most often contain 50% of 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:11.739
 the composition of a product and has 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.079
 simply the first grÃ©zian grain so 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.910
 if I think about levin 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:18.130
 conditional and products-based 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.500
 of water the first thing you 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.030
 have a top down of course pink the whole thing 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.760
 and the liquid product 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.100
 so it's really what what 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.420
 account the product contains more so 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.910
 here you are reading the ingredients 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.620
 content on the back of your products you 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.120
 do some research on google 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.890
 to know a little about what you are fighting 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.170
 in your hair to know if they 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.660
 contain moisturizing or 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.489
 it will not enlighten you a little more 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.239
 on what you bring to your hair 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.799
 basic 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.989
 second tip is to focus 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.359
 on lengths and spikes so 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.739
 when you apply your care or when 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:53.410
 you treat your hair simply 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.450
 it's good to know that these are the 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.010
 parties who are the least hydrate who 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.610
 need more than 100 more actions 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.710
 fragile 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.570
 so if you handle hair if you 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.010
 to heal my hair concentrate on 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.390
 the lengths and spikes me that's 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.700
 what I do when I wash them 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.990
 hair when I apply my mask I 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.220
 applies them only to 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.010
 lengths and spikes and not the 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.080
 root that after - and love each other and who 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.670
 does not need as much care as my 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.920
 length and but tip 3rd tip 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.480
 it is to double lighthouses so if you 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.680
 wash your hair once a 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.330
 week do you have maybe the 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.430
 hair twice a week if you 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.970
 moisturize every two days 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.650
 perhaps 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.640
 moisturize your hair every day 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.380
 where every day I do not know brief 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.690
 double your efforts over a period 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.960
 given so maybe a month or two 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.419
 month 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.400
 during this time where you do the 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.990
 duplicate things so instead of doing 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.550
 a washing once a week of the 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.360
 do it twice a week to see this 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.800
 that it can change 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.780
 it's like when you're hungry you 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.730
 eat twice as much and I think 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.850
 it's the same for your hair so 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.590
 do on some sort of cure to see if 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.570
 it improves or not the state of your 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.850
 hair and especially hydration and to 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.320
 the suppleness of your fourth hair 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.480
 advice and that's my advice prefer 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.950
 it's drinking more water or changing 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.620
 a little bit your diet because 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.080
 that your health is reflected in the sources 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.419
 also reflects forgiveness because you 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.760
 eat is what you take in yourself 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.440
 so if you drink already drink a little 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.060
 earlier to say that you moisturize a little 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.860
 the more your body so it's okay 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.020
 naturally with the without going 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.940
 to your hair and hydrated your 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.450
 hair so much more if your hair 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.310
 are poorly moisturize or her sex this is going 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.250
 maybe also an impact on 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.320
 your break on your face you go 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.419
 may have found that there is a bad 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.790
 hydration on poor hydration 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.620
 on other parts of your map and 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.450
 I think when you go amount of a 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.750
 better way by drinking more water 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.700
 it will change already in state 2 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.290
 I want but also of your body and 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.830
 you will already feel much better in 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.510
 your skin 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.250
 5th tip and this is my last 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.050
 concert a little more drastic actually 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.140
 it's all about cutting your 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.280
 hair because you have to know that your 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.160
 hair have layers 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.360
 so it's not just a hair 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.730
 but there are several layers that 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.650
 make up your hair and sometimes on 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:07.830
 your points there are layers that are 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:10.020
 eliminated and which are much finer 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.360
 and that are simply 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.920
 bad condition and not the best 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.610
 solution is to cut your hair 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:20.370
 to actually eliminate that bad sides of 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.780
 your hair is to keep only the 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.790
 good and say goodbye to a few 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.370
 centimeters of your hair I know that 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.020
 it's sometimes painful but if you 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.780
 want to have healthy hair and one 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.700
 is in good health 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:35.580
 that's the only solution and it was my 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:37.350
 last advice and that was all 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.510
 for my video I hope the ad you 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.190
 and as soon as it could be useful and that 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.110
 you liked also do not hesitate to 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.180
 like this video if that's the case and 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.770
 also to share other ideas in 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.210
 comment I like to discuss with 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.220
 you and I think it's Sunday 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.060

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.440
 exchange moment 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.330
 I know I'm not a 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.270
 specialist and I'm taking for 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.770
