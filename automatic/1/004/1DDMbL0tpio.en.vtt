00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello people welcome once more alone 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.310
 for everyone in this video we're going to 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.360
 be doing your own tail of 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.070
 paste using milk and in addition to milk 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.259
 and we will be using two ingredients 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.670
 more that are so easy to get 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.920
 like milk 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.869
 these are vinegar that everyone 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.880
 has vinegar at home and we will be 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.020
 also using something that we use a lot 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.960
 our video of our experiences 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.519
 which is the sodium bicarbonate other than 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.740
 the things that we are going to use is also a 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.599
 coffee filter that we are going to need and 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.059
 some other tools for example 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.430
 a spoon a glass a container for 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.870
 able to filter and another container where 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.270
 I will be able to put the milk so that 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.680
 I got wiesenthal and the first thing 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.260
 what we are going to have to do is separate 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.350
 whey protein and milk 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.489
 we 're going to do that with the vinegar 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.570
 let's first serve the milk in the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.399
 glass almost to fill the glass and then 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.149
 let's complete the difference with 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.149
 vinegar 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.770
 now let's stir and let's start 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.600
 to notice how the milk protein is 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.369
 begins to separate began to create a 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.619
 effect very similar to what happened with what 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.630
 of the cocacola good then now what 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.180
 what we are going to have to do is filter 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.890
 they're going to see that it's like curd if it's 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.800
 both to the protein separated from what 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.900
 it's the vinegar that we put and the soil 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.340
 the milk we will use the coffee filter 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.620
 this we are going to have to leave 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.450
 filtering approximately 15 or 20 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.450
 minutes until you see it stop dripping 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.380
 after we leave it for a while filtering 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.900
 this is the liquid that we managed to get out 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.080
 and what we have here is only the 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:05.890
 protein and that's what we 're going to use to 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.229
 make our milk cola let's 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.119
 pass a separate container 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.620
 and now we will be placing 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:17.019
 Baking soda will start to notice 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.000
 that begin to generate a bubble that 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.379
 of carbon dioxide we have already seen in other 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.060
 experiences what happens when 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.790
 we mix sodium bicarbonate with 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.239
 vinegar that creates a reaction that generates 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.989
 carbon dioxide and that's what we have left 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:34.239
 milk cola let's try to paste 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.470
 three things in this case I have here 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.680
 a few sticks to eat meals 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.079
 Japanese wood then I have what 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.730
 I stay where the spring flower two 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:47.519
 pieces of eva rubber to see if it sticks 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.519
 really and we're going to also paste paper 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.610
 and without more we can do today is now 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.870
 just let them arrive until tomorrow and 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.970
 these are the results after 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:23.120
 having waited one day for the paper you see that 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.120
 I stick it perfectly as you can see 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.090
 I have it well 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.860
 the wood we had supported in 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.140
 a paper so that it does not stain and also 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.050
 hit the paper came out of the wood 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:39.180
 paper to the way sticks and wood 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.180
 he also hit it pretty well 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.270
 and the eva rubber 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.430
 I do not even hit it even dried 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.590
 I do not know now if one lets it dry more 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.060
 time to that grip 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.160
 If you let it dry longer with a 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.140
 day the rubber eva was not enough because 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.340
 it did not even dry up and if you want to see more 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.120
 videos how can you enter the 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.890
 one page for all 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.209
 if you so these kind of experience 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.890
 then I recommend that you are a 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.299
 return to the channel that happens to win 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.159
 because there's a lot of video with this kind of 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.989
 experience and if you suddenly like it 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.730
 build things do things a little more 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.379
 rare on this side we had 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.480
 taught to make a hologram already 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.400
 we had explained how this works 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.560
 program and what use it was given in that 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.060
 era when they created it and from this side 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.060
 we have a trick of 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.640
 valera 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:33.349
 and on this side I leave you a magic trick 

00:04:31.489 --> 00:04:34.879
 interactive if you are the magic are of 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:36.979
 those I'll support sitting on the screen 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:38.989
 and you guess what the number is 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:40.579
 you chose so go there 

00:04:38.989 --> 00:04:42.849
 visit them and see you in the next 

00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:42.849
 video
