00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 Here's another test from youtube today 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.710
 is about a forage machine for 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.730
 Cats call themselves pat safe and now 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.630
 I show you first where the product 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.940
 can buy at all and the pet safe 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.560
 Feeding machines with timer for 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.160
 There are five meals at amazon 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.720
 to buy costs 43 euro 39 and is 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.910
 Free shipping therefore via Amazon 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.380
 the link to the product is sent 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.490
 post with a text alt and a video 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.869
 or just click on it and come 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.470
 right in and now let's have a look 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.470
 the device 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.340
 we have the pet safe feeders 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.340
 that's what it looks like 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.140
 you can open it 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.979
 For that you have to press the front search 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:28.369
 and then you can open it and stuff 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:32.330
 is he looking back then ? 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.940
 We can do that with the five feeds 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.520
 you make it so high here 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.979
 then what it looks here but under from 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.110
 that should be cool battery but does not fit 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.320
 everyone always sees who is 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:49.399
 Example too big then the dimensions 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:55.360
 would be about nine here but we say 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:58.700
 times eight and a half centimeters times trained 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.369
 16 half so eight and half times 16 half 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:06.170
 then the accor fits in because that's too 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.269
 Gross here is tariff 80 can also 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.030
 will be opened here 

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:12.530
 dollars are four of these big ones 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.360
 then batteries in it 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.610
 The batteries should also be very long 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.900
 keep a household has the device already 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.030
 several months and that is still 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.850
 the first four batteries which he 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.959
 has now come to the 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.760
 Programming is actually very much 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.269
 easy 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.160
 now we have the time 12 v 8 if 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.290
 I can push on it now I can 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.750
 imagine the time of day 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.950
 Here you go down there is now and 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.790
 pm is here now 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.340
 you can go up again so pushes 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.880
 you here again it can be the 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.880
 minutes 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:56.730
 that was the time you can nine 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:59.190
 different times program this 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.760
 Now I'll go down here on the 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:06.000
 button on my well-known has now 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.000
 For example, as a program time at the 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.230
 number one in the morning 5 o'clock 35 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.470
 programmed with the new one he has 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.269
 nothing with that comes down again 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.780
 if we press on it now as 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:25.230
 second time at noon at half past eleven and on 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:28.260
 pm so the evening at half past five and over 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.760
 night at half past eleven when now 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.530
 I also tell you to change it 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.160
 we are still on the one pressing 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.620
 her the key and now we come 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.480
 change the times as you want 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.790
 when you push body to the 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.450
 minutes if you set it to zero 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.630
 put 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:49.890
 one presses on it now is patience 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.260
 and since then come again 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.370
 then I just have a taste 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.880
 here and that here 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.950
 So you can advice the plate here 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:05.400
 Turning completely I show that time 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:07.579
 that's just one of them 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.440
 position 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:13.950
 that was all about it 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.739
 vending machines here from the pet safe know 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.729
 yes very good product i can 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:23.400
 actually only recommend for 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.780
 dry food because wet food here in 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.380
 to distinguish the individual camera 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.470
 days time 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.289
 it will become dry or bad afterwards 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.760
 or the cola co he uses nothing synonymous 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.770
 Do you have it if it is cooled here? 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.910
 but in other chambers is none 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.169
 That's why they might have that kind of cooling 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.490
 a thing must build a small one 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.919
 fridge or something but for 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.090
 Dry food is a great thing 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.440
 I only recommend the link to that 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.000
 has product in the text and are in video 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.120
 just on it could be directly to 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.479
 Amazon without it until the next 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.479
 times
