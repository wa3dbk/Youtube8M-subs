decks<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.289> have<00:02:10.500> eight<00:02:10.800> different<00:02:11.129> sets<00:02:11.730> that

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
decks you have eight different sets that

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.550 
decks you have eight different sets that
you<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.330> need<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.599> build<00:02:12.750> up<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.140> do

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
you you need to build up and do

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.410 
you you need to build up and do
so<00:02:13.770> we'll<00:02:13.920> also<00:02:14.099> clear<00:02:14.489> space<00:02:14.790> on<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.180> board

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
so we'll also clear space on the board

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.270 
so we'll also clear space on the board
as<00:02:15.660> well<00:02:15.690> getting<00:02:16.440> rid<00:02:16.620> of<00:02:16.650> some<00:02:16.830> carts<00:02:17.099> so<00:02:17.220> it

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
as well getting rid of some carts so it

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.500 
as well getting rid of some carts so it
gets<00:02:17.430> easier<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:17.819> easier<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.090> play<00:02:18.270> as<00:02:18.420> you

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
clear away the suits it's fairly

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.010 
clear away the suits it's fairly
difficult<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:21.120> win<00:02:22.010> because<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.700> have<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.030> you
