 so var could not stay outside 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.260

 bart gas writing on the blackboard 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.980
 after 25 years on the air there is a lot 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.170
 material to analyze whether they are 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.599
 coincidences or true clairvoyance 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.179

 cakes I will not call my teacher hot cakes 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.430
 we know that bar is not close to having 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.559
 such a relationship against paper and 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.329
 it's just a lack of respect but there 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.430
 student teacher relations cases 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.610

 wrote and windows the miracle because no 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.080
 I will sell miracle cures was a 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.580
 coincidence that just in the 90s it 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.680

 hundreds of books on substances 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.430
 curatives were sold and a 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:40.050
 space for miraculous cures

 and daughter living picks the short 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.510
 Chinese is unhealthy for children and 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.550
 other creatures alive last year a 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.800
 ex marine got drunk and entered into a 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.440
 fight with his stepfather taking his clothes 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.360
 inside and putting it on his head the 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.930
 problem was that somehow it was 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.830
 around his neck suffocating him 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:09.660

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.380
 the bar blackboard the phrase and not longer

 I want my mtv I do not want my m tv anymore 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.880
 interesting is that at that time m tv 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.360
 I still had music videos and few 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.860
 reality shows years later m tv se 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.320
 it became something that other generations 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.830
 they do not recognize and for which they can 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.530
 feel identified with the phrase 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.660
 number one there is an end in 2010 the 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.510
 pitarra showed the phrase the world mind and 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.420
 in 2012 betis show and the world will be able 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.519
 finish in 2012 but this show is not 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.840
 clear that by then there was already 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.700
 a 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.530
 contract signed in the future but what 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.349
 interesting is that for more years than 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.360
 pass the phrase is still real the 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.190
 simpson have become a kind of 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.430
 infinite story to which we do not see him 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.750
 culmination you know some other story 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.750
