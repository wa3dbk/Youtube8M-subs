00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.379 
the hobbyking XD 6 for poor balance
charger<00:00:12.750> now<00:00:13.349> this<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.099> as<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.910> see<00:00:15.089> for

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
charger now this is a as you see for

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.640 
charger now this is a as you see for
ports<00:00:15.719> you<00:00:15.809> can<00:00:15.929> charge<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.199> up<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.440> 4

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
ports you can charge it up to 4

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.920 
ports you can charge it up to 4
batteries<00:00:17.010> at<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.279> same<00:00:17.430> time<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:17.970> what's

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
batteries at the same time and what's

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.750 
batteries at the same time and what's
nice<00:00:19.080> about<00:00:19.140> this<00:00:19.590> one<00:00:19.800> it's<00:00:19.980> 60<00:00:20.369> watts<00:00:20.550> per

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
nice about this one it's 60 watts per

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.010 
nice about this one it's 60 watts per
channel<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.150> it's<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.300> little<00:00:21.420> bit<00:00:21.600> higher<00:00:21.779> than

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
channel so it's a little bit higher than

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.290 
channel so it's a little bit higher than
your<00:00:22.230> standard<00:00:22.560> for<00:00:22.920> port<00:00:23.160> chargers<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:24.150> this

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
your standard for port chargers so this

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.810 
your standard for port chargers so this
will<00:00:24.449> handle<00:00:24.660> up<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:24.960> 6<00:00:25.470> amp<00:00:25.740> charge<00:00:26.099> rates<00:00:26.400> for

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
will handle up to 6 amp charge rates for
