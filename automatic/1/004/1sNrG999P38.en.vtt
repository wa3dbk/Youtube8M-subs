thinkpad utility what I don't like

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.390

though<00:02:24.270> is<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.930> new<00:02:25.200> trackpad<00:02:25.860> with

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
though is the new trackpad with

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.670 
though is the new trackpad with
integrated<00:02:27.090> buttons<00:02:27.600> but<00:02:28.020> I<00:02:28.050> guess<00:02:28.320> it's

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
integrated buttons but I guess it's

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.630 
integrated buttons but I guess it's
better<00:02:29.220> than<00:02:29.370> no<00:02:29.820> trackpad<00:02:30.510> at<00:02:30.750> all<00:02:30.900> an

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
better than no trackpad at all an
