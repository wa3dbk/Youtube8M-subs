history anyway if you're doing a

history anyway if you're doing a
nighttime<00:00:27.330> scene<00:00:27.900> you've<00:00:28.109> got<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.500> compensate

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
nighttime scene you've got to compensate

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.120 
nighttime scene you've got to compensate
for<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.910> way<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.090> tube<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:31.590> my<00:00:31.830> opinion

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
for the way you tube in my opinion

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.340 
for the way you tube in my opinion
doesn't<00:00:32.250> handle<00:00:32.940> dark<00:00:33.300> colors<00:00:33.690> particularly

well<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.890> its<00:00:35.130> encoding<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.870> your<00:00:37.190> animation

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
well in its encoding so your animation

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.069 
well in its encoding so your animation
might<00:00:38.370> look<00:00:38.520> fine<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:38.850> your<00:00:39.180> screen<00:00:39.600> or<00:00:39.629> even

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
might look fine on your screen or even

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.290 
might look fine on your screen or even
on<00:00:40.200> your<00:00:40.350> friend<00:00:40.680> screen<00:00:41.070> but<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.760> get<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.090> put

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
on your friend screen but you get to put

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.790 
on your friend screen but you get to put
it<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:42.510> YouTube<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.230> they've<00:00:43.410> got<00:00:43.530> to

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
it on YouTube and they've got to

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.119 
it on YouTube and they've got to
compensate<00:00:45.170> one<00:00:46.170> way<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.440> doing<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.860> to

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
compensate one way of doing this is to

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.400 
compensate one way of doing this is to
change<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.489> gamma<00:00:48.270> settings<00:00:48.840> for<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.260> whole

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
change the gamma settings for the whole

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.229 
change the gamma settings for the whole
project<00:00:49.680> which<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.489> probably<00:00:50.700> want<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.149> do

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
project which you probably want to do

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.290 
project which you probably want to do
anyway<00:00:51.629> but<00:00:52.289> then<00:00:52.410> also<00:00:52.559> why<00:00:52.980> not<00:00:53.160> fix<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.180> as

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
anyway but then also why not fix it as

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.180 
anyway but then also why not fix it as
source<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.960> some<00:00:55.140> extent<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.800> that's<00:00:55.949> with

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
source to some extent and that's with

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.720 
source to some extent and that's with
your<00:00:56.489> choice<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.420> lighting<00:00:58.370> so<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> scene

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
your choice of lighting so the scene

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.599 
your choice of lighting so the scene
that<00:00:59.850> we're<00:01:00.000> looking<00:01:00.090> at<00:01:00.390> here<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:01.340> the<00:01:02.340> third

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
that we're looking at here is the third

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.530 
that we're looking at here is the third
attempt<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:04.189> get<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> nighttime<00:01:05.729> scene<00:01:06.270> for

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
attempt to get a nighttime scene for

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.080 
attempt to get a nighttime scene for
YouTube<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.260> should<00:01:08.159> say<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.820> work

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
YouTube I should say that this is a work

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.630 
YouTube I should say that this is a work
in<00:01:09.119> progress<00:01:09.570> it's<00:01:10.439> good<00:01:10.740> enough<00:01:11.010> for<00:01:11.250> me<00:01:11.369> now

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
in progress it's good enough for me now

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.969 
in progress it's good enough for me now
at<00:01:11.850> my<00:01:12.030> current<00:01:12.330> stage<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.900> development<00:01:13.170> you

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
at my current stage of development you

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.920 
at my current stage of development you
may<00:01:14.159> well<00:01:14.369> know<00:01:14.400> better<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.240> which<00:01:15.420> case<00:01:15.689> i'd

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
may well know better in which case i'd

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.649 
may well know better in which case i'd
love<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.290> hear<00:01:16.500> from<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.939> but<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> rest

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
love to hear from you but for the rest

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.410 
love to hear from you but for the rest
of<00:01:18.810> us<00:01:20.030> i'm<00:01:21.030> using<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:22.250> for<00:01:23.250> distant<00:01:23.820> lights<00:01:24.090> and

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
of us i'm using a for distant lights and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.060 
of us i'm using a for distant lights and
moon<00:01:24.900> lights<00:01:25.820> lighting<00:01:26.820> setup<00:01:27.650> in<00:01:28.650> order<00:01:28.950> to

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
moon lights lighting setup in order to

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.069 
moon lights lighting setup in order to
achieve<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.670> result<00:01:31.250> without<00:01:33.079> compensating

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
achieve this result without compensating

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.249 
achieve this result without compensating
it<00:01:34.590> would<00:01:34.979> look<00:01:35.130> like<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:36.079> which<00:01:37.079> is

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
it would look like this which is

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.109 
it would look like this which is
arguably<00:01:37.470> more<00:01:38.040> realistic<00:01:38.700> if<00:01:38.850> you're<00:01:38.970> not

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
arguably more realistic if you're not

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.980 
arguably more realistic if you're not
looking<00:01:39.450> at<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:39.840> youtube<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:40.829> we<00:01:40.979> are<00:01:41.990> so

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
looking at it on youtube but we are so

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.310 
looking at it on youtube but we are so
I've<00:01:43.350> had<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.860> add<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.149> bit<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.360> lighting<00:01:46.020> to

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
I've had to add in a bit of lighting to

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.499 
I've had to add in a bit of lighting to
the<00:01:46.530> things<00:01:47.340> other<00:01:47.549> than<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.909> road<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.360> can

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
the things other than the road you can

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.080 
the things other than the road you can
probably<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:48.899> see<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.259> road<00:01:49.439> now<00:01:49.710> if<00:01:50.490> you

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
probably just see the road now if you

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.670 
probably just see the road now if you
add<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.240> bit<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.540> lighting<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.259> get<00:01:52.470> this

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
add a bit of lighting you get this

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.760 
add a bit of lighting you get this
result<00:01:53.780> now<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.840> should<00:01:55.170> be<00:01:55.200> seeing<00:01:55.590> that

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
result now you should be seeing that

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.469 
result now you should be seeing that
it's<00:01:55.979> not<00:01:56.189> just<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.670> road<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:56.880> fact<00:01:57.299> there<00:01:57.450> are

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
it's not just a road in fact there are

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.080 
it's not just a road in fact there are
walls<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.649> buildings<00:01:58.829> around<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.759> but<00:01:59.969> you

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
walls and buildings around it but you

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.420 
walls and buildings around it but you
still<00:02:00.360> can't<00:02:00.750> really<00:02:01.170> make<00:02:01.320> them<00:02:01.560> out<00:02:01.770> and

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
still can't really make them out and

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.300 
still can't really make them out and
that<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.090> why<00:02:03.299> I've<00:02:03.479> overcompensated<00:02:04.409> again

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
that is why I've overcompensated again

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.930 
that is why I've overcompensated again
and<00:02:05.520> done<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:06.590> which<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:07.890> YouTube<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.729> can

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
and done this which on YouTube you can

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.570 
and done this which on YouTube you can
now<00:02:09.239> make<00:02:09.450> out<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:10.050> you're<00:02:10.200> in<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.349> scene<00:02:10.709> so

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
now make out that you're in a scene so

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.900 
now make out that you're in a scene so
good<00:02:12.510> enough<00:02:12.750> for<00:02:12.930> YouTube

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
good enough for YouTube

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.350 
good enough for YouTube
it<00:02:14.390> doesn't<00:02:14.810> particularly<00:02:15.800> look<00:02:16.130> like<00:02:16.430> real

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
it doesn't particularly look like real

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.500 
it doesn't particularly look like real
nighttime<00:02:18.730> because<00:02:19.730> in<00:02:19.880> some<00:02:20.030> circumstances

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
nighttime because in some circumstances

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.410 
nighttime because in some circumstances
dark<00:02:21.410> areas<00:02:21.830> can<00:02:22.010> be<00:02:22.040> completely<00:02:22.550> black<00:02:22.910> at

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
dark areas can be completely black at

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.540 
dark areas can be completely black at
nighttime<00:02:25.810> anyway<00:02:26.810> this<00:02:26.960> is<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.170> setup<00:02:27.550> so

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
nighttime anyway this is the setup so

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.060 
nighttime anyway this is the setup so
i'm<00:02:28.640> using<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.090> moonlight<00:02:29.650> with<00:02:30.650> fifty

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
i'm using the moonlight with fifty

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.550 
i'm using the moonlight with fifty
percent<00:02:31.340> brightness<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:32.410> then<00:02:33.410> i've<00:02:33.530> got

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
percent brightness and then i've got

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.340 
percent brightness and then i've got
four<00:02:34.180> distant<00:02:35.180> lights<00:02:35.390> north<00:02:35.960> east<00:02:36.110> south

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
four distant lights north east south

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.100 
four distant lights north east south
west<00:02:36.680> and<00:02:37.130> you'll<00:02:37.700> notice<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.270> brightness<00:02:38.720> on

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
west and you'll notice the brightness on

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.470 
west and you'll notice the brightness on
them<00:02:39.320> is<00:02:39.440> low<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.070> color<00:02:40.340> of<00:02:40.640> each<00:02:41.150> light

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
them is low and the color of each light

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.920 
them is low and the color of each light
is<00:02:41.660> different<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:43.250> lights<00:02:43.490> work<00:02:43.820> together<00:02:44.060> to

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
is different the lights work together to

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.280 
is different the lights work together to
fake<00:02:45.340> indirect<00:02:46.340> lighting<00:02:46.610> so<00:02:47.300> that<00:02:47.330> the

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
fake indirect lighting so that the

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.420 
fake indirect lighting so that the
further<00:02:48.530> you<00:02:48.710> are<00:02:48.800> from<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.250> light<00:02:49.400> source

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
further you are from the light source

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.930 
further you are from the light source
the<00:02:50.180> moon<00:02:50.360> here<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:51.560> darker<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.160> areas<00:02:52.730> are

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
the moon here the darker the areas are

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.620 
the moon here the darker the areas are
but<00:02:53.120> they<00:02:53.210> still<00:02:53.420> light<00:02:53.660> up<00:02:53.690> somewhat<00:02:55.630> again

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
but they still light up somewhat again

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.780 
but they still light up somewhat again
as<00:02:56.810> I<00:02:56.930> said<00:02:56.960> in<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.650> related<00:02:58.040> daytime

nighttime for the scene to work now an
artist<00:03:25.970> that<00:03:26.090> I<00:03:26.150> know<00:03:26.360> on<00:03:26.480> another<00:03:26.750> site

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
artist that I know on another site

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.180 
artist that I know on another site
that's<00:03:27.380> way<00:03:28.160> ahead<00:03:28.190> of<00:03:28.430> me<00:03:28.550> says<00:03:29.420> them

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
that's way ahead of me says them

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.050 
that's way ahead of me says them
nighttime<00:03:31.190> lighting<00:03:31.370> is<00:03:31.730> all<00:03:31.820> about

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
nighttime lighting is all about

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.460 
nighttime lighting is all about
contrasts<00:03:33.820> so<00:03:34.820> what<00:03:35.600> I'm<00:03:35.690> now<00:03:36.020> going<00:03:36.170> to<00:03:36.260> show

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
contrasts so what I'm now going to show

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.900 
contrasts so what I'm now going to show
is<00:03:36.760> my<00:03:37.760> attempts<00:03:38.150> at<00:03:38.300> contrasting<00:03:39.910> making

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
is my attempts at contrasting making

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.550 
is my attempts at contrasting making
things<00:03:41.120> interesting<00:03:41.300> by<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:41.959> bits<00:03:42.290> that<00:03:42.410> you

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
things interesting by the bits that you

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.970 
things interesting by the bits that you
choose<00:03:42.770> to<00:03:43.010> light<00:03:43.220> up<00:03:43.989> so<00:03:44.989> here's<00:03:45.200> a<00:03:45.260> taxi<00:03:45.800> a

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
choose to light up so here's a taxi a

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.910 
choose to light up so here's a taxi a
London<00:03:46.430> taxi<00:03:46.459> that<00:03:47.060> flies<00:03:47.680> that's<00:03:48.680> going<00:03:48.830> to

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
London taxi that flies that's going to

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.140 
London taxi that flies that's going to
be<00:03:48.980> in<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.280> next<00:03:49.640> part<00:03:50.630> of<00:03:50.720> my<00:03:50.810> animated<00:03:51.170> movie

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
be in the next part of my animated movie

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.760 
be in the next part of my animated movie
and<00:03:53.150> one<00:03:53.330> thing<00:03:53.540> I'm<00:03:53.660> experimenting<00:03:54.050> with<00:03:54.470> is

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
and one thing I'm experimenting with is

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.830 
and one thing I'm experimenting with is
the<00:03:54.980> use<00:03:55.160> of<00:03:55.190> its<00:03:55.520> headlamps<00:03:56.360> to<00:03:56.510> make<00:03:56.690> the

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
the use of its headlamps to make the

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.070 
the use of its headlamps to make the
scene<00:03:57.340> interesting<00:03:58.600> so<00:03:59.600> the<00:03:59.720> shot<00:03:59.930> we're

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
scene interesting so the shot we're

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.720 
scene interesting so the shot we're
looking<00:04:00.320> at<00:04:00.440> here<00:04:00.650> would<00:04:00.830> be<00:04:00.860> without

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
looking at here would be without

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.620 
looking at here would be without
headlamps<00:04:02.540> and<00:04:03.610> then<00:04:04.610> with<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.180> headlamps<00:04:05.690> on

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
headlamps and then with the headlamps on

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.330 
headlamps and then with the headlamps on
the<00:04:08.630> scene<00:04:08.900> suddenly<00:04:09.350> comes<00:04:09.590> alive<00:04:10.360> contrast

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
the scene suddenly comes alive contrast

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.449 
the scene suddenly comes alive contrast
here<00:04:13.340> it<00:04:14.120> doesn't<00:04:14.570> quite<00:04:14.720> work<00:04:14.840> it<00:04:15.770> looks<00:04:16.100> more

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
here it doesn't quite work it looks more

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.449 
here it doesn't quite work it looks more
like<00:04:16.640> dawn<00:04:17.540> but<00:04:18.440> you<00:04:18.500> put<00:04:18.709> the<00:04:18.799> headlights<00:04:19.190> on

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
like dawn but you put the headlights on

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.940 
like dawn but you put the headlights on
and<00:04:19.810> it<00:04:20.810> still<00:04:21.049> probably<00:04:21.320> struggles<00:04:21.799> a<00:04:21.919> bit

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
and it still probably struggles a bit

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.690 
and it still probably struggles a bit
that<00:04:22.340> you've<00:04:22.970> got<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:23.270> contrast<00:04:24.580> finally<00:04:25.580> if

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
that you've got the contrast finally if

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.150 
that you've got the contrast finally if
you<00:04:25.880> look<00:04:26.030> at

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
you look at

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
channel so that's it without light and

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.170 
channel so that's it without light and
that's<00:04:45.470> it<00:04:45.680> with<00:04:45.830> light<00:04:46.100> and<00:04:46.280> you<00:04:46.460> can<00:04:46.670> mix<00:04:46.910> in

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
that's it with light and you can mix in

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.830 
that's it with light and you can mix in
between<00:04:47.600> to<00:04:48.260> come<00:04:48.470> up<00:04:48.590> with<00:04:48.770> the<00:04:48.980> best

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
compromise for your scene and I think

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.910 
compromise for your scene and I think
that's<00:04:53.240> the<00:04:53.420> key<00:04:53.600> word<00:04:53.630> compromise<00:04:54.410> for

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
that's the key word compromise for

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.160 
that's the key word compromise for

good<00:04:58.090> maybe<00:04:59.090> you<00:04:59.390> can<00:04:59.570> sacrifice<00:04:59.870> some

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
good maybe you can sacrifice some

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.170 
good maybe you can sacrifice some
reality<00:05:01.340> just<00:05:02.060> to<00:05:02.180> make<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:02.510> scene<00:05:02.780> work<00:05:03.740> on

reality just to make the scene work on

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.560 
reality just to make the scene work on
YouTube<00:05:05.180> for<00:05:06.370> example<00:05:07.370> there's<00:05:07.610> three<00:05:08.270> point

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
YouTube for example there's three point

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.050 
YouTube for example there's three point
lighting<00:05:08.980> specific<00:05:09.980> to<00:05:10.550> that<00:05:10.580> character

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
lighting specific to that character

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.540

standing<00:05:11.840> on<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.080> pavement<00:05:12.290> there<00:05:12.860> which

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
standing on the pavement there which

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.659 
standing on the pavement there which
looks<00:05:13.850> a<00:05:14.030> little<00:05:14.180> bit<00:05:14.419> force<00:05:14.720> in<00:05:14.960> that<00:05:14.990> shot

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
looks a little bit force in that shot

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.940 
looks a little bit force in that shot
but<00:05:16.669> when<00:05:16.820> you<00:05:16.970> add<00:05:17.120> in<00:05:17.330> the<00:05:17.710> headlamps<00:05:18.710> from

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
but when you add in the headlamps from

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.330 
but when you add in the headlamps from
the<00:05:19.160> taxi<00:05:19.750> now<00:05:20.750> he<00:05:20.810> doesn't<00:05:21.320> fade<00:05:22.010> into<00:05:22.220> the

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
the taxi now he doesn't fade into the

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.520 
the taxi now he doesn't fade into the
background<00:05:22.430> quite<00:05:23.150> as<00:05:23.360> much<00:05:23.540> so<00:05:24.380> it's

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
background quite as much so it's

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.130 
background quite as much so it's
cheating<00:05:24.830> it's<00:05:25.340> what<00:05:25.940> you<00:05:26.030> can<00:05:26.240> make<00:05:26.360> work<00:05:26.690> but

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
cheating it's what you can make work but

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.409 
cheating it's what you can make work but
hopefully<00:05:27.620> I've<00:05:27.770> given<00:05:28.669> you<00:05:28.760> some<00:05:28.970> tools<00:05:29.210> if

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
hopefully I've given you some tools if

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.030 
hopefully I've given you some tools if
you've<00:05:29.570> never<00:05:29.750> thought<00:05:30.050> of<00:05:30.260> combining<00:05:30.770> these

you've never thought of combining these

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.490 
you've never thought of combining these

techniques together and I talk to you
