yeah<00:00:08.340> this<00:00:08.519> is<00:00:08.639> our<00:00:09.559> washing<00:00:10.559> machine<00:00:11.389> bicycle

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
yeah this is our washing machine bicycle

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:26.269 
yeah this is our washing machine bicycle
powered<00:00:12.570> with<00:00:13.049> flywheel<00:00:13.920> attachment<00:00:25.279> but

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
powered with flywheel attachment but

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.730 
powered with flywheel attachment but
this<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.720> probably<00:00:27.720> what<00:00:28.019> we<00:00:28.050> came<00:00:28.380> for<00:00:28.439> made

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
this is probably what we came for made

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.420 
this is probably what we came for made
in<00:00:28.769> 70s<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:30.560> unlike<00:00:31.560> traditional<00:00:31.590> washing

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
in 70s and unlike traditional washing

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:47.380 
in 70s and unlike traditional washing
machines<00:00:32.700> back<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.090> time<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.510> has<00:00:33.660> this

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:01:01.040 

I'm<00:00:48.390> going<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.930> push<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.379> back<00:00:59.750> but<00:01:00.750> yeah<00:01:00.930> it

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
I'm going to push you back but yeah it

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.529 
I'm going to push you back but yeah it
takes<00:01:01.199> about<00:01:01.350> eight<00:01:01.710> gallons<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.190> water<00:01:02.539> 810

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
takes about eight gallons of water 810

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:10.100 
takes about eight gallons of water 810
for<00:01:04.110> one<00:01:04.350> loom<00:01:07.159> and<00:01:08.159> then<00:01:08.400> rinse<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.479> mean<00:01:09.720> ten

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
for one loom and then rinse I mean ten

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.590 
for one loom and then rinse I mean ten
minute<00:01:10.409> education<00:01:10.979> cycle<00:01:11.340> followed<00:01:12.119> by<00:01:12.240> ten

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
minute education cycle followed by ten

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.020 
minute education cycle followed by ten
minute<00:01:12.840> rinse<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.470> want

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
minute rinse you want

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.870 
minute rinse you want
so<00:01:15.030> we'll<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.299> explain<00:01:15.450> how<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.900> works<00:01:16.880> okay

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
so we'll just explain how it works okay

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.570 
so we'll just explain how it works okay
so<00:01:18.540> underneath<00:01:19.140> here<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.470> can<00:01:19.770> see<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.400> this

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
so underneath here you can see that this

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.210 
so underneath here you can see that this
belt<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.090> attached<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.750> small<00:01:21.900> pulley<00:01:22.380> which

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
belt is attached to a small pulley which

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.490 
belt is attached to a small pulley which
was<00:01:23.460> originally<00:01:23.729> driven<00:01:24.180> by<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> motor<00:01:24.869> about

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
was originally driven by a motor about

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.260 
was originally driven by a motor about
this<00:01:25.799> size<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.100> would<00:01:26.640> run<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.030> whole

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
this size that would run this whole

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.230 
this size that would run this whole
operation<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:29.040> what<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.340> did<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.850> took<00:01:29.880> out

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
operation so what I did is I took out

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.749 
operation so what I did is I took out
all<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.229> innards<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.369> let<00:01:32.579> that

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
all the innards of this and let that

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.700 
all the innards of this and let that
pulley<00:01:33.090> that's<00:01:33.540> driving<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.079> bunch<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.409> gears

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
pulley that's driving a bunch of gears

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.359 
pulley that's driving a bunch of gears
that<00:01:35.040> transfer<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.150> power<00:01:36.210> into<00:01:37.369> that

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
that transfer that power into that

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.760 
that transfer that power into that
patient<00:01:39.030> mode<00:01:39.180> or<00:01:39.689> spinning<00:01:40.290> mode<00:01:40.500> depending

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
patient mode or spinning mode depending

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.850 
patient mode or spinning mode depending
on<00:01:41.159> what<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.460> want<00:01:41.490> instead<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.710> so<00:01:43.710> this

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
on what you want instead of that so this

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.910 
on what you want instead of that so this
belt<00:01:44.130> runs<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> larger<00:01:45.750> pulley<00:01:45.960> which<00:01:46.710> is

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
belt runs to a larger pulley which is

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.620 
belt runs to a larger pulley which is
attached<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.610> fly<00:01:47.880> though<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.420> see

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
attached to a fly though that you see

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.289 
attached to a fly though that you see
right<00:01:48.780> here<00:01:49.170> which<00:01:49.799> stores<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.820> mechanical

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
right here which stores the mechanical

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.230 
right here which stores the mechanical
energy<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.960> you're<00:01:52.200> putting<00:01:52.850> out<00:01:53.850> through

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
energy that you're putting out through

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.719 
energy that you're putting out through
the<00:01:54.329> pedals<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.140> just<00:01:55.740> gives<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.130> smoother

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
the pedals and just gives you a smoother

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.730 
the pedals and just gives you a smoother
ride<00:01:56.969> otherwise<00:01:57.930> it's<00:01:58.200> going<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.409> be<00:01:58.469> very

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
ride otherwise it's going to be very

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.149 
ride otherwise it's going to be very
choppy<00:01:59.100> as<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.880> pedals<00:02:00.500> reach<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.829> point

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
choppy as the pedals reach this point

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.850 
choppy as the pedals reach this point
where<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.240> have<00:02:03.479> actually<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.439> have<00:02:04.649> no

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
where you have actually you have no

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.660 
where you have actually you have no
leverage<00:02:06.049> we<00:02:07.049> also<00:02:07.200> have<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.489> still

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
leverage we also have this this is still

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.300 
leverage we also have this this is still
capable<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:09.239> shifting<00:02:09.840> gears<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:10.979> can

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
capable of shifting gears so you can

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.440 
capable of shifting gears so you can
start<00:02:11.670> off<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.030> really

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
start off on a really

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.600 
start off on a really
easy<00:02:12.569> gear<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.140> then<00:02:13.260> work<00:02:13.830> your<00:02:13.860> way<00:02:14.160> up<00:02:14.190> once

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
easy gear and then work your way up once

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.440 
easy gear and then work your way up once
you<00:02:14.730> get<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.910> system<00:02:15.300> moving<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:15.840> also

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
you get the system moving and also

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.199 
you get the system moving and also
adapting<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:19.010> people's<00:02:20.010> different<00:02:20.790> athletic

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
adapting to people's different athletic

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.050 
adapting to people's different athletic
ability<00:02:21.599> isn't<00:02:21.720> able<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.080> do<00:02:22.319> this<00:02:22.849> so<00:02:23.849> let's

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
ability isn't able to do this so let's

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.479 
ability isn't able to do this so let's
go

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.589 

so<00:02:29.489> as<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.700> can<00:02:29.790> see<00:02:29.849> it's<00:02:30.150> pretty<00:02:30.330> it's

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
so as you can see it's pretty it's

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.979 
so as you can see it's pretty it's
pretty<00:02:30.660> easy<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.110> get<00:02:31.349> going<00:02:32.269> but<00:02:33.269> it's<00:02:33.690> not

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
pretty easy to get going but it's not

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.420 
pretty easy to get going but it's not
the<00:02:34.200> age<00:02:34.319> so<00:02:34.590> it's<00:02:34.739> not<00:02:34.860> going<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.099> be<00:02:35.190> doing

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
the age so it's not going to be doing

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:42.350 
the age so it's not going to be doing
anything<00:02:41.120> all<00:02:42.120> right

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
anything all right

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
anything all right
now<00:02:42.569> as<00:02:42.629> a<00:02:42.690> gauge<00:02:43.160> that<00:02:44.160> handle<00:02:45.200> engages<00:02:46.200> and

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
now as a gauge that handle engages and

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.559 
now as a gauge that handle engages and
disengages<00:02:46.410> you<00:02:46.950> supply<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.400> system<00:02:47.880> so

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
disengages you supply the system so

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.020 
disengages you supply the system so
there<00:02:49.140> we<00:02:49.260> go<00:02:49.819> here<00:02:50.819> this<00:02:50.940> like<00:02:51.150> Queen<00:02:51.569> Creek

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
there we go here this like Queen Creek

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:02.300 
there we go here this like Queen Creek
here<00:02:54.030> some<00:02:54.599> decades<00:02:55.819> keeps<00:03:01.010> going<00:03:02.010> higher<00:03:02.190> and

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
here some decades keeps going higher and

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:49.410 
here some decades keeps going higher and
lower<00:03:03.590> going<00:03:04.590> harder

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.580 

how<00:03:50.420> long<00:03:50.570> does<00:03:50.720> it<00:03:50.780> take<00:03:51.080> to<00:03:51.710> wash<00:03:51.890> clothes<00:03:52.670> so

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
how long does it take to wash clothes so
