00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
repainted since I didn't really care too

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.340 
repainted since I didn't really care too
much<00:00:20.010> for<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.460> way<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.840> Hasbro<00:00:21.840> version<00:00:21.900> came

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
much for the way the Hasbro version came

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.439 
much for the way the Hasbro version came
out<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.400> forgot<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.699> show<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:23.939> guys<00:00:24.029> how<00:00:24.300> it

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
out so I forgot to show you guys how it

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.029 
out so I forgot to show you guys how it
turned<00:00:24.660> out<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.080> see<00:00:25.650> what<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:25.859> thought

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
turned out and see what you thought

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.870 
turned out and see what you thought
about<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.869> it<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.349> exact<00:00:29.220> same<00:00:29.400> figure<00:00:29.609> as

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
about it it is the exact same figure as

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.990 
about it it is the exact same figure as
the<00:00:29.910> Hasbro<00:00:30.449> version<00:00:30.500> just<00:00:31.520> just<00:00:32.520> repainted

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
the Hasbro version just just repainted

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.280 
the Hasbro version just just repainted
so<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.300> retains<00:00:33.630> all<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.110> same

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
so it retains all of the same

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.139 
so it retains all of the same
articulation<00:00:34.790> however<00:00:35.790> minimal<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.540> and

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
articulation however minimal that is and

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.819 
articulation however minimal that is and
all<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.450> still<00:00:39.899> has<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.170> action<00:00:40.440> feature<00:00:40.620> as

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
all the still has the action feature as

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.790 
all the still has the action feature as
well<00:00:41.030> but<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.180> does<00:00:42.329> have<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.719> new<00:00:42.870> color

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
well but it does have the new color

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.729 
well but it does have the new color
scheme<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.700> match<00:00:44.820> better<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.390> movie

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
scheme the to match better to the movie

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.680 
scheme the to match better to the movie
as<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.800> can<00:00:47.070> see<00:00:47.280> it's<00:00:47.969> more<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.480> light

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
as you can see it's more of a light

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.060 
as you can see it's more of a light
green<00:00:50.539> instead<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.620> dark<00:00:52.860> version

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
green instead of the the dark version

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.490 
green instead of the the dark version
Hasbro<00:00:53.699> gave<00:00:53.940> us<00:00:54.120> would<00:00:54.989> like<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.320> almost

gray hairs on there's this one now as

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.580 
gray hairs on there's this one now as
the<00:00:59.160> dark<00:00:59.399> hair<00:00:59.609> like<00:00:59.730> it's<00:00:59.850> supposed<00:01:00.120> to

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
the dark hair like it's supposed to

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.810 
the dark hair like it's supposed to
instead<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.739> tan<00:01:01.980> pants<00:01:02.399> which<00:01:02.489> were<00:01:02.670> in

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
instead of the tan pants which were in

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.950 
instead of the tan pants which were in
the<00:01:03.049> concept<00:01:04.100> pieces<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.250> they<00:01:05.689> the<00:01:06.689> Marvel

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the concept pieces that they the Marvel

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.950 
the concept pieces that they the Marvel
Studios<00:01:07.229> showed<00:01:07.560> now<00:01:08.310> has<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.600> weathered

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
Studios showed now has the the weathered

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.460 
Studios showed now has the the weathered
blue<00:01:10.770> jeans<00:01:11.570> so<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:13.049> know<00:01:13.140> it's<00:01:13.290> basically

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
blue jeans so you know it's basically

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.560 
blue jeans so you know it's basically
the<00:01:13.710> same<00:01:13.830> figure<00:01:14.220> but<00:01:14.280> first<00:01:15.210> thing<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.390> like

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
the same figure but first thing I like

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.609 
the same figure but first thing I like
this<00:01:15.720> one<00:01:15.900> heck<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.229> lot<00:01:16.320> better<00:01:16.380> than

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
this one heck of a lot better than

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.380 
this one heck of a lot better than
Hasbro<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.250> just<00:01:17.460> because<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.939> colors<00:01:18.210> are

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
Hasbro is just because the colors are

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.330 
Hasbro is just because the colors are
more<00:01:18.509> accurate<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:19.110> what<00:01:19.350> how<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:19.979> looks<00:01:20.189> like

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
more accurate to what how it looks like

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.460 
more accurate to what how it looks like
in<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.580> film<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.630> figure<00:01:21.960> looks<00:01:22.170> okay<00:01:22.439> on

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
in the film this figure looks okay on

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.560 
in the film this figure looks okay on
the<00:01:22.650> Shelf<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.820> one<00:01:24.030> looks<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.270> lot<00:01:24.420> better

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
the Shelf this one looks a lot better

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.270 
the Shelf this one looks a lot better
with<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.900> team<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.350> little<00:01:25.590> bit<00:01:25.710> brighter<00:01:25.920> and

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
with the team a little bit brighter and

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.600 
with the team a little bit brighter and
it<00:01:26.729> has<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.060> classic<00:01:27.210> cult<00:01:27.720> look<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.610> with

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
it has that classic cult look to it with

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.060 
it has that classic cult look to it with
the<00:01:29.700> more<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.030> real<00:01:30.210> skin<00:01:30.540> looking<00:01:30.869> paint<00:01:31.860> on

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the more of a real skin looking paint on

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.510 
the more of a real skin looking paint on
instead<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.430> just<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.850> flat<00:01:33.119> dark<00:01:33.479> green<00:01:33.780> so

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
instead of just the flat dark green so

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.620 
instead of just the flat dark green so
it's<00:01:35.520> still<00:01:35.759> not<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.030> greatest<00:01:36.060> figure<00:01:36.570> in

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
it's still not the greatest figure in

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.499 
it's still not the greatest figure in
the<00:01:36.720> world<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.490> detail<00:01:38.850> on<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.060> makes<00:01:39.420> me

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
the world the the detail on it makes me

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.120 
the world the the detail on it makes me
what<00:01:39.630> kind<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.869> flabby<00:01:40.140> instead<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.650> muscular

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
what kind of flabby instead of muscular

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.950 
what kind of flabby instead of muscular
but<00:01:41.460> at<00:01:41.970> least<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.270> looks<00:01:42.299> better<00:01:42.600> than<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.899> did

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
but at least it looks better than it did

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.920 
but at least it looks better than it did
before<00:01:43.670> so<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.700> feel<00:01:45.119> free<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.360> share<00:01:45.600> any<00:01:45.840> of
