00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.300
 Effect is ground vortex 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.120
 the silver is a final one 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.320
 Creglingen 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:45.570
 Here you can see that cellar warning sign 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:47.719

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.300

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.990

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:13.670
 Of course the bam number is the 1,125 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:16.920
 and brother weight 22 44 gang and the 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.060
 m86 1 gram so the three pieces 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.530

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.530
 and here are instructions for use 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:38.159
 There is nothing more to say then per 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:42.360
 logged in and see us so see 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:46.460
 the out of here is the effect so the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:51.540
 ground vortex is made of plastic the cover 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:55.950
 here then green visco and here the 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.840
 Dome here is the biggest effect more 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.810
 There is not much to say and have fun 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.119

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.119
 now the basement ufos 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.940
 very loud crunchy after ignition 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.670
 I can assure you in any case 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.150
 that the ufos are worth their price 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.330
 because the ground swirls the silver of the 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.569
 very nice and they turn well too 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.750
 out now does not like a good level 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:40.920
 but otherwise very much in any case 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:45.540
 nice and eske reckling in the end is very 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.579
 loud and buy you in any case 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.090
 and I can only recommend it 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:54.180
 yes that was it and then it went to see 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.810
 thumbs up would be very nice and off and on 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.379
 Of course, then until the next 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.379
