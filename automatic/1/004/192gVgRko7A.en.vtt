riding pants on my legs which I love and

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.370 
riding pants on my legs which I love and
we<00:07:16.980> highly<00:07:17.340> recommend<00:07:17.370> just<00:07:18.140> because<00:07:19.140> I

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:19.380 
we highly recommend just because I

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.550 
we highly recommend just because I
usually<00:07:19.830> get<00:07:19.980> asked<00:07:21.020> they<00:07:22.020> are<00:07:22.170> in<00:07:22.380> the

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 
usually get asked they are in the

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.410 
usually get asked they are in the
smallest<00:07:22.980> size<00:07:23.310> I<00:07:23.340> think<00:07:23.730> that's<00:07:23.880> an<00:07:24.000> extra

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:24.420 
smallest size I think that's an extra

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.930 
smallest size I think that's an extra
small<00:07:24.780> and<00:07:25.050> I<00:07:25.680> definitely<00:07:25.860> want<00:07:26.400> to<00:07:26.490> buy<00:07:26.700> some

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:26.940 
small and I definitely want to buy some

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.150 
small and I definitely want to buy some
more<00:07:27.120> at<00:07:27.240> some<00:07:27.420> point<00:07:27.660> but<00:07:27.780> they<00:07:27.930> are<00:07:28.160> quite

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.160 
more at some point but they are quite

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.420 
more at some point but they are quite
expensive<00:07:29.810> so<00:07:30.810> I<00:07:31.530> don't<00:07:32.040> think<00:07:32.160> that<00:07:32.310> will<00:07:32.400> be

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:32.430 
expensive so I don't think that will be

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.790 
expensive so I don't think that will be
for<00:07:33.270> a<00:07:33.330> while<00:07:33.540> and<00:07:33.840> then<00:07:34.020> I've<00:07:34.140> got<00:07:34.290> my<00:07:34.320> a<00:07:34.530> Swiss
