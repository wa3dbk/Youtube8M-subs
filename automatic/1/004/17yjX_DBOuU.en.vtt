00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
which is way off for me I read that I

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.220 
which is way off for me I read that I

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
all know the fusion has nowhere near

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.370 
all know the fusion has nowhere near
that<00:02:39.920> but<00:02:40.920> if<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:41.940> have<00:02:41.970> any<00:02:42.360> wheel<00:02:42.630> spin<00:02:42.959> it

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
that but if you have any wheel spin it

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.810 
that but if you have any wheel spin it
up<00:02:43.590> throughout<00:02:43.829> the<00:02:44.010> reading<00:02:44.310> which<00:02:44.489> this

I<00:02:46.450> don't<00:02:47.450> know<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:47.810> can<00:02:48.080> never<00:02:48.230> take<00:02:48.710> off

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
I don't know I can never take off

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.680 
I don't know I can never take off
without<00:02:49.100> spinning<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.670> wheels<00:02:49.880> come<00:02:50.390> off<00:02:50.510> the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
without spinning the wheels come off the

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.120 
without spinning the wheels come off the
hole<00:02:50.840> so<00:02:51.140> it's<00:02:51.290> really<00:02:51.530> hard<00:02:51.680> to<00:02:51.830> get<00:02:51.980> that

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
hole so it's really hard to get that

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.160 
hole so it's really hard to get that
down<00:02:53.440> 0-60<00:02:54.440> which<00:02:54.590> is<00:02:54.740> real<00:02:54.950> cool<00:02:56.170> and

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
down 0-60 which is real cool and

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.140 
down 0-60 which is real cool and
quarter-mile<00:02:58.070> which<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.400> never<00:02:58.460> tried<00:02:58.910> yet

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
quarter-mile which I never tried yet

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.580 
quarter-mile which I never tried yet
because<00:02:59.450> I<00:02:59.600> can't<00:02:59.840> find<00:03:00.050> out<00:03:00.290> long<00:03:00.440> enough

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
because I can't find out long enough

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.710 
because I can't find out long enough
stretch<00:03:00.980> of<00:03:01.130> road<00:03:01.310> to<00:03:01.490> try<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:01.790> without

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
stretch of road to try it without

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.500 
stretch of road to try it without
getting<00:03:02.990> a<00:03:03.170> ticket

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
getting a ticket

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.890 
getting a ticket
so<00:03:05.510> that's<00:03:06.050> CCS<00:03:06.650> CT<00:03:07.100> liveWires<00:03:07.610> real<00:03:08.030> really

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
so that's CCS CT liveWires real really

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.720 
so that's CCS CT liveWires real really
really<00:03:09.170> good<00:03:09.380> tuner<00:03:11.320> computer<00:03:12.320> or<00:03:12.410> whatever

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.880 

all<00:03:16.730> right
