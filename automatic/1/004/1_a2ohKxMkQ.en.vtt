right after the festival I thought about
it<00:02:55.709> obviously<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:56.250> little<00:02:56.370> bit<00:02:56.579> before<00:02:56.730> but

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
it obviously a little bit before but

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.990 
it obviously a little bit before but
right<00:02:57.750> off<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.989> game<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.890> realized<00:02:59.459> that<00:02:59.640> my

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000
