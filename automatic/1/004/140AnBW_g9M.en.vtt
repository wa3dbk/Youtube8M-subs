00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.300
Hello Technic fans!

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.060
Today we will review new Technic set of 2015

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.660
set 42037 Formula Off-roader

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.980
Original name "Formula Off-roader"

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.880
is the name of off-road competition

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.580
We dont know much about this challeng in Russia, thats strange, since Russia is off / bad/ no road country

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.940
This challenge is very popular in Iceland and scandinavian countries

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.700
The main target is to climb on hill covered with sand or volcanic dust

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.980
Huge power, light weight and grippy tires with sand "diggers"

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.820
help this cars to accelerate to 100 km/h for 3 seconds and maximum speed 160 km/h

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.680
Back to LEGO set

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.160
Main model have 4 functions

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.580
1.Independent suspension on 4 wheels

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.180
2. inline 4-cylinder  engine connected to rear axle

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.800
3. steering system with control on roof (HOG)

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.480
4. Opening cockpit

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.920
Alternative model is some kind of Hot-rod

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.520
woth some similar to main model elements

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.740
instruction for B-model is in the BOX, no need to download

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.300
Set consist of 494 parts

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.200
some platics bags, 2 instructions and  sticker sheet

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.880
Let's stop on the most useful and interesting parts

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.240
The biggest parts are 4 ballon tires with offroad pattern with diameter 81 mm

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.340
These new lime rims will be good for trophy trucks, crawlers or drift car models.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.960
4x 6.5L hard shock absorbers, that can be used in different kind of vehicles

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.440
that can be used for heavy models, hard supercar suspension and for soft long travelling suspension

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:52.420
MUST-HAVE suspension arms that are useful not only for supercars, but also mid-scale models

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.080
Short 7L gear rack is useful for steering and 2x 6L ball-joint links for steer and suspension

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.500
MUST-HAVE wheel hubs for steered/non-steered axles

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.860
and this for steered axle

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.440
For driving wheels hubs, I have just mentioned, you need this CV joints

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.480
these quantity is enough for driving only one axle

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.360
In the age of Turbo engines 4 cylinders are enough to build every type of car: sport, SUV and civil types

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.740
1x differential

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.120
steering wheel that is far better for planes, not for cars

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.000
very small quantity of gears that is enough only for driving 1 axle and steering system

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.440
liftarm frames are always useful for reinforcing, building axles and other hard-loaded elements

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.980
New color light-blue 3x11 curved technic panels

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.520
and lime 3x7 curved, wheel arch technic panels 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.740
...are not enough to build completed car body

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.580
These 16x thin 6L liftarms are used as rear-axle suspension arms

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.400
Here are all thick liftarms of set...

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.560
Almost all ot them are used in the chassis. And some for rollcage and driver's seat

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.200
Looking at the partlist, I can clearly see that this is very nice RESOURCE set

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.340
You should buy it if you need parts for building chassis with suspension and engine. 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:08.100
Base for every car, no matter civil or sport, track or offroad...

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.780
nothing useless... for its price

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.200
Building starts from front axle 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.220
No driving shafts here, only steering...

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.700
Suspension is soft with long travel

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.180
Then we connect inline 4 cylinder engine to front axle

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.360
Rear axle with differential and driving shafts

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.320
Rear suspenison arms are form 6L thin liftarms, 16pcs

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.220
travelling is much limited comparing with front axle

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.100
you can see the difference between front (left) and rear (right)

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.580
Here is completed chassis

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.940
here is how RWD transmisson works

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.580
camshaft

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.060
Steering system

00:04:15.557 --> 00:04:19.637
Everything works well here 

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.620
As I said before, almost all parts are used for chassis

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.220
and the rest for exterior

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:37.160
Don't drop used sticker sheet, you can use it for  stickering mirrors (usually 2x2 tiles)

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.820
Nothing else to say about functions...

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.240
Model is comfort for playing: easy driving and steering

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.880
Suspension and engine are functional

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.780
Suspension is very strong, I can't destroy it

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.520
But only destroyed other design elements

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.500
Opening cockpit, but in reality it should be dead-closed, as it is safe cage...

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.740
Small and strange steering "wheel"

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.700
Big "Sparco"-style sport seat

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.240
Stickers complete sport look

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.940
Interesting sponsors, especially "Stinkwell exhausts"

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.380
65 - is it a designer's year of birth?

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:45.080
"Fast climb" - this is climbing vehicle, now I am 100% sure!

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.240
Extra details: lights, and 4 exhaust pipes

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:59.320
Long travelling front and short limited back...

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.620
So let's make conclusion...

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.100
this set is a good buy for auto builders

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.080
Here you can find everything for on/off road chassis with suspension and engine

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.880
One more interesting fact...

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.620
This model is very similar to 42029 red customized pickup truck from 2h 2014

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.440
they have common construction of suspension, drivetrain and steering system

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.260
and even the same size of wheels

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.880
42037 is simplyfied 42029

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.240
difference is in big amount of panels and litarms that was used in 42029 for body

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.880
42037 is a good present for kid

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:43.740
because he can easily play with car (comparing to 42038 Arctic truck which is hard to play)

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.180
Set with best usefulness/ price rate in 2015

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.100
Recommended buy!

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.000
