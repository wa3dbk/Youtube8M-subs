00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
so right now on screen I have all of the

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.830 
so right now on screen I have all of the
crafting<00:01:30.100> recipes<00:01:30.460> flashing<00:01:31.000> I<00:01:31.180> think<00:01:31.780> it

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
crafting recipes flashing I think it

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.149 
crafting recipes flashing I think it
like<00:01:31.960> the<00:01:32.049> top<00:01:32.229> left<00:01:32.470> or<00:01:32.590> right<00:01:32.740> hand<00:01:32.920> corner

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
like the top left or right hand corner

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.039 
like the top left or right hand corner
of<00:01:33.189> the<00:01:33.310> screen<00:01:33.400> and<00:01:34.270> essentially<00:01:34.810> all<00:01:34.900> you

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
of the screen and essentially all you

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.210 
of the screen and essentially all you
have<00:01:35.140> to<00:01:35.229> do<00:01:35.320> is<00:01:35.439> just<00:01:35.619> switch<00:01:35.710> out<00:01:35.890> different

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
have to do is just switch out different

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.270 
have to do is just switch out different
dyes<00:01:36.490> dyes<00:01:36.840> for<00:01:37.840> different<00:01:38.770> colors<00:01:39.040> and

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
dyes dyes for different colors and

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.469 
dyes dyes for different colors and
that's<00:01:39.580> pretty<00:01:39.759> much<00:01:39.850> how<00:01:40.030> it<00:01:40.060> works<00:01:40.270> the

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
that's pretty much how it works the

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.120 
that's pretty much how it works the
crafting<00:01:41.049> recipe<00:01:41.350> though<00:01:41.470> is<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.710> same<00:01:41.920> for

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
crafting recipe though is the same for

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
umbrella now I do actually kind of wish

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.070 
umbrella now I do actually kind of wish
that<00:02:30.640> there<00:02:30.790> was<00:02:30.849> a<00:02:30.910> little

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
that there was a little

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.490 
that there was a little
like<00:02:32.290> timer<00:02:32.620> that<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:33.010> guys<00:02:33.190> could<00:02:34.200> have<00:02:35.200> the

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
like timer that you guys could have the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.410 
like timer that you guys could have the
ability<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.010> run<00:02:36.430> out<00:02:36.670> with<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.150> actual

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
ability to run out with the actual

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.460 
ability to run out with the actual
umbrella<00:02:37.720> Lux<00:02:37.840> I<00:02:37.930> think<00:02:38.080> it's<00:02:38.200> kind<00:02:38.380> of<00:02:38.410> a

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
umbrella Lux I think it's kind of a

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.050 
umbrella Lux I think it's kind of a
little<00:02:38.590> bit<00:02:38.770> overpowered<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.610> just<00:02:39.760> have<00:02:39.910> it

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
little bit overpowered to just have it

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.480 
little bit overpowered to just have it
go<00:02:40.180> on<00:02:40.330> forever<00:02:40.570> so<00:02:41.380> maybe<00:02:41.620> if<00:02:41.890> like<00:02:42.130> maybe<00:02:42.370> you

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
go on forever so maybe if like maybe you

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.040 
go on forever so maybe if like maybe you
can<00:02:42.610> only<00:02:42.700> be<00:02:42.850> in<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.030> air<00:02:43.180> for<00:02:43.210> ten<00:02:43.660> seconds

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
can only be in the air for ten seconds

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.840 
can only be in the air for ten seconds
with<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.320> umbrella<00:02:44.620> or<00:02:45.040> maybe<00:02:45.190> five<00:02:45.460> seconds

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
with the umbrella or maybe five seconds

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.310 
with the umbrella or maybe five seconds
and<00:02:45.970> make<00:02:46.030> it<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.240> little<00:02:46.390> bit<00:02:46.540> more<00:02:46.720> kind<00:02:47.260> of

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
and make it a little bit more kind of

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.110 
and make it a little bit more kind of
practical<00:02:47.980> because<00:02:48.340> at<00:02:48.610> this<00:02:48.700> point<00:02:48.910> right

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
practical because at this point right

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.880 
practical because at this point right
now<00:02:49.240> you<00:02:49.300> guys<00:02:49.540> can<00:02:49.750> just<00:02:49.810> use<00:02:49.990> it<00:02:50.110> for<00:02:50.140> as<00:02:50.560> long

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
now you guys can just use it for as long

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.230 
now you guys can just use it for as long
as<00:02:51.190> you<00:02:51.310> want<00:02:51.520> and<00:02:51.580> I<00:02:51.640> think<00:02:51.820> that<00:02:51.940> can<00:02:52.030> get<00:02:52.210> a

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
as you want and I think that can get a

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.080 
as you want and I think that can get a
little<00:02:52.690> bit<00:02:53.370> overpowered<00:02:54.370> but<00:02:54.580> nevertheless

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
little bit overpowered but nevertheless

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.460 
little bit overpowered but nevertheless
I<00:02:55.360> still<00:02:55.390> still<00:02:55.690> do<00:02:55.780> you<00:02:56.020> think<00:02:56.200> it's<00:02:56.290> kind<00:02:56.440> of

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
I still still do you think it's kind of

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.470 
I still still do you think it's kind of
cool<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:57.220> also<00:02:57.460> there<00:02:57.760> is<00:02:57.790> another<00:02:57.910> use<00:02:58.450> for

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
cool and also there is another use for

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.600 
cool and also there is another use for
it<00:02:58.780> say<00:02:59.350> you<00:02:59.410> guys<00:02:59.620> are<00:02:59.800> kind<00:03:00.070> of<00:03:00.130> in<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.370> little

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
it say you guys are kind of in a little

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.870 
it say you guys are kind of in a little
bit<00:03:00.790> of<00:03:00.940> a<00:03:01.030> spot<00:03:01.960> where<00:03:02.170> it's<00:03:02.520> maybe<00:03:03.520> like<00:03:03.700> two

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
bit of a spot where it's maybe like two

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.220 
bit of a spot where it's maybe like two
or<00:03:04.000> three<00:03:04.030> blocks<00:03:04.390> high<00:03:04.570> and<00:03:04.720> you<00:03:04.780> can't<00:03:05.020> just

installing the mod so does watch out for
that<00:04:35.350> so<00:04:35.890> I<00:04:35.919> think<00:04:36.010> that's<00:04:36.130> a<00:04:36.280> pretty<00:04:36.430> big

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
that so I think that's a pretty big

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.400 
that so I think that's a pretty big
problem<00:04:36.970> but<00:04:37.150> that's<00:04:37.690> really<00:04:37.870> the<00:04:37.990> only<00:04:38.230> bug

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
problem but that's really the only bug

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.870 
problem but that's really the only bug
there<00:04:38.590> is<00:04:38.710> and<00:04:38.890> the<00:04:38.950> moderator<00:04:39.400> is<00:04:39.520> well<00:04:39.669> aware
