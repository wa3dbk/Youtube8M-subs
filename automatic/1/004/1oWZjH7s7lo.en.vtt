out here's life to the suzuki hayabusa
but<00:00:11.639> this<00:00:11.880> one's<00:00:12.179> been<00:00:12.480> heavily<00:00:12.780> modded

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.170 

this<00:00:31.490> is<00:00:31.670> still<00:00:32.000> the<00:00:32.450> 2010<00:00:33.140> suzuki<00:00:33.530> hayabusa

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
this is still the 2010 suzuki hayabusa

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.270 
this is still the 2010 suzuki hayabusa
with<00:00:35.180> the<00:00:35.270> cubic<00:00:35.600> capacity<00:00:35.750> of<00:00:36.200> 3040<00:00:36.800> it<00:00:37.010> looks

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
with the cubic capacity of 3040 it looks

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.549 
with the cubic capacity of 3040 it looks
nothing<00:00:37.760> like<00:00:37.970> a<00:00:38.090> stock<00:00:38.360> booster<00:00:38.750> but<00:00:38.960> this<00:00:39.440> is

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
nothing like a stock booster but this is

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:46.760 
nothing like a stock booster but this is
how<00:00:39.650> it<00:00:39.770> is<00:00:39.800> right<00:00:40.040> now

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
I purchased the bike in 2010 itself of

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.240 
I purchased the bike in 2010 itself of
course<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.360> was<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.540> stock<00:00:51.840> bike<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.710> black<00:00:52.980> and

the red graphics which are there on it
and<00:00:56.000> subsequently<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.090> enjoy<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.600> bike<00:00:57.780> for

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
and subsequently I enjoy the bike for

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.930 
and subsequently I enjoy the bike for
quite<00:00:58.170> some<00:00:58.380> time<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.800> course<00:00:58.980> our<00:00:59.220> kind<00:00:59.820> of

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
quite some time of course our kind of

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.880 
quite some time of course our kind of
try<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.480> make<00:01:00.720> myself<00:01:00.900> a<00:01:01.290> little<00:01:01.320> bit<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
try to make myself a little bit in the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.250 
try to make myself a little bit in the
acquaintance<00:01:02.310> with<00:01:02.490> the<00:01:02.670> brony<00:01:03.630> talk<00:01:03.930> what<00:01:04.140> it

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
acquaintance with the brony talk what it

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.910 
acquaintance with the brony talk what it
had<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.790> as<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:06.030> when<00:01:06.300> time<00:01:07.020> went<00:01:07.260> by<00:01:07.410> at<00:01:07.650> fan

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
had and as on when time went by at fan

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.470 
had and as on when time went by at fan
made<00:01:08.190> myself<00:01:08.550> more<00:01:08.670> familiar<00:01:09.030> with<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> bike

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
made myself more familiar with the bike

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.020 
made myself more familiar with the bike
and<00:01:09.750> then<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.650> entire<00:01:10.980> evolution<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.880> the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
and then the entire evolution of the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.450 
and then the entire evolution of the
modifications<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.870> it<00:01:15.650> got<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.770> Kara<00:01:17.100> Soria

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
modifications of it got the Kara Soria

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.270 
modifications of it got the Kara Soria
fog<00:01:17.760> wheels<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.360> got<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.050> car<00:01:19.229> Soria<00:01:19.560> for<00:01:19.830> deals

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
fog wheels I got the car Soria for deals

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.160 
fog wheels I got the car Soria for deals
this<00:01:20.700> basically<00:01:21.090> kind<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.510> reduced<00:01:21.900> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
this basically kind of reduced the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.650 
this basically kind of reduced the
entire<00:01:22.470> beat<00:01:23.190> of<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.640> existing<00:01:24.090> vehicle<00:01:24.510> I

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
entire beat of the existing vehicle I

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.500 
entire beat of the existing vehicle I
think<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.619> stock<00:01:25.860> wheels<00:01:26.100> were<00:01:26.460> around<00:01:26.910> say

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
think the stock wheels were around say

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.270 
think the stock wheels were around say
more<00:01:28.110> than<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.290> couple<00:01:28.440> of<00:01:28.590> pounds<00:01:28.950> which<00:01:29.100> were

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
more than a couple of pounds which were

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.310 
more than a couple of pounds which were
heavier<00:01:29.640> than<00:01:30.090> these<00:01:30.330> beans<00:01:30.600> then<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.050> got<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
heavier than these beans then I got the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.010 
heavier than these beans then I got the
gal<00:01:31.500> for<00:01:31.710> carbon<00:01:32.070> compressed<00:01:32.640> rotors<00:01:33.150> now

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
gal for carbon compressed rotors now

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.630 
gal for carbon compressed rotors now
these<00:01:34.200> are<00:01:34.350> single<00:01:34.500> rotors<00:01:34.950> at<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.220> rear<00:01:35.400> they

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
these are single rotors at the rear they

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.219 
these are single rotors at the rear they
are<00:01:35.760> dual<00:01:36.060> rotors<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.869> head

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
are dual rotors in a head

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.969 
are dual rotors in a head
I<00:01:37.260> got<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.460> hot<00:01:39.450> body<00:01:39.750> exhaust<00:01:40.350> which

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
I got the hot body exhaust which

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.500 
I got the hot body exhaust which
obviously<00:01:41.340> does<00:01:41.640> not<00:01:41.670> give<00:01:41.970> me<00:01:42.090> as<00:01:42.240> much<00:01:42.479> as

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
obviously does not give me as much as

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.380 
obviously does not give me as much as
the<00:01:43.140> output<00:01:43.619> what<00:01:44.130> my<00:01:44.250> HMF<00:01:44.670> going<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.060> do<00:01:45.180> into

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the output what my HMF going to do into

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.840 
the output what my HMF going to do into
one<00:01:45.540> used<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.810> give<00:01:46.020> but<00:01:46.830> this<00:01:47.010> still<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.670> makes

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
one used to give but this still it makes

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.090 
one used to give but this still it makes
it<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.330> bike<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.570> little<00:01:48.960> bit<00:01:49.110> lighter<00:01:49.619> of

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
it the bike a little bit lighter of

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.160 
it the bike a little bit lighter of
course<00:01:50.580> I<00:01:50.640> got<00:01:50.789> the<00:01:50.850> adjustable<00:01:51.179> rear<00:01:51.840> sets

quick<00:02:17.580> shift<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:18.450> is<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.720> quick<00:02:18.930> shift

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
quick shift this is the quick shift

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.030 
quick shift this is the quick shift
which<00:02:19.290> gives<00:02:19.590> me<00:02:19.740> clutchless<00:02:20.700> shifting<00:02:21.660> and

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
which gives me clutchless shifting and

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.010 
which gives me clutchless shifting and
you<00:02:23.040> have<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.340> LCD<00:02:23.790> monitor<00:02:24.150> which<00:02:24.870> will

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
you have the LCD monitor which will

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.000 
you have the LCD monitor which will
basically<00:02:25.200> give<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.760> mappings<00:02:28.010> there

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
basically give you the mappings there

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.110 
basically give you the mappings there
are<00:02:29.069> different<00:02:29.370> mappings<00:02:29.700> what<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:29.940> could

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
are different mappings what you could

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.540 
are different mappings what you could
use<00:02:30.690> on<00:02:30.960> this<00:02:31.110> vehicle<00:02:31.410> with<00:02:31.920> respect<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.400> the

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
use on this vehicle with respect to the

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.850 
use on this vehicle with respect to the
exhaust<00:02:33.090> what<00:02:33.270> you<00:02:33.390> are<00:02:33.450> using<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.710> could

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
exhaust what you are using and you could

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.380 
exhaust what you are using and you could
store<00:02:35.069> these<00:02:35.280> mappings<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:35.819> see<00:02:35.940> what<00:02:36.150> suits

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
store these mappings and see what suits

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.150 
store these mappings and see what suits
you<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.690> best

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
you the best

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.930 
you the best
I<00:02:39.560> think<00:02:40.560> it's<00:02:40.680> it's<00:02:40.920> also<00:02:41.160> in<00:02:41.460> terms<00:02:41.760> of

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
I think it's it's also in terms of

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.300 
I think it's it's also in terms of
personal<00:02:42.720> perspective<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.500> want<00:02:43.800> to<00:02:43.920> kind<00:02:44.100> of

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
personal perspective you want to kind of

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.450 
personal perspective you want to kind of
have<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:45.030> best<00:02:45.240> in<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.870> market<00:02:46.020> in<00:02:46.460> already

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
have the best in the market in already

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.250 
have the best in the market in already
which<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.730> there<00:02:48.090> on<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.420> stock<00:02:48.660> bike<00:02:48.870> itself

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
which is there on the stock bike itself

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.770 
which is there on the stock bike itself
and<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:49.950> think<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.490> added<00:02:50.970> performance<00:02:51.150> parts

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
and I think the added performance parts

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.620 
and I think the added performance parts
also<00:02:52.050> kind<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:53.040> helps<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.550> to<00:02:53.730> break<00:02:54.060> down<00:02:54.270> the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
also kind of helps you to break down the

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.800 
also kind of helps you to break down the
gap<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.700> maybe<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:56.970> know<00:02:57.120> trying<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.600> cover

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
gap of maybe you know trying to cover

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.320 
gap of maybe you know trying to cover
that<00:02:58.050> margin<00:02:58.890> of<00:02:58.980> error<00:02:59.280> which<00:02:59.520> we<00:02:59.700> the<00:03:00.120> rider

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
that margin of error which we the rider

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.020 
that margin of error which we the rider
has<00:03:00.600> so<00:03:01.470> say<00:03:01.890> for<00:03:01.920> instance<00:03:02.220> you<00:03:02.730> talk<00:03:02.910> about

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
has so say for instance you talk about

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.990 
has so say for instance you talk about
braking<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:03.690> talk<00:03:04.080> about<00:03:04.260> your<00:03:05.130> entire<00:03:05.400> fuel

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
braking you talk about your entire fuel

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.990 
braking you talk about your entire fuel
injection<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:07.410> make<00:03:07.770> it<00:03:07.950> much<00:03:08.370> more<00:03:08.520> faster

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
injection to make it much more faster

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.520 
injection to make it much more faster
maybe<00:03:09.210> you<00:03:09.390> want<00:03:09.600> our<00:03:09.720> top-end<00:03:09.960> speed<00:03:10.170> which

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
maybe you want our top-end speed which

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.430 
maybe you want our top-end speed which
is<00:03:10.650> much<00:03:10.830> more<00:03:11.040> higher<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.610> had<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.270> earlier<00:03:12.600> go

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
is much more higher I had the earlier go

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.320 
is much more higher I had the earlier go
into<00:03:13.650> two<00:03:13.740> into<00:03:13.980> one<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.310> HMS<00:03:14.760> exhaust<00:03:15.150> which

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
into two into one the HMS exhaust which

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.030 
into two into one the HMS exhaust which
gave<00:03:15.510> me<00:03:15.630> a<00:03:15.660> top-end<00:03:15.900> speed<00:03:16.140> but<00:03:16.620> then<00:03:16.770> it<00:03:16.890> was

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
gave me a top-end speed but then it was

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.220 
gave me a top-end speed but then it was
more<00:03:17.280> not<00:03:17.760> in<00:03:17.940> terms<00:03:18.120> of<00:03:18.300> how<00:03:18.450> fast<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:18.930> can<00:03:19.050> go

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
more not in terms of how fast you can go

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.560 
more not in terms of how fast you can go
at<00:03:19.380> what<00:03:19.560> terms<00:03:19.800> and<00:03:20.040> in<00:03:20.130> agility<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:20.940> can

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
at what terms and in agility you can

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.170 
at what terms and in agility you can
improvise<00:03:21.930> as<00:03:22.110> much<00:03:22.320> as<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.530> want<00:03:22.970> it's<00:03:23.970> never

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
improvise as much as you want it's never

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.240 
improvise as much as you want it's never
an<00:03:24.330> end<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.660> it<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:25.320> it's<00:03:25.470> more<00:03:25.650> in<00:03:25.830> terms<00:03:26.070> of

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
an end to it so it's more in terms of

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.120 
an end to it so it's more in terms of
not<00:03:26.550> how<00:03:26.820> fast<00:03:27.270> you<00:03:27.480> can<00:03:27.660> go<00:03:27.840> but<00:03:28.410> how<00:03:28.830> well<00:03:29.040> you

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
not how fast you can go but how well you

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.010 
not how fast you can go but how well you
can<00:03:29.250> also<00:03:29.430> manually<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:30.060> bike<00:03:30.360> which<00:03:30.990> is

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
can also manually the bike which is

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.960 
can also manually the bike which is
Hayabusa<00:03:31.710> known<00:03:32.010> for<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.340> straight-line<00:03:32.790> speed

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
Hayabusa known for a straight-line speed

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.060 
Hayabusa known for a straight-line speed
so<00:03:33.660> you<00:03:33.750> want<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:34.020> make<00:03:34.140> it<00:03:34.320> more<00:03:34.860> of

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
so you want to make it more of

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:42.650 
so you want to make it more of
compatible<00:03:36.030> with<00:03:36.210> everything<00:03:36.630> a<00:03:41.480> normal<00:03:42.480> day

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
compatible with everything a normal day

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.320 
compatible with everything a normal day
would<00:03:43.080> be<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:44.130> can<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.490> can<00:03:44.640> start<00:03:44.880> off<00:03:45.120> with

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
would be you can you can start off with

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.460 
would be you can you can start off with
going<00:03:45.510> for<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:45.810> quick<00:03:46.050> spin

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
going for a quick spin

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.320 
going for a quick spin
of<00:03:46.530> course<00:03:47.190> you<00:03:47.340> kind<00:03:47.640> of<00:03:47.760> check<00:03:48.000> with<00:03:48.180> the

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
of course you kind of check with the

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.750 
of course you kind of check with the
tire<00:03:48.630> pressures<00:03:49.080> you<00:03:49.290> want<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:49.590> kind<00:03:50.280> of<00:03:50.430> flown

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
tire pressures you want to kind of flown

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.280 
tire pressures you want to kind of flown

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
each time you sit on the bike so you

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.960 
each time you sit on the bike so you
kind<00:03:52.770> of<00:03:52.860> go<00:03:53.010> for<00:03:53.190> a<00:03:53.220> short<00:03:53.459> spin<00:03:53.670> and<00:03:53.820> see

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
kind of go for a short spin and see
