well<00:00:00.480> I<00:00:00.510> realized<00:00:01.020> the<00:00:01.170> other<00:00:01.199> day<00:00:01.380> I<00:00:01.530> haven't

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
well I realized the other day I haven't

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.560 
well I realized the other day I haven't
done<00:00:02.100> one<00:00:02.220> of<00:00:02.250> these<00:00:02.399> gas<00:00:02.639> masks<00:00:02.909> test<00:00:03.210> videos

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
done one of these gas masks test videos

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.720 
done one of these gas masks test videos
in<00:00:03.750> a<00:00:03.810> while<00:00:03.959> so<00:00:04.740> if<00:00:04.799> what<00:00:04.950> we<00:00:05.040> do<00:00:05.160> need<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.370> stem

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
in a while so if what we do need a stem

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.909 
in a while so if what we do need a stem
and<00:00:06.120> this<00:00:06.600> is<00:00:06.750> not<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.109> original<00:00:07.200> filter<00:00:07.830> on

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
and this is not the original filter on

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.860 
and this is not the original filter on
it<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.370> original<00:00:08.580> has<00:00:08.849> ten<00:00:09.120> filters<00:00:09.570> I've<00:00:09.690> got

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
it the original has ten filters I've got

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.770 
it the original has ten filters I've got
of<00:00:09.960> all<00:00:10.080> expired<00:00:10.880> so<00:00:11.880> this<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.420> just<00:00:12.660> a

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
of all expired so this is just a

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.890 
of all expired so this is just a
standard<00:00:13.019> green<00:00:13.500> olive<00:00:13.830> NATO<00:00:14.190> filter<00:00:14.900> normal

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
standard green olive NATO filter normal

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.109 
standard green olive NATO filter normal
NBC<00:00:16.379> type<00:00:16.590> filter<00:00:17.130> so<00:00:17.279> do<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.580> exact<00:00:17.850> same<00:00:17.880> job

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
NBC type filter so do the exact same job

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.849 
NBC type filter so do the exact same job
and<00:00:18.600> because<00:00:18.990> obviously<00:00:19.140> this<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.529> 40

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
and because obviously this is a 40

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.439 
and because obviously this is a 40
millimeter<00:00:20.010> mask<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.670> can<00:00:20.789> put<00:00:20.970> any<00:00:21.119> filter

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
millimeter mask you can put any filter

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.500 
millimeter mask you can put any filter
on<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.779> fits<00:00:22.220> so<00:00:23.220> we<00:00:23.850> got<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.090> test<00:00:24.269> this

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
on it the fits so we got to test this

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.890 
on it the fits so we got to test this
and<00:00:25.250> this<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.369> my<00:00:26.519> more<00:00:26.699> modernist<00:00:27.150> 10<00:00:27.390> it's

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
and this is my more modernist 10 it's

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.720 
and this is my more modernist 10 it's
one<00:00:28.140> that's<00:00:28.320> still<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:29.010> know<00:00:29.130> impractical

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
one that's still you know impractical

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.310 
one that's still you know impractical
NBC's<00:00:30.179> shelf<00:00:30.449> life<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.779> think<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.019> master

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
NBC's shelf life I think the master

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.749 
NBC's shelf life I think the master
certainly<00:00:31.619> about<00:00:31.769> five<00:00:32.099> years<00:00:32.279> old<00:00:32.520> or

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
certainly about five years old or

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.209 
certainly about five years old or
something<00:00:33.079> so<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.410> mask<00:00:34.590> itself<00:00:34.950> should<00:00:35.160> be

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
something so the mask itself should be

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.310 
something so the mask itself should be
fine<00:00:35.430> but<00:00:36.270> don't<00:00:36.510> know<00:00:36.690> about<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.960> filter

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
fine but don't know about the filter

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.229 
fine but don't know about the filter
that<00:00:37.890> obviously<00:00:38.399> lots<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.700> people<00:00:38.969> like<00:00:39.120> this

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
that obviously lots of people like this

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.720 
that obviously lots of people like this
mask<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.140> let's<00:00:40.620> test<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.250> see<00:00:41.340> how<00:00:41.550> well

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
mask so let's test it and see how well

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.840 
mask so let's test it and see how well
it<00:00:41.850> works<00:00:42.680> all<00:00:43.680> right<00:00:43.710> I've<00:00:44.100> got<00:00:44.129> two<00:00:44.489> sprays

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
it works all right I've got two sprays

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.540 
it works all right I've got two sprays
to<00:00:45.120> try<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.390> with<00:00:45.570> today<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.440> I've<00:00:46.739> also<00:00:46.980> got

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
to try it with today and I've also got

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.270 
to try it with today and I've also got
the<00:00:47.670> masculine<00:00:48.059> already<00:00:48.680> as<00:00:49.680> I've<00:00:49.920> sprayed<00:00:50.250> a

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
the masculine already as I've sprayed a

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.520 
the masculine already as I've sprayed a
bit<00:00:50.520> into<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.850> air<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.239> test<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.020> actual

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
bit into the air to test that the actual

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.340 
bit into the air to test that the actual
filter<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.190> working<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.789> seems<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.300> be<00:00:54.420> so

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
filter is working it seems to be so

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.869 
filter is working it seems to be so
let's<00:00:55.530> see<00:00:55.649> how<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:56.010> holds<00:00:56.160> up<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.460> get<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
let's see how it holds up to get to the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.630 
let's see how it holds up to get to the
troubling<00:00:57.270> attack<00:00:58.039> so<00:01:00.710> do<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.829> think<00:01:02.100> mask<00:01:02.370> is

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
troubling attack so do you think mask is

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.490 
troubling attack so do you think mask is
on<00:01:04.460> there<00:01:05.460> tight<00:01:05.670> seal<00:01:06.060> let's<00:01:06.810> begin<00:01:07.140> spraying

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
on there tight seal let's begin spraying

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.570 
on there tight seal let's begin spraying
and<00:01:07.799> see<00:01:07.920> what<00:01:08.070> happens

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:23.399 

first<00:01:16.580> ones<00:01:16.850> free

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:30.100 

second<00:01:24.409> canister<00:01:24.920> sprayed<00:01:26.800> I'm<00:01:27.800> now<00:01:29.110> I'll

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
second canister sprayed I'm now I'll

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.510 
second canister sprayed I'm now I'll
talk<00:01:30.380> about<00:01:30.409> a<00:01:31.250> minute<00:01:31.790> a<00:01:31.940> few<00:01:32.270> minutes<00:01:33.520> then

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
talk about a minute a few minutes then

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.800 
talk about a minute a few minutes then
we'll<00:01:34.700> see<00:01:34.820> if<00:01:34.909> it<00:01:35.030> has<00:01:35.180> an<00:01:35.270> effect

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
we'll see if it has an effect

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.620 
we'll see if it has an effect
so<00:01:38.290> yes<00:01:39.290> tan<00:01:39.649> was<00:01:39.860> made<00:01:40.250> by<00:01:40.460> Avon<00:01:40.909> used<00:01:41.390> by<00:01:41.570> the

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
so yes tan was made by Avon used by the
