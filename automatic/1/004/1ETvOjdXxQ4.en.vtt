00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hello very good as data two kids 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.520
 here is by iron and commenting on another 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.200
 gameplay of modern warfare 3 and I'm 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.290
 playing a domain game of 6 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.450
 against 6 with the muffler with muffler 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.570
 extended chargers and I'm doing 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.210
 a game of road to 2 map in a 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.250
 starting as you see we started capturing 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.600
 we charge ourselves to these 2 filthy 3 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.980
 we discovered the kit for out there we 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.689
 we raised we recorded it the truth that 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.820
 an awesome start and I had to 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.220
 be the ball is up there you have me 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.769
 to try all the beginning and started 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.230
 all right or that is about the concept 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:36.270
 but good still a love yes I'm going 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.670
 to take out the second one you can take it out 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.309
 may not 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.019
 let's see I'm playing with the sep text 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.460
 because I tell myself 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:45.140
 lately I was always playing with 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.609
 the great fragmentation look here makes me 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.010
 the corrector on the one hand by another on 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:51.859
 which goes the ball and is born the end 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.359
 kills to be 98 that I think I think that 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.690
 I added to the play because I think I 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:58.609
 I knew elije bate added ya look look 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.219
 two shots in the head the mother well 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:03.070
 good what I said I have a feeling 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.180
 but I always good at the beginning 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.049
 it seems to be that he had people but 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.630
 I do not even remember that anymore 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.640
 then been to hours up to a week 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.520
 monotonous week two or three days I have 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.069
 been with the fragmentation grenade 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.210
 because I do not know it seems to me better or is it 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:18.560
 it seemed simple but it is 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.450
 wrong because then I got into the 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.940
 application is that I downloaded in the 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.759
 call of duty elite play and put that 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.830
 the times he had thrown everything and 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.959
 osaka plan the times cucha 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.130
 thrown grains and so on and sometimes 

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:32.959
 that he had killed with each grenade and 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.459
 it turns out that he had thrown less 

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:36.860
 people who had killed themselves more times with 

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:38.600
 the in text then it 's one thing that you 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.399
 I recommend that you take a look for 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.590
 that you see for example as with false da 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.290
 better in the blinding grenades and 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.740
 stunners I do not notice 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.460
 in plan 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.079
 how many people are blinded or something like that 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.420
 but look here, it's funny for me 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.740
 predator I see that we could do that 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.369
 them us more is where he was 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.799
 capture explained is not very clear anymore 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.420
 I return to the other the other topic saw a 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.220
 predator did not enter and I say here we are 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.899
 both capturing this insurance that the 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.090
 that is going to throw the plate is going to defend its 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.369
 flag then do not throw it somewhere else 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.380
 still away the predator not there is there 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.480
 then I go back to the flag 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.040
 just before he gets to the flag 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.290
 kill the one that was to my partner that 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.880
 was capturing the flag but the 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.489
 arrive a half second later still 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.069
 followed by filling the bar or whatever 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.480
 They kill him when there was nothing on it is 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.340
 that got all the advantages and I 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.440
 charged and who had killed him and over 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.680
 captured the flag and it would be wrong 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.709
 grace or that but good 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.959
 I recommend that I recommend that you 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.850
 you put in the heat application 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.560
 useful and I suppose the minister for the xbox and 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.790
 the computer I do not have an idea but what 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.410
 most likely yes or no in the 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.630
 call of duty leader page of the 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.890
 computer and point or the last point 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.110
 com 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.420
 and nothing if you can see for example what 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.830
 what do I look at the pomegranates and then 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.660
 since then I get more people 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.340
 although not all much difference but 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.540
 yes if he says that throwing less already kills more 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.850
 it's because it's like that and then good a 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.940
 tip is a tip for you to cast a 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.040
 look then because I get blinding 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.660
 stunners good I used to put myself 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.600
 always stunners but because I get 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.100
 to the mowers because because when stun 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.770
 I think the stun effect 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.360
 hard lasts less than taking off and 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.760
 then make them one that can be 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.590
 look and kill and that but I do not know I have 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.720
 blinded now is now and is although 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.660
 not much problem and as you can see I'm 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.100
 happening this fast fast fast because 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.980
 You already know that they take me a lot 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.430
 upload the video to low internet in my 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.930
 house in my hut from here of the village 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.630
 Then I'll pass it fast - look 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.140
 here I charge this to this and we go back to 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.850
 the fast and good camera good so that 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.040
 see if maybe they love me to the best 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.600
 no but this video is the first one I'm going 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.450
 to try to upload them on Thursday with luck 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.220
 it will rise on Thursday, so if 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.320
 You see that I get up on Friday or Saturday 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.970
 it's because the internet is going wrong for me but I've 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.260
 tried to raise those on Thursday which is what 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.180
 most likely it works for me because 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.590
 lately nobody is working 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.930
 touch the internet of my house is already here 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.250
 fashion fashion balls we take the 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.080
 What I want is for them to kill me 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.810
 that's why he did not shoot anything 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.160
 I let them kill me and nothing here I follow 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.920
 scampering to try to go for the 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.890
 mort used by the second fashion and good 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.660
 for disadvantages good you see that the 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.820
 normal I have drawn fast 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.710
 scavenger and shooter and of those who 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.630
 I put in the specialist I put presti 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.390
 citation hard line and blind eye and as 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.590
 you see a coach a pig has thrown me 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.530
 without problems has returned to take me out 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.470
 water thing that good demotivates a little 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:43.000
 but well, it does not matter, I have a 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:45.510
 ask if I get the fashion they kill me and 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.580
 shot to love that helps me for the streak 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.870
 the next bouts of casualties or for or me 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.669
 also count as casualties for 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.460
 next way I ask everything because 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:57.270
 I have no idea it here just in case 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.270
 the kitchen 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:05.250
 the second although yes yes I am pretty 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.700
 you'll see that I have one minute left 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.700
 departure 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:23.700
 now many some maybe not but 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:25.770
 good because there is a wretch with the 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.810
 last battle of the pockets those that 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.880
 you touch your nose that you throw the 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.480
 dog thrown to the ground and above me 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.480
 kill with the pipe 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.800
 leave it there list of doors 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.770
 we captured the flag they would only 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.630
 oil I see a package that they have thrown away and 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.880
 the centex help help the good of the 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.500
 36 that explodes fast and although the bad 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.030
 is that as it sticks in a place that 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.030
 book here 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:57.600
 I think they have a speck of oysters that 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.460
 I think it 's supportive and everything has been 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.380
 cut in puja then here 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.430
 we recover all the advantages of how 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.950
 over here I'm keeping an eye on 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.900
 minimap to the titan to see where it goes and 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.700

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.740
