Zed 1a which anybody who knows anything

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.410 
Zed 1a which anybody who knows anything
about<00:01:55.740> old<00:01:56.460> Kawasaki's<00:01:57.470> will<00:01:58.470> recognize<00:01:58.979> that

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
about old Kawasaki's will recognize that

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.880 
about old Kawasaki's will recognize that
some<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.659> might<00:02:00.840> be<00:02:01.049> but<00:02:01.380> most<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.740> it

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
some of it might be but most of it

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.370 
some of it might be but most of it
certainly<00:02:02.250> isn't<00:02:02.659> however<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.899> only<00:02:04.110> paid<00:02:04.349> a

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
certainly isn't however I only paid a

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.389 
certainly isn't however I only paid a
thousand<00:02:04.920> pounds<00:02:05.220> for<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.459> so<00:02:07.099> I'm<00:02:08.099> going<00:02:08.340> to

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
thousand pounds for it so I'm going to

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.600 
thousand pounds for it so I'm going to
do<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.030> as<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.179> bit<00:02:09.329> of<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.479> project<00:02:10.280> it's<00:02:11.280> got<00:02:11.489> the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
do it as a bit of a project it's got the

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.979 
do it as a bit of a project it's got the
original<00:02:12.410> Kawasaki<00:02:13.670> wheels<00:02:14.670> on<00:02:14.970> which<00:02:15.810> are

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
original Kawasaki wheels on which are

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.170 
original Kawasaki wheels on which are
possibly<00:02:16.410> from<00:02:16.829> as<00:02:17.069> a<00:02:17.130> thousand<00:02:17.700> mark<00:02:17.910> to

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
possibly from as a thousand mark to

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.990 
possibly from as a thousand mark to
because<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:19.049> has<00:02:19.200> an<00:02:19.410> 18<00:02:19.769> inch<00:02:19.950> rear<00:02:20.160> wheel<00:02:20.370> and

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
because it has an 18 inch rear wheel and

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
the 19 inch front wheel so it can't be

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.699 
the 19 inch front wheel so it can't be
the<00:02:24.150> custom<00:02:24.660> because<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:25.049> would<00:02:25.170> have<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.319> 16

he's<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:42.959> thousand<00:02:43.440> a1<00:02:43.769> a2<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.730> he<00:02:45.269> stumped<00:02:45.780> up

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
he's a thousand a1 a2 and he stumped up

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.500 
he's a thousand a1 a2 and he stumped up
with<00:02:46.109> us<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.680> DMV<00:02:47.100> stamping<00:02:48.030> rather<00:02:48.239> than

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
with us a DMV stamping rather than

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.080 
with us a DMV stamping rather than
Kawasaki<00:02:49.079> stamping<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:49.709> either<00:02:50.100> it<00:02:50.940> was

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
Kawasaki stamping so either it was

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.770 
Kawasaki stamping so either it was
stolen<00:02:51.420> at<00:02:51.780> some<00:02:51.959> point<00:02:52.230> in<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.440> past<00:02:52.620> or<00:02:53.780> it

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
stolen at some point in the past or it

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.390 
stolen at some point in the past or it
was<00:02:54.900> crashed<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.680> hence<00:02:55.859> that's<00:02:56.130> why<00:02:56.280> it's

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
was crashed and hence that's why it's

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.580 
was crashed and hence that's why it's
ended<00:02:56.639> up<00:02:56.730> as<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.150> Zed<00:02:57.420> 1a<00:02:57.600> but<00:02:58.109> with<00:02:58.260> lots<00:02:58.410> of

on it in total so let's see where that
goes<00:05:34.990> and<00:05:35.020> when<00:05:35.470> it's<00:05:35.620> finished<00:05:36.360> I'm<00:05:37.360> hoping

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
goes and when it's finished I'm hoping

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.610 
goes and when it's finished I'm hoping
apart<00:05:38.650> from<00:05:38.800> the<00:05:38.920> exhaust<00:05:39.250> system<00:05:40.620> too

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
apart from the exhaust system too

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.740 
apart from the exhaust system too
dissimilar<00:05:41.860> to<00:05:42.130> this<00:05:42.340> the<00:05:43.090> main<00:05:43.270> reason<00:05:43.630> is

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
dissimilar to this the main reason is

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.420 
dissimilar to this the main reason is
it's<00:05:44.050> actually<00:05:44.170> going<00:05:44.560> to<00:05:44.650> get<00:05:44.800> this<00:05:44.980> tank

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
it's actually going to get this tank

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.090 
it's actually going to get this tank
side<00:05:45.730> panels<00:05:46.090> and<00:05:46.240> tail<00:05:46.390> piece<00:05:46.860> fitted<00:05:47.860> onto

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
side panels and tail piece fitted onto

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.350 
side panels and tail piece fitted onto
that<00:05:49.000> one<00:05:49.150> and<00:05:50.340> the<00:05:51.340> tail<00:05:51.520> piece<00:05:51.760> and<00:05:51.970> tankless

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
that one and the tail piece and tankless

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.500 
that one and the tail piece and tankless
one<00:05:52.600> up<00:05:52.950> will<00:05:53.950> be<00:05:54.040> repainted<00:05:54.400> and<00:05:55.090> put<00:05:55.270> on<00:05:55.390> this

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
one up will be repainted and put on this

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.280 
one up will be repainted and put on this
one<00:05:55.860> but<00:05:56.860> I<00:05:56.890> may<00:05:57.070> well
