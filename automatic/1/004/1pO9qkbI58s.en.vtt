00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 of the important thermal descent 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.180
 experienced during the last end of 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.670
 week at temperatures will cost them 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.740
 recover only a couple of days of 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.929
 made from Wednesday they will return 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.730
 already much more spring values of 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.890
 moment continues to be very cold 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.810
 especially in these early hours of the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.090
 tomorrow when the minimums are recorded 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.550
 of the day today the two degrees are around 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.650
 subzero in points of almería like 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.689
 consequence will continue to snow in dimensions 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.880
 relatively low around 1000 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.669
 meters keeping that yellow warning 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.070
 by snowfall in points of Jaén de Granada 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.630
 and also from almería finally the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.750
 rain will come back to make an appearance 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.820
 to precipitations that will be more intense 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.040
 and could be accompanied by hail 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.469
 in the eastern interior being by the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.530
 otherwise weaker and less likely 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.199
 towards the coast so that awaits us 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.570
 another unpleasant and rainy day with 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.120
 snow and with very cold temperatures 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.190
 similar to yesterday's warm up well 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.140
 they are ready to leave home and if not 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.879
 I wait for you at eight thirty to see 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.100
 the forecast with snow we are going to 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.330
 accompany during these last two days 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.970
 April 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.070
 with the month of May will come again 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.930
 more stable and springtime 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.460
 time until three o'clock this afternoon 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.490
 keep that yellow warning for snowfall 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.860
 in points of jaén granada and it is extended 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.380
 also to the province of almeria so 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.600
 general could accumulate between 2 and 3 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.000
 centimeters thick reaching up 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.040
 the 7 centimeters on the feet and 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.900
 provinces from tomorrow will begin 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.940
 to raise the temperatures in fact already 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.490
 for Wednesday we expect very values 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.560
 Spring in Andalusia as a 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.270
 despite the important thermal drop 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.610
 experienced during the last end of 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.979
 week the temperatures temperatures them 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.290
 It will cost to recover just a couple of 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.010
 days in fact as of Wednesday 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.840
 they will return much more values 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.940
 Springtime for the moment continues 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.830
 being very cold especially in these 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.690
 first thing in the morning when it 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.880
 they register the minimums of the day that today 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.070
 the two degrees are below zero in 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.510
 Almería points as a consequence 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.420
 will continue to be relatively high 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.800
 low around 2000 meters 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.840
 keeping that yellow warning for 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.390
 snowfall in jaén de grana 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.180
 and also from almería and finally the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.010
 rain return to make an appearance 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.810
 precipitations that will be more intense and 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.489
 could be accompanied by hail in 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.920
 the eastern interior being by the 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.319
 otherwise weaker and less likely 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.810
 towards the coast so that awaits us 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.390
 they see a disagreeable day and 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.910
 rainy with snow and with temperatures 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.500
 cold very similar to yesterday but 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.629
 if you think a candle that ten o'clock and 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.629
 mean we see the forecast in detail
