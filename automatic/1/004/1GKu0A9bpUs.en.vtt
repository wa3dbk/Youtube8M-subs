the the figures waist right there that's

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.630 
the the figures waist right there that's
kind<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.809> knowing<00:00:33.930> same<00:00:34.800> thing<00:00:34.980> with<00:00:35.130> his<00:00:35.340> legs

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
kind of knowing same thing with his legs

kind of knowing same thing with his legs
here<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.000> can<00:00:36.120> see<00:00:36.360> straight<00:00:36.899> through<00:00:37.260> his

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
body to the other side and I think

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.420 
body to the other side and I think
that's<00:00:39.510> kind<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.840> tacky<00:00:40.140> at<00:00:40.530> least<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.980> joints

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
that's kind of tacky at least the joints

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.209 
that's kind of tacky at least the joints
aren't<00:00:42.210> limited<00:00:42.750> by<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:42.989> little<00:00:43.770> holsters

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
aren't limited by the little holsters

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.560 
aren't limited by the little holsters
that<00:00:44.250> are<00:00:44.520> dangling<00:00:44.879> from<00:00:45.059> their<00:00:45.180> belt<00:00:45.480> at

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
that are dangling from their belt at

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.560 
that are dangling from their belt at
least<00:00:45.719> they<00:00:45.780> have<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> decent<00:00:46.050> range<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.469> motion

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
least they have a decent range of motion

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.090 
least they have a decent range of motion
we<00:00:48.570> can't<00:00:48.750> really<00:00:48.899> go<00:00:48.989> back<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.620> far<00:00:49.649> but

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
we can't really go back that far but

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.100 
we can't really go back that far but
they<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.370> go<00:00:50.460> forward<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.940> little<00:00:50.969> bit<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.660> mean

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
they can go forward a little bit I mean

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.330 
they can go forward a little bit I mean
more<00:00:52.320> than<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.500> little<00:00:52.680> bit<00:00:52.800> pretty<00:00:52.980> good<00:00:53.160> but

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
more than a little bit pretty good but

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.200 
more than a little bit pretty good but
they<00:00:53.430> can't<00:00:53.610> go<00:00:53.670> back<00:00:53.910> if<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.210> wanted<00:00:54.480> them<00:00:54.629> to

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
they can't go back if you wanted them to

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.069 
they can't go back if you wanted them to
double<00:00:57.210> knee<00:00:57.329> joints<00:00:57.570> are<00:00:57.660> fine<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:57.930> they're

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
double knee joints are fine but they're

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.740 
double knee joints are fine but they're
a<00:00:58.109> little<00:00:58.320> tight<00:00:58.760> there<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.239> bootcut

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
a little tight there is the bootcut

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.900 
a little tight there is the bootcut
swivel<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.320> that's<00:01:01.469> cool<00:01:01.739> but<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.280> hinge<00:01:02.699> for

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
swivel so that's cool but the hinge for

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.630 
swivel so that's cool but the hinge for
the<00:01:02.969> ankles<00:01:03.409> I<00:01:04.409> really<00:01:05.010> like<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.280> ankle<00:01:05.489> so

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
the ankles I really like the ankle so

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.070 
the ankles I really like the ankle so
well<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> swivel<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.600> left<00:01:06.810> is

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
well but the swivel on the left is

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.710 
well but the swivel on the left is
really<00:01:07.470> tight<00:01:07.979> hopefully<00:01:08.460> if<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.640> get<00:01:08.790> one<00:01:09.000> it

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
really tight hopefully if you get one it

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.070 
really tight hopefully if you get one it
isn't<00:01:10.110> as<00:01:10.170> tight<00:01:10.409> as<00:01:10.650> mine

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
isn't as tight as mine

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.620 
isn't as tight as mine
also<00:01:13.080> my<00:01:13.200> biggest<00:01:13.380> beef<00:01:13.650> was<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.509> you<00:01:15.509> know

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
you can see that it's a piece that

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.010 
you can see that it's a piece that
connects<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.610> shoulder<00:01:20.970> ball<00:01:21.119> because

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
connects to the shoulder ball because

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.690 
connects to the shoulder ball because
this<00:01:22.320> shoulder<00:01:22.530> ball<00:01:22.799> doesn't<00:01:23.009> move<00:01:23.159> at<00:01:23.549> all

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.030 
this shoulder ball doesn't move at all
in<00:01:24.000> fact<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:25.020> section<00:01:25.439> that's<00:01:25.590> supposed<00:01:25.950> to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
in fact the section that's supposed to

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.649 
in fact the section that's supposed to
meet<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.549> stay<00:01:26.820> connected<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.509> shoulder

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
meet and stay connected to the shoulder

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.140 
meet and stay connected to the shoulder
ball<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.470> one<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:29.280> really<00:01:29.640> loose<00:01:29.970> so

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
ball on this one is really loose so

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
ball on this one is really loose so
every<00:01:30.329> time<00:01:30.390> I'm<00:01:30.479> trying<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.720> move<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.020> feel

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
every time I'm trying to move it I feel

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.499 
every time I'm trying to move it I feel
like<00:01:31.259> I'm<00:01:31.320> gonna<00:01:31.439> break<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.799> off<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.520> also

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
like I'm gonna break it off so I also

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.819 
like I'm gonna break it off so I also
don't<00:01:33.630> want<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.900> use<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> blow<00:01:34.290> dryer<00:01:34.320> on<00:01:34.680> that

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
don't want to use a blow dryer on that

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.050 
don't want to use a blow dryer on that
because<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.040> think<00:01:35.100> it's<00:01:35.310> just<00:01:35.430> gonna<00:01:35.549> loosen

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
because I think it's just gonna loosen

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.719 
because I think it's just gonna loosen
this<00:01:36.270> section<00:01:36.720> even<00:01:36.900> more<00:01:37.460> I'm<00:01:38.460> gonna<00:01:38.549> try

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
this section even more I'm gonna try

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.069 
this section even more I'm gonna try
dipping<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.240> some<00:01:39.390> hot<00:01:39.570> water<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.960> see

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
dipping this in some hot water and see

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.100 
dipping this in some hot water and see
if<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.320> moves<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:41.490> torso<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.780> shoulder

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
if that moves the torso and the shoulder

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.100 
if that moves the torso and the shoulder
joint<00:01:43.380> but<00:01:44.250> uh<00:01:44.329> between<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.630> shoulder<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
pretty interesting because

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.980 
pretty interesting because
they<00:02:14.130> attempted<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.610> not<00:02:14.730> only<00:02:14.850> like<00:02:15.450> sculpt<00:02:15.930> a

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
hairstyle but sculpt like a little tuft

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.150 
hairstyle but sculpt like a little tuft
of<00:02:18.510> it's<00:02:18.660> sticking<00:02:19.050> out<00:02:19.170> on<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.530> sides<00:02:19.890> there

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
of it's sticking out on the sides there

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.830 
of it's sticking out on the sides there
and<00:02:20.340> I've<00:02:20.400> never<00:02:20.490> really<00:02:20.760> seen<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:20.970> too

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
and I've never really seen that too

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.780 
and I've never really seen that too
often<00:02:22.260> in<00:02:22.470> action<00:02:22.950> figures<00:02:23.280> I've<00:02:23.460> seen<00:02:23.640> that

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
often in action figures I've seen that

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.340

with two pistols and they're you know
basic<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.650> pretty<00:03:49.799> well<00:03:49.920> done<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.370> one<00:03:50.489> of

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
basic and pretty well done and one of

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.150 
basic and pretty well done and one of
them<00:03:50.640> fits<00:03:51.380> into<00:03:52.380> a<00:03:52.410> holster<00:03:52.769> on<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:52.950> side

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
them fits into a holster on the side

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.340 
them fits into a holster on the side
there<00:03:53.450> one<00:03:54.450> of<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.600> weird<00:03:54.780> things<00:03:54.810> is<00:03:55.049> at<00:03:55.170> his

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
there one of the weird things is at his

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.440 
there one of the weird things is at his
right<00:03:55.620> hand<00:03:55.650> has<00:03:56.430> separation<00:03:57.030> at<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.180> index

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
right hand has separation at the index

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.690 
right hand has separation at the index
finger<00:03:57.720> so<00:03:57.840> he<00:03:57.930> can<00:03:58.019> grip<00:03:58.170> a<00:03:58.290> gun<00:03:58.470> but<00:03:59.370> his<00:03:59.459> left

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
finger so he can grip a gun but his left

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.300 
finger so he can grip a gun but his left
hand<00:03:59.820> is<00:03:59.910> just<00:04:00.030> a<00:04:00.090> basic<00:04:00.330> grip<00:04:00.690> hand<00:04:00.930> so

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
hand is just a basic grip hand so

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.400 
hand is just a basic grip hand so
there's<00:04:02.310> no<00:04:02.430> separation<00:04:03.000> for<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.209> index<00:04:03.600> so

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
there's no separation for the index so

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.020 
there's no separation for the index so
he<00:04:04.500> could<00:04:04.620> really<00:04:04.769> only<00:04:04.980> properly<00:04:05.489> hold<00:04:05.610> one

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
he could really only properly hold one

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.880 
he could really only properly hold one
gun<00:04:06.330> and<00:04:06.570> not<00:04:06.660> both<00:04:06.900> so<00:04:07.380> that's<00:04:07.500> a<00:04:07.590> little<00:04:07.769> bit

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
gun and not both so that's a little bit

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.190 
gun and not both so that's a little bit
of<00:04:07.950> an<00:04:08.040> annoyance<00:04:08.810> articulation<00:04:09.810> on<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.019> legs

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
of an annoyance articulation on the legs

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.840 
of an annoyance articulation on the legs
is<00:04:10.380> pretty<00:04:10.650> decent<00:04:10.920> which<00:04:11.220> allows<00:04:11.459> me<00:04:11.579> to<00:04:11.700> get

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
is pretty decent which allows me to get

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.000 
is pretty decent which allows me to get
him<00:04:11.970> into<00:04:12.120> some<00:04:12.239> solid<00:04:12.660> poses<00:04:13.049> well<00:04:13.769> he<00:04:13.890> may

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
him into some solid poses well he may

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.979 
him into some solid poses well he may
not<00:04:14.040> be<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.430> best<00:04:14.579> figure<00:04:14.970> in<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.329> arrow<00:04:15.600> line

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
not be the best figure in the arrow line

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.509 
not be the best figure in the arrow line
he's<00:04:16.260> certainly<00:04:16.530> not<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:16.890> worst<00:04:17.070> figure<00:04:17.400> the

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
he's certainly not the worst figure the

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.789 
he's certainly not the worst figure the
