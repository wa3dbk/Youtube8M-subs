00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
four holes which also are lined all the

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.280 
four holes which also are lined all the
way<00:03:25.949> through<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.430> fit<00:03:27.389> your<00:03:27.540> eyeballs<00:03:27.989> on<00:03:28.169> here

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
the eyeballs and the hard case on at the

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.119 
the eyeballs and the hard case on at the
same<00:03:49.290> time<00:03:49.470> you're<00:03:49.680> gonna<00:03:49.799> be<00:03:49.889> getting<00:03:49.980> a

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
same time you're gonna be getting a

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.080 
same time you're gonna be getting a
whole<00:03:50.250> lot<00:03:50.280> of<00:03:50.430> protection<00:03:50.609> be<00:03:50.879> they're<00:03:51.000> going

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
whole lot of protection be they're going

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.430 
whole lot of protection be they're going
to<00:03:51.150> be<00:03:51.269> in<00:03:51.359> the<00:03:51.480> shock<00:03:51.690> absorption<00:03:51.989> from<00:03:52.260> the

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
to be in the shock absorption from the

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.780 
to be in the shock absorption from the
balls<00:03:52.650> if<00:03:52.769> you<00:03:52.799> drop<00:03:53.069> it<00:03:53.099> and<00:03:53.430> you're<00:03:53.699> also

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
balls if you drop it and you're also

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.530 
balls if you drop it and you're also
going<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.030> be<00:03:54.120> getting<00:03:54.209> your<00:03:54.359> shock

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
going to be getting your shock

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.729 
going to be getting your shock
absorption<00:03:54.810> from<00:03:55.049> the<00:03:55.199> balls<00:03:55.349> that<00:03:55.500> are<00:03:55.530> built

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
absorption from the balls that are built

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.559 
absorption from the balls that are built
into<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:56.250> case<00:03:56.430> those<00:03:56.669> those<00:03:57.090> little<00:03:57.299> indents

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
into the case those those little indents

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:58.759 
into the case those those little indents
right<00:03:57.750> there<00:03:57.870> they're<00:03:58.049> actually<00:03:58.319> pretty<00:03:58.440> hard

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
right there they're actually pretty hard

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.289 
right there they're actually pretty hard
so<00:03:58.980> you're<00:03:59.459> gonna<00:03:59.579> get<00:03:59.699> the<00:03:59.819> shock<00:04:00.000> absorption

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
so you're gonna get the shock absorption

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.819 
so you're gonna get the shock absorption
from<00:04:00.480> those<00:04:00.750> as<00:04:00.930> well<00:04:01.079> in<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.379> case<00:04:01.590> is

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
from those as well in the case is

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.110 
from those as well in the case is
actually<00:04:02.310> pretty<00:04:02.430> nice<00:04:02.579> it's<00:04:02.760> pretty<00:04:02.909> hard

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
actually pretty nice it's pretty hard

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.819 
actually pretty nice it's pretty hard
all<00:04:03.569> right<00:04:03.720> we'll<00:04:03.959> Bend<00:04:04.169> obviously<00:04:04.650> because

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
all right we'll Bend obviously because

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.349 
all right we'll Bend obviously because
you<00:04:04.889> need<00:04:05.069> to<00:04:05.099> maneuver<00:04:05.579> it<00:04:05.639> around<00:04:05.669> and<00:04:06.060> you

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
you need to maneuver it around and you

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.800

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
also have the soft plush lining I don't

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.059 
also have the soft plush lining I don't
know<00:04:09.870> if<00:04:09.930> I<00:04:09.989> mentioned<00:04:10.049> that<00:04:10.349> yet<00:04:10.500> but<00:04:10.859> it<00:04:10.979> goes

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
know if I mentioned that yet but it goes

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:12.379 
know if I mentioned that yet but it goes

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
bottom as well it goes over the hinge so

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.939 
bottom as well it goes over the hinge so

your iPad at all so you're getting the
maximum<00:04:18.930> protection<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.949> stitching<00:04:20.340> on<00:04:20.430> the

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
maximum protection the stitching on the

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.459 
maximum protection the stitching on the
inside<00:04:20.909> is<00:04:21.030> very<00:04:21.269> nice<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.780> plus<00:04:22.019> goes<00:04:22.229> right

inside is very nice the plus goes right

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:25.700 
inside is very nice the plus goes right
up<00:04:22.680> and<00:04:22.860> underneath<00:04:23.479> the<00:04:24.479> case<00:04:24.930> itself<00:04:25.320> so<00:04:25.650> you

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710
