00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.570
1956 is always a very memorial remembrance
for me because it was my first Olympic Games

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.779
and it was my most enjoyable Olympic Games
because I don't think you could ever take

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.640
away from the fact that you are competing
for your country in your first Olympic Games.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.310
The atmosphere is entirely different and you
know the excitement of being chosen to represent

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.270
your country at an Olympic Games, the greatest
sporting event in the world, and it's just

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.450
all very overpowering and exciting.
My performance in 1956 was probably my best

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.120
ever, my first Olympic Games and being very
raw to the situation and international competition

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.440
it was very exciting but you know it was all
a great experience of learning how to swim

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.440
a race and how to try and win a race and I
was very fortunate I had a great coach who

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.110
looked after me, gave me all that wonderful
experience of how I had to prepare for my

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.969
race and I put it all down to just a wonderful
experience and I guess probably the greatest

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:21.340
memory I have of 1956 is the fact that I looked
up into the stands and unbeknown to me my

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.700
mother and father were sitting in the stands
having seen me race for the first time in

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.310
their life.
My first medal I won was a Gold medal for

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.840
the 100 metres freestyle swimming and it was
a great competition because we had a fantastic

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.490
team in Lorraine Crapp and Faith Leech and
we were very fortunate to be the first swimmers

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.939
in the world ever to do 1, 2 and 3 for a country
and I was very fortunate to be the number

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.909
1 Gold medal winner, Lorraine got second and
Faith Leech got third. And then my second

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:02.930
race was in the 4 x 100 metres freestyle relay
where we won that medal and beat America and

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.850
that was a Gold medal and also my other medal
I won was a Silver medal where I got second

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:15.030
to Lorraine Crapp in the 400 metres freestyle.
The emotions that go through your head is

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.810
one of excitement, one of thinking well all
the hard work that I did, all the arguments

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.280
I had with my coach about training, leaving
your family and going away on a training camp

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.450
it all came to fruition that all of a sudden
here it was the excitement of winning a Gold

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.570
medal in your hand and it was all worthwhile
and it was an experience that I put in the

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.250
back of my head for the rest of my life.
