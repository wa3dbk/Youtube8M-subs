of<00:00:46.610> things<00:00:46.880> that<00:00:47.239> I<00:00:47.270> think<00:00:47.360> are<00:00:47.600> kind<00:00:47.750> of

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
of things that I think are kind of

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.770 
of things that I think are kind of
interesting<00:00:48.020> with<00:00:48.469> it<00:00:48.590> one<00:00:48.829> is<00:00:49.180> that<00:00:50.180> I<00:00:50.239> have

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
interesting with it one is that I have

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.470 
interesting with it one is that I have
put<00:00:51.079> it<00:00:51.200> under<00:00:51.410> a<00:00:51.440> spray<00:00:51.739> test<00:00:52.040> and<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:53.390> way

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
put it under a spray test and the way

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.180 
put it under a spray test and the way
that<00:00:53.600> I<00:00:53.719> do<00:00:53.780> that<00:00:54.050> is<00:00:54.170> put<00:00:54.350> a<00:00:54.379> paper<00:00:54.620> a<00:00:54.739> bunch<00:00:55.129> of

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
that I do that is put a paper a bunch of

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.760 
that I do that is put a paper a bunch of
paper<00:00:55.399> towels<00:00:55.640> inside<00:00:56.210> I<00:00:56.510> shut<00:00:57.230> the<00:00:57.350> lid<00:00:57.530> and

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
paper towels inside I shut the lid and

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.040 
paper towels inside I shut the lid and
then<00:00:57.829> just<00:00:58.039> spread<00:00:58.280> it<00:00:58.340> with<00:00:58.489> water<00:00:58.930> over<00:00:59.930> and

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
then just spread it with water over and

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.600 
then just spread it with water over and
over<00:01:00.110> again<00:01:00.320> all<00:01:00.829> along<00:01:01.070> it<00:01:01.129> seems<00:01:01.460> in<00:01:01.579> the

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
over again all along it seems in the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.850

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
thing that I did was that I tried to

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.109 
thing that I did was that I tried to
submerge<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.659> thing<00:01:09.409> in<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.130> sink<00:01:10.399> the<00:01:10.909> Box

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
submerge the thing in the sink the Box

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.769 
submerge the thing in the sink the Box
in<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:11.299> sink<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:11.840> it<00:01:12.439> floats<00:01:13.039> so<00:01:13.459> oh<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:14.569> best

I<00:01:14.929> could<00:01:14.990> do<00:01:15.229> was<00:01:15.259> hold<00:01:15.590> it<00:01:15.709> under<00:01:15.920> water<00:01:16.100> and

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
I could do was hold it under water and

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.849 
I could do was hold it under water and
move<00:01:17.270> it<00:01:17.389> around<00:01:17.450> a<00:01:17.719> whole<00:01:17.869> lot<00:01:18.049> and<00:01:18.289> the<00:01:18.679> thing

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.529 
it has a bunch of electronic gear that
you<00:01:42.770> might<00:01:43.189> find<00:01:43.219> on<00:01:43.490> a<00:01:43.549> boat<00:01:43.819> stored<00:01:44.299> in<00:01:44.419> there

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
you might find on a boat stored in there

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.870 
you might find on a boat stored in there
and<00:01:44.869> it<00:01:45.679> certainly<00:01:45.859> would<00:01:46.189> be<00:01:46.219> good<00:01:46.489> for<00:01:46.700> that

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
and it certainly would be good for that

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.359 
and it certainly would be good for that
the<00:01:47.749> other<00:01:47.869> thing<00:01:48.169> though<00:01:48.439> that<00:01:48.770> I<00:01:48.979> thought

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
the other thing though that I thought

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.909 
the other thing though that I thought
about<00:01:49.549> was<00:01:50.119> it's<00:01:50.989> not<00:01:51.229> only<00:01:51.499> great<00:01:51.709> for<00:01:51.739> that

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:51.919 
about was it's not only great for that

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:54.279 
about was it's not only great for that
but<00:01:52.279> it's<00:01:52.549> also<00:01:52.759> would<00:01:53.299> be<00:01:53.419> a<00:01:53.450> great<00:01:53.689> firearms

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
but it's also would be a great firearms

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.729 
but it's also would be a great firearms
transport<00:01:54.889> case<00:01:55.119> this<00:01:56.119> would<00:01:56.509> satisfy<00:01:56.899> most

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:57.739 
transport case this would satisfy most

00:01:57.739 --> 00:01:59.440 
transport case this would satisfy most
airline<00:01:58.249> requirements<00:01:58.969> because<00:01:59.090> it's<00:01:59.359> a

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
airline requirements because it's a

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.620 
airline requirements because it's a
lockable<00:01:59.840> case<00:02:00.429> you<00:02:01.429> can<00:02:01.639> put<00:02:01.849> your<00:02:02.119> handgun

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
lockable case you can put your handgun

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.449 
lockable case you can put your handgun
in<00:02:02.749> here<00:02:02.959> right<00:02:03.139> now<00:02:03.289> have<00:02:03.499> a<00:02:03.529> Glock<00:02:03.770> 17<00:02:04.309> in

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
there you can show that gun to be

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
shop it is withheld then the only thing

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.750 
shop it is withheld then the only thing
we<00:02:39.140> didn't<00:02:39.500> do<00:02:39.680> is<00:02:40.120> drive<00:02:41.120> it<00:02:41.360> over<00:02:41.510> a<00:02:42.020> I<00:02:42.800> mean

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
we didn't do is drive it over a I mean

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.090 
we didn't do is drive it over a I mean
drive<00:02:43.970> over<00:02:44.240> with<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.420> truck<00:02:44.800> and<00:02:45.800> maybe<00:02:45.980> that

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
drive over with a truck and maybe that

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.440 
drive over with a truck and maybe that
would<00:02:46.430> have<00:02:46.550> done<00:02:46.700> something<00:02:46.910> a<00:02:47.120> little<00:02:47.270> bit

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
would have done something a little bit

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.420 
would have done something a little bit
different<00:02:47.870> maybe<00:02:48.590> it<00:02:48.710> would<00:02:48.860> have<00:02:48.950> broken<00:02:49.190> it

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
different maybe it would have broken it

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.920 
different maybe it would have broken it
but<00:02:49.970> I<00:02:50.000> think<00:02:50.300> if<00:02:50.420> you're<00:02:50.570> looking<00:02:50.900> for

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
but I think if you're looking for

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.980 
but I think if you're looking for
something<00:02:51.400> that's<00:02:52.400> not<00:02:52.460> too<00:02:52.730> expensive<00:02:52.990> that

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
something that's not too expensive that

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.160 
something that's not too expensive that
you<00:02:54.110> can<00:02:54.320> use<00:02:54.530> for<00:02:55.390> multi-tasking<00:02:56.390> whether

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
you can use for multi-tasking whether

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.500 
you can use for multi-tasking whether
you're<00:02:57.350> out<00:02:57.470> on<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.680> water<00:02:57.950> or<00:02:58.370> maybe<00:02:59.120> flying

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
you're out on the water or maybe flying

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.730 
you're out on the water or maybe flying
or<00:02:59.750> maybe<00:02:59.870> just<00:02:59.960> want<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:00.320> store<00:03:00.500> something
