00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 se in cell-my name's not 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.960
 porsche the table tennis coach from bonn 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.389
 and this video is about the question 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.830
 which foot we use with short balls 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.260
 to come forward table tennis cases 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.670
 conquer the table csr example 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.410
 right-handed and I explain it now 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.560
 also for right-handed people for 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.449
 Left-handed is exactly the opposite 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.820
 Assuming we have short forest where we are 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.930
 Both of us have to move too far 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.900
 are gone from the plate 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.870
 there we either have the left foot on 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.160
 right foot forward and I would 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.850
 give you a very simple tip 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.070
 is always the foot for the racket hand 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.000
 So here I am right-handed 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.969
 So right foot 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.450
 both at the far would exist 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.450
 right foot or backhand 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.260
 why the whole thing has a lot to do with the 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.960
 Sleep techniques to do if I am now 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.609
 have the ball in the far forehand out 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.149
 I could be the starting position 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.870
 theoretically left to the front and 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.500
 now the blow 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.659
 but here is the problem yes I'm coming 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.130
 but here it is not enough that we have the 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.080
 but we want to 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.140
 also have a good starting position 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.470
 and if I stand here now my 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.100
 lever goes from the right arm from outside it 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.619
 out of salt body inside rather because 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.420
 we always have it inside and now 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.689
 i here my body but also inside 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.950
 stand and that's two again 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.619
 additionally 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.539
 forces against each other because here 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.159
 nothing is free here I block that 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.770
 merkel on the shoulder that it is not 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.679
 proceeds when I do the same for 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.729
 but do it with your right foot and here 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:51.750
 out it's free here that's already one 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:55.289
 advantage if I now in the back wall 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.630
 I have to go wrong first I could 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:01.049
 I have a good left here 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:05.250
 position and come out again 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:09.539
 okay if I go in with right too 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.160
 Here a good position good focus 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.319
 especially and I do not fall down 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.019
 and here I can also have impact against 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.060
 and came out again 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.739
 the advantage is but if he has a foot 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.739
 that you make small decisions 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.019
 because it's hard to say 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.030
 if you like the ball with me for example 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.280
 whether he has the forehand or us 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.019
 goes crazy and then turns 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.799
 I still leave the question with left 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:37.230
 let's go or go right out of us 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.340
 want to try that belong so easy 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.829
 as possible to put 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.810
 and that's why you always say as 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.720
 right-handed I go no matter what 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.959
 short balles always in the right foot off 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.730
 whether in the back seat or in the 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.810
 intends 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.609
 even if I really accept now 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.500
 and make the banana out of the curtain 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.420
 as well as those with much offshore boil 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.880
 then he often does with his left leg 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.260
 Another start was closer 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.250
 come and now the right foot goes 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.049
 out and here comes the banana st 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.550
 that's why it's always the foot of the 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.500
 take a hand for a short wave 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.740
 Definitely recommendable 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.110
 small tip on the edge is still if you 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.710
 Now here you are , I think I can find it 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.000
 at the bottom 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:24.570
 do not worry if now missing and listening 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.550
 short ball many make the mistake 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:32.410
 if now here is the root ball that 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:35.140
 but never a total dam 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.360
 feet have yes because here no 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.980
 scissors of and therefore always no matter where 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.650
 The ball comes and you stand down like that 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.870
 that I have a wide foot position here 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.850
 I have that weight too 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.680
 can really relocate because I want to 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.870
 do not fall over and that happens when 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.940
 so I always slim down on it 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.430
 Eighth wide foot position deeper 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.980
 focus and really the weight 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.830
 can relocate without over the 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.060
 focus to grab 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.020
 I hope you liked the video 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.850
 was a bit of theory 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.190
 I 'll let you too 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.420
 examples of how to do it and how to do it 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.040
 one knows also still variations 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.730
 make if you step first order 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.590
 makes etc 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.780
 but I only wanted it in general 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.790
 clarify the question maybe helps him 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.140
 one or the other I hope so 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.470
 will do well until next time and 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.470
