00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:04.060
 Willem Middelkoop co-owner of the coc and the step for your money 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.030
 the gold price and has meanwhile pan out is still wise of people to 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.930
 with a mentally still to be purchased as an investment yes we get those questions 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.930
 also very much of it is not on a species 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.060
 but a lot of altigen vita say the last ten years his work in one 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.990
 number rising with the gold price a pack of cards at the gold price we 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.579
 have the graph of the past 40 years 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.749
 then you see that gold corrected for inflation is very easy to pass through 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:34.090
 passes have hit the old top 10 he has seen 80 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.140
 That was his dog's four $ 5,000 per ounce converted for inflation 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.490
 adjusted donners so the samuel of the dollar there is room to 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.090
 about 4 five thousand dollars 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.620
 and ing has made a name for itself as the man who saw the credit crisis coming 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.110
 chairman also recovery short term 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.110
 you see the yard set on the stock market you see a recovery in the economy 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.310
 But that is a bit artificial now that is artificial because of the government 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.200
 and let's say that recovery has been initiated by huge amounts in the 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.690
 economy but it is also a kind of technical recovery you are whole 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.070
 fallen deep that point you can only ask if you look at 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.890
 Sales of company cars 10 were 45 percent lower than a year ago 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.130
 so that is not a real recovery in the broad economy 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.860
 so we were very far down to the 4 by definition recovery but it is none 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.820
 real recovers to the old levels 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.930
 And finally, tents believe that investors are at least 10 percent of it 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.170
 invested capital in gold 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.090
 how has a party divided in-house 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.770
 with me is just over 10 percent in gold but I always say very much physically 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.820
 gold for sale that they are very important if you have a little ability with 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.170
 to put at least 10 to 15 percent of your assets in physical gold 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.800
 CIDSE bankers used to do heavily wealthy clients, which I mostly did 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.950
 many accidents happen to the financial system we have seen it 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.660
 last year were seen the dsb bank 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.520
 so hence that advice but in addition I have the position in addition to the physical 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.520
 I actually bravo I have to say but not 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.400
 up to an 80 90 percent of my more assets 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:14.309
 commodity-related position as well as 80 percent gold and silver positions 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:15.029
 to be 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:18.869
 I already have my own house so you own a lot of real estate 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:22.189
 so my own house is where investment property i also have 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:25.369
 very much in gold and silver and the earlier
