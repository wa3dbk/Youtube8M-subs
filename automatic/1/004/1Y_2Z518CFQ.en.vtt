00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.570
 I am flavio quintana and work in the 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.520
 institute of biology of organisms 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.410
 sailors in the Patagonian national center 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.510
 in puerto madryn I am a researcher 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.710
 principal of the conicet and my area of 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.710
 work in marine biology 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.600
 at the moment I decide to dedicate myself to 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.870
 The science 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.790
 it was very early I had at school 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.160
 primary I was particularly interested 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.320
 animal behavior always and 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.350
 I remember that a companion gave me a gift 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.350
 book 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.730
 sexual behavior of animals that 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.730
 book in high school I was shocked by 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.950
 different reasons 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.540
 and from that I think I started my 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.870
 university career knowing should you 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.449
 have the behavior 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.360
 I would say current research is based on 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.010
 understand the behavior of 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.199
 Creators tops of birds and mammals 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.019
 mariners in the sea understand where they 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.970
 they feed how much time they spend on 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.650
 get food how much energy by taking 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.570
 the sea how much are they consuming from the sea 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.409
 and all that applied to the 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.450
 conservation of this group 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.820
 of animals and the Argentine sea is a 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.620
 set 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.560
 we work mainly with birds 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.479
 marinas and particularly we are dedicated 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.900
 marine birds divers this is because 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.850
 morals 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.070
 however, we also have studies in 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.480
 birds that get their food let's say in 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.520
 the surface of the sea like the petrel 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.720
 giant of the south and some works of the 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.270
 research group has hereinafter 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.480
 also with marine mammals finally 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.310
 basis with elephant seals and sea lions 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.530
 of studying animal behavior in 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.990
 land to try to understand how was the 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.750
 animal behavior of these are 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.520
 birds in particular in the sea 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.960
 when they left our view 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.150
 when they left the coast to 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.280
 feed in the sea for that we had 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.930
 that incorporate technology that we 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.060
 will allow you to follow the movements 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.920
 remote animals we were already incapable 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.380
 to observe them with binoculars with 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.979
 telescopes and we had to follow them in 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.970
 remotely using technology 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.090
 electronic for the study the 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.940
 animal behavior opened us the 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.320
 immense doors because many 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.170
 animals with whom we work 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.900
 many the species that we investigate 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.140
 they explore totally underwater environments 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.510
 inaccessible we place 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.550
 technology to track animals 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.569
 the shape of small instruments those 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.239
 animals are carried 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.010
 instruments record absolutely everything 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.079
 what we ask and we 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.280
 they return that information is really 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.280
 a fascinating job 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.120
 on the subject let's say the similarities in 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.709
 regarding the behavior of the species 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.230
 in malvinas and in the rest of the 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.330
 Argentine continuous platform what 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.110
 we begin to see with just the use 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:00.350
 of technology when we say the group of 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.900
 work saw that elephant seals of the 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.940
 peninsula valdés went to waters 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.160
 around malvinas to feed or 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.050
 they even stopped making breaks breaks 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.940
 on the coasts of malvinas and the same 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.819
 exactly the same with for example 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.790
 southern giant petrel 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.129
 penguins 11 through tracking 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.260
 remote these animals knowing their 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:24.530
 routes you can see the connections that the 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:28.140
 animals make between the continent the 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.510
 Malvinas and even in the churches 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.640
 when one thinks of the Falkland Islands 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.580
 from the point of view of 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.170
 of wildlife and mainly 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.590
 let's say of marine organisms 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.970
 higher this is to say marine micros 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.030
 somehow what he does is 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.260
 simply corroborate this idea of ​​a 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.230
 of a unit 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:54.160
 unique functional ecological 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:57.940
 clearly see that the continent 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.880
 of Argentina and the Malvinas Islands are 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.460
 a unit the seabirds what they do 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.640
 and marine mammals in general is 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:09.010
 I usually underline this idea 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.709
 first of all if one thinks that is 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.150
 we should know that we share from 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.880
 the point of view of birds and 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.400
 marine mammals between malvinas and the 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.320
 continent and first of all we share 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.290
 a lot of species or the same 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.600
 species that breed on the islands 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.700
 Malvinas reproduce also in the part 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.530
 continental of Argentina 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.050
 many species of marine mammals 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.450
 especially in sea lions and elephants 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.780
 marine reproduce both in the peninsula 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.900
 valdés as in the Malvinas Islands 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.820
 if we talk about penguins for example 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.860
 yellow magellan penguin 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.790
 Gentoo penguin all the species that 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:51.300
 share let's say these areas of 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:53.759
 reproduction in 1 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.650
 that is with respect to what happens in the 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:58.169
 land when these animals are in 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.000
 land to reproduce if we go and 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.139
 we make a look from the sea this 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.990
 conjunction as a functional unit 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:09.240
 ecological falklands continent of the 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.180
 Argentine republic is still even greater 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.460
 because these animals share the 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.479
 same places in the sea look for the 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.430
 food in the same places they sail 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:22.680
 they fly over the same waters or are 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.020
 the same depths are in fact 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.810
 can find animals coming 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.120
 of the Falkland Islands and the area 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.669
 continental of Argentina in the same 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.150
 marine sector that is looking for food 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.880
 it is clearly a 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.980
 something that totally amalgamated by the 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.550
 wildlife there is no way there is no 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:47.020
 way to stop 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:49.570
 and much more if we think this in 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:53.590
 oceanographic terms let's say still 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:56.080
 this unit is greater if the currents 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.930
 that govern the entire system of 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.569
 marine ecosystem of the South Atlantic are 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.869
 the same 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:05.839
 the oceanographic component in the waters 

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:08.279
 around malvinas and the component 

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:10.080
 oceanographic in the waters let's say the 

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:12.449
 Argentine continental shelf 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.020
 location to the north is practically the 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:19.190
 they are governed from it 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:22.460
 the homogenization of the ecological landscape 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:24.530
 of the South Atlantic is given by this 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:28.789
 this ability that animals have 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:30.979
 to unite all this this environment and that 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:34.810
 I think it 's another example of the 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:34.810
 Argentine sovereignty over the silhouette
