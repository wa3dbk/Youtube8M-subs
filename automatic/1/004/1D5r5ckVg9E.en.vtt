00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.770
 Hello, how are I going to show you how 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:09.490
 make the change of a nissan frontier 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.230
 2000 what I'm going to change is the 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.629
 Fan clutch or fent clutch 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:19.310
 how do you want to call 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:23.480
 This one I bought it in auto cost me 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.610
 of 650 pesos this is something easy to 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.520
 change this since if you take it with the 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:32.840
 mechanical, it charges you 300 to 400 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.630
 weights this like realizing that you're 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.970
 damaged good to me what happened to me is that 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.380
 this radiator cap this semester 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.410
 I 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:45.230
 it shows because the troca sometimes 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.600
 walk at a high temperature here can 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.850
 see this that they put some silicon 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.550
 but because that does not work there's nothing 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.170
 more than changing the take it with a with 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.840
 a professional to change it 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.090
 this once it has already been changed as it 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.940
 What I 'm going to do is change them 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.740
 I say he 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:08.500
 the clutch the fan even this 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:10.869
 how to realize if it is damaged then 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.909
 this here I can give an account because 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:17.290
 has something of has some fire this 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.360
 this regularly should not have 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.759
 no fire this has some fire 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.299
 apart when the engine is hot what 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.610
 I turn off and keep turning what it tells me 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:31.030
 that already and it is already a little 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.880
 damaged this good here I'm going to show you 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:38.060
 The first thing is to disconnect the 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.610
 the negative of the battery 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:45.520
 this is an average key what I 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.520
 indicates that to have no problem 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.470
 i 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.310
 once disconnected 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.480
 it is already disconnected we remove it are 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.020
 they just have four four 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.970
 screws that we can see there with the 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.030
 key number 10 and we remove them is something 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.470
 it's something easy, it's not something 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.470
 by the way how is it 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:35.610
 Well, as you can see, I will remove the 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.610
 the four screws is already loose this 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.450
 in kilos I have them but yes I am going 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.769
 having a little bit to remove them what 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.110
 What I'm going to do is remove the lid 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.750
 radiator simply has three 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.780
 screws here is one 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.300
 and there's the other one and it's this we're going 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.100
 remove with number 10 also quoted 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.940
 remove this hose and it's so that 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.940
 let me get it out 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.069
 good as you can see this artist those 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.230
 screws ready the lid a little bit for 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.209
 I 'm like the hose because I do not 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.120
 It has a little anti frizz but 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.010
 really more is not much and here I have 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.260
 space to be able to remove it without any 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.930
 problem even to screw the 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.700
 and you can realize here is this already 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.670
 it's a bit dirty, you have to clean it, there's 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.440
 that change the blades and this is the 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.470
 number 10 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.160
 This is the change and right now they 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:35.580
 show as how to install 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.550
 and as you can see, I removed the four 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.550
 screws this is the old one here I have the 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.380
 new unique pole that we do is to put them 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.260
 space in the new we put the 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.890
 screws I show you how to install 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.500
 the energy install the new the 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.650
 epithelium the four screws this good 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.360
 polonica difference is that here is a 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.100
 little bit different this is closed and 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.810
 is open but that is not any 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:06.720
 problem this now I will continue this 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.020
 to install it and tighten the screws is 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.020
 something 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:17.190
 Well, this one I already pressed well 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:20.889
 the four screws is already the new 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:24.159
 cen clutch this one 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:27.880
 I put the lid on him first 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:30.730
 I put the stage there is a screw 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.670
 and there is the other screw is this 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:36.220
 screw make sure that from below 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.060
 'assemble well this connects this small 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.690
 hose 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:44.290
 the other hose I already put his 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:47.169
 terminal add a little liquid to 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:50.319
 what not so that he does not 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:54.190
 that there is no corruption you sell it 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:57.849
