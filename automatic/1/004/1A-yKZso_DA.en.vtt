00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
a lot of oil mid lane and i don't mean

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.380 
a lot of oil mid lane and i don't mean
left<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.550> right<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.910> middle<00:01:00.120> i<00:01:00.210> mean

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
left to right in the middle i mean

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.560 
left to right in the middle i mean
distance<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.140> middle<00:01:02.180> so<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.210> really

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
distance in the middle so it really

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.289 
distance in the middle so it really
makes<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.899> breakpoint<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.619> lot<00:01:04.799> more

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
makes the breakpoint a lot more

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.429 
makes the breakpoint a lot more
difficult<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.450> maintain<00:01:06.600> because<00:01:07.260> that's

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
difficult to maintain because that's

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.039 
difficult to maintain because that's
where<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.650> pattern<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.159> flattest<00:01:08.900> i'm<00:01:09.900> going
