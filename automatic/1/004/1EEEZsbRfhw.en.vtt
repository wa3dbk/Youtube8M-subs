00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.959
 hello welcome to the board 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.760
 In this class I'm going to talk about mutations. 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:16.779
 Let's suppose that here I am. 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:20.560
 representing a dna molecule in which 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:24.699
 happened the substitution of goiania for the 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.470
 adenine promoting change in maid 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.710
 dna sequence 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.869
 these substitutions that cause 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.810
 change in the DNA sequence 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:39.489
 I call mutations that mutation 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:42.730
 occurring following a gene will give 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:45.940
 origin to a new gene or a new version 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.920
 of the gene that is the allele thus producing 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.850
 a new feature for your 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.670
 carrier 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:56.710
 if this feature is advantageous 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:01:01.559
 this new gem will be maintained by the process 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:04.420
 of natural selection 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.140
 we can say that each individual 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.619
 currently exist as a whole. 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:16.060
 single genetic result of the accumulation of 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:19.659
 advantageous mutations that have been 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.540
 perpetuating billions of years ago due to 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.180
 performance of natural selection 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:29.049
 but not always a mutation will 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.720
 conferring an advantageous characteristic is 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.299
 the case, for example, of sickle cell anemia 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:38.200
 where there is the substitution of a single base 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:41.170
 progeny in the hemoglobin gene that 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.200
 is a protein constituent of red blood cells 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.229
 so here I represented a stretch 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.009
 gene where there is a substitution of 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:55.170
 thymine by adenine this normal stretch 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:02:01.359
 will be transcribed into a messenger 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:04.930
 agree g1 to g5 hinders glutamine 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:08.320
 and this stretch of mutated gene will be 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:13.530
 transcribed in rna messenger agree g 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:16.319
 og coding is worth nothing 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.040
 because of the replacement of a single 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:23.010
 amino acid in the hemoglobin chain a 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.760
 in a scythe format 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.100
 which carries a lower concentration 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.140
 Insufficient oxygen in relation to and 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.480
 mÃ¡rcio is normal that carries a 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.470
 insufficient quantity of 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.870
 oxygen 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.930
 It is worth remembering that for a mutation to be 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.290
 harmful to the body, I must have a 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.630
 accumulation of mutations and not 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.340
 isolated form as for example in a 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.640
 single cell 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.970
 and not always the change of a single 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.940
 base changes the protein 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:02.250
 Let's suppose that here I have a passage 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:04.860
 t tt gene that has changed to 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.130
 ttc 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.310
 this normal stretch will be transcribed into a 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:18.989
 rn the messenger agree 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:23.340
 ah ah ah that encodes lysine and that 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:28.170
 mutated passage will be transcribed into an rna 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:31.860
 messenger with cotton aaag that 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.170
 also encodes lysine, ie 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.049
 protein encoded by this mutated gene 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.329
 shall not be subject to any change in 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.310
 to your friends or newborns 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:44.010
 then what I have presented so far 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.260
 we can conclude that mutations do not 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.380
 always harmful 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:53.040
 they can be neutral by not changing the 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.680
 organism or may be advantageous by being 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.390
 important for diversity as well. 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:04.140
 of good organisms and what causes these 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.010
 changes occurring in the molecule of the 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.850
 dna 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.940
 good mutations can be spontaneous 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:15.720
 which usually occur during the 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.400
 process of dna replication due to 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.919
 errors that occur during this 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:24.979
 process such as matching 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:27.400
 or wrong base mutations can be 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:30.820
 induced by the call 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:34.330
 the agents in the Taj and the Argentinean nikos 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.820
 agents may be physical which is the case 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:40.300
 for example of x- rays 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.430
 Another example of a physical agent is 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:47.020
 rays 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:49.030
 or these agents may be clinical 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:53.190
 is the case, for example, of nicotine 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:55.960
 found in cigarettes and the derivatives of 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:05:02.229
 hydrocarbon fossil fuels 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:06.850
 like gasoline and good diesel oil 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:08.889
 mutations happen all the time in the 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.930
 dna molecule 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:15.220
 however the cells developed 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:17.830
 mechanisms that repair these errors in a 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.699
 of these mechanisms a set of enzymes 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:24.190
 called a complex then nuclease is not 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:26.020
 need to record this name just know 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.020
 indigenous people are working the time 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.210
 all repairing these errors will know 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:36.310
 the region 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:37.510
 with the mutation binds and cuts this 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.949
 region 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:45.940
 later this region is eliminated 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:49.740
 of the dna molecule and an enzyme of that 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:56.340
 complex which has polymerase activity 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:06:00.610
 synthesizes the new section of the dna 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:02.260
 producing a new dna molecule without 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.139
 the population error 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.750
 these repair mechanisms are 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:10.110
 important because they maintain the 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:13.090
 characteristics of the organisms and 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:16.300
 consequently the survival 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:20.460
 Good, I hope you understood. 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.460
 good studies and even more
