so<00:03:23.629> no<00:03:23.989> trying<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:24.319> do<00:03:24.440> something<00:03:25.129> I<00:03:25.569> wasted

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
so no trying to do something I wasted

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.960 
so no trying to do something I wasted
most<00:03:26.959> of<00:03:27.109> my<00:03:27.230> energy<00:03:27.650> on<00:03:27.680> well<00:03:27.980> I<00:03:28.609> don't<00:03:28.909> think

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
most of my energy on well I don't think

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.080 
most of my energy on well I don't think
using<00:03:29.269> my<00:03:29.480> lasers<00:03:29.900> don't<00:03:30.019> work<00:03:30.230> down<00:03:30.500> here<00:03:31.090> hmm

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
using my lasers don't work down here hmm

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.369 
using my lasers don't work down here hmm
I<00:03:32.510> guess<00:03:32.750> who<00:03:32.840> wants<00:03:32.930> to<00:03:33.079> think<00:03:33.170> there's

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:33.379 
I guess who wants to think there's

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.910 
I guess who wants to think there's
something<00:03:33.530> else

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
something else

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.640
