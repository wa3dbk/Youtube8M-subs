let's<00:00:22.810> begin<00:00:22.990> our<00:00:23.320> discussion<00:00:24.250> of<00:00:24.490> metering

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:25.450 
let's begin our discussion of metering

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.840 
let's begin our discussion of metering
with<00:00:25.869> discussing<00:00:26.410> the<00:00:26.680> two<00:00:26.860> basic<00:00:27.279> types

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:27.850 
with discussing the two basic types

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.350 
with discussing the two basic types
there's<00:00:28.840> reflected<00:00:29.830> which<00:00:30.430> is<00:00:30.640> found<00:00:31.000> in

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
there's reflected which is found in

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.450 
there's reflected which is found in
cameras<00:00:31.869> because<00:00:32.200> it's<00:00:32.410> easy<00:00:32.590> to<00:00:32.860> measure<00:00:33.070> a

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
cameras because it's easy to measure a

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.240 
cameras because it's easy to measure a
light<00:00:34.090> from<00:00:34.450> the<00:00:34.780> camera<00:00:35.230> reflected<00:00:36.040> light

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
light from the camera reflected light

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.430 
light from the camera reflected light
and<00:00:36.460> then<00:00:37.120> they're<00:00:37.270> sensitive<00:00:37.780> which<00:00:37.989> is<00:00:38.200> done

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
and then they're sensitive which is done

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.430 
and then they're sensitive which is done
with<00:00:38.559> a<00:00:38.590> handheld<00:00:39.070> meter<00:00:39.280> which<00:00:40.030> is<00:00:40.290> used<00:00:41.290> to

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
with a handheld meter which is used to

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.840 
with a handheld meter which is used to
measure<00:00:41.620> the<00:00:41.980> amount<00:00:42.280> of<00:00:42.340> light<00:00:42.550> that<00:00:42.580> is

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
measure the amount of light that is

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.250 
measure the amount of light that is
falling<00:00:43.180> on<00:00:43.360> this<00:00:43.540> subject

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
falling on this subject

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.530 
falling on this subject
the<00:00:44.920> problem<00:00:45.370> with<00:00:45.550> reflected<00:00:46.360> light

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
the problem with reflected light

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.290 
the problem with reflected light
metering<00:00:47.050> is<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:48.309> light<00:00:48.489> meter<00:00:48.699> only<00:00:49.059> sees

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
metering is the light meter only sees

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.090 
metering is the light meter only sees
gray<00:00:49.690> and<00:00:50.050> the<00:00:50.379> amount<00:00:50.650> of<00:00:50.710> light<00:00:50.920> that's

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
gray and the amount of light that's

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.399 
gray and the amount of light that's
reflected<00:00:51.250> from<00:00:51.790> the<00:00:51.970> subject<00:00:52.449> so<00:00:53.199> it's

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409 
reflected from the subject so it's

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:56.009 
reflected from the subject so it's
trying<00:00:53.680> to<00:00:53.860> resolve<00:00:54.129> everything<00:00:54.729> to<00:00:55.000> a<00:00:55.269> shade

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
trying to resolve everything to a shade

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.390 
trying to resolve everything to a shade
of<00:00:57.210> basically<00:00:58.210> gray<00:00:58.589> it's<00:00:59.589> color<00:00:59.890> photograph

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
of basically gray it's color photograph

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.729 
of basically gray it's color photograph
but<00:01:00.550> it's<00:01:00.699> trying<00:01:00.940> to<00:01:01.030> resolve<00:01:01.330> everything<00:01:02.199> to

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
but it's trying to resolve everything to

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.189 
but it's trying to resolve everything to
a<00:01:02.769> shade<00:01:03.309> of<00:01:03.460> grey<00:01:03.670> so<00:01:04.540> if<00:01:04.900> you've<00:01:05.170> taken

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
a shade of grey so if you've taken

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.070 
a shade of grey so if you've taken
pictures<00:01:05.830> of<00:01:06.040> snow<00:01:06.310> or<00:01:06.640> Beach<00:01:07.330> and<00:01:07.720> you<00:01:07.750> see

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
pictures of snow or Beach and you see

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.350 
pictures of snow or Beach and you see
that<00:01:08.229> the<00:01:08.409> snow<00:01:08.620> is<00:01:08.650> light<00:01:09.040> gray<00:01:09.340> or<00:01:09.670> that<00:01:10.240> the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
that the snow is light gray or that the

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.450 
that the snow is light gray or that the
beach<00:01:10.510> is<00:01:10.720> light<00:01:10.930> gray<00:01:11.229> or<00:01:11.440> if<00:01:11.890> you<00:01:11.979> do<00:01:12.130> a<00:01:12.159> black

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
beach is light gray or if you do a black

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.330 
beach is light gray or if you do a black
cat<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:14.080> black<00:01:14.320> cat<00:01:15.060> will<00:01:16.060> come<00:01:16.090> out<00:01:16.450> as<00:01:16.750> a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
cat the black cat will come out as a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.649 
cat the black cat will come out as a
darker<00:01:18.340> shade<00:01:18.549> of<00:01:18.610> grey<00:01:18.880> in<00:01:19.060> the<00:01:19.090> snow<00:01:19.390> and<00:01:19.570> the

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
darker shade of grey in the snow and the

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.029 
darker shade of grey in the snow and the
beach<00:01:19.810> will<00:01:20.020> come<00:01:20.140> out<00:01:20.260> lighter<00:01:20.500> shades<00:01:20.829> of

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
beach will come out lighter shades of

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.219 
beach will come out lighter shades of
grey<00:01:21.420> instant<00:01:22.420> works<00:01:22.570> great<00:01:22.869> if<00:01:23.020> you're<00:01:23.200> a

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
grey instant works great if you're a

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.069 
grey instant works great if you're a
great<00:01:23.530> person<00:01:23.979> great<00:01:24.009> background<00:01:24.700> whatever

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
great person great background whatever

other than that incident might be your

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.999 
other than that incident might be your
better<00:01:28.119> choice<00:01:28.450> but<00:01:29.049> some<00:01:29.289> people<00:01:29.590> average

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
better choice but some people average

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.639 
better choice but some people average
between<00:01:30.789> the<00:01:31.090> two<00:01:33.990> here<00:01:34.990> we're<00:01:35.170> looking<00:01:35.289> at

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
between the two here we're looking at

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.459 
between the two here we're looking at
three<00:01:36.280> subjects<00:01:36.820> that<00:01:37.090> are<00:01:37.270> being<00:01:37.600> metered

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
three subjects that are being metered

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.620 
three subjects that are being metered
with<00:01:38.770> reflected<00:01:39.609> light<00:01:39.759> metering<00:01:40.090> like<00:01:40.359> in

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
with reflected light metering like in

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.929 
with reflected light metering like in
the<00:01:40.750> camera<00:01:41.229> if<00:01:41.920> you<00:01:42.039> notice<00:01:42.369> we're<00:01:42.579> metering

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
the camera if you notice we're metering

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.029 
the camera if you notice we're metering
a<00:01:43.000> white<00:01:43.240> plate<00:01:43.539> that<00:01:43.719> meters<00:01:44.680> at<00:01:45.659> 125th<00:01:46.659> at

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
a white plate that meters at 125th at

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:52.200 
a white plate that meters at 125th at
f/32<00:01:48.039> a<00:01:48.310> gray<00:01:48.969> plate<00:01:49.270> at<00:01:49.570> f-16<00:01:50.500> at<00:01:50.649> 125th<00:01:51.399> and<00:01:51.729> a

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
f/32 a gray plate at f-16 at 125th and a

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.999 
f/32 a gray plate at f-16 at 125th and a
black<00:01:52.420> plate<00:01:53.109> metered<00:01:53.890> at<00:01:54.479> f/8<00:01:55.479> at<00:01:55.659> 125th<00:01:56.500> the

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
black plate metered at f/8 at 125th the

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.830 
black plate metered at f/8 at 125th the
reason<00:01:57.399> being<00:01:57.609> is<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:58.090> white<00:01:58.119> plate<00:01:58.600> is

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
reason being is the white plate is

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.200 
reason being is the white plate is
reflecting<00:01:59.439> a<00:01:59.530> lot<00:01:59.710> more<00:02:00.039> light<00:02:00.369> than<00:02:01.179> the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
reflecting a lot more light than the

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.810 
reflecting a lot more light than the
gray<00:02:01.570> plate<00:02:01.869> or<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.170> black<00:02:02.469> plate<00:02:02.799> and<00:02:03.100> thus

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
gray plate or the black plate and thus

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.419 
gray plate or the black plate and thus
they're<00:02:04.119> going<00:02:04.390> to<00:02:04.570> meet<00:02:04.780> her<00:02:04.929> at<00:02:05.429> different

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
they're going to meet her at different

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.540 
they're going to meet her at different
levels<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.810> problem<00:02:08.320> is<00:02:08.500> is<00:02:08.800> is<00:02:09.100> the<00:02:09.340> white

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
levels the problem is is is the white

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.700 
levels the problem is is is the white
plate<00:02:09.850> should<00:02:10.210> we<00:02:10.390> should<00:02:11.080> meet<00:02:11.260> her<00:02:11.410> a<00:02:11.440> lot

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
plate should we should meet her a lot

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.590 
plate should we should meet her a lot
more<00:02:11.950> light<00:02:12.160> or<00:02:12.400> should<00:02:12.670> reflect<00:02:12.940> a<00:02:13.210> lot<00:02:13.360> more

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
more light or should reflect a lot more

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.880 
more light or should reflect a lot more
light<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:14.410> as<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.520> grey<00:02:15.730> plate<00:02:16.030> should<00:02:16.890> not

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
light and as the grey plate should not

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.790 
light and as the grey plate should not
reflect<00:02:18.280> as<00:02:18.780> much<00:02:19.780> light<00:02:20.020> as<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.319> white<00:02:20.530> and

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
reflect as much light as the white and

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.760 
reflect as much light as the white and
the<00:02:21.250> black<00:02:21.430> plate<00:02:21.790> should<00:02:22.260> reflect<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.530> least

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
the black plate should reflect the least

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.300 
the black plate should reflect the least
light<00:02:24.010> of<00:02:24.160> all<00:02:24.340> but<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.210> camera<00:02:26.100> with<00:02:27.100> its

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
light of all but the camera with its

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.650
