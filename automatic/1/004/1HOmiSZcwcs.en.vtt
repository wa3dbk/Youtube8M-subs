yards 45 yards it was very very far away
and<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.460> thought<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.850> was<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.210> against<00:01:36.900> noia<00:01:37.110> I

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
and I thought it was in against noia I

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.710 
and I thought it was in against noia I
think<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.650> was<00:01:37.829> but<00:01:38.220> no<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.820> wasn't<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.630> was

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
think it was but no it wasn't it was

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.520 
think it was but no it wasn't it was
just<00:01:39.930> white

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
just white

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.319 
just white
he<00:01:40.710> has<00:01:40.860> good<00:01:41.070> positioning<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.729> thought<00:01:42.000> his

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
he has good positioning I thought his

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.210 
he has good positioning I thought his
work<00:01:42.570> race<00:01:42.840> will<00:01:43.079> be<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.409> problem<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:44.009> that

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
work race will be a problem in that

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.310 
work race will be a problem in that
sense<00:01:44.430> at<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.670> computer<00:01:45.149> all<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:45.689> no<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.960> wasn't

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
sense at a computer all but no it wasn't

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.139 
sense at a computer all but no it wasn't
he<00:01:46.439> was<00:01:46.590> making<00:01:46.920> runs<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.520> every<00:01:47.939> time<00:01:48.119> I

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
he was making runs and every time I

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.789 
he was making runs and every time I
wanted<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.509> see<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.750> know<00:01:49.020> an<00:01:49.140> over<00:01:49.380> top<00:01:49.590> board

wanted to see you know an over top board

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.550 
wanted to see you know an over top board

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
he was there making the run and also he

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.200 
he was there making the run and also he
assisted<00:01:53.009> my<00:01:53.189> strikers<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:53.850> guy's<00:01:54.030> got

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
assisted my strikers this guy's got

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.789 
assisted my strikers this guy's got
great<00:01:54.509> pulsing<00:01:54.990> if<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.200> wanna<00:01:55.320> cross<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.710> as

well

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
well

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.010 
well
I<00:01:56.159> think<00:01:56.579> he<00:01:56.759> he<00:01:57.090> assisted<00:01:57.450> my<00:01:57.600> strike<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:57.990> a

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
I think he he assisted my strike is a

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.590 
I think he he assisted my strike is a
lot<00:01:58.290> from<00:01:58.469> corners<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.399> very<00:02:00.030> very<00:02:00.299> good

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
lot from corners so very very good

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.209 
lot from corners so very very good
playmaker<00:02:01.140> at<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.439> same<00:02:01.649> time<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.100> if<00:02:02.189> you

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
playmaker at the same time so if you

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.440 
playmaker at the same time so if you
don't<00:02:02.310> like<00:02:02.549> him<00:02:02.700> as<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.820> sense<00:02:03.090> attacking

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
don't like him as a sense attacking

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.330 
don't like him as a sense attacking
midfielder<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.259> could<00:02:04.439> play<00:02:04.590> as<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.829> central

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
midfielder you could play as a central

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.039 
midfielder you could play as a central
midfield<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.060> he<00:02:06.180> plays<00:02:06.420> really<00:02:06.659> well<00:02:06.780> in

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
midfield and he plays really well in

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.059 
midfield and he plays really well in
that<00:02:07.259> position<00:02:07.649> as<00:02:07.770> well

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
that position as well

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.430 
that position as well
now<00:02:08.369> his<00:02:08.520> negatives<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.599> let<00:02:09.780> me<00:02:09.899> start<00:02:10.379> with

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
now his negatives so let me start with

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.680 
now his negatives so let me start with
his<00:02:10.739> biggest<00:02:11.039> negative<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.000> as<00:02:12.120> his<00:02:12.360> pace

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
his biggest negative and as his pace

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.760 
his biggest negative and as his pace
basically

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
basically

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.620 
basically
I<00:02:13.830> found<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:14.370> quite<00:02:14.490> hard<00:02:14.610> sometimes<00:02:15.120> to

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
I found it quite hard sometimes to

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.330 
I found it quite hard sometimes to
create<00:02:16.050> space<00:02:16.380> with<00:02:16.590> him<00:02:16.710> because<00:02:17.100> even

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
create space with him because even

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.070 
create space with him because even
though<00:02:17.850> this<00:02:18.000> guy's<00:02:18.210> got<00:02:18.420> high<00:02:18.600> dribbling

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
though this guy's got high dribbling

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.320 
though this guy's got high dribbling
it's<00:02:19.260> easy<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.710> dribble<00:02:19.980> past<00:02:20.220> defenders<00:02:20.730> but

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
it's easy to dribble past defenders but

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.240 
it's easy to dribble past defenders but
even<00:02:21.810> though<00:02:21.960> when<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.230> do<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.950> create

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
even though when you do that and create

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.830 
even though when you do that and create
your<00:02:23.310> own<00:02:23.400> space<00:02:23.730> they<00:02:24.030> easily<00:02:24.390> catch<00:02:24.630> up

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
your own space they easily catch up

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.780 
your own space they easily catch up
before<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.230> could<00:02:25.350> unleash<00:02:25.710> the<00:02:25.950> shot<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.430> as

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
before you could unleash the shot and as

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.520 
before you could unleash the shot and as
you<00:02:26.940> guys<00:02:27.060> know<00:02:27.300> in<00:02:27.420> Ultimate<00:02:27.810> Team<00:02:27.930> many

you guys know in Ultimate Team many
Center<00:02:28.950> backs<00:02:29.160> in<00:02:29.460> this<00:02:29.850> game-mode<00:02:30.120> are

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
Center backs in this game-mode are

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.140 
Center backs in this game-mode are
 fast<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:32.070> they're<00:02:32.220> really<00:02:32.670> much

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
 fast and they're really much

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.510 
 fast and they're really much
faster<00:02:33.510> damn<00:02:34.050> crews<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:35.340> is<00:02:35.490> a

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
faster damn crews so that is a

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.700 
faster damn crews so that is a
huge<00:02:35.940> problem<00:02:36.300> that<00:02:36.480> I<00:02:36.570> found<00:02:36.870> with<00:02:37.110> him<00:02:37.290> now

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
huge problem that I found with him now

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.810 
huge problem that I found with him now
if<00:02:37.860> you're<00:02:38.010> playing<00:02:38.190> him<00:02:38.340> as<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.460> central

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
if you're playing him as a central

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.100 
if you're playing him as a central
midfielder<00:02:38.940> this<00:02:39.330> shouldn't<00:02:39.600> be<00:02:39.690> much<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:39.960> a

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
midfielder this shouldn't be much of a

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.810 
midfielder this shouldn't be much of a
problem<00:02:40.350> because<00:02:40.710> you<00:02:40.830> want<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.100> be<00:02:41.250> expecting

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
problem because you want to be expecting

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.700 
problem because you want to be expecting
him<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:41.970> shoot<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.660> lot<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:42.960> the<00:02:43.080> time<00:02:43.290> now

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
him to shoot it a lot of the time now

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.500 
him to shoot it a lot of the time now
it's<00:02:43.860> like<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.130> said<00:02:44.340> his<00:02:44.490> agility<00:02:44.850> isn't<00:02:45.390> that

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
it's like I said his agility isn't that

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.960 
it's like I said his agility isn't that
great<00:02:45.810> only<00:02:46.140> 81<00:02:46.470> for<00:02:46.740> a<00:02:46.800> 6-foot<00:02:47.280> earth

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
great only 81 for a 6-foot earth

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.390 
great only 81 for a 6-foot earth
I<00:02:48.000> think<00:02:48.390> he's<00:02:48.510> 6-foot<00:02:48.930> yeahtool<00:02:49.590> player<00:02:49.860> it

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
I think he's 6-foot yeahtool player it

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.250 
I think he's 6-foot yeahtool player it
means<00:02:50.730> his<00:02:50.940> dribbling<00:02:51.330> has<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.690> come<00:02:51.930> down<00:02:52.230> a

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
means his dribbling has to come down a

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.440 
means his dribbling has to come down a
bit<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.800> because<00:02:53.100> his<00:02:53.250> pace<00:02:53.460> is<00:02:53.670> slow<00:02:53.910> you

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
bit and because his pace is slow you

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.930 
bit and because his pace is slow you
won't<00:02:54.630> find<00:02:54.900> him<00:02:55.080> as<00:02:55.230> agile<00:02:55.770> as<00:02:55.800> you<00:02:56.190> think<00:02:56.520> he

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
won't find him as agile as you think he

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.850 
won't find him as agile as you think he
is<00:02:57.090> he's<00:02:57.390> got<00:02:57.540> freestyle<00:02:58.020> skills<00:02:58.230> like<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.590> said

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
is he's got freestyle skills like I said

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.000 
is he's got freestyle skills like I said
and<00:02:59.070> I<00:02:59.580> found<00:03:00.000> him<00:03:00.180> quite<00:03:00.210> weak<00:03:01.050> so<00:03:01.440> he<00:03:01.770> won't

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
and I found him quite weak so he won't
