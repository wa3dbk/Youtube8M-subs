00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
gameplay the biggest thing I think is

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.119 
gameplay the biggest thing I think is
the<00:00:45.899> coop<00:00:46.140> thing<00:00:46.350> right<00:00:46.530> that's<00:00:46.770> that's<00:00:47.010> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
the coop thing right that's that's the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.540 
the coop thing right that's that's the
huge<00:00:47.280> thing<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.850> then<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.750> top<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.110> it

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
huge thing and then on top of that it

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.369 
huge thing and then on top of that it
tries<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.579> modulate<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.210> drama<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:51.960> if<00:00:52.289> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
tries to modulate the drama so if the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.010 
tries to modulate the drama so if the
team<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.710> getting<00:00:52.829> really<00:00:53.280> worked<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
team is getting really worked and the
