00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:29.619
 but I'm going to have a lot of problems 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.610
 Pollution overpopulation global warming 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.610
 and just when we thought it could not get any worse 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.490
 they have nothing 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.140
 I'm one of the last not to the 1 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.960
 that's me in my hometown I do not go anywhere to every debtor 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.230
 does or does not 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.820
 I thought it over correctly and 67 is capable of surviving and decide 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.319
 Has 

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:59.230
 everyone does 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.600
 I am in a very active lifestyle here 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.810
 but that is 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.280
 to 27 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.700
 even with the big role model 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.970
 I do not think so 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.460
 is 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.460
 and then, of course, nobleman 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.659
 by the hard-hitting partner horse 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.740
 It was not last night 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.590
 my mother always told me some best something was going on 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.170
 Any interested party should want the pieces strong again 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.570
 the sixth Sawicki awaits 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.570
 I'll have the employee this week already 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.220
 the best thing about being all of the last survivors in the world is 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.290
 the highly infectious Kabul on all levels 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.240
 Dr 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.240
 Dieter did not know what she was about to have the internet 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.740
 the decisive factor is the cool
