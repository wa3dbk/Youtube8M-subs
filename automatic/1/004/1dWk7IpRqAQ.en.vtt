00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:14.509
 yes hello people 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.859
 I have a new video for you today 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.699
 after a long time finally again 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:19.500
 I have 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.589
 and already said that it is not good 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:23.249
 beautiful 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:26.519
 here once my g110 toiled 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.659
 and now I've taken the trouble 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:31.360
 and immediately phoned Blue Tec 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.520
 Susanne Klatten wrote an e-mail 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.570
 and that was relatively easy 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.420
 I've got it 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.160
 Picture Mozilla now confirmed and describe what was broken 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.930
 and that's what I did last week Thursday 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.000
 today is Monday 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 and it is now announced a church man 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.570
 if his animals 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.450
 the destination is located 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.260
 I felt like I did 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
 because old Kadir t the 110th 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.090
 but do not be deterred 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.090
 Euro 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.360
 40,000 euros is manifold also Daimler goes and keeps the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.780
 commercial 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.780
 the 110th 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.330
 We also can take percent technique to buy market 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.760
 what's on it 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.200
 to identify the Austrian post office 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.200
 I need to go 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.950
 I already had that time 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.960
 if the pensioner already knows I now own all the animals 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.600
 that also applies to problem-free was broken so again and again to speak 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.520
 not only recommend 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.840
 as described male approx 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.840
 St 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.480
 that's the keyboard it draws frustration 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.590
 around 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.590
 You can see a picture of a usb port here 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.639
 us the Odie o entry and exit 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:10.740
 comment on info 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.740
 Elkin plug 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:17.029
 make the partners 

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:18.299
 Goal of this 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:19.909
 Meet in Brussels 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.909
 Plank 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:30.299
 the success 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.909
 carton 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.909
 then she jumped and drove her Mercedes 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:42.339
 and then, of course, with care in a silo 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.639
 already the boxes and welds 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.019
 loud what nobody reads 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.949
 Xing is packed so wonderfully 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:54.849
 thereupon 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.269
 calls for around 40 products have over 500 open direction Schumacher 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.809
 Federer leads 40 15 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:06.809
 Hertha hopes 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.539
 were more strongly represented 

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:13.539
 So I have to do the tournament 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.269
 Chris Herperger and the Kurzweil 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.019
 Clever Behringer 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.759
 an eon-trained 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:25.379
 Lechner for a year after Mandelsons 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:26.659
 agreed 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:29.659
 all finisher Hirschmann finds the night 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.339
 feels that pleasing little 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:36.289
 These will only be ten years old 

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:39.289
 ridiculous the friend with striking building 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:42.939
 water samples 

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:48.849
 I actually had 100 subscribers to start the Blue 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:52.429
 but so big because they are the "Focus" 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.999
 in the chamber 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:57.599
 Percent so big 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.709
 Of course not intended 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.829
 close 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.370
 that may be more in the direction of 20 euros is good if 

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:06.479
 go or something 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.329
 "I can not do more," he said 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.329
 why I was born here 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.969
 we all that 110 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:17.759
 if someone wants to have 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:22.680
 and the one who is ready to pay for the shipping there is telling me to do it 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.460
 Gludovatz or tilted 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.460
 The consumption is not only quick and, however, 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.520
 I do not know about Erkner so what do I know if you have someone? 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.189
 want 

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:35.020
 should be the value of the archives 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.590
 Reichert with the Clean 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.590
 He should add two different things to a passer-by 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:43.479
 That's what it's all about, first of all 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.490
 theoretically I could do interviews as well as 110 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.439
 around 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:52.839
 we have to write the comments what he thinks so if you want that 

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:55.580
 or not 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.580
 So who would you like to see from the boxing? 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.840
 then I can only say prevent you 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.059
 to leave the ladder 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:07.969
 possible comments under 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:10.800
 as a favorite the video that of course super 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.559
 Helping percent or more very far 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:17.330
 I'm always happy about subscribers, so you know what she's got to do 

00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:18.219
 are not at first
