00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
don't think we've ever done anything

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.690 
don't think we've ever done anything
conventionally<00:00:49.500> when<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.890> kind<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.250> hold<00:00:50.489> his

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
hand I just have a very very strong

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
hand I just have a very very strong
sense<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.210> feels<00:00:54.210> right<00:00:55.170> well<00:00:55.680> today

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430

you're going to propose yes so what's it

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.439 
you're going to propose yes so what's it
led<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.520> think<00:01:02.699> this<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> really

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
led to this I think this is a really

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.729 
led to this I think this is a really
really<00:01:03.719> important<00:01:04.110> year<00:01:04.229> for<00:01:04.409> us<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.680> think

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
really important year for us and I think

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.320 
really important year for us and I think
it's<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.010> very<00:01:05.189> very<00:01:05.400> important<00:01:05.760> year<00:01:05.880> for<00:01:05.909> him

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
it's a very very important year for him

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.109 
it's a very very important year for him
because<00:01:07.400> in<00:01:08.400> spite<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.729> very<00:01:09.000> very

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
because in spite of very very

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.810 
because in spite of very very
challenging<00:01:10.049> time<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.220> think<00:01:11.280> leading<00:01:11.670> up<00:01:11.790> to

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
challenging time I think leading up to

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.929 
challenging time I think leading up to
this<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.240> his<00:01:12.360> own<00:01:12.450> life<00:01:13.070> and<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.760> lack<00:01:14.909> of

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
this in his own life and a lack of

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.490 
this in his own life and a lack of
opportunities<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.810> would<00:01:15.869> say<00:01:16.049> he's<00:01:16.229> managed

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
opportunities I would say he's managed

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.410 
opportunities I would say he's managed
to<00:01:16.530> get<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.860> university<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.700> now<00:01:18.060> he's<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.390> his

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
to get to university and now he's in his

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.840 
to get to university and now he's in his
13<00:01:18.869> he<00:01:19.020> will<00:01:19.110> actually<00:01:19.409> graduate<00:01:19.830> what<00:01:20.729> do<00:01:20.790> you

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
13 he will actually graduate what do you

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.460 
13 he will actually graduate what do you
think<00:01:21.000> he's<00:01:21.090> gonna<00:01:21.210> say<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.720> think<00:01:21.900> he'll<00:01:22.290> say

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
think he's gonna say I think he'll say

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.679 
think he's gonna say I think he'll say
yes<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.369> sense<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:23.939> think<00:01:23.970> he<00:01:24.479> feels

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
yes in the sense that I think he feels

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.330 
yes in the sense that I think he feels
about<00:01:25.080> me<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.320> way<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.439> feel<00:01:25.619> about<00:01:25.680> him<00:01:26.100> I

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
about me the way I feel about him I

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.609 
about me the way I feel about him I
don't<00:01:27.060> think<00:01:27.150> he<00:01:27.600> would<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:27.780> any<00:01:28.140> sense<00:01:28.500> that

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
don't think he would have any sense that

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.170 
don't think he would have any sense that
this<00:01:28.770> was<00:01:28.950> happening<00:01:29.100> today<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.759> he<00:01:30.030> will

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
this was happening today so he will

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.850 
this was happening today so he will
probably<00:01:30.210> be<00:01:30.570> examining<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.320> buildings<00:01:31.710> in

probably be examining the buildings in

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.109 
probably be examining the buildings in
the<00:01:31.920> distance<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.430> telling<00:01:32.700> me<00:01:32.790> something

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119
