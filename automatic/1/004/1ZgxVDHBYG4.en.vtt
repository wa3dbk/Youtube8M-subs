00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
anything I thought that was real hair

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.399 
anything I thought that was real hair
all<00:01:16.549> of<00:01:16.729> it<00:01:16.880> maybe<00:01:17.329> that<00:01:17.450> was<00:01:17.749> just<00:01:17.779> me<00:01:18.139> but

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
all of it maybe that was just me but

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.010 
all of it maybe that was just me but
after<00:01:19.130> learning<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.520> process<00:01:19.789> it<00:01:20.450> really

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
after learning the process it really

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.779 
after learning the process it really
doesn't<00:01:21.409> matter<00:01:21.529> to<00:01:21.859> me<00:01:21.889> so<00:01:22.459> it<00:01:22.579> doesn't

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
doesn't matter to me so it doesn't

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:25.539 
doesn't matter to me so it doesn't
matter<00:01:22.939> now<00:01:23.179> no<00:01:23.959> but<00:01:24.439> before<00:01:24.889> did<00:01:25.130> you<00:01:25.159> think<00:01:25.459> I

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
matter now no but before did you think I

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.399 
matter now no but before did you think I
didn't<00:01:25.789> really<00:01:25.939> match<00:01:26.209> me<00:01:26.539> before<00:01:26.959> but<00:01:27.229> I

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
didn't really match me before but I

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.499 
didn't really match me before but I

expanded on um you know the difference
between<00:02:34.819> like<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.510> textures<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:38.110> just<00:02:39.110> just

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
between like the textures and just just

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.370 
between like the textures and just just
the<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.920> textures<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.580> patterns<00:02:41.150> of

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
the the textures and the patterns of

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.440 
the the textures and the patterns of
weaves<00:02:42.380> well<00:02:43.099> the<00:02:43.250> texture<00:02:43.760> would<00:02:43.910> be<00:02:44.120> low

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
weaves well the texture would be low

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.350 
weaves well the texture would be low
luster<00:02:44.720> medium<00:02:45.410> luster<00:02:45.890> high<00:02:46.730> luster<00:02:46.970> that's

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
luster medium luster high luster that's

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.420 
luster medium luster high luster that's
like<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.630> shine<00:02:47.959> of<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.260> hair<00:02:48.500> like<00:02:49.220> low

like the shine of the hair like low
luster<00:02:49.700> is<00:02:50.000> more<00:02:50.239> like<00:02:50.420> natural<00:02:50.989> looking<00:02:51.380> and

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
luster is more like natural looking and

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.710 
luster is more like natural looking and
then<00:02:52.190> high<00:02:52.400> luster<00:02:52.670> is<00:02:53.000> like<00:02:53.150> it's<00:02:53.299> real<00:02:53.420> shiny

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
then high luster is like it's real shiny

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.380 
then high luster is like it's real shiny
like<00:02:54.049> its<00:02:54.230> promises<00:02:54.920> we<00:02:55.190> don't<00:02:55.310> like<00:02:55.489> that<00:02:55.730> we
