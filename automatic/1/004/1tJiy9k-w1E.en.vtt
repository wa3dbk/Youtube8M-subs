00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.810
 Hello everyone and we are going to talk about the 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.200
 meals of the pets in which 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.730
 find I'm going to the city other 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.830
 there's only I think about five or six 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.450
 meals they sell in cities the 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.219
 others are achieved by killing monsters and 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.349
 the meals that are obtained in the 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.699
 cities and the obtained ones you buy that 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.530
 they are in these stores here that have 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.620
 this sign 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.360
 this poster is the food you can 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.950
 use to train a pet and 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.800
 Pets are always found 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.570
 in the cities is these pets is 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.690
 say if you find a meal that is 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.050
 for that it stops for a normal vampire 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.010
 but I say to a bat's 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.300
 bats are not found 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.830
 cities find the caves that 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.050
 depends but the ones that are 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.430
 you can buy at the stores 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.710
 this little sign if it is in the 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.720
 city ​​so you just give a 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.879
 return to the city and look for it in 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.860
 this occasion is this 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.780
 caramelito that is for the cole is the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.440
 this city where I am right now in 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.659
 the 77 and nothing here you can get the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.530
 alcohol food and let's see let's go 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:04.780
 with the following 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:09.300
 the next one would be the rabbit that exists 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.310
 Hence the well would be 404 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.110
 and the rabbit's food is a carrot 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.210
 which is very obvious although good this is 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.210
 juve word and here the animals eat 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.980
 weird things here would be a car of a 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.050
 carrot is quite simple and 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.300
 you will get a rabbit like the one you have 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.190
 right now to see then you're rabbit 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.950
 and mounted on the character see there they are 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.880
 they are ugly now we go with the 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.409
 next that would be a second here the 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.850
 terry or this earlier like 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.859
 a puppy that are 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.560
 cities like that looks like a cat by 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.390
 true and it would be a law uav simply 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.460
 buy the water or search the city 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.990
 is that all these kinds of pets 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.340
 that we buy here that we buy the 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.959
 pet food here is usually 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.579
 find in the city after you give a 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:54.020
 around the city ​​and you find the 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:58.310
 terrier 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:02.780
 now let's go with the next one that would be 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:05.659
 the cat the cat the cat sit stress 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.229
 and the cat I think it was a candy 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.980
 let's see it right now 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.170
 here I am if a candy a candy this 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.540
 You buy the same and you look for the cat 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.090
 that is around here in the city 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.939
 we also have the chip that would be the 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.350
 sheep was the coton karl and I think it was 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:26.950
 let's see it right now 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.069
 Let's see 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.200
 here you are and cotton candy you buy it and 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.629
 the same are very cheap all that is 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.920
 If I recommend you always said 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.120
 and I repeat it again whenever 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.129
 I start a game the first thing that 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.349
 do you go to the city ​​to buy this 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:45.020
 and dawn a pet that they want 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:47.300
 pets if they are birds is helpful 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.240
 Let's see 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.910
 OK 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.910
 that of the sheep would tell us if you do not 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.950
 I will also put it on screen or over there 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.670
 and the last one is that of molt small is the 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.319
 are these ugly moles that are found 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.180
 also in the cities from time to time 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.709
 if there are many laps and I found them 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.069
 also that they are outside the cities 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.480
 like wild animals that you 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.680
 will attack those in the city do not attack you 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.709
 but well they can also be administered 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.110
 even if they try to attack you here is the 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.260
 from that of the mole that is a donut of 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:25.190
 chocolate and practically that's all in 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:28.370
 the next chapter of the of the cidh 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.250
 what I'm going to give is something more interesting 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.470
 that would be being places like 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.450
 example caves of the map where you 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.750
 find for example diamonds 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:42.049
 silver what is copper although it is called 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.150
 envelopes it easier to find gold and 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.560
 all this kind of things that already 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.739
 we will comment on the next chapter of a 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.629
 like if you would like more chapters of the 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.799
 last city is the truth is that it is much 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.349
 worse than practicing or some what 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.720
 you asked me to record this although this is not 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.400
 I know it's for me that I know if you want a mole 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.160
 so look at more phases and you come here and not 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.200
 you go city ​​by city so nothing I 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.440
 here the video does not feel video and up 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.440
 the next
