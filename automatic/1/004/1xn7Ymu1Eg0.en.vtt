00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
hey YouTube is Archangel and I've got a

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.580 
hey YouTube is Archangel and I've got a
couple<00:00:07.140> requests<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:08.100> show<00:00:08.340> what<00:00:08.549> happens<00:00:09.590> to

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
couple requests to show what happens to

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.700 
couple requests to show what happens to
the<00:00:10.710> sump<00:00:11.010> in<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.520> event<00:00:11.730> of<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.940> power<00:00:12.120> failure

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:12.710 
the sump in the event of a power failure

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.499 
the sump in the event of a power failure
so<00:00:13.710> I'm<00:00:13.769> going<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.950> simulate<00:00:14.400> that<00:00:14.429> by<00:00:14.639> turning

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
so I'm going to simulate that by turning

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.310 
so I'm going to simulate that by turning
my<00:00:15.780> pump<00:00:16.080> off<00:00:16.520> under<00:00:17.520> there<00:00:17.670> right<00:00:17.849> now<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.930> so

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
my pump off under there right now and so

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.749 
my pump off under there right now and so
watch<00:00:19.739> this<00:00:19.950> in<00:00:20.099> real<00:00:20.279> time<00:00:22.399> alright<00:00:23.399> turn<00:00:23.610> the

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759 
watch this in real time alright turn the

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:25.639 
watch this in real time alright turn the
pump<00:00:24.000> off<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.509> can<00:00:24.689> see<00:00:24.869> that's<00:00:25.140> filling<00:00:25.500> up

00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:25.649 
pump off you can see that's filling up

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:43.029 
pump off you can see that's filling up
in<00:00:25.829> water<00:00:26.720> and<00:00:27.720> back<00:00:28.380> siphoned

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:43.039 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:51.079 

okay<00:00:44.039> so<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.149> can<00:00:45.210> see<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:50.089> hasn't

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
okay so you can see that hasn't

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:54.950 
okay so you can see that hasn't
overflowed<00:00:51.930> or<00:00:52.500> anything<00:00:53.600> just<00:00:54.600> now<00:00:54.809> you've

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
overflowed or anything just now you've

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.819 
overflowed or anything just now you've
been<00:00:55.140> up<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.409> the<00:00:55.860> max<00:00:56.100> more<00:00:56.399> than<00:00:56.519> line<00:00:57.829> right

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
been up to the max more than line right

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.740 
been up to the max more than line right
there<00:00:59.360> now<00:01:00.360> the<00:01:00.420> sump<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:01.019> not<00:01:01.409> even<00:01:01.649> full<00:01:02.750> you

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
there now the sump is not even full you

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.080 
there now the sump is not even full you
look<00:01:04.440> at<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.619> tank<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.190> got<00:01:05.369> some<00:01:05.519> air<00:01:05.700> bubble

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
look at the tank I got some air bubble

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.600 
look at the tank I got some air bubble
micro<00:01:06.420> bubbles<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.930> there<00:01:07.159> because<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.340> pump

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
micro bubbles in there because the pump

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.969 
micro bubbles in there because the pump
just<00:01:10.970> shooting<00:01:11.970> out<00:01:12.030> air<00:01:12.240> bubbles<00:01:12.690> but<00:01:13.200> you

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
just shooting out air bubbles but you

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.330 
just shooting out air bubbles but you
can<00:01:14.159> see<00:01:14.369> it's<00:01:14.819> the<00:01:14.970> water<00:01:15.179> in<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.420> tank<00:01:16.220> or<00:01:17.220> in

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
can see it's the water in the tank or in

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.340 
can see it's the water in the tank or in
the<00:01:17.460> sump<00:01:17.990> hasn't<00:01:18.990> overflowed<00:01:19.440> and<00:01:19.940> then

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
the sump hasn't overflowed and then

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.859 
the sump hasn't overflowed and then
let's<00:01:22.350> say<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.619> power<00:01:22.799> turns<00:01:23.159> back<00:01:23.399> on<00:01:23.869> turn

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
let's say the power turns back on turn

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:33.680 
let's say the power turns back on turn
my<00:01:25.020> plug<00:01:25.710> my<00:01:25.860> pump<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:31.909> all<00:01:32.909> right<00:01:33.090> words

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
my plug my pump in all right words

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:40.370 
my plug my pump in all right words
flowing<00:01:34.399> back<00:01:35.399> into<00:01:35.429> the<00:01:35.819> tank<00:01:38.929> level<00:01:39.929> and<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
flowing back into the tank level and the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.320 
flowing back into the tank level and the
return<00:01:40.709> chamber<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.489> going<00:01:42.300> down<00:01:42.890> and<00:01:44.330> then

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
return chamber is going down and then

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.109 
return chamber is going down and then
water<00:01:46.080> is<00:01:46.369> automatically<00:01:47.369> going<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.789> start

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
water is automatically going to start

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.800 
water is automatically going to start
flowing<00:01:48.860> back<00:01:49.860> through<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.030> overflow<00:01:51.300> and

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
flowing back through the overflow and

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.779 
flowing back through the overflow and
down<00:01:52.020> into<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.709> first<00:01:52.950> chamber<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.950> that's

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
down into the first chamber and that's

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.330 
down into the first chamber and that's
pretty<00:01:57.030> much<00:01:57.179> it<00:01:57.330> I<00:01:57.750> mean<00:01:57.929> this<00:01:58.050> it<00:01:58.950> runs

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
pretty much it I mean this it runs

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:11.050 
pretty much it I mean this it runs
itself<00:01:59.759> the<00:02:00.000> tank<00:02:00.920> tank<00:02:01.920> runs<00:02:02.190> itself

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.630
