 jetta built in the year 2001 this 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.880
 auto is equipped with a transmission 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.730
 manual the steps that I will describe 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.230

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.580
 go driving and the brake lights 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.860
 they were on all the time since 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.260
 the car has manual transmission is 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.079
 possible to drive the car in most 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.969
 of the cases 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.460
 in vehicles equipped with 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.829
 automatic transmission is not possible 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.129
 change speed because the lever 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.530
 of speeds will remain blocked 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.449
 this problem in particular is very common 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.670
 in volkswagen vehicles the 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.710

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.020

 Improved design Your design is slightly 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.340
 different from the original but the connector 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.050

 cables and restart the vehicle 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.560
 the ipc light should light up for about 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.049
 seconds only to indicate that the 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.410
