you know it is going to be pixelated but

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.480 
you know it is going to be pixelated but
you<00:03:00.570> can<00:03:00.750> kind<00:03:01.170> of<00:03:01.320> tell<00:03:01.560> that<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.280> actually

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
you can kind of tell that it actually

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.270 
you can kind of tell that it actually
says<00:03:02.940> thermite<00:03:03.660> so<00:03:04.260> for<00:03:04.440> those<00:03:04.560> who<00:03:04.860> were<00:03:05.010> sort

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
says thermite so for those who were sort

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.710 
says thermite so for those who were sort
of<00:03:05.400> questioning<00:03:05.880> whether<00:03:06.060> or<00:03:06.180> not<00:03:06.300> the<00:03:06.480> code

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
of questioning whether or not the code

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.980 
of questioning whether or not the code
that<00:03:07.530> was<00:03:07.830> in<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.250> game<00:03:08.400> was<00:03:08.970> sort<00:03:09.240> of<00:03:09.300> legit

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
that was in the game was sort of legit

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.350 
that was in the game was sort of legit
or<00:03:10.260> not<00:03:10.290> or<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:11.220> know<00:03:11.340> if<00:03:11.850> you<00:03:12.120> were<00:03:12.240> just

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
or not or you know if you were just

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.360 
or not or you know if you were just
wondering<00:03:12.870> questioning<00:03:13.500> yourself<00:03:13.650> about<00:03:14.160> it

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
wondering questioning yourself about it

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.009 
wondering questioning yourself about it
we<00:03:14.820> kind<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.150> have<00:03:15.330> some<00:03:15.510> information<00:03:15.720> here

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
we kind of have some information here

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.229 
we kind of have some information here
that<00:03:16.470> would<00:03:17.190> indicate<00:03:17.430> that<00:03:17.640> this<00:03:17.910> stuff<00:03:18.090> is

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
that would indicate that this stuff is

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.330 
that would indicate that this stuff is
actually<00:03:18.480> real<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.170> obviously<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.980> gun<00:03:20.190> to

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
actually real and obviously the gun to

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.340 
actually real and obviously the gun to
the<00:03:20.430> left<00:03:20.610> of<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:20.880> that's<00:03:21.630> got<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:21.989> be<00:03:22.080> a<00:03:22.110> flare

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
the left of it that's got to be a flare

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.620 
the left of it that's got to be a flare
gun<00:03:22.380> because<00:03:22.980> it's<00:03:23.310> not<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.489> revolver<00:03:23.970> as<00:03:24.150> you

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
gun because it's not a revolver as you

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.420 
gun because it's not a revolver as you
can<00:03:24.750> tell<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:25.260> what<00:03:25.590> is<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.800> muzzle<00:03:26.310> or

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
can tell the what is it the muzzle or

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.680 
can tell the what is it the muzzle or
that<00:03:26.640> you<00:03:26.760> know<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:26.940> tip<00:03:27.180> where<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.510> gun

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
that you know the tip where the gun

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.350 
that you know the tip where the gun
where<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.410> bullets<00:03:28.680> come<00:03:28.890> out<00:03:29.360> obviously

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
where the bullets come out obviously

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.080 
where the bullets come out obviously
that's<00:03:30.570> pretty<00:03:31.050> big<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:31.530> that<00:03:32.190> just<00:03:32.820> looks

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
that's pretty big and that just looks

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.540 
that's pretty big and that just looks
like<00:03:33.209> a<00:03:33.330> flare<00:03:33.810> gun<00:03:34.040> now<00:03:35.040> one<00:03:35.280> thing<00:03:35.310> that's

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
like a flare gun now one thing that's

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.600 
like a flare gun now one thing that's
cool<00:03:35.790> if<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.269> actually<00:03:36.480> hit<00:03:36.900> start<00:03:37.350> and

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
cool if you actually hit start and

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.180 
cool if you actually hit start and
online<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:38.970> then<00:03:39.209> go<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.840> stats<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.830> then

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
online and then go to the stats and then

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.970 
online and then go to the stats and then
go<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.430> weapons<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.590> then<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:43.680> scroll<00:03:43.920> all

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
go to weapons and then you scroll all

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.530 
go to weapons and then you scroll all
the<00:03:44.190> way<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.550> left<00:03:44.790> or<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.120> right

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
the way to the left or the right

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.840 
the way to the left or the right
whatever<00:03:45.930> way<00:03:46.200> you<00:03:46.230> want<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.530> go<00:03:46.730> and<00:03:47.730> you

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
whatever way you want to go and you

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.310 
whatever way you want to go and you
actually<00:03:48.000> get<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.450> firework<00:03:48.900> launcher

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
actually get to the firework launcher

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.650 
actually get to the firework launcher
you<00:03:50.220> can<00:03:50.430> see<00:03:50.730> right<00:03:50.760> under<00:03:51.330> the<00:03:51.420> fireworks

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
you can see right under the fireworks

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.890 
you can see right under the fireworks
launcher<00:03:52.190> there's<00:03:53.190> actually<00:03:53.760> half<00:03:54.390> of<00:03:54.660> the

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
launcher there's actually half of the

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.280 
launcher there's actually half of the
thermite<00:03:55.350> bomb<00:03:55.590> on<00:03:55.920> this<00:03:56.550> picture<00:03:57.000> now<00:03:57.780> I

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
thermite bomb on this picture now I

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.870 
thermite bomb on this picture now I
don't<00:03:58.590> know<00:03:58.830> what<00:03:59.190> happened<00:03:59.550> there<00:03:59.640> I<00:03:59.670> guess

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
don't know what happened there I guess

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.250 
don't know what happened there I guess
Rockstar<00:04:00.330> just<00:04:00.480> forgot<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:00.720> crop<00:04:01.019> that<00:04:01.050> out

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
Rockstar just forgot to crop that out

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.170 
Rockstar just forgot to crop that out
but<00:04:01.860> like<00:04:02.010> I<00:04:02.130> said<00:04:02.190> here<00:04:02.760> we<00:04:02.850> have<00:04:03.000> another

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
but like I said here we have another

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.940 
but like I said here we have another
indication<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.230> store<00:04:04.440> my<00:04:04.530> bottom<00:04:04.800> is

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
indication that the store my bottom is

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.830 
indication that the store my bottom is
actually<00:04:05.220> a<00:04:05.489> real<00:04:05.790> thing<00:04:06.090> now<00:04:06.330> this<00:04:06.510> one<00:04:06.750> you

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
actually a real thing now this one you

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.910 
actually a real thing now this one you
just<00:04:06.870> see<00:04:07.080> the<00:04:07.200> top<00:04:07.410> so<00:04:07.590> you<00:04:07.650> can't<00:04:07.860> really

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
just see the top so you can't really

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.560 
just see the top so you can't really
make<00:04:08.160> out<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.400> bottom<00:04:08.820> that<00:04:08.940> says<00:04:09.000> thermite

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
make out the bottom that says thermite

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.539 
make out the bottom that says thermite
but<00:04:10.140> if<00:04:10.260> you<00:04:10.380> go<00:04:10.650> back<00:04:10.769> to<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.010> other<00:04:11.160> picture

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
but if you go back to the other picture

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.280 
but if you go back to the other picture
you<00:04:11.670> can<00:04:11.820> see<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.120> top<00:04:12.299> is<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.720> exact<00:04:13.080> same

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
you can see the top is the exact same

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.259 
you can see the top is the exact same
top<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:13.799> it's<00:04:14.400> in<00:04:14.489> the<00:04:14.580> exact<00:04:14.880> same<00:04:15.060> position

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
top and it's in the exact same position

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.740 
top and it's in the exact same position
as<00:04:15.720> it<00:04:16.440> is<00:04:16.650> on<00:04:16.919> that<00:04:17.549> picture<00:04:17.790> and<00:04:18.150> that<00:04:18.479> is<00:04:18.600> why

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
as it is on that picture and that is why

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.320 
as it is on that picture and that is why
this<00:04:18.810> code<00:04:19.350> and<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.950> picture<00:04:20.370> with<00:04:21.090> all<00:04:21.120> the

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
this code and the picture with all the

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.020 
this code and the picture with all the
guns<00:04:21.720> that<00:04:22.350> is<00:04:22.500> why<00:04:22.650> that<00:04:22.919> is<00:04:23.070> a<00:04:23.220> pretty<00:04:23.729> real

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
guns that is why that is a pretty real

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.340 
guns that is why that is a pretty real
thing<00:04:24.330> because<00:04:24.720> the

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
thing because the

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.870 
thing because the
picture<00:04:25.620> with<00:04:25.920> half<00:04:26.250> of<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.460> third<00:04:26.610> by<00:04:26.700> Bob

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
picture with half of the third by Bob

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.580 
picture with half of the third by Bob
that's<00:04:27.120> actually<00:04:27.300> in<00:04:27.720> the<00:04:27.900> start<00:04:28.170> menu<00:04:28.320> in<00:04:28.560> the

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
that's actually in the start menu in the

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.410 
that's actually in the start menu in the
game<00:04:28.890> from<00:04:29.220> Rockstar<00:04:29.730> that<00:04:29.850> they<00:04:29.970> put<00:04:30.270> their

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
game from Rockstar that they put their

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.230 
game from Rockstar that they put their
so<00:04:30.690> they<00:04:31.200> kind<00:04:31.470> of<00:04:31.560> messed<00:04:31.770> up<00:04:31.950> here<00:04:32.250> but<00:04:32.700> the

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
so they kind of messed up here but the

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.000
