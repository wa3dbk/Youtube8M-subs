hey guys so today I want to do a quick
little<00:00:01.770> video<00:00:02.070> here<00:00:02.280> because<00:00:02.850> it<00:00:03.030> seems<00:00:03.300> that

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
little video here because it seems that

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.710 
little video here because it seems that
we<00:00:03.929> have<00:00:03.959> a<00:00:04.350> new<00:00:04.529> galaxy<00:00:05.009> s4<00:00:05.819> variant<00:00:06.330> coming

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
we have a new galaxy s4 variant coming

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.080 
we have a new galaxy s4 variant coming
out<00:00:06.839> which<00:00:07.740> could<00:00:07.950> be<00:00:08.099> exciting<00:00:08.490> if<00:00:08.700> you<00:00:08.880> have

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
out which could be exciting if you have

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.669 
out which could be exciting if you have
if<00:00:09.300> you're<00:00:09.450> still<00:00:09.630> interested<00:00:09.840> in<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.320> galaxy

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
if you're still interested in the galaxy

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.890 
if you're still interested in the galaxy
s4<00:00:11.010> but<00:00:11.190> you<00:00:11.309> see<00:00:11.460> this<00:00:11.610> new<00:00:11.790> Galaxy<00:00:12.269> Note<00:00:12.450> 3

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
s4 but you see this new Galaxy Note 3

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.010 
s4 but you see this new Galaxy Note 3
and<00:00:12.929> you'd<00:00:13.799> be<00:00:14.040> like<00:00:14.070> well<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:15.269> galaxy<00:00:15.660> note<00:00:15.750> 3

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
and you'd be like well the galaxy note 3

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.859 
and you'd be like well the galaxy note 3
has<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.350> better<00:00:16.590> processor<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:18.150> better<00:00:18.330> GPU

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
has a better processor and a better GPU

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.920 
has a better processor and a better GPU
well<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:20.070> seems<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.640> this<00:00:20.970> new<00:00:21.240> galaxy<00:00:21.689> s4

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
well it seems that this new galaxy s4

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.779 
well it seems that this new galaxy s4
variant<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.560> might<00:00:22.859> become<00:00:23.279> interesting

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
variant and might become interesting

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.950 
variant and might become interesting
it's<00:00:24.600> going<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.199> be<00:00:25.350> called<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.920> GTI<00:00:26.369> 950<00:00:27.330> 6

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
it's going to be called the GTI 950 6

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.439 
it's going to be called the GTI 950 6
and<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:29.189> as<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.580> see<00:00:29.880> here<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.420> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
and this as you see here this is the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.200 
and this as you see here this is the
international<00:00:31.140> variant<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.730> galaxy's

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
international variant of the galaxy's

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.990 
international variant of the galaxy's
for<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.780> with<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.469> Snapdragon<00:00:34.980> 600<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.790> I

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
for it with the Snapdragon 600 that I

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.030 
for it with the Snapdragon 600 that I
think<00:00:36.390> majority<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:36.930> people<00:00:37.260> use<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.649> Europe

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
think majority of people use in Europe

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.380 
think majority of people use in Europe
where<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.340> live<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.820> also<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.410> US<00:00:41.010> GT<00:00:41.940> on<00:00:42.059> FL

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
where I live and also in the US GT on FL

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.110 
where I live and also in the US GT on FL
05<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.230> they're<00:00:43.410> bumping<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.860> up<00:00:43.920> into<00:00:44.399> GT<00:00:44.879> ina

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
05 so they're bumping it up into GT ina

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.650 
05 so they're bumping it up into GT ina
506<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.379> instead<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.280> having<00:00:47.430> Snapdragon<00:00:48.000> 600

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
506 and instead of having Snapdragon 600

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.979 
506 and instead of having Snapdragon 600
it's<00:00:48.840> going<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.020> be<00:00:49.110> snapdragon<00:00:49.910> 800<00:00:50.910> same<00:00:51.809> as

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
it's going to be snapdragon 800 same as

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.470 
it's going to be snapdragon 800 same as
in<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.260> galaxy<00:00:52.829> note<00:00:53.039> 3<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.699> then<00:00:54.030> also<00:00:54.270> a

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
in the galaxy note 3 and then also a

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.799 
in the galaxy note 3 and then also a
better<00:00:54.719> GPU<00:00:55.320> going<00:00:55.739> from<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.010> drone<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.309> three

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
better GPU going from a drone of three

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.529 
better GPU going from a drone of three
2203<00:00:57.809> turkey<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:59.789> seems<00:01:00.030> like<00:01:00.120> this

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
2203 turkey and it seems like this

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.579 
2203 turkey and it seems like this
variant<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.859> galaxy<00:01:02.460> s4<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.899> going<00:01:04.350> to

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
variant of the galaxy s4 it is going to

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.670 
variant of the galaxy s4 it is going to
be<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.939> international<00:01:05.939> edition<00:01:06.900> international

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
international version of a Korean galaxy

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.710 
international version of a Korean galaxy
s4<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.950> new<00:01:14.189> Korean<00:01:14.610> galaxy<00:01:15.000> s4<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.570> was

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
s4 this new Korean galaxy s4 that was

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.760 
s4 this new Korean galaxy s4 that was
called<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.189> e3<00:01:17.189> third<00:01:17.820> BS<00:01:18.420> Nazca<00:01:19.380> see<00:01:19.530> over

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
called the e3 third BS Nazca see over

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.219 
called the e3 third BS Nazca see over
here<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.610> was<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.659> they<00:01:21.840> get<00:01:22.049> released

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
here that it was that they get released

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.249 
here that it was that they get released
in<00:01:22.590> Korea<00:01:22.890> with<00:01:23.549> LTE<00:01:23.939> Advanced<00:01:24.420> which<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
in Korea with LTE Advanced which is the

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.560 
in Korea with LTE Advanced which is the
best<00:01:25.439> LTE<00:01:25.890> well<00:01:26.159> Bo<00:01:26.400> now<00:01:26.939> I'm<00:01:27.090> not<00:01:27.119> sure<00:01:27.240> if

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
best LTE well Bo now I'm not sure if

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.980 
best LTE well Bo now I'm not sure if
this<00:01:27.810> new<00:01:28.140> GTA<00:01:28.710> 5<00:01:29.130> 06<00:01:29.430> will<00:01:29.909> come<00:01:30.210> also<00:01:30.780> with

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
this new GTA 5 06 will come also with

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.350 
this new GTA 5 06 will come also with
LTE<00:01:31.350> advanced<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.430> mean<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.970> kind<00:01:33.329> of

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
LTE advanced and I mean it kind of

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.569 
LTE advanced and I mean it kind of
depends<00:01:33.689> also<00:01:33.930> probably<00:01:34.320> on<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.560> carrier<00:01:34.979> the

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
depends also probably on the carrier the

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.940 
depends also probably on the carrier the
carrier<00:01:35.939> almost<00:01:36.360> support<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.710> order

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
carrier almost support it and the order

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.270 
carrier almost support it and the order
of<00:01:38.009> course<00:01:38.310> they<00:01:38.400> need<00:01:38.750> so<00:01:39.750> they<00:01:40.070> made<00:01:41.070> some

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
of course they need so they made some

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.969 
of course they need so they made some
benchmarking<00:01:42.000> tests<00:01:42.360> here<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.740> can<00:01:43.829> see
