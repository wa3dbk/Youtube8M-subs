00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.080
 hello i am not one of records in 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.360
 I would like to show you this project 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.480
 how the entire native instruments 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.240
 Control with an ipad for a year 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.970
 hardware sound generator combines the 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.140
 idea is simple i want my ipad 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.230
 connect with here 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.490
 and i want all the regulators from the ipad 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.080
 here with the hardware control 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.789
 because then I just like that 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.859
 right hardware feeling and the 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.170
 advantage of the ipad is that me 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.460
 stop via touch surface immediately in the 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.590
 sound can intervene 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.570
 that is if I sounded fast in the 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.250
 I want to intervene on the ipad 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.450
 but if I really want to play 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.130
 for example with eyes closed 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.750
 then I have this here 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.000
 beautiful keyboard with the whole 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.370
 turntables and I'll show you now 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.219
 times how to integrate all okay 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.620
 with the ipad one has only these these 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.210
 at this usb connection ultimately and 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.300
 I did it that way I got one 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.219
 usb to midi interface have taken that 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.670
 then with the ipad and with the complete 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:03.430
 control connected that means usb goes 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.899
 here with the midi interface the with 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.729
 interface there is the entrance here in 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.829
 the exit and the exit in the 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.450
 input so I bidirectional 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:13.479
 can build connection 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.799
 then i just have to in this ipad app i 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.729
 have me here for a mini of 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.789
 nature decided 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.159
 then I go to connect and then go 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:23.770
 I hmi the attitude and there 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.590
 I just have to make sure that 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.319
 my midi interface cm you to me the 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.819
 that's what's on when that's on 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:35.889
 I should already hear a sound now 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:38.109
 very well ok now I want the 

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:39.310
 Controls here with the hardware 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:41.139
 save controller 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.849
 For this I have to go back to the mini 

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:45.489
 attitude simply go to media 

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:47.560
 go midi learn is enabled now 

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:49.779
 namely cantauw filter frequency because that 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.060
 just such a common processing 

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:54.249
 parameters for the sound so then turn 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.919
 I at a regulator and you can see 

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:58.869
 here that the whole also links that 

00:01:56.919 --> 00:02:01.359
 same we do the resonance or 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.219
 here filter in the faces then I go up 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:06.219
 the mound on contour 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:08.530
 that is the curve intensity for the 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:11.140
 filter then I do the same always 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.600
 with attack for the movie 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.819
 the cold filter and then too 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.290
 attack for the volume and the stairs 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.800
 the volume and then the 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.330
 volume itself that is really 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.670
 pretty easy then I go on then 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.800
 he should have noticed that now 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.510
 if I move to grade you see here 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.730
 that the filter frequency also modulates 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.950
 that's not going to be that far 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.020
 special 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.590
 down loud a nice of the 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.590
 make hardware 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.290
 I really liked what we did 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.849
 have a bidirectional connection that 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.530
 If I am here at the ipad 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:58.290
 I would have to turn on the parameters 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:01.280
 the hardware so if you are here completely 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.450
 People often have ads 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.549
 that should really be with the ipad 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.920
 that means that if I am now 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.090
 of course in the preset load would have to 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.049
 here too all the parameters 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.049
 to be updated 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.250
 and yes it works 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.670
 the advantage is of course I have none 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.409
 parameter jump because we are here now 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.829
 exactly the right ipad value displayed 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.829
 become 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.130
 that means if I am now for example 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.130
 more than eight parameters for this left 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.660
 I actually have this entire one 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:42.180
 access here in my hardware 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:43.740
 controller really nice of her 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.050
 of course now that this is the 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.910
 designation are already correct for 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.590
 this native instruments controller 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.210
 is there the controller editor that is 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.760
 a software that is easy for 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.170
 every native instrument device and in 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.760
 I can do this controller editor 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.040
 really say every parameter again 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.530
 on what medica nala should send something 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.690
 for midi data to send at all like 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.010
 The name is I can Yes 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.990
 also really on the keyboard 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.120
 tumble and here really and keyboards 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.740
 make me look like that with one 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.720
 half of the time are and with the 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.610
 drive other half the other 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.840
 I'll show you how it all works 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.209
 goes in this controller editor 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.280
 software In any case, I find that 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.670
 really great that I am the synthesizer 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.740
 now really have and I can be a yes 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.170
 ipad quite loose without the mouse or 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:32.160
 so my cousins ​​by tilting and have 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:34.230
 always my same preparation if 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.480
 I the ipad app is closing and again 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.640
 reopen the mapping is still there 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.960
 is that beautiful 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.800
 Ok, let's go over there 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.360
 controller editor so now you see too 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.040
 already as I called it all 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.870
 So up here you have my eight regulators 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.260
 if I now have this card often regulator 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.760
 I would like to edit it and edit it 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.200
 I could now be the first name 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.380
 change you just take it 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.790
 filter and then you can already see that 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.640
 immediately taken a hardware 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.410
 which one takes some getting quite good then 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.370
 I'm the midi channel to point that's 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.770
 pretty important and above all things 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.660
 the number because if now for example 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.780
 the filter regulator and the volume 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.240
 regulator if the two with the company 17 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.950
 your values ​​would be yes then would be 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.380
 no different directions should 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.300
 one and the same and especially important 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.970
 here the mode setting on the go 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.010
 Absolutely be absolutely that means he takes 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.170
 really the absolute attitude of 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.400
 this ipad takes over there and 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.450
 conversely he sends the absolute 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.090
 attitude to the ipad 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.130
 if I would do that relatively now 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.930
 then it would always only +1 or 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.200
 -1 would therefore have in practice 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.790
 he works on the ipad 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.190
 but that does not necessarily mean that absolutely 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.980
 Be sure to be one 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.510
 bidirectional media connection 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.040
 That means that I am here 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.710
 really the video output with the the 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.440
 four associations and the media with the 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.240
 idiot so the couple really has to 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.130
 not only being fully connected is possible 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.120
 an agency 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:03.170
 ok i change that again a cutoff 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.930
 I already have my principle 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.790
 ipad my yes my ipad is so as is 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.070
 a hard one and it worked and 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.170
 In the next video I show you how I am 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.780
 is a second synthesizer so that a 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:17.080
 I'm also from here until then 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.080
 later
