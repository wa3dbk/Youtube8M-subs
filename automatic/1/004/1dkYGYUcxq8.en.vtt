00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
finger to the second

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.630 
finger to the second
in<00:00:50.960> your<00:00:51.469> ring<00:00:51.649> finger<00:00:52.300> to<00:00:53.300> the<00:00:53.329> first<00:00:54.640> and

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
in your ring finger to the first and

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.389 
in your ring finger to the first and
you're<00:00:56.089> going<00:00:56.120> to<00:00:56.420> use<00:00:56.780> these<00:00:57.440> three<00:00:57.890> fingers

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
you're going to use these three fingers

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:05.590 
you're going to use these three fingers
all<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:58.850> time<00:01:01.479> this<00:01:02.479> is<00:01:02.629> the<00:01:02.750> pattern<00:01:03.670> so<00:01:04.670> by

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
all the time this is the pattern so by

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.850 
all the time this is the pattern so by
string<00:01:06.020> by<00:01:06.500> string<00:01:06.530> numbers<00:01:08.020> three<00:01:09.020> two<00:01:09.530> one

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
string by string numbers three two one

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.050 
string by string numbers three two one
two<00:01:10.520> three<00:01:11.119> two<00:01:11.659> one<00:01:12.229> always<00:01:13.039> like<00:01:13.280> that<00:01:13.310> so<00:01:14.030> I

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
two three two one always like that so I

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:37.709 
two three two one always like that so I
guess<00:01:14.920> three<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:20.210> same<00:01:20.420> pace

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:41.709 

okay<00:01:38.719> and<00:01:39.159> in<00:01:40.159> between<00:01:40.429> you<00:01:41.090> just<00:01:41.299> need<00:01:41.450> to<00:01:41.570> add

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:41.719 
okay and in between you just need to add

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:43.899 
okay and in between you just need to add
the<00:01:41.750> base<00:01:42.140> on<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.920> bass<00:01:43.130> sound<00:01:43.520> you're<00:01:43.729> using

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
the base on the bass sound you're using

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.550 
the base on the bass sound you're using
your<00:01:44.210> thumb<00:01:44.479> in<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:45.890> fifth<00:01:46.189> string<00:01:47.289> the<00:01:48.289> first

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
your thumb in the fifth string the first

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.130 
your thumb in the fifth string the first
one<00:01:48.770> just<00:01:49.009> let<00:01:49.789> it<00:01:49.880> go<00:01:49.909> to<00:01:50.329> the<00:01:50.420> left<00:01:50.689> hand<00:01:53.140> so

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
one just let it go to the left hand so

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.630 
one just let it go to the left hand so
we<00:01:54.170> do<00:01:54.469> the<00:01:54.590> thumb<00:01:54.829> first<00:01:55.159> and<00:01:55.429> then<00:01:55.610> the

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
we do the thumb first and then the

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:04.310 
we do the thumb first and then the
pattern<00:01:56.350> so<00:01:57.350> like<00:01:57.500> this

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.920 

so<00:02:04.740> after<00:02:04.920> we<00:02:05.190> ate<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.430> pace<00:02:05.659> you<00:02:06.659> do<00:02:06.810> the

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
so after we ate the pace you do the

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.960 
so after we ate the pace you do the
pattern<00:02:07.350> twice<00:02:07.680> so

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.589 

PG<00:02:11.630> well
