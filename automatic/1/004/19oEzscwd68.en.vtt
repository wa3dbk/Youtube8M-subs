00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:10.410
 my name is harald huber or hd huber 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.799
 most of me used to be myself 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.619
 Goalkeeper has managed this fourth league 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.609
 already long time active goalkeeping coach 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.439
 mostly the youth area but also 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.160
 up to mens region regionalliga 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.949
 bavaria innovative but at the end driving 68 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.810
 05 10 16 21 I've been there for several years 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.160
 years 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.710
 Goalkeeping coach at the bv for all 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.160
 selection teams and also at the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.730
 Trainer 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.040
 training or education during 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.469
 So my entire youth was the time 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.260
 fc bavaria from the e to the youth 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.969
 I am then taken over if the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.969
 Amateur was then two years 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.640
 the relative 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.489
 in the trainers business so as goalkeeper 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.840
 trainer just started this way 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.620
 a bit by the way and then it always is 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.420
 become more 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.290
 until now actually always relatively good 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.750
 will run the contact then with 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.360
 dani weber also knew about us and 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.860
 through the fields of the past has everything 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.530
 then I said okay then you can go here 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.810
 also in the munich area or in the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.460
 southern bavarian room somehow something 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.080
 build up that you can promote the boys 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.460
 yes and so it all has its own way 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.530
 taken away until just before three 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.869
 years the chance has come 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.210
 bavaria federal leagues to work with 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.619
 1860 Munich where you just stop by 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.020
 can go out to a certain level 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.149
 can say about it ok things are there 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.520
 maybe the right kick that 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.330
 perhaps the chance at the top 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.330
 can perceive 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.080
 basically you have to say like yourself 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.820
 the stop all the years of 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.590
 Torwartspiels also through by 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.020
 regulate or stop by the whole game 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.430
 has changed in football if you have now 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.100
 I think I have to go back sooner 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.670
 Think back to my time a lot 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.400
 leap power and comparison is 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.490
 always so happy so the generation the so 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.990
 olli kahn, the choice was really there 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.340
 superior and then someday 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.400
 once walked where told 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.620
 every goalkeeper has to play the game too 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.060
 quite active participate a good 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.860
 players open the game quickly 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.870
 if you do it today 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.610
 Goalkeeper look at the controls 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.440
 actually all in the upper area 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.140
 if you go down to the second 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.700
 league actually all relatively well there and 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.470
 you try everything as 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.270
 Goalkeeper coach on such things then 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.800
 to enter also in training 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.020
 or to improve it there 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.090
 so much is synonymous in the foot 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.220
 a lot 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.379
 where also player situations are yes 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.629
 Of course, the other one 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.959
 Goalkeeper alone has to master so 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.150
 Not 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.069
 no field players are the normal ones 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.709
 basic the fundamentals the basic techniques 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.300
 it should be really technically clean 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.090
 be designed and since you have as 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.440
 goalkeeper coach indeed be insane exactly 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.720
 improve a lot again and again 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.000
 that is a very long process and that 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.519
 I try to implement as has 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.140
 actually also the basis of 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.940
 the top goalie trainer i mean it 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.260
 pulls like a red thread through the 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.209
 do not all want about the same 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.519
 Of course, everyone has and then of course 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.620
 so his certain characteristics 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.739
 it is clear you can not do it there 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.060
 copy one-to-one coaches but those 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.500
 basic group guide it always exists 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.280
 how should the individual techniques 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.890
 ausschauen 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.140
 where now also had to say earlier was 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.879
 seat in my case not so extreme in the 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.560
 Goalkeeper training also in Bavaria if I 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:40.069
 that now once we have comparison 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.860
 only from the b-youth times in the enjoyment 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.720
 the likely come here meyer rehearse 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.459
 to train professionals 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.840
 So it's not the same then 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.130
 one hundred percent funded 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.340
 I was actually in my youth 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.480
 was also relatively successful 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.100
 youth national player from the u15 up to 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.000
 18 have also participated in an em 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.160
 at a wm 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.079
 but even there I say it is 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.510
 had been relatively difficult with his 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.099
 Goalkeeper training asked if it at 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.889
 selection measures was or even in the 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.569
 but always a bit like that 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.670
 So close is a bit next to it 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.650
 and that's why you think 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.840
 the guys have to keep holding the yes 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.700
 encourage talents as early as possible 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.220
 or ask them something 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.539
 teach and then on the 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.539
 bring the right way
