talk<00:00:23.250> about<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.609> wrong<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:24.090> basically<00:00:24.750> if

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
talk about that wrong so basically if

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.290 
talk about that wrong so basically if
you<00:00:25.289> guys<00:00:25.470> didn't<00:00:26.130> know<00:00:26.189> cuz<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.849> think<00:00:26.910> I'm

not sure I've always worn push-up bras
pretty<00:00:31.170> much<00:00:31.349> because<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.769> have<00:00:32.340> smaller<00:00:32.669> boobs

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910

don't even know what you would call it
but<00:00:58.770> there's<00:00:59.160> like<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> little<00:00:59.520> bubble<00:00:59.760> in<00:01:00.359> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
but there's like a little bubble in the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.290 
but there's like a little bubble in the
in<00:01:00.719> bottom<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.739> inside<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.609> bra<00:01:02.820> that

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
in bottom of the inside of the bra that

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.509 
in bottom of the inside of the bra that
kind<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.600> pushes<00:01:03.930> your<00:01:04.080> boob<00:01:04.290> up<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:05.159> this

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
kind of pushes your boob up so this

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.300 
kind of pushes your boob up so this
instead<00:01:06.240> has<00:01:06.810> like<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.049> little<00:01:07.260> flat<00:01:07.740> platform

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
instead has like a little flat platform

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.210 
instead has like a little flat platform
that<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.479> flat<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.020> bra<00:01:10.290> until<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.010> pull

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
that is flat in the bra until you pull

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.640 
that is flat in the bra until you pull
these<00:01:11.400> little<00:01:11.700> straps<00:01:12.000> down<00:01:12.330> here<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:13.530> by

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
these little straps down here so by

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.160 
these little straps down here so by
pulling<00:01:14.070> these<00:01:14.189> little<00:01:14.460> straps<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:15.450> causes

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
pulling these little straps it causes

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.830 
pulling these little straps it causes
the<00:01:16.259> platform<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.920> raise<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.540> kind<00:01:18.780> of

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
the platform to raise and so it kind of

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.140 
the platform to raise and so it kind of
pushes<00:01:19.140> your<00:01:19.439> boob<00:01:19.710> up<00:01:20.009> if<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.700> makes<00:01:20.909> sense

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
pushes your boob up if that makes sense

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.330 
pushes your boob up if that makes sense
but<00:01:21.299> anyway<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.080> further<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.560> pull<00:01:22.860> over

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
but anyway so the further you pull over

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.859 
but anyway so the further you pull over

if<00:03:02.530> you<00:03:02.680> can<00:03:02.950> tell<00:03:03.310> I<00:03:03.669> mean<00:03:04.150> I<00:03:04.209> don't<00:03:04.269> know<00:03:04.450> how

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
if you can tell I mean I don't know how

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.179 
if you can tell I mean I don't know how
you<00:03:04.629> couldn't<00:03:04.900> tell<00:03:05.200> but<00:03:05.709> this<00:03:05.889> is<00:03:06.010> where<00:03:06.159> I

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.189 
you couldn't tell but this is where I

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.159 
you couldn't tell but this is where I
get<00:03:06.400> just<00:03:06.549> on<00:03:06.639> the<00:03:06.730> second<00:03:07.060> or<00:03:07.209> third<00:03:07.239> like<00:03:07.900> I

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:08.169 
get just on the second or third like I

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:10.530 
get just on the second or third like I
think<00:03:08.319> it's<00:03:08.530> a<00:03:08.650> third<00:03:08.859> actually<00:03:09.129> slot<00:03:09.700> so<00:03:10.329> if<00:03:10.450> I

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
think it's a third actually slot so if I

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.940 
think it's a third actually slot so if I
pulled<00:03:10.750> it<00:03:10.870> in<00:03:10.930> more<00:03:11.079> my<00:03:11.290> boobs<00:03:11.469> would<00:03:11.560> be<00:03:11.650> even

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
pulled it in more my boobs would be even

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.159 
pulled it in more my boobs would be even
more<00:03:11.980> like<00:03:12.459> up<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:13.450> this<00:03:13.569> is<00:03:13.629> the<00:03:13.810> Burrow<00:03:13.959> that

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:14.169 
more like up and this is the Burrow that

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:15.659

really quickly so it looks pretty much

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.199

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.080 
know there's some shirts that you just
feel<00:03:37.659> like<00:03:37.979> it<00:03:38.979> would<00:03:39.129> look<00:03:39.340> better<00:03:39.609> if<00:03:39.970> you

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.050 
feel like it would look better if you
had<00:03:40.409> like<00:03:41.409> not<00:03:41.620> a<00:03:41.650> small<00:03:42.009> boobs<00:03:42.340> I<00:03:42.639> don't<00:03:42.729> know

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.429 
it just it maybe it's just me but I just
think<00:03:45.790> that<00:03:45.909> for<00:03:46.030> certain<00:03:46.299> outfits<00:03:46.810> or<00:03:47.139> shirts

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:47.439 
think that for certain outfits or shirts

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:48.960 
think that for certain outfits or shirts
or<00:03:47.769> insurance<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.370> make<00:03:48.459> them<00:03:48.609> fit<00:03:48.759> better

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
or insurance to make them fit better

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.729 
or insurance to make them fit better
this<00:03:49.419> bra<00:03:49.629> works<00:03:49.900> perfectly<00:03:50.349> because<00:03:50.560> it

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
this bra works perfectly because it

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.490 
this bra works perfectly because it
makes<00:03:51.069> this<00:03:51.310> shirt<00:03:51.759> like<00:03:51.970> fit<00:03:52.449> better<00:03:52.810> that

makes this shirt like fit better that
makes<00:03:53.769> sense<00:03:54.009> at<00:03:54.159> all<00:03:54.340> but<00:03:54.909> if<00:03:55.000> you<00:03:55.120> think<00:03:55.329> this

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
makes sense at all but if you think this

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:57.059 
makes sense at all but if you think this
