up to gold is the i think it's called
the<00:01:38.659> m1216<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.579> actually<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.000> really

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
the m1216 and that is actually a really

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.639 
the m1216 and that is actually a really
good<00:01:42.299> young<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:43.170> it'll<00:01:44.070> be<00:01:44.100> like<00:01:45.500> it'll<00:01:46.500> be

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
good young but it'll be like it'll be

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.050 
good young but it'll be like it'll be
like<00:01:46.950> luxury<00:01:47.780> after<00:01:48.780> using<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.290> thing<00:01:49.350> but

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
like luxury after using this thing but

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.670 
like luxury after using this thing but
waiting<00:01:51.060> for<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.329> guy<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.899> he<00:01:52.020> jumps<00:01:52.530> out

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
waiting for this guy and he jumps out

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.590 
waiting for this guy and he jumps out
the<00:01:52.770> window<00:01:52.799> comes<00:01:53.369> back<00:01:53.610> round<00:01:53.880> on<00:01:54.240> me<00:01:54.270> I

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
the window comes back round on me I

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.060 
the window comes back round on me I
think<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.380> we'll<00:01:55.500> see<00:01:55.649> him<00:01:55.740> coming<00:01:55.950> back

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
think that we'll see him coming back

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.910 
think that we'll see him coming back
round<00:01:56.399> anyway<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.450> i<00:01:58.170> think<00:01:58.380> i<00:01:58.469> actually<00:01:58.590> took

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
round anyway and i think i actually took

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.380 
round anyway and i think i actually took
that<00:01:59.130> going<00:01:59.369> out<00:01:59.460> with<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.700> betty<00:01:59.939> in<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.270> end

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
that going out with the betty in the end

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.440 
that going out with the betty in the end
