and<00:00:07.320> so<00:00:08.320> what<00:00:08.500> we're<00:00:08.680> hoping<00:00:08.710> for<00:00:09.190> is

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
and so what we're hoping for is

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.420 
and so what we're hoping for is
proactive<00:00:10.540> differentiation<00:00:11.500> these<00:00:12.100> little

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:12.430 
proactive differentiation these little

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.209 
proactive differentiation these little
guys<00:00:12.900> designed<00:00:13.900> a<00:00:14.049> bridge<00:00:14.320> kind<00:00:14.770> of<00:00:14.889> like<00:00:15.070> we

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
guys designed a bridge kind of like we

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.300 
guys designed a bridge kind of like we
design<00:00:15.549> lesson<00:00:15.969> plans<00:00:16.240> and<00:00:16.950> then<00:00:17.950> the<00:00:18.070> bridge

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
design lesson plans and then the bridge

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.330 
design lesson plans and then the bridge
got<00:00:18.550> built<00:00:18.820> and<00:00:19.470> they're<00:00:20.470> looking<00:00:20.830> at<00:00:20.949> it<00:00:21.010> and

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
got built and they're looking at it and

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.890 
got built and they're looking at it and
it's<00:00:21.490> just<00:00:21.580> not<00:00:21.940> quite<00:00:22.270> what<00:00:22.690> they<00:00:22.840> were

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
it's just not quite what they were

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.499 
it's just not quite what they were
envisioning<00:00:23.619> and<00:00:23.859> one<00:00:24.699> of<00:00:24.849> them<00:00:24.939> says<00:00:25.210> to<00:00:25.390> the

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509 
envisioning and one of them says to the

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.240 
envisioning and one of them says to the
other<00:00:25.660> one<00:00:25.900> so<00:00:26.140> much<00:00:26.320> for<00:00:26.589> winging<00:00:26.980> and<00:00:27.099> add

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
other one so much for winging and add

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.109 
other one so much for winging and add
next<00:00:27.609> time<00:00:27.789> we<00:00:27.970> plan<00:00:28.269> the<00:00:28.599> bridge<00:00:29.939> what<00:00:30.939> we're

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
next time we plan the bridge what we're

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.670 
next time we plan the bridge what we're
talking<00:00:31.539> about<00:00:31.630> with<00:00:31.960> differentiation

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
talking about with differentiation

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.460 
talking about with differentiation
that's<00:00:33.280> proactive<00:00:34.090> is<00:00:34.360> that<00:00:35.140> when<00:00:35.290> we

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
that's proactive is that when we

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.800 
that's proactive is that when we
improvise<00:00:36.100> or<00:00:36.579> overlook<00:00:37.300> student

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 
improvise or overlook student

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.780 
improvise or overlook student
differences<00:00:38.440> the<00:00:38.650> kids<00:00:38.920> and<00:00:39.220> the<00:00:39.280> content

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
differences the kids and the content

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.630 
differences the kids and the content
often<00:00:40.120> don't<00:00:40.570> connect<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:42.070> what<00:00:42.250> we're<00:00:42.400> trying

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
often don't connect so what we're trying

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.660 
often don't connect so what we're trying
to<00:00:42.760> do<00:00:42.970> is<00:00:43.270> plan<00:00:43.770> differentiation<00:00:44.770> so<00:00:45.460> that

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
to do is plan differentiation so that

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.310 
to do is plan differentiation so that
we're<00:00:45.850> really<00:00:46.150> looking<00:00:46.330> at<00:00:46.870> who<00:00:47.110> are<00:00:47.200> we

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
we're really looking at who are we

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.380 
we're really looking at who are we
trying<00:00:47.470> to<00:00:47.620> connect<00:00:48.070> this<00:00:48.220> content<00:00:48.790> to<00:00:48.880> and

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
what are the various ways we can make it

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.220 
what are the various ways we can make it

this<00:00:56.590> and<00:00:56.920> I<00:00:57.790> suspect<00:00:58.270> some<00:00:58.510> of<00:00:58.540> you<00:00:58.840> have

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
this and I suspect some of you have

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.160 
this and I suspect some of you have
experiences<00:00:59.830> as<00:01:00.040> students<00:01:00.580> and<00:01:00.790> to<00:01:01.630> be<00:01:01.750> honest

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
experiences as students and to be honest

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.390 
experiences as students and to be honest
I<00:01:02.290> would<00:01:02.350> have<00:01:02.620> to<00:01:02.770> say<00:01:02.950> that<00:01:02.980> I<00:01:03.190> have

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
I would have to say that I have

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.039 
I would have to say that I have
inflicted<00:01:03.760> this<00:01:04.119> as<00:01:04.330> a<00:01:04.360> teacher<00:01:04.689> and<00:01:04.930> I

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
inflicted this as a teacher and I

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:06.510 
inflicted this as a teacher and I
presume<00:01:05.470> some<00:01:05.680> of<00:01:05.799> the<00:01:05.860> rest<00:01:06.040> of<00:01:06.220> you<00:01:06.369> have

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
presume some of the rest of you have

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.190 
presume some of the rest of you have
here<00:01:06.820> as<00:01:06.939> well<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:09.420> happens<00:01:10.420> sometimes<00:01:11.020> of

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
here as well that happens sometimes of

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.690 
here as well that happens sometimes of
course<00:01:11.230> because<00:01:11.620> kids<00:01:11.830> are<00:01:12.040> sleep-deprived

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
course because kids are sleep-deprived

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.000 
course because kids are sleep-deprived
but<00:01:13.030> it<00:01:13.450> also<00:01:13.630> starts<00:01:14.200> to<00:01:14.260> happen<00:01:14.470> maybe<00:01:14.740> not

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
but it also starts to happen maybe not

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.100 
but it also starts to happen maybe not
completely<00:01:15.340> within<00:01:16.150> two<00:01:16.360> minutes<00:01:16.540> but<00:01:16.960> when

completely within two minutes but when

completely within two minutes but when
the<00:01:17.230> kid<00:01:17.410> realizes<00:01:18.070> she's<00:01:18.910> teaching<00:01:19.180> me<00:01:19.360> this

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
the kid realizes she's teaching me this

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.120

one<00:01:40.030> of<00:01:40.120> my<00:01:40.210> favorite<00:01:40.659> definitions<00:01:41.290> of

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
one of my favorite definitions of

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.620 
one of my favorite definitions of
differentiation<00:01:42.040> came<00:01:42.490> from<00:01:42.850> a<00:01:42.909> little

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
differentiation came from a little

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.760 
differentiation came from a little
middle<00:01:43.870> school<00:01:44.170> kid<00:01:44.440> that<00:01:44.470> I<00:01:44.680> was

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
middle school kid that I was

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.940 
middle school kid that I was
interviewing<00:01:45.430> and<00:01:45.760> she<00:01:46.120> said<00:01:46.420> to<00:01:46.659> me<00:01:46.690> she<00:01:47.530> was

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
interviewing and she said to me she was

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.530 
interviewing and she said to me she was
talking<00:01:48.280> to<00:01:48.370> me<00:01:48.490> about<00:01:48.580> a<00:01:48.729> class<00:01:49.030> that<00:01:49.330> was

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
talking to me about a class that was

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.060 
talking to me about a class that was
differentiated<00:01:50.380> that<00:01:50.500> she<00:01:50.680> thought<00:01:50.860> was

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
differentiated that she thought was

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.130 
differentiated that she thought was
really<00:01:51.340> effective<00:01:51.850> and<00:01:52.000> she<00:01:52.180> said<00:01:52.420> I<00:01:52.659> like

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
really effective and she said I like

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.660 
really effective and she said I like
this<00:01:53.350> class<00:01:53.680> because<00:01:53.979> there's<00:01:54.220> something

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
this class because there's something

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.899
