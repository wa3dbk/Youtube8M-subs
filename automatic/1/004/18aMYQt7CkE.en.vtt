00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
thought today I would talk a little bit

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.379 
thought today I would talk a little bit
about<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.680> sort<00:00:08.130> of<00:00:08.220> leveling<00:00:08.730> system<00:00:09.179> or

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
about the sort of leveling system or

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.110 
about the sort of leveling system or
tradition<00:00:09.990> system<00:00:10.530> as<00:00:11.400> I'll<00:00:11.580> probably<00:00:11.759> call

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
tradition system as I'll probably call

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.560 
tradition system as I'll probably call
it<00:00:12.590> that<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:13.769> will<00:00:14.009> basically<00:00:14.940> how<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.269> will

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
it that you will basically how you will

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.930 
it that you will basically how you will
gain<00:00:15.780> experience<00:00:16.500> how<00:00:16.980> your<00:00:17.160> army<00:00:17.490> as<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.640> whole

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
gain experience how your army as a whole

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.370 
gain experience how your army as a whole
will<00:00:18.449> level<00:00:19.279> and<00:00:20.279> what<00:00:20.820> kind<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.380> bonuses

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
will level and what kind of bonuses

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.410 
will level and what kind of bonuses
you're<00:00:22.560> going<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.800> get<00:00:22.890> things<00:00:23.189> like<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.550> so

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
you're going to get things like that so

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.839 
you're going to get things like that so
your<00:00:24.720> entire<00:00:24.990> army<00:00:25.410> will<00:00:25.710> gain<00:00:26.039> experience<00:00:26.609> as

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
your entire army will gain experience as

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.269 
your entire army will gain experience as
a<00:00:26.880> whole<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.480> progress<00:00:28.260> through<00:00:28.650> ten<00:00:29.039> levels

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
a whole and progress through ten levels

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.749 
a whole and progress through ten levels
and<00:00:29.760> each<00:00:30.359> level<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.289> gain<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:32.340> can

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
and each level that you gain you can

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.870 
and each level that you gain you can
choose<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.380> tradition<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.309> tradition<00:00:35.760> is

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
choose a tradition and a tradition is

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.270 
choose a tradition and a tradition is
basically<00:00:36.360> going<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.750> be<00:00:36.809> an<00:00:37.050> army<00:00:37.469> type<00:00:37.860> buff

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
basically going to be an army type buff

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.360 
basically going to be an army type buff
one<00:00:38.879> example<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.629> they<00:00:39.750> gave<00:00:39.930> was<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.590> heavy

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
one example that they gave was a heavy

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.299 
one example that they gave was a heavy
infantry<00:00:41.730> buff<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.840> would<00:00:42.960> basically

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
infantry buff so it would basically

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.729 
infantry buff so it would basically
increase<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.550> attack<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.239> defense<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.230> all

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
increase the attack and defense of all

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.970 
increase the attack and defense of all
heavy<00:00:47.100> infantry<00:00:47.840> unit<00:00:48.840> types<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.469> your<00:00:49.680> army

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
heavy infantry unit types in your army

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.880 
heavy infantry unit types in your army
and<00:00:50.210> each<00:00:51.210> buff<00:00:51.660> or<00:00:51.960> tradition<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.680> get

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
and each buff or tradition that you get

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.670 
and each buff or tradition that you get
has<00:00:53.399> three<00:00:53.820> levels<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.449> total<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:55.410> by<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.559> time

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
has three levels in total so by the time

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.350 
has three levels in total so by the time
you<00:00:56.010> get<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.190> level<00:00:56.640> 10<00:00:56.940> you're<00:00:57.180> probably

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
you get to level 10 you're probably

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.160 
you get to level 10 you're probably
going<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.660> have<00:00:57.809> three<00:00:58.289> maxed<00:00:58.859> out<00:00:59.059> traditions

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
going to have three maxed out traditions

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.049 
going to have three maxed out traditions
which<00:01:01.170> will<00:01:01.320> make<00:01:01.410> nine<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.949> then<00:01:02.489> you're

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
which will make nine and then you're

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.359 
which will make nine and then you're
going<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.239> have<00:01:03.300> one<00:01:03.899> more<00:01:04.049> level<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.710> invest

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
going to have one more level to invest

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.170 
going to have one more level to invest
in<00:01:05.610> whatever<00:01:06.240> other<00:01:06.810> trait<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.740> want<00:01:08.180> so

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
in whatever other trait to you want so

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.700 
in whatever other trait to you want so
in<00:01:09.540> my<00:01:09.689> opinion<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:10.200> think<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.560> really

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
in my opinion I think this is really

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.039 
in my opinion I think this is really
cool<00:01:11.130> system<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.760> think<00:01:12.180> we're<00:01:12.750> going<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.930> be

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
cool system I think we're going to be

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.649 
cool system I think we're going to be
able<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.439> customize<00:01:14.010> our<00:01:14.220> Army's<00:01:14.610> tailor<00:01:15.479> it

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
able to customize our Army's tailor it

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.359 
able to customize our Army's tailor it
to<00:01:15.689> how<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:15.960> want<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.290> play<00:01:16.470> which<00:01:16.890> would<00:01:17.250> be

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
to how we want to play which would be

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.219 
to how we want to play which would be
really<00:01:17.520> cool<00:01:17.790> but<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.360> just<00:01:18.540> hope<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.780> they're

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
really cool but I just hope that they're

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.550 
really cool but I just hope that they're
they're<00:01:19.830> designing<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:21.150> huge<00:01:22.020> variety<00:01:22.229> of

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
they're designing a huge variety of

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.950 
they're designing a huge variety of
these<00:01:22.860> traditions<00:01:23.400> because<00:01:24.180> if<00:01:24.659> they've<00:01:24.810> only

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
these traditions because if they've only

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.899 
these traditions because if they've only
got<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> few<00:01:25.409> sort<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.710> main<00:01:25.920> traditions<00:01:26.490> people

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
got a few sort of main traditions people

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.310 
got a few sort of main traditions people
are<00:01:27.030> just<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.360> pick<00:01:27.570> like<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.020> three

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
are just going to pick like the three

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.600 
are just going to pick like the three
main<00:01:28.560> say<00:01:28.920> heavy<00:01:29.220> infantry<00:01:29.610> cavalry<00:01:30.150> and

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
main say heavy infantry cavalry and

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.960 
main say heavy infantry cavalry and
Archer<00:01:32.610> bonus<00:01:33.570> or<00:01:33.930> buffs<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:35.040> they're<00:01:35.759> just

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
Archer bonus or buffs and they're just

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.760 
Archer bonus or buffs and they're just
going<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.180> maxs<00:01:36.360> those<00:01:36.659> out<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.170> then<00:01:37.350> get<00:01:37.560> one

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
going to maxs those out and then get one

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.999 
going to maxs those out and then get one
more<00:01:38.180> so<00:01:39.180> I'm<00:01:39.990> not<00:01:40.200> really<00:01:40.259> sure<00:01:40.500> whether

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
more so I'm not really sure whether

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.609 
more so I'm not really sure whether
there'll<00:01:41.280> be<00:01:41.400> enough<00:01:42.000> variety<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:43.079> warrant

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
there'll be enough variety to warrant

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.850 
there'll be enough variety to warrant
gang<00:01:43.950> any<00:01:44.340> other<00:01:45.259> traditions<00:01:46.259> other<00:01:46.590> than

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
gang any other traditions other than

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.740 
gang any other traditions other than
like<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.369> heavy<00:01:47.579> infantry<00:01:47.909> one<00:01:48.270> because<00:01:48.540> I

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
like the heavy infantry one because I

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.359 
like the heavy infantry one because I
guess<00:01:48.960> most<00:01:49.320> people<00:01:49.409> will<00:01:49.770> just<00:01:49.979> pick<00:01:50.189> that

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
guess most people will just pick that

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.160 
guess most people will just pick that
because<00:01:50.729> most<00:01:51.000> armies<00:01:51.390> have<00:01:51.630> at<00:01:51.750> least<00:01:51.899> some

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
because most armies have at least some

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.399 
because most armies have at least some
heavy<00:01:52.439> infantry<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:53.659> but<00:01:54.659> i<00:01:54.689> don't<00:01:54.930> know<00:01:55.020> maybe

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
heavy infantry in but i don't know maybe

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.789 
heavy infantry in but i don't know maybe
they'll<00:01:55.710> be<00:01:55.890> creative<00:01:56.549> with<00:01:57.030> their

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
they'll be creative with their

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.100 
they'll be creative with their
traditions<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:59.250> fingers<00:02:00.090> crossed<00:02:00.119> but<00:02:01.020> if

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
traditions so fingers crossed but if

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.359 
traditions so fingers crossed but if
they<00:02:01.259> do<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.469> well<00:02:01.619> i<00:02:01.649> think<00:02:01.829> it'd<00:02:02.070> be<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.189> really

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
they do it well i think it'd be a really

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.359 
they do it well i think it'd be a really
good<00:02:02.549> system<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.960> if<00:02:04.409> your<00:02:04.680> army<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.009> killed

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
good system so if your army is killed

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.449 
good system so if your army is killed
it's<00:02:05.990> you<00:02:06.990> know<00:02:07.140> unfortunate<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.069> lose<00:02:08.280> all

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
it's you know unfortunate you lose all

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.010 
it's you know unfortunate you lose all
those<00:02:08.610> soldiers<00:02:08.910> but<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.479> don't<00:02:09.840> necessarily

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
those soldiers but you don't necessarily

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.470 
those soldiers but you don't necessarily
lose<00:02:10.739> all<00:02:11.160> their<00:02:11.400> traditions<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.330> you've

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
lose all their traditions that you've

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.400 
lose all their traditions that you've
taken<00:02:12.660> ages

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
taken ages

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.350 
taken ages
to<00:02:13.620> get<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:14.070> you<00:02:14.280> know<00:02:14.400> level<00:02:14.700> ten<00:02:14.730> with

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
to get to you know level ten with

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.330 
to get to you know level ten with
whatever<00:02:15.990> assortment<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.770> traditions<00:02:17.190> you

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
whatever assortment of traditions you

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.820 
whatever assortment of traditions you
had<00:02:17.630> they're<00:02:18.630> not<00:02:18.750> completely<00:02:19.020> lost<00:02:19.440> what<00:02:19.740> you

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
had they're not completely lost what you

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.210 
had they're not completely lost what you
can<00:02:19.980> do<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:20.310> go<00:02:20.520> back<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.880> settlement<00:02:21.180> and

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
can do is go back to a settlement and

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.270 
can do is go back to a settlement and
presumably<00:02:23.220> at<00:02:23.520> some<00:02:24.150> cost<00:02:24.800> you<00:02:25.800> can<00:02:26.010> raise

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
presumably at some cost you can raise

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.860 
presumably at some cost you can raise
the<00:02:26.610> banner<00:02:27.170> effectively<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:29.270> sort<00:02:30.270> of<00:02:30.390> I

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
the banner effectively and sort of I

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.580 
the banner effectively and sort of I
guess<00:02:31.730> reteach<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:33.390> learnings<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:34.200> the

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
guess reteach the learnings of the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.150 
guess reteach the learnings of the
particular<00:02:35.520> Legion<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.840> had<00:02:37.080> I<00:02:37.350> guess

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
particular Legion that you had I guess

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.770 
particular Legion that you had I guess
is<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.490> idea<00:02:38.820> that<00:02:38.880> they're<00:02:39.150> going<00:02:39.300> for<00:02:39.600> so

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
is the idea that they're going for so

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.040 
is the idea that they're going for so
you<00:02:39.810> can<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.590> can<00:02:40.740> retrain<00:02:41.190> them<00:02:41.690> but<00:02:42.690> your

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
you can you can retrain them but your

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.960 
you can you can retrain them but your
individual<00:02:43.560> units<00:02:43.920> obviously<00:02:44.490> won't<00:02:44.670> keep

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
individual units obviously won't keep

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.490 
individual units obviously won't keep
their<00:02:45.420> individual<00:02:46.200> experience<00:02:47.160> gained<00:02:48.140> so<00:02:49.140> ya

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
their individual experience gained so ya

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.330 
their individual experience gained so ya
know<00:02:49.710> it<00:02:50.070> seems<00:02:50.370> like<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.760> really<00:02:51.600> cool<00:02:51.810> system

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
know it seems like a really cool system

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.770 
know it seems like a really cool system
and<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.550> think<00:02:53.760> they're<00:02:53.910> focusing<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.510> lot<00:02:54.630> more

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
and I think they're focusing a lot more

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.350 
and I think they're focusing a lot more
like<00:02:55.230> customization<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.520> sort<00:02:56.850> of<00:02:56.940> tailoring

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
like customization and sort of tailoring

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.260 
like customization and sort of tailoring
