 this issue is to solve the conflict and 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.980
 Brazilian and how it comes 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.560
 developing with this I want to try 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.860
 make it clear to you all about 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.660
 rr fashion games and how to put together a 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.880

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.650
 so that day will be made in parts 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.740
 for you to understand how it works 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:51.260
 this great market that from 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:55.460
 now it will not be in Brazil the growth 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.170
 of the very personal competitive landscape in 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.000
 my humble opinion is not about 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.550
 just a good time that Brazil 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.320
 currently living economically but rather 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.960
 because the Brazilian people are 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.149
 developing development caused by 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.120
 for work and time for us 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.420
 Brazilians not by someone or some 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.940
 political party, especially where I 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.400
 I want to arrive is that Brazil is a country 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.310
 extensive and so there are not millions 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.220
 of inhabitants then to five ten years 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.440
 behind there were inhabitants but there was 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.670
 technology and enough background with 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.760
 conditions to sustain trade 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.470
 the sport is already happening 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.590
 in the united states in europe 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.420
 Then you ask me and why now? 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:46.250
 Brazil will be able to keep this great 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:48.230
 trade of games with the arrival of lightning
