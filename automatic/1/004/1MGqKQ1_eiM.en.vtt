side<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.560> gyroscope<00:01:38.130> detects<00:01:38.520> this

side the gyroscope detects this

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.969 
side the gyroscope detects this
deviation<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.540> gives<00:01:40.290> signals<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.950> a

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
deviation and gives signals to a
