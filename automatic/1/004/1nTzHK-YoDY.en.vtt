00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.880
 environmental awareness and energy saving 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.290
 are always higher on the political and 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.990
 social agenda 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.059
 the technical university of eindhoven 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.949
 contributes to this 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.449
 by using a heat and 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:24.630
 cold storage system it heat and 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.060
 cold storage system was on it in 2002 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.730
 tue site 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.890
 the tue saves about 3 annually 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.710
 million kilowatt hours of electricity 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.059
 and six hundred thousand cubic meters 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.680
 natural gas 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.680
 that is equivalent to energy consumption 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.110
 of 850 households 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.660
 the saving on CO2 emissions is 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.530
 similar to the planting of 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:53.039
 100,000 trees 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:56.250
 a whole forest and heat and cold storage 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.530
 system's name says it already stores heat 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.190
 and cold up in the soil 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.100
 the storage medium is water 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.710
 the heat and cold are stored in 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.759
 a layer of sand between two watertight ones 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.560
 low 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.009
 this sand layer is saturated with 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.009
 ground water 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.250
 are you constructing the system 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.930
 to one or more cold and warm 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.300
 wells drilled 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.220
 via a pipe network with heat exchangers 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.690
 these sources with the to 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.690
 buildings connected 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.009
 when storing heat and cold 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.810
 using the seasons 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.229
 groundwater is pumped up in winter 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.940
 from the hot springs to this hot water 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.140
 heat is extracted 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.080
 used to construct the building 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:48.509
 heat the cooled water 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.509
 then injected into the cold hum 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.800
 the cooled water is used in the summer 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.750
 used to cool the building 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.420
 la that the cold water is out of the soil 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.610
 You will be pumped via the heat exchanger 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.350
 cold withdrawn 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.840
 this water then becomes a few degrees 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.679
 warmer and then in the hot spring 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.679
 injected 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.160
 the heat and cold storage system of the 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.660
 tea in one is it right now 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.519
 largest in the Netherlands 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.320
 the system consists of three 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.320
 main parts 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:28.750
 warm clusters cold clusters and one 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:31.000
 underground piping on the tue 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.790
 grounds are three warm 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.269
 clusters each cluster consists of four 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.470
 up to six hot springs of 125 each 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.350
 cubic meters per hour 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.420
 or 35 liters per second 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.540
 a source is a well of about 80 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.610
 meters deep in the well is a pump and 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.410
 an injection line 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.410
 depending on the heat or cold 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:58.090
 need is the pump running or the 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.090
 induction line opened 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.130
 also the 3 cold clusters on the site 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.240
 each consist of four to six cold 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.190
 sources 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.480
 the operation is the same as that of the 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.370
 hot springs 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.900
 the only difference is the temperature of 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.120
 the water 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.670
 the groundwater is in the hot springs 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.330
 about 15 degrees Celsius and in the 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.510
 cold springs 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.060
 8 degrees Celsius the normal groundwater 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.810
 temperature is around 11 to 12 degrees 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.810
 celcius 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.540
 the hot and cold clusters are 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.730
 connected to an underground pipe 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.250
 with further being currently 12 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:41.840
 buildings and the two cooling towers on it 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:44.480
 connected to the cooling towers 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.540
 ensure extra supply of cold to 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.880
 the heat and cold storage system that is 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.400
 needed because the need for cold in the 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.990
 tue buildings is larger than the 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.940
 need for heat 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.200
 as a result, otherwise a shortage of cold 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.200
 in the ground 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.700
 about half of it goes in the winter 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.610
 all heat supplied by the system 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.440
 but the 12 connected buildings 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.659
 the other half goes to the cooling towers 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:16.359
 those at sufficiently low temperatures 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:18.699
 extra cold drawer in summer becomes 100% 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:25.600
 of the cold supplied by the system 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:28.330
 the connected buildings make use of the 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:32.080
 buildings of the tue that are part 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.940
 of the campus 2020 housing plan 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.000
 are all connected to it 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.280
 heat and cold storage system that is 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.169
 because of this better utilized and that is still possible 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.000
 more energy is saved 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.729
 it is expected that this will cause the 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.340
 saving on electricity increases from 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.419
 three to four million kilowatt hours per 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.750
 year 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:56.789
 the saving on gas rises from 600,000 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.789
 to a million cubic meters per year
