mostly<00:02:09.119> container<00:02:09.599> it's<00:02:09.869> not<00:02:09.989> all<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.200> way

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
mostly container it's not all the way

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.559 
mostly container it's not all the way
around<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.770> container<00:02:11.030> this<00:02:12.030> thing<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.390> know

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
around the container this thing you know

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.760 
around the container this thing you know
you're<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.110> plant<00:02:13.379> this

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
you're to plant this

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.130 
you're to plant this
plant<00:02:13.980> water<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.000> fertilizer<00:02:15.450> right<00:02:15.810> you're

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
plant water and fertilizer right you're

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.500 
plant water and fertilizer right you're
going<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.350> be<00:02:16.440> doing<00:02:16.620> good<00:02:17.040> it's<00:02:17.820> got<00:02:18.090> great

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
going to be doing good it's got great

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.010 
going to be doing good it's got great
results<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.710> long<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:22.910> that's<00:02:23.910> going<00:02:24.720> into

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
results so long and so that's going into

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.610 
results so long and so that's going into
the<00:02:25.170> ground<00:02:25.880> if<00:02:26.880> we<00:02:26.970> can<00:02:27.180> hose<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.690> off<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:28.320> free

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
the ground if we can hose it off to free

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.100 
the ground if we can hose it off to free
up<00:02:28.710> some<00:02:28.890> these<00:02:29.070> roots<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:30.150> can<00:02:30.360> finger<00:02:30.720> rough

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
up some these roots you can finger rough

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.460 
up some these roots you can finger rough
it<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.320> little<00:02:31.470> bit<00:02:32.300> get<00:02:33.300> this<00:02:33.450> root<00:02:33.750> system<00:02:34.230> so

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
it a little bit get this root system so

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.660 
it a little bit get this root system so
it's<00:02:34.620> not<00:02:34.880> bound<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.150> root<00:02:36.360> ball<00:02:37.520> put<00:02:38.520> them

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
it's not bound to the root ball put them

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.520 
it's not bound to the root ball put them
hanging<00:02:39.060> off<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.330> side<00:02:39.570> here<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.140> we<00:02:40.260> put<00:02:40.500> our

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
hanging off the side here so we put our

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.360 
hanging off the side here so we put our
backfill<00:02:41.160> mix<00:02:41.490> in<00:02:42.440> they<00:02:43.440> root<00:02:43.740> out<00:02:43.890> into<00:02:44.280> the

backfill mix in they root out into the

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.090 
backfill mix in they root out into the
backfill<00:02:44.850> mix<00:02:45.210> and<00:02:45.480> begin<00:02:45.810> taking<00:02:46.590> up<00:02:46.830> water

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
backfill mix and begin taking up water

got the apricot tree over here Ted at

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.209 
got the apricot tree over here Ted at
the<00:03:50.969> initial<00:03:51.390> watery<00:03:51.810> that's<00:03:52.709> still<00:03:52.980> never

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
guarantee you as muddy as this is that's

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.860 
guarantee you as muddy as this is that's
still<00:04:04.799> not<00:04:05.040> enough<00:04:05.239> to<00:04:06.239> get<00:04:06.420> this<00:04:06.599> tree

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
still not enough to get this tree

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.690 
still not enough to get this tree
thoroughly<00:04:07.469> wet<00:04:07.879> get<00:04:08.879> pull<00:04:09.180> down<00:04:09.420> here<00:04:09.900> and

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
thoroughly wet get pull down here and

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.330 
thoroughly wet get pull down here and
eventually<00:04:11.700> get<00:04:11.849> to<00:04:12.000> some<00:04:12.180> dry<00:04:12.480> soil<00:04:13.159> you<00:04:14.159> want

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
eventually get to some dry soil you want

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.210 
eventually get to some dry soil you want
to<00:04:14.430> have<00:04:14.579> this<00:04:14.790> soil<00:04:15.120> this<00:04:15.900> tree<00:04:16.410> just

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
to have this soil this tree just

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.550 
to have this soil this tree just
swimming<00:04:18.000> in<00:04:18.090> water<00:04:18.329> the<00:04:18.690> first<00:04:18.959> day<00:04:19.229> or<00:04:19.380> two

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
swimming in water the first day or two

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.629 
swimming in water the first day or two
out<00:04:19.799> so<00:04:20.579> that<00:04:20.699> there's<00:04:20.880> no<00:04:20.940> drying<00:04:21.509> out<00:04:21.840> of<00:04:22.049> it

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.779 

so<00:04:26.639> that's<00:04:26.789> about<00:04:27.060> the<00:04:27.479> roots<00:04:27.780> and<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.110> basic

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:28.789 
so that's about the roots and the basic

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:34.009 
so that's about the roots and the basic
wedding<00:04:29.789> of<00:04:29.940> this<00:04:30.470> initial<00:04:31.470> planting
