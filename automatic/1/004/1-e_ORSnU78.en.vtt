00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.280
 good this video is that I wanted to record 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:18.340
 we recorded it but we could not 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:21.700
 record could not prove it better said no 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:25.420
 me 50 years of recording was in the building 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.100
 what's behind this 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.750
 yes 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:35.530
 and there you have it because I focus on this 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:38.020
 very simple because that arch as you see 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.559
 it's a kind of square arch worth 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:46.120
 because everything in the middle is heaven is 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:48.579
 say is the hole completely this 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.760
 there is a lot of wind 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:55.829
 if they let me get close because the 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.829
 another night they looked perfectly 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:19.439
 and there does not have to be anything because there 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.570
 There are several groups of spheres exactly 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.090
 ar now we can see it better one two 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.090
 three down voucher 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.939
 there they are, they are beautiful 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.590
 love I love it is not there still 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:43.729
 there you have it 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:47.719
 that is a time in google man that 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:50.600
 look for the skyscrapers of the square 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:52.280
 Castilla de Madrid and you will see that this 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.009
 is the building with the square arch 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.840
 up totally hollow there's no 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:06.390
 absolutely nothing 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:11.690
 and yet there is fuck 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.690
 and there it is 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:23.110
 let's go air but good 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.680
 They appreciate us perfectly I think we go 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.680
 to do a test 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:38.970
 If you do not stop, do not take the rest 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.970
 you have drinks you have 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.210
 there you have them 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:51.150
 there is this wonder, well, that is 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.510
 completely exploding in the middle of 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.409
 building gap 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.409
 or not 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.500
 credit asked 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.980
 and there it is there is 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.830
 and impressive 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.329
 I assure you that there are no 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.329
 absolutely nothing nothing but heaven 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.319
 may well explain what explains it 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.209
 this video I love for the 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.980
 skeptics to explain what it is that 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:54.010
 is what is there in the middle of a 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.010
 hollow in a skyscraper of madrid 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.720
 there you have it 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.970
 I repeat who wants to check the 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.900
 building that look for the skyscrapers of 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.900
 the plaza castilla in madrid 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:19.310
 and you'll see that I know that part of the building 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.310
 it's completely hollow 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.310
 completely strike 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.180
 but no 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.920
 and there you have it as an illuminator 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.920
 egg 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.919
 There it is, I love it 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:47.919
 and I love it 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.180
