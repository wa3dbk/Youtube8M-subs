 modality that now yes that as such as 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.080

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.580
 go quickly to the citadel 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.350
 the idea is there to buy something for the 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.940
 for all the people to be so one day 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.360

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.110
 that people can win these gifts 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.209
 so good kids commented we started 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.740
 with the block of today this as I say 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.770

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.500

 He thinks that I'm watching because I come 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.080
 driving but good is paying 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:52.410
 then we have to not go much 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.370
 interference with light 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.370
 today I have many 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.019
 at level I am with Mr. dyn the 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.120
 promotional material is blue now 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.599
 it comes from pollution but more money 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.400
 for a change of blue and we're screaming at 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.989
 shrink some games because I want to say 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.980
 be someone local these points 5 hd 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:20.900
 remix that pinche hdmi 2.5 this 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.350
 remix remix of I do not know what else if you 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.890
 get a good name is half average 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.520
 but ridiculous in reality but positive 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.520
 here is play 3 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.379
 Once I'm around here I'm going 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.379
 here 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.220
 because surely the distribution 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.860
 as classes whenever you go it does not come from 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.810
 I understood that I could be 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.810
 wrong but I do not see it much 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.709
 we do not eat 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.610
 also and 3 according to the web that explains 4 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.080
 let's see psp we have a mega fail 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.330
 you played the everest or you came to see 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.040
 game that was like the black ops but 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.870
 for psp 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.970
 I wanted to I wanted to play that but never 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.110
 I was like Carlos, I liked it 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.319
 as 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.750
 play 3 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:22.440
 but the cover does not look 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.570
 the escrow house but not four campuses 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.230
 they are from this fail 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:31.150
 let's go keep looking elsewhere 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.850
 good when we get your corners in 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.280
 citadel we did not find the game we went 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.870
 to search 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.870
 in plans that we are going to look for 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.200
 it's good to be walmart I do not know if it's worth 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.460
 It's a shame to meddle because I do not think it's 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:53.060
 so I think it's worth mothers or 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.600
 the law and it is currently and consolation 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.600
 it's going to be our 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:15.080
 please let's cook the house and we 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.560
 we are talking more about you for 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.810
 start with him 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.970
 we are going to put it in the camera of the 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.630
 Goku's time almost almost as soon as he gets 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.270
 the shot with ag 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:30.320
 exact 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.320
 on the front 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.370
 and what else has 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.310
 barry that today 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.490
 she 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.250
 plus 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.280
 ambient 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.889
 the cookies 

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:20.119
 to 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.570
 here is the scene 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.900
 quietly but good since we're going 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:35.100
 to follow him then said kids that 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.870
 apart from buying that stop issuing to 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.500
 buy a gift for you for the 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:42.040
 five thousand subs 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:44.500
 but better tomorrow I have more time 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.120
 let's spend the sun and let's find the 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.670
 game and together with your gifts 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:53.410
 I'm thinking theoretically on cards 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:59.710
 of points to be the most common for 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:07:01.990
 anything several second three and 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:06.010
 that people have more opportunity to 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:09.010
 win not tell me who is said 

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:11.350
 razor or nothing kids to I thought that one what 

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:13.480
 does in good faith if there are people who 

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:16.660
 really will be dedicated to doing that 

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:20.350
 one what a bad wave and two a great sum of 

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:22.020
 because it's not me it's not my plan we continue 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:24.720
 here in citadel 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.889
 they told me without sun the web are the ones that 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.770
 they are like there is no media we do not want 

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:31.050
 less is not so not tonight the 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:34.560
 true but it is more rare that there is almost 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:37.830
 As it comes alone I was here in it 

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:40.529
 for what was the good end and it was not a 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:43.019
 Desmadre this matter 

00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:44.249
 of the square but well we're going for the 

00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:48.499
 home 

00:07:44.249 --> 00:07:48.499
 this is the most block
