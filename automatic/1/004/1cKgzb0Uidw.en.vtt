00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
different types we're going to be using

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.639 
different types we're going to be using
for<00:00:34.200> this

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
for this

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.500 
for this
this<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.309> priming<00:00:35.760> sugar<00:00:35.820> we<00:00:36.180> don't<00:00:36.329> have<00:00:36.420> to

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
this is priming sugar we don't have to

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.049 
this is priming sugar we don't have to
worry<00:00:36.660> about<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:37.140> until<00:00:37.670> we<00:00:38.670> start<00:00:38.879> bottling

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
worry about this until we start bottling

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.670 
worry about this until we start bottling
which<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.540> going<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.690> be<00:00:39.840> way<00:00:40.020> down<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
which is going to be way down in the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.389 
which is going to be way down in the
process<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.309> already<00:00:41.610> about<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:42.200> for<00:00:43.200> now

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
process of already about that for now

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.610 
process of already about that for now
this<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> specialty<00:00:45.120> greens<00:00:45.480> two<00:00:46.260> different

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
types we're going to be using we got

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.819 
types we're going to be using we got
some<00:00:49.829> dry<00:00:50.250> malt<00:00:50.640> extract<00:00:51.449> yeah<00:00:51.870> packages<00:00:52.680> of

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
some dry malt extract yeah packages of

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.160 
some dry malt extract yeah packages of
those<00:00:53.149> we<00:00:54.149> got<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> yeast<00:00:54.750> which<00:00:54.989> we'll<00:00:55.140> be

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
those we got a yeast which we'll be

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.020 
those we got a yeast which we'll be
using<00:00:55.289> later<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.070> process<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.879> this

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
using later on in the process and this

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.520 
using later on in the process and this
is<00:00:57.090> for<00:00:57.390> our<00:00:57.480> specialty<00:00:57.870> grains<00:00:58.140> looks<00:00:58.379> like<00:00:58.500> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
is for our specialty grains looks like a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.950 
is for our specialty grains looks like a
little<00:00:58.770> sack<00:00:59.039> over<00:00:59.309> there<00:00:59.510> yeah<00:01:00.510> maybe<00:01:00.870> I

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
little sack over there yeah maybe I

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.479 
little sack over there yeah maybe I
should<00:01:01.050> use<00:01:01.350> my<00:01:01.530> own<00:01:01.680> SAP<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.219> give<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.460> a

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
should use my own SAP to give it a

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.310 
should use my own SAP to give it a
little<00:01:02.609> bit<00:01:02.760> extra<00:01:02.910> flavor<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.809> know<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:03.960> used

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
a flounder that's kind of tell me the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.359 
a flounder that's kind of tell me the
temperature<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:27.990> water<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.619> what<00:01:29.250> we

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
temperature of the water and what we

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.160 
temperature of the water and what we
want<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.670> do<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:30.000> get<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.390> about<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.689> hundred

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
that's what this recipe calls for for

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.789 
that's what this recipe calls for for
the<00:04:15.390> Imperial<00:04:15.930> pale<00:04:16.200> ale

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799

of beer actually calls for three
different<00:04:33.270> types<00:04:33.419> of<00:04:33.510> hops<00:04:33.660> like<00:04:33.750> I<00:04:33.900> mentioned

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
different types of hops like I mentioned

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.050 
different types of hops like I mentioned
before<00:04:34.200> one<00:04:34.530> the<00:04:34.620> first<00:04:34.800> one<00:04:34.950> I'm<00:04:35.760> going<00:04:35.910> to<00:04:35.970> be

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
before one the first one I'm going to be

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.270 
before one the first one I'm going to be
putting<00:04:36.300> in<00:04:36.540> Columbus<00:04:37.380> it's<00:04:38.100> at<00:04:38.220> the

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
putting in Columbus it's at the

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.070 
putting in Columbus it's at the
beginning<00:04:38.370> of<00:04:38.700> the<00:04:38.760> boil<00:04:38.940> then<00:04:39.780> I'm<00:04:39.930> going<00:04:40.050> to

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080
