00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
answer on a second thought I agreed with

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.470 
answer on a second thought I agreed with
him<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:28.769> however<00:03:29.400> i<00:03:29.489> believe<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:30.060> host<00:03:30.299> was

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
him and however i believe the host was

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.930 
him and however i believe the host was
bluffing<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.110> correct<00:03:31.470> answer<00:03:31.799> was<00:03:32.040> D<00:03:32.310> so

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
bluffing and the correct answer was D so

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.270 
bluffing and the correct answer was D so
that<00:03:33.090> means<00:03:33.299> that<00:03:33.390> I<00:03:33.510> got<00:03:33.720> no<00:03:33.989> points<00:03:34.290> for<00:03:34.650> not

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
that means that I got no points for not

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.949 
that means that I got no points for not
getting<00:03:35.580> a<00:03:35.640> correct<00:03:35.910> answer<00:03:36.060> however<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:36.900> also

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
getting a correct answer however I also

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.580 
getting a correct answer however I also
lose<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.500> point<00:03:37.830> for<00:03:38.340> agreeing<00:03:38.700> with<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.060> host
