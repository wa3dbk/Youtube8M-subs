to<00:02:29.900> page<00:02:30.230> 40<00:02:30.850> where<00:02:31.850> you<00:02:32.030> have<00:02:32.330> a<00:02:32.780> reading

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
to page 40 where you have a reading

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.200 
to page 40 where you have a reading
study<00:02:33.680> that's<00:02:33.890> just<00:02:34.190> using<00:02:34.460> those<00:02:34.580> notes<00:02:34.880> d<00:02:35.180> e

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
study that's just using those notes d e

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.750 
study that's just using those notes d e
and<00:02:35.390> f<00:02:35.690> there's<00:02:36.230> a<00:02:36.320> CD<00:02:36.710> track<00:02:37.010> for<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:37.490> you<00:02:37.730> can

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
and f there's a CD track for it you can

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.190 
and f there's a CD track for it you can
run<00:02:38.060> through<00:02:38.300> that<00:02:38.330> hopefully<00:02:38.870> it'll<00:02:39.080> sound

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
run through that hopefully it'll sound

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.080 
run through that hopefully it'll sound
all<00:02:39.440> right<00:02:39.560> for<00:02:39.830> you<00:02:39.950> then<00:02:40.670> I'm<00:02:40.790> going<00:02:40.880> to<00:02:40.940> have

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
all right for you then I'm going to have

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.850 
all right for you then I'm going to have
you<00:02:41.120> do<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.360> note<00:02:41.690> identification<00:02:42.470> worksheet

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
you do the note identification worksheet

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.360 
you do the note identification worksheet
on<00:02:42.890> page<00:02:43.280> 42<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:45.440> might<00:02:45.590> need<00:02:45.740> to<00:02:45.860> review<00:02:46.190> some

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
on page 42 you might need to review some

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.010 
on page 42 you might need to review some
of<00:02:46.430> those<00:02:46.610> notes<00:02:46.910> on<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.210> other<00:02:47.330> strings<00:02:47.690> for

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
of those notes on the other strings for

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.320 
of those notes on the other strings for
this<00:02:48.170> because<00:02:48.770> this<00:02:48.980> does<00:02:49.190> use<00:02:49.220> all<00:02:49.790> four

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
this because this does use all four

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.090 
this because this does use all four
strings<00:02:50.720> all<00:02:50.990> the<00:02:51.140> notes<00:02:51.320> that<00:02:51.530> you<00:02:51.650> know<00:02:51.830> so

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
strings all the notes that you know so

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.280 
strings all the notes that you know so
far<00:02:52.370> so<00:02:52.970> I<00:02:53.000> want<00:02:53.210> you<00:02:53.270> to<00:02:53.360> complete<00:02:53.750> this<00:02:53.990> and

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
far so I want you to complete this and

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.440 
far so I want you to complete this and
then<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:54.770> can<00:02:54.920> get<00:02:55.070> started<00:02:55.250> on<00:02:55.490> page<00:02:55.700> 43

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
then you can get started on page 43

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.930 
then you can get started on page 43
which<00:02:57.050> is<00:02:57.260> all<00:02:57.710> the<00:02:58.040> notes<00:02:58.250> that<00:02:58.490> you<00:02:58.640> have

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
which is all the notes that you have

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.060 
which is all the notes that you have
learned<00:02:59.090> so<00:02:59.390> far<00:02:59.420> in<00:02:59.930> a<00:03:00.140> reading<00:03:00.440> study<00:03:00.740> so

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
learned so far in a reading study so

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.370 
learned so far in a reading study so
there's<00:03:01.250> a<00:03:01.310> CD<00:03:01.610> track<00:03:01.970> for<00:03:02.300> it<00:03:02.420> goes<00:03:03.020> kind<00:03:03.290> of

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
there's a CD track for it goes kind of

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.780 
there's a CD track for it goes kind of
fast<00:03:03.590> so<00:03:03.860> I<00:03:03.890> want<00:03:04.070> you<00:03:04.130> to<00:03:04.250> be<00:03:04.370> able<00:03:04.400> to<00:03:04.610> take

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
fast so I want you to be able to take

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.270 
fast so I want you to be able to take
this<00:03:05.030> line<00:03:05.690> by<00:03:05.930> line<00:03:06.170> slowly<00:03:06.830> with<00:03:07.250> the

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
this line by line slowly with the

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.550 
this line by line slowly with the
metronome<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:08.090> then<00:03:08.600> work<00:03:08.870> your<00:03:08.900> tempo<00:03:09.380> up

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
metronome and then work your tempo up

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.920 
metronome and then work your tempo up
and<00:03:09.860> then<00:03:10.070> try<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:10.459> with<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.700> CV<00:03:11.180> a<00:03:11.390> good

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
and then try it with the CV a good

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.630 
and then try it with the CV a good
strategy<00:03:12.170> might<00:03:12.620> be<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.770> try<00:03:13.070> to<00:03:13.130> play<00:03:13.400> the

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
strategy might be to try to play the

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.750 
strategy might be to try to play the
whole<00:03:13.820> page<00:03:14.270> at<00:03:14.840> 60<00:03:15.470> beats<00:03:15.650> per<00:03:15.800> minute<00:03:16.250> once

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
whole page at 60 beats per minute once

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.760 
whole page at 60 beats per minute once
you<00:03:16.880> can<00:03:17.060> do<00:03:17.239> that<00:03:17.270> move<00:03:17.660> it<00:03:17.840> up<00:03:17.930> to<00:03:18.110> about<00:03:18.230> 65

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
you can do that move it up to about 65

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.160 
you can do that move it up to about 65
and<00:03:19.459> then<00:03:19.880> once<00:03:20.060> you<00:03:20.180> can<00:03:20.330> do<00:03:20.480> that<00:03:20.510> try<00:03:21.110> it
