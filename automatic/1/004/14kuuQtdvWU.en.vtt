00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.500 
but the Yankees you know times are tough
I<00:00:53.610> guess<00:00:53.640> they<00:00:54.000> don't<00:00:54.120> have<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.570> 14<00:00:54.989> million

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.029 
I guess they don't have the 14 million
if<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.690> want<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.050> keep<00:00:58.170> somebody<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.829> keep

and but why would she say someone who's
injured<00:01:29.909> too<00:01:30.590> here's<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.740> difference<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
age will sign sheet and then if he looks

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
pretty good I wouldn't be surprised if

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.050
