00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello everybody got tired 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.190
 I hope you're fine I'm going 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.219
 well and today a little trick 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.240
 so a very simple little trick 

00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:11.910
 but I've already been asked several times 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.530
 question and new users 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.770
 often have this problem good after when 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.970
 you know the system better 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.190
 but in the beginning when you are new 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.039
 even if you are a beginner no matter 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.630
 well we often have this little problem that 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.090
 does that when we download a 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.849
 new application 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.859
 this is what we see here what we 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.289
 impossible to open good after me it's 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.420
 knicks a pure for the example so 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:37.829
 impossible to open to knicks 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.219
 because this application comes from a 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.600
 unidentified developer and then we get 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.489
 says good how I'm going to do I can 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.749
 not open the app because it 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.659
 not come from the apple store blah blah blah 

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:51.899
 blah blah actually it's simple 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:53.190
 go into your system preferences you 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.679
 come here on security and 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.699
 confidentiality 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:01:03.049
 here you come here in general and has it 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:06.990
 so wait i'm just going up 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:08.399
 unlock all this so here and there 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.859
 we will have allowed you 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:13.680
 downloaded applications 2 and there in 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:16.049
 by default it's mac apple store and 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.810
 developers identify so he's going 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.560
 have to at any place so there he 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.210
 puts you a message for a message from 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.340
 confirmation you have allowed 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.189
 from anywhere and then you 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.100
 can close system preferences and 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:36.259
 you try again hop you tried again 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.259
 to open your application and the magic 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.740
 here is yours your app down is 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.859
 launch without problem so 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.240
 So here at least I hope 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:49.649
 this video would have been useful if 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.200
 you never have this problem or whatever 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.700
