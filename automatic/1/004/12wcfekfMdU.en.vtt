00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.410
 Menouer 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.920
 it's crazy this case order today 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.810
 to you are there to hi everyone 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.120
 it was delta and today we are 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.560
 found for a new video enough 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.840
 special because it's my first video 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:44.040
 minecraft because we can not say that 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.610
 frankly the projects 20 subscribers and the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.830
 video pub that I had done this are 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.030
 really minecraft videos so the 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.150
 I wanted to make one on my 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.610
 project a real video about my project 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.129
 minecraft is a football stadium 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.750
 you see there are signs of damage 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.820
 with small street lamps 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.670
 customized like that and there I did 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.020
 a kind of carpet with no workbenches 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.180
 too bad so there I did I tried 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.530
 to do some pretty luxurious stairs cd 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.570
 half stone slabs 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.750
 so here I will make you visit everything in 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.120
 the time the stadium is entirely wooden 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.100
 I wanted to have fun doing it entirely 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.330
 in wood like that do not loose why I 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.530
 put the advertised not very well so we'll 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.450
 go back to the stadium there I wanted 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.820
 to make a small booth spectators but 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.130
 how there were two cabins 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.890
 commentators speak but there was no need to 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.210
 this place for for there to make a 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.890
 a staircase I really wanted to do 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.200
 so here is my stage my big stadium that 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.759
 I had put in my video ad 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.229
 I had some pictures, so there he 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.850
 is really well done so it's a 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.409
 all glass roof like that as soon as he 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.789
 it's raining it 's not happening on the ground 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.719
 and there the tribes and I did some 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:03.320
 stairs like this and and platform cdd 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:07.409
 little wooden plates like that 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.940
 so toulon so seats I wanted 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.050
 have fun doing a little trick 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.250
 customized for as if there were 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.240
 someone important who were coming 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.430
 attend the match 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.020
 something like that so the ground 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.570
 this is the famous land that has not taken 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.670
 less time doing there I did some 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.100
 cages with fences in doing I 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.010
 did not pay much else and I 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:33.060
 could not finish I could not close them 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.220
 we do not have the opportunity to make my case 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.160
 there are the small the little cabins 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.380
 usually the players and all that and in 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.690
 place one for visitors and the same 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.620
 for 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.360
 coloring makes such small of 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.980
 small custom floor lamps like 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.860
 there is around the stadium 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.580
 I make barriers to avoid 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.430
 the people I go out I am 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.960
 on the ground as they so have there 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.980
 it's the locker rooms I did the same and 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:08.500
 a photo two and a half and there is 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:14.230
 the locker room so a seat by 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:16.390
 nobody with small sounds with 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.070
 small walls to separate them and 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.690
 tables with I put barriers and 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.290
 pressure plates that's enough 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.200
 stylish I find and the coast and local these 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.790
 visitors it's the same so I put in 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.710
 viewer the same number 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:34.140
 I have subscribers that is 35 to 35 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:36.610
 spectators in the stadium 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.130
 there the small booths commentators 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.330
 we will see them right away by the 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:46.450
 little passage that I had shown everything to 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:47.790
 the hour so we go down the stairs and 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.770
 there it is on the right 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.900
 So here I am not visiting all 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.860
 right away 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.540
 here and there is the little cabin of 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.970
 for tic and admission tickets at 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.530
 stage but the same with plates of 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.510
 pressure and barriers and there a little 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.830
 safe to store the money so I do 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.680
 I wanted to make a little delusion I put 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.410
 ruby diamonds from raw beef for 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.980
 to say it 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.080
 so here we'll get there on track 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.419
 so I will not take it because there is 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.669
 people there I put a little too much 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:27.820
 we have to take them off and I 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:30.550
 do a single one vab and who 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:34.120
 stop bothering me at years back 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.830
 so there is a big waterfall 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.200
 I had fun doing that when 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.520
 I had some water cascades 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.160
 around the stairs to climb into the 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.950
 booth commentators so there you 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.080
 see there are seats the effects in 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.970
 the stairs are like small tables 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.560
 like this so we see spectators there 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.110
 liked these beautiful views of the stadium 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.850
 and on all sides it's the same 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:01.260
 this is also amused to make a 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:04.030
 master of the water and a little trick too 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.490
 there is a small pond I put myself 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:10.090
 to do that too when we arrived 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.970
 at the stairs could not pass so I 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:16.150
 I'm not having fun doing all the 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:19.420
 wagons because it's not that it's 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.070
 long but there are people it's going us 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.200
 it'll slow start nato is 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.430
 all that so 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:30.700
 so I can not so I wanted to put 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:32.260
 walls here because otherwise if I have them 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.350
 did not put here was getting pretty much less 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.760
 pampered the rails but otherwise it's 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.930
 true that if he did not emit there was no 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.800
 not kidney and it was a little style 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:46.750
 and with the seats the seats like that 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:48.490
 it's pretty stylish out 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.290
 So here it's over for me my 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.380
 first minecraft project that took me 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.000
 about five days I think so that's 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.980
 pretty big projects but hey I have not 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.290
 spend all my days on it like 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.120
 you know I have my channel is not 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.100
 dedicated that minecraft otherwise it's true I 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.110
 redo I would have been much faster 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.690
 it would be when are in school period 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:12.040
 we have less to do we have less 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:14.500
 of time to devote to our channels and 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.750
 so that's where I left the little ones 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.920
 void for the feathers and all that so at 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.040
 least not without going to see their chains 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.450
 classics and imax is patriotic of the 45th and 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.910
 others 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.730
 so there I had fun doing a 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.830
 small archery target is what 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:32.380
 I had discovered the flat surface here 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.580
 my football stadium outside and we said ah 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:38.140
 worse everyone for a next 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:39.670
 video a next one next one 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.620
 monument that I do so I 'm going to you 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.070
 propose you put that in the 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.410
 comments 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:47.230
 either you choose between a building 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.010
 a very big building almost the 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.980
 stadium size 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.740
 but between and that will be very high or 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:56.740
 so central park you know the big 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:58.260
 the big park that is inside of 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:02.020
 new york in the middle of new york 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:03.250
 with how that makes pretty much the 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.650
 size of a city oka really a 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.430
 very very big no where I'm going to do 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.220
 push the 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.870
 for myself and opposed to more 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.590
 everyone for a next video 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.590
 did
