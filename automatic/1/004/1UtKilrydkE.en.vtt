00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.269
 with outstanding capacity 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.730
 reproductive health and good 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.520
 production of meat and milk 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.609
 these are some of the characteristics of the 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.550
 cindy livestock originating in Pakistan and 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.400
 It is in Brazil a few decades ago one 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.980
 differentiated creator is how we can 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.580
 talk about dna audio cast of clarissa 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.769
 of new horizon and sÃ£o paulo in 1936 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.640
 uncle, grandfather, joseph, cesario de castilho 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:44.670
 was the forerunner of the sindi race in Brazil 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.860
 the reddish or 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.410
 saturn and finest leather adapted 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.050
 easily to Brazil since it is from the region 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.719
 mountainous region of pakistan is a race 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.600
 formed in a desert in a semi-desert 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.410
 then it has a millenarian resistance and 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.309
 it was a practically natural selection 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.759
 it really is different in the southern period 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.759
 dry it keeps the score very well is 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.630
 protected from fat meat in the 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.099
 waters 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.800
 it accumulates fat until it is accumulated up to 

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:22.140
 chest apple many breeds sign of 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.910
 superiority but in the sindi race 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.119
 I in my point of view and quality 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:30.149
 because in the dry period it takes this 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.080
 energy to help maintain your score 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.369
 corporal 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.009
 the professor at the federal university 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.560
 rural of rio de janeiro jorge carlos 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.380
 days says that cattle rather presents 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.630
 optimal reproductive capacity in addition to 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.849
 use of carcass above the 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.020
 national average since in three debates 

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:49.440
 technical 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.979
 the average yield was 58% while the 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.970
 national average is 52% for most 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.590
 of the races 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.399
 I think this information is very 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.200
 important because it propitiates the man 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.810
 of the field the cowboy who needs 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.970
 of a bull that accelerates its potential 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.190
 production level of meat 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.069
 I have no doubt that it is a material 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.680
 genetics at the level of 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.240
 milk production and meat production 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.490
 the farm works with the development 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.200
 of the Sindhi breed 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.590
 to have an idea just take a look 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.920
 in the bulls 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.470
 only the Indian has sold more than 25 thousand 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.420
 doses of semen to Brazil and also 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.980
 to the outside 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.959
 so the teacher makes a point of 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.050
 highlight the details of the older bull 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.019
 of the farm the uirapuru da estiva first 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.060
 great champion in uberaba in 2006 who 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.510
 marked the return of the Sindhi race to the 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.299
 exposure, people will notice 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.450
 clearly the superiority of the whole 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:52.030
 structure of that animal's body. 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.700
 the Sindhi race is also characterized by 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.610
 milk production without much demand in the 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.829
 natural production ranges from 8 to 12 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.500
 pounds per day but with the improvement 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:05.110
 genetics can produce more 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.129
 As the cattle rancher explains, Brazil has 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:12.220
 16 million dairy cows is in two 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:15.450
 national milking 5.3 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.190
 if I found him privately 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.220
 select a cattle that in the first one 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.370
 me from four to five kilos in a 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.709
 only time this animal is very good 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:31.959
 producer of milk if I put him in the 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:33.250
 handling of milk with ration it goes to 15 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.880
 20 pounds 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:40.540
 This I have even shown some doubts 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:43.690
 that I sent for dairy management is 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:47.230
 they are even in uberaba in a control of 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.480
 abcz where there is a heifer standing 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.660
 highlighting it calls the seed of the stow 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.669
 in two milking is 18 kilos 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.340
 those who work with livestock management as 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:04:00.280
 Rodolfo william assure that the animal is 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.980
 docile and obedient to cattle rather than 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.620
 impressive docility we do not 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.930
 Has no problem with the owner's part . 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.590
 of creation and in the general part of 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.000
 from the field to the handling is 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:18.280
 We'll move over from 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.510
 small and brushing in the neighborhood and never 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.000
 did not work 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.130
 against these qualities the veterinarian 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.380
 raquel rodrigues hopes to study more 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.539
 on the establishment of the breed in the country and 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.580
 reproductive capacity of cindy cattle 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.620
 also with other races 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.680
 we want to expand ours ours 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.919
 goal is to try 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.080
 is to collect a lot of data 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.850
 for playback even if you have the other 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.979
 the sebum in which it does not yet have in the race 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.320
 Syndicate, we can improve 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.940
 plus the production both meat production 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.430
 the production of clothes for those who do not 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.500
 know a piece of advice worth knowing 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.900
 more about the cindy cattle that left the 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.669
 pakistan for who knows in the future fell 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.940
 I do not like Brazilian cattle ranchers. 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:04.350
 it is worth creating so it is undoubtedly 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:08.570
 besides the person of income she will have a 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.570
 animal that will give you much satisfaction
