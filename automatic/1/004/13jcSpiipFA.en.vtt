memory stick I think that's a big one I

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.699 
memory stick I think that's a big one I
don't<00:02:29.120> use<00:02:29.269> that<00:02:29.299> one<00:02:29.569> but<00:02:29.750> yeah<00:02:30.260> it<00:02:30.349> supports

flash drive you know display all or is
it<00:04:40.270> there<00:04:41.270> we<00:04:41.360> go

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
it there we go

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.730 
it there we go

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
and that's the multi card reader so it

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.110 
and that's the multi card reader so it
does<00:04:45.919> support<00:04:46.310> both<00:04:46.460> things<00:04:46.759> which<00:04:46.940> is<00:04:47.090> really

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
slots so once again you're actually

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.600 
slots so once again you're actually

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
adding an extra slot than the first ps3

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:59.890 
adding an extra slot than the first ps3
models<00:04:58.910> you<00:04:59.030> will<00:04:59.150> actually<00:04:59.570> end<00:04:59.750> up<00:04:59.840> having

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
models you will actually end up having

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.249 
models you will actually end up having
five<00:05:00.789> because<00:05:01.789> the<00:05:02.240> multi<00:05:02.539> port<00:05:02.750> adapter<00:05:02.960> will

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:03.259 
five because the multi port adapter will

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:05.740 
five because the multi port adapter will
take<00:05:03.470> up<00:05:03.650> one<00:05:03.889> you'll<00:05:04.669> have<00:05:04.850> one<00:05:05.150> free<00:05:05.389> one<00:05:05.539> and
