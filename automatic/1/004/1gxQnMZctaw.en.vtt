squatting<00:02:05.270> I'm<00:02:05.719> actually<00:02:06.079> supposed<00:02:06.320> to<00:02:06.590> be

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
squatting I'm actually supposed to be

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.120 
squatting I'm actually supposed to be
doing<00:02:06.710> for<00:02:07.219> second<00:02:07.909> negatives<00:02:08.420> but<00:02:09.019> um<00:02:09.530> since

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
doing for second negatives but um since

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.849 
doing for second negatives but um since
x<00:02:10.459> speeds<00:02:10.970> up<00:02:11.209> when<00:02:11.239> you're<00:02:11.750> doing<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:12.290> slow

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:12.859 
x speeds up when you're doing a slow

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:15.550 
x speeds up when you're doing a slow
with<00:02:13.070> negatives<00:02:13.609> um<00:02:13.880> it's<00:02:14.750> actually<00:02:14.930> ended<00:02:15.500> up

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
with negatives um it's actually ended up

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.530 
with negatives um it's actually ended up
only<00:02:15.739> be<00:02:15.859> about<00:02:16.130> you<00:02:16.400> in<00:02:16.609> this<00:02:16.760> set<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.150> think<00:02:17.450> I

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
only be about you in this set I think I

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.660 
only be about you in this set I think I
increased<00:02:17.989> it<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.290> 3<00:02:18.560> in<00:02:18.650> later<00:02:18.859> sets<00:02:19.160> but<00:02:19.370> it

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
increased it to 3 in later sets but it

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.440 
increased it to 3 in later sets but it
is<00:02:20.049> really<00:02:21.049> hard<00:02:21.380> to<00:02:21.620> go<00:02:22.040> too<00:02:22.100> slow<00:02:22.519> as<00:02:22.820> you

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
is really hard to go too slow as you

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.259 
is really hard to go too slow as you
could<00:02:23.660> see<00:02:23.959> in<00:02:24.109> the<00:02:24.260> last<00:02:24.440> in<00:02:24.859> this<00:02:25.579> squat<00:02:25.940> here

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
could see in the last in this squat here

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.870 
could see in the last in this squat here
I<00:02:26.480> have<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.230> little<00:02:27.500> less<00:02:27.829> flexibility<00:02:28.579> on<00:02:28.760> my

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
I have a little less flexibility on my

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.420 
I have a little less flexibility on my
left<00:02:29.120> side<00:02:29.209> which<00:02:29.510> is<00:02:29.630> why<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:30.010> squat<00:02:31.010> deeper

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
left side which is why I squat deeper

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.039 
left side which is why I squat deeper
kind<00:02:31.670> of<00:02:31.790> on<00:02:31.880> my<00:02:32.000> right<00:02:32.239> and<00:02:32.480> there's<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.900> little

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049
