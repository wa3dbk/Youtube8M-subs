00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.510
 we will go to the meteorite laboratory in 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.430
 fossil laboratory where there are 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.050

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.950
 so I'll show you the others too 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.690
 then we continue as follows 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.030
 immediately to look a little like for the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.920
 battle 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.960
 this can I have besides besides being 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.629
 legendary event you find bad luck 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.480
 even the house is legendary shiny 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.940
 stylistic to have all the ways that is 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.250
 ps attack special attack defended for 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.290
 special speed at 31 then al 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:10.650
 maximum 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:14.659
 now let's go with psychic here is you with 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.659
 the animation of the struggle of deo csis 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.119
 in this way we have defeated 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.900
 the opponent not very difficult to 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.990
 to defeat 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:32.100
 Now we go straight to the lab 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:37.200
 fossils found as they say here 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:40.619
 to petrov to pietro the headlights and we go to 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.100
 change the form of the csis 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.810
 there will be more meteorites in the laboratory 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.979
 compared to the forms of hawks iss e 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.090
 enter them yourself more 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:54.659
 I will still take it in its normal form 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.909
 and therefore there is not as it was said 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.860
 according to different rumors a new form 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.960
 of the oc sis 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.850
 as you can see, in fact, there are 5 meteorites 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.950
 while the forms of deo csis an attack 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:10.080
 speed defense is normal the first one does it 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.900
 it does so to bring the normal form then 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.099
 does nothing 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.920
 the second as the writing also says 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:25.239
 deoxys assumed the attack form in 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:28.450
 this way we want to go see it info 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:33.560
 and here you deoxys in its form 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:35.390
 married in its attack form here it is 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:41.590
 here 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.590
 as you can see pokÃ©mon fantastic 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:47.260
 we pass the other two forms or the 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.260
 oven defense form of the city 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.420
 then let's betray myself in this 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:58.220
 of the sixteenth is reaching the meteorite 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:01.010
 you want him to come closer see the oc si si 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.379
 assumed the defensive form 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:09.109
 let's go immediately to show it to you and here you are 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:14.299
 deoxys in defended form as you can 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:16.400
 see how you can clearly see the 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.530
 particularity of the shine shape idea of 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.750
 the office consists of several 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.530
 pokemon coloring and committees that in 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:28.010
 this case instead of having the color 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.049
 orange one last yellow color 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.790
 shape of the history of progression and lives 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.040
 you want me to come closer see the oc series 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.010
 assumed the speed form we go 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:41.049
 immediately to see 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.049
 and here also the hawks at speed 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:48.199
 the movements it makes in the info are 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:51.319
 always those depending also on the 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:52.970
 ok shapes 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.729
 here is also this form and now vi 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.879
 I show that with the last one last 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:04:00.919
 meteorite always remains in the form 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.560
 normal does not change there is no new one 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:06.889
 shape you do talking since you do 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.650
 approach see the oc silos in transform 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.430
 normal if we go to the first one that doesn't 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.409
 I showed 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:19.669
 and we talk about it and says deoxys assumed the 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:21.979
 form attack because then when we 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.080
 we go with the normal form if we for 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.620
 example the walk an attack form 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.100
 ok 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.260
 so if we talk about it again it will give us back 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.970
 another form therefore does not depend so much 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.620
 from the meteorite it is only the first 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.330
 meteorites alone the first form is 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.139
 second only our second and so 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.460
 Street 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.800
 as you see, however, continuing to talk 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.389
 with the same we will pass to all the 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.660
 forms until you get back to normal 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.940
 so there won't be one more per 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.680
 this video and everything else come down 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.630
