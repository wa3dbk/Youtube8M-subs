00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.960
 little to get out of the hospital back of the 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:16.410
 frankly it's this man I 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.199
 rev thank you included coppens where all the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.390
 motorcycle world 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.609
 we see everyone I move I 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.109
 I'm having fun, it's a little bit 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.410
 it's a shame not to roll but I knew 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.439
 that I know it's like that I do not like 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.530
 not to play too much but I'm not sure 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.320
 too much this ball beats not programmed in 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.280
 their life will come back its reading we're going 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.390
 to say that point Thursday when you roll 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.950
 not if you want to do it after eight 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:47.059
 every night yeah good either but 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.590
 I can go to bed late I do not know 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.090
 a lot good we only see a big 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.199
 smile we can imagine that after 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.370
 Italy did not have the big smile 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.940
 it must have spent a few moments 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.250
 little difficult 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.770
 well yeah that was hard it was planned 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.000
 with us anyway it would have been hard 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.510
 anyway but then I cut myself 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.019
 two legs 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.880
 I stayed a month and a half at all 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.830
 only locked up the way at my parents 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.020
 to see nobody did anything so 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.600
 that's for sure that all of this should move 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.070
 from next week as 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.080
 that reduc center in the southwest to 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.250
 cape so I'm going to attack a 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.250
 little to work properly and 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.790
 work the program what is the 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.170
 rehabilitation is a long shot in 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.220
 it's more than 4 weeks 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.369
 four weeks of work four 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.600
 Fashion weeks not your 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.640
 the goal is to really redo 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.070
 physical to jog the bike of 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.100
 the condition also that now it is 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.299
 also wamu the game quite special 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.100
 be careful to boss 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.170
 it's a bit weird like having 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.310
 particular ligaments of the knee he has 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.140
 triumphed Sunday we will see softbank 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.240
 is compromised and that are the legs 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.140
 will not be hired to do everything that 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.390
 it's still way too early to talk 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:08.269
 motorcycle that is sure is it's not 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.500
 before end of February not sure after I 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.269
 do not know we'll see you're going to 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.410
 nantes a little bit of all this a year ago 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.790
 there are some who resume at six months and 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.150
 there they learn at four months so 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.319
 so we'll see more in February that the 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.440
 big countries that starts in march it's going 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.810
 to be hard balladur 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.810
 I did everything for a long time I 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.190
 really physically bumped that compensates 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.920
 a little lack of running hopes 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.030
 but OK 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.650
 on one side the season will be long it takes 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.860
 not necessarily be ready from the beginning 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.860
 March 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:50.569
 stan and sent it when they 14 I like 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:52.040
 a lot china is so good then 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.810
 2013 we hear a lot of dylan in 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.859
 were beautiful this year the gp 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.569
 next year is waiting for it to be like 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:57.079
 that all the gp over podiums he saw 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.879
 one in sweden 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:02.060
 magic moment you have to think about it in your 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:05.569
 head the pros when I saw three the 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.139
 motivation I think pretty magical the 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.959
 torture and murder as it really is 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:12.980
 imaginable and rosa world of football 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.849
 good age limit it does not like at all 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.049
 the world but for someone like you 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.530
 it's good it releases a little bit of 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:25.590
 not even interested place I fall back 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:27.810
 also low raises the question of time 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.920
 it's only 60 to 100 m2 for a lot 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.209
 of years mount part on the kawa 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.099
 do you know that you know people well 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.360
 that you know well, you're not going 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.550
 arrive physically ready for happiness 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.050
 but you know where you put your feet yeah 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.800
 yeah sure you have the team 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.800
 japanese people 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.459
 to be on top together and 4 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.770

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:59.100
 to be able to have to attack minister 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.990
