 hello everyone welcome once again to 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.009
 my color demo channel i am unique and 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.170
 Because the truth is that I come very 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.820
 happy but happier I come every 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.320
 Once I have the chance to share 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.570
 with you once the 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.370
 draw so I'm thinking which one is going to 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.260
 be the next I can bring to you 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.630
 something that you really like something that 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.640
 something useful to me is useful to me 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.960
 really give to you and then 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.340
 I always try that what I'm going to 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.680
 sharing with you is something that 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.349
 I use and something that I also like to 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.269
 me of course and this time I'm going to 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.800
 make this draw for being the draw for 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.960
 four weeks have the time is 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.520
 enough for you to participate 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.070
 to start the draw up to four 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.450
 weeks that's what I'm going to try 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.550
 combine on this occasion yes I'm going to 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.230
 give the opportunity that many more can 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.760
 participate I love to bring you as 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.200
 Makeup draw because of course 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.210
 because I know that makeup like to 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.559
 everyone but I was thinking that I wanted 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.360
 do something different this time 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.280
 for you and then makeup 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.399
 many raffles always also in 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.309
 youtube about makeup then I was 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.140
 thinking that I wanted to bring you something 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.329
 it was a little bit different 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.680
 and I want you to put on makeup and 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.690
 see beautiful but also at the same 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.820
 have a tool for 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.990
 fix your hair and then in this case 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.550
 I bought this iron to make 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.770
 I bought the wavy hair 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.440
 for me and I really liked what I 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.380
 like this iron is that it is for 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.520
 wet hair and for dry hair and that's 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.570
 one of the things that I like a lot 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.640
 because sometimes if you do not give us time 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.190
 ironing the hair or drying the hair 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.680
 to then iron it and shape it 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.990
 Well, I like to use the tools 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.030
 that at the same time they serve you with the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.610
 wet hair or with wet hair or with 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.200
 dry hair and well this one also brings a 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.180
 bonus that is this little one that is here 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.530
 I really like what I really am 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.850
 using and how they have their teeth 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.500
 so big 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.840
 Well, that helps you make any type 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.990
 of hair that you have, you will feel 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.800
 very comfortable using it and it is 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.960
 made from a thermal technology part of 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.210
 the porcelain helps you so much that 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.789
 hair does not suffer so much heat so 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.390
 penetrating that can burn you a lot 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.990
 hair 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.350
 this iron heats up to 356 degrees 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.060
 fahrenheit or 180 degrees celsius that is 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.310
 the most there is in power at the time 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.569
 to warm up because if you 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.100
 like the iron is very hot 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.720
 how I like it to be good 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.800
 hot and instead of plans and plates 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.170
 so that it is ironed only once and 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.660
 So that helps you a lot. 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.910
 you finish your hairstyle very fast is this 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.350
 iron is of the brand with air is a 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.360
 brand that I have been using makes 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.040
 a lot of time and the truth is that I 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.800
 I really like that many girls 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.690
 know why is it a company 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.270

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.760
 in the market among the more I know how to read to 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.430
 different markets many have to know 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.190
 that many as much as in Europe as in 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.080
 usa mexico canada knows a lot about 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.130
