00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
is I think crucial to the success of the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.620 
is I think crucial to the success of the
festival<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.370> fact<00:02:41.550> they<00:02:41.700> asked<00:02:42.060> us<00:02:42.270> to<00:02:42.300> be

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
festival so the fact they asked us to be

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.270 
festival so the fact they asked us to be
here<00:02:42.840> is<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.260> think<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.530> really<00:02:43.680> big<00:02:43.890> deal

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
here is I think a really big deal

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.949 
here is I think a really big deal
we've<00:02:44.640> done<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.790> lot<00:02:44.940> of<00:02:45.090> shows<00:02:45.270> in<00:02:45.300> Colorado<00:02:45.870> I

we've done a lot of shows in Colorado I

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.120 
we've done a lot of shows in Colorado I
think<00:02:46.110> we<00:02:46.170> have<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.290> pretty<00:02:46.440> good<00:02:46.590> following<00:02:47.040> in

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
think we have a pretty good following in

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.640 
think we have a pretty good following in
