00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.360
 enter an extreme state of panic 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.850
 crossing the portal so much so that at 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.340
 see all this atmosphere I dropped my 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.300
 sword listened to voices the heat was 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.180
 perhaps infernal hell was in the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.910
 place was dark and reddish much of the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.490
 place was on fire there were mountains and 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.700
 lava mountains in fact you had to go 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.180
 very carefully suddenly the voice of 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.490
 hero brain in my head listen steve te 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.979
 I did come here because it's totally 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.410
 necessary so you can come back before 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.690
 that nothing will tell you something about 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.750
 creatures that live here first thing 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:31.380
 avoid at all costs there are three types of 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.330
 creatures here one of them neutral not 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.330
 they will do nothing to you if you do not do anything to them 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.520
 his name is big man they are pigs but they 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.000
 they look like a human like you or me 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.720
 to carry a golden sword I that you 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.119
 avoid the second creatures 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.030
 they call blake are the reason why 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.710
 you are here are dangerous but not 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.110
 if you have your sword 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.020
 mature and your courage I know that the 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.900
 you have listen are creatures that are 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.240
 in flames they throw fire is a head 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.630
 floating with three objects that rotate to its 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.330
 around are somewhat dangerous but not 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.940
 as the third creature they are called cast 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.790
 they are giants and they are in the skies of 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.130
 these worlds if any of them sees you 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.380
 will try to kill by throwing a ball of 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.470
 big fire from your mouth you decide if 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.569
 dodge it counterattack the ball then you 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.090
 I will explain why you should kill blaze 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.550
 they leave an artifact that I call 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.489
 rod de blaze well steve finds 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.170
 several of those creatures kill the and 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.660
 take away your bullets in flames 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.030
 good luck those were the 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.580
 indications that froó brahím means no 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.620
 I hesitate to listen to him take my sword 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.739
 diamond that he had dropped by the 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.410
 panic and as hero brain said to those 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.569
 strange pigs trust what he 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.630
 and he said passing near them 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.310
 waiting for results none attacked me 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.950
 perfect 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.890
 I followed my path in search of those laws 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.010
 but nothing took two hours there the place 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.560
 it was totally repeated tired of 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.300
 search and search I heard some moans that 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.300
 They made my hair stand on end 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.640
 all 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.050
 when I heard those moans I hid 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.760
 in a column 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.400
 I was hidden for about ten seconds 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.560
 when I decided to go out and see what 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.650
 creature was making those sounds 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.140
 maybe it was a place the creature that I 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.100
 I was looking for I took my diamond sword and 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.890
 I came out no, it was not a shit, it was a 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:44.580
 Spending turned around looked at me I begged 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.310
 God that nothing did to me but did not launch 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.860
 a huge fireball I threw myself towards 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.930
 one side to dodge it I started running 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.360
 while running I kept my sword of 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.030
 diamond to shoot with arrows 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.010
 I started running for that creature me 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.380
 lose sight after at least 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.930
 five minutes of running and running without 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.630
 to stop that thing from losing me 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.910
 seen so I decided to appear by 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.880
 back I carry an arrow in my bow 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.430
 point cardio an impulse and finally 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.609
 I released the arrow the arrow hit against 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:20.940
 that thing but I think the best idea was 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.160
 run away since I think the damage I did to him 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.150
 it was very tiny and then it happened 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.270
 back and I 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.759
 another ball of fire this time I wanted to make 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.430
 something different I released Wednesday that my 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:35.039
 diamond sword wait for the ball 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.590
 is about to impact I was so 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.960
 when he was about to hit me 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.139
 I hit the ball with my sword 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.169
 as expected the projectile went from 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:48.660
 where he had come like this against attacking 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:52.470
 that creature as expected the ball of 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.419
 fire struck with the gas this one died of 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.780
 same way I preferred not to fight with 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:59.690
 no more of them I followed my path in 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.610
 look for the plays when the landscape 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.729
 it started to change a bit I could see 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.130
 some buildings was something like a 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:11.460
 fortress I do not know which word would you put 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.830
 to describe that place in the end the place 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.220
 had changed and I could see a few 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.949
 structures I was walking for a while 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.470
 those structures until something crashed 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:24.870
 with my back were three little balls 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.720
 of fire I said in my mind fucked 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.120
 fuck again a cast but not this time 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.940
 when 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.699
 what attacked me was' a place was a 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.010
 Floating head wrapped in flames with 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:40.830
 three rods surrounding the east as well 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:43.139
 that spending could rise 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.180
 I took my sword and before it was 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.900
 in the air I gave him three blows of my 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.910
 diamond sword and so I could kill him 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.419
 I do not want to describe much what happened 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.060
 after 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:56.460
 so I briefly managed another five 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.800
 plays appeared I killed them but I 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.020
 they left in a very bad state towards 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.389
 I decided to go home what the way 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.460
 back it was hell in fact I 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:08.400
 he was lost and had found a 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:11.340
 how many times did they attack me and I fought with 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.949
 several of them my diamond armor 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.530
 had been shattered like my 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:19.169
 body finally found the portal 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.180
 to leave I already had what I had 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:24.449
 burning bullets that I had won in my 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:27.590
 I fought the links when I found 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:30.110
 the portal appeared 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:33.050
 I went to rest and rest was 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.940
 very hurt while improving and repairing 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.410
 and equipment expected new 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.410
