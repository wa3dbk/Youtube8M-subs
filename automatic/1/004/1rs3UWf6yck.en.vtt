going<00:02:48.920> to<00:02:49.010> work<00:02:49.130> for<00:02:49.160> me<00:02:51.220> but<00:02:52.220> let's<00:02:52.430> give<00:02:52.580> it<00:02:52.640> a

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
going to work for me but let's give it a

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:06.580 
going to work for me but let's give it a
try

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.839 

clothes<00:03:07.590> are<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:07.920> little<00:03:08.190> bit<00:03:08.370> thin<00:03:08.580> not<00:03:08.790> too

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
clothes are a little bit thin not too

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:18.199 
clothes are a little bit thin not too
bad

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.690 

the<00:03:19.209> taste<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:19.810> this<00:03:20.170> stuff<00:03:20.440> to<00:03:20.920> me<00:03:21.129> is<00:03:21.310> very

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
the taste and this stuff to me is very

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.369 
the taste and this stuff to me is very
very<00:03:22.239> very<00:03:22.720> subtle<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:25.180> taste<00:03:25.390> is<00:03:25.629> there<00:03:26.080> and

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
very very subtle the taste is there and

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.229 
very very subtle the taste is there and
again<00:03:26.650> if<00:03:26.860> the<00:03:27.010> taste<00:03:27.430> is<00:03:27.640> similar<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.120> the

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
again if the taste is similar to the

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.259 
again if the taste is similar to the
smell<00:03:28.540> it's<00:03:28.780> like<00:03:29.019> a<00:03:29.940> ripe<00:03:30.940> cantaloupe<00:03:32.099> sweet

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
smell it's like a ripe cantaloupe sweet

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.380 
smell it's like a ripe cantaloupe sweet
and<00:03:34.709> what<00:03:35.709> I<00:03:35.739> find<00:03:35.950> a<00:03:36.099> little<00:03:36.220> odd<00:03:36.580> about<00:03:36.970> it<00:03:37.030> is

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
and what I find a little odd about it is

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.160 
and what I find a little odd about it is
the<00:03:37.989> taste<00:03:38.319> I<00:03:38.970> don't<00:03:39.970> really<00:03:40.150> taste<00:03:40.510> it<00:03:40.780> on<00:03:41.019> the

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
the taste I don't really taste it on the

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.440 
the taste I don't really taste it on the
inhale<00:03:41.530> or<00:03:41.830> the<00:03:42.010> exhale<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:42.819> tastes<00:03:43.030> it<00:03:43.239> more

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
inhale or the exhale it tastes it more

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.910 
inhale or the exhale it tastes it more
about<00:03:43.769> as<00:03:44.769> an<00:03:45.040> after<00:03:45.489> taste<00:03:46.650> it's<00:03:47.650> kind<00:03:47.799> of

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
about as an after taste it's kind of

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.979 
about as an after taste it's kind of
sitting<00:03:48.190> on<00:03:48.340> your<00:03:48.489> tongue<00:03:48.730> after<00:03:49.000> after<00:03:49.630> you

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
sitting on your tongue after after you

00:03:49.989 --> 00:04:04.800 
sitting on your tongue after after you
exhale

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:16.259 

very<00:04:05.560> smooth<00:04:06.750> yourself

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.390 

I<00:04:16.359> like<00:04:18.000> it<00:04:19.000> is<00:04:19.150> very<00:04:19.419> subtle<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:20.049> I<00:04:20.530> have<00:04:20.949> a

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
I like it is very subtle and I have a

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.909 
I like it is very subtle and I have a
feeling<00:04:21.849> that<00:04:21.879> this<00:04:22.360> particular<00:04:22.840> patch<00:04:23.410> might

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
feeling that this particular patch might

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.460 
feeling that this particular patch might
be<00:04:24.129> a<00:04:24.160> little<00:04:24.610> drier<00:04:25.090> than<00:04:25.750> it<00:04:26.020> really<00:04:26.319> should

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
be a little drier than it really should

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.950 
be a little drier than it really should
be<00:04:26.740> I<00:04:26.949> know<00:04:27.190> that<00:04:27.520> other<00:04:27.909> nachlas<00:04:28.569> have<00:04:28.720> had

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
be I know that other nachlas have had

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.059 
be I know that other nachlas have had
are<00:04:30.300> similar<00:04:31.300> to<00:04:31.509> this<00:04:31.659> like<00:04:32.590> I<00:04:32.680> have<00:04:32.860> been

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
comparatively speaking and I just have a

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.510 
comparatively speaking and I just have a
funny<00:04:53.289> feeling<00:04:53.380> that<00:04:53.740> this<00:04:54.069> stuff<00:04:54.310> is<00:04:54.460> a

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
funny feeling that this stuff is a

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.270 
funny feeling that this stuff is a
little<00:04:54.819> bit<00:04:55.030> dried<00:04:55.330> out<00:04:55.590> that<00:04:56.590> it<00:04:56.860> should

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
little bit dried out that it should

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.140 
little bit dried out that it should
maybe<00:04:57.490> be<00:04:57.729> a<00:04:57.759> little<00:04:57.849> bit<00:04:58.210> moister<00:04:59.340> I<00:05:00.340> would

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150
