explain to you today how to construct a

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.690 
explain to you today how to construct a
song<00:00:12.599> there<00:00:13.379> are<00:00:13.530> some<00:00:13.740> basic<00:00:14.099> formulas<00:00:14.669> that

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
song there are some basic formulas that

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.089 
song there are some basic formulas that
much<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.509> music<00:00:15.599> today<00:00:15.959> follows<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.679> if<00:00:16.980> you

much of music today follows and if you

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:18.650 
much of music today follows and if you
follow<00:00:17.310> those<00:00:17.550> you're<00:00:17.820> going<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.179> be<00:00:18.269> able<00:00:18.480> to

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
pop music today is constructed on four

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.810 
pop music today is constructed on four
chords<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.330> one<00:00:24.810> chord<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.320> 4<00:00:25.679> chord<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.130> 5<00:00:26.429> chord

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
chords a one chord a 4 chord a 5 chord

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.900 
chords a one chord a 4 chord a 5 chord
and<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.419> 6<00:00:27.689> chord<00:00:27.990> these<00:00:28.769> numbers<00:00:29.279> are<00:00:29.490> based<00:00:29.519> on

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
and a 6 chord these numbers are based on

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.150 
and a 6 chord these numbers are based on
any<00:00:30.179> scale<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.869> might<00:00:31.080> be<00:00:31.289> working<00:00:31.560> with<00:00:31.740> and

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
any scale you might be working with and

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.459 
any scale you might be working with and
then<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.879> combinations<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.719> these<00:00:34.020> chords

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
then the combinations of these chords

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.920 
then the combinations of these chords
are<00:00:34.590> often<00:00:34.920> constructed<00:00:35.160> into<00:00:35.760> pop<00:00:36.300> songs<00:00:36.629> and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
are often constructed into pop songs and

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.170 
are often constructed into pop songs and
these<00:00:37.410> formulas<00:00:37.950> can<00:00:38.100> be<00:00:38.129> recycled<00:00:38.489> over<00:00:39.030> and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
these formulas can be recycled over and

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.090 
these formulas can be recycled over and
over<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.629> over<00:00:39.780> with<00:00:40.110> very<00:00:40.410> minor<00:00:40.890> changes

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
over and over with very minor changes

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.970 
over and over with very minor changes
which<00:00:42.059> give<00:00:42.270> us<00:00:42.300> many<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.140> pop<00:00:43.320> songs<00:00:43.649> that

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
which give us many of the pop songs that

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.270 
which give us many of the pop songs that
most<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.670> us<00:00:44.760> enjoy<00:00:45.149> today<00:00:45.510> these<00:00:46.410> chords<00:00:46.980> you

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
most of us enjoy today these chords you

most of us enjoy today these chords you
can<00:00:47.309> see<00:00:48.059> here<00:00:48.480> based<00:00:49.109> on<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.350> C<00:00:49.620> major<00:00:49.770> scale

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
can see here based on a C major scale

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.470 
can see here based on a C major scale
our<00:00:50.579> one<00:00:50.940> chord<00:00:51.180> would<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:51.989> C<00:00:52.469> major<00:00:53.149> our<00:00:54.149> four

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
our one chord would be C major our four

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.000 
our one chord would be C major our four
chord<00:00:54.809> would<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:55.710> F<00:00:56.160> major<00:00:57.289> our<00:00:58.289> five<00:00:58.620> chord

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
chord would be F major our five chord

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.910 
chord would be F major our five chord
would<00:00:59.399> be<00:00:59.519> G<00:00:59.730> major<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.379> our<00:01:01.379> sixth<00:01:01.679> chord

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
would be G major and our sixth chord

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.210 
would be G major and our sixth chord
would<00:01:02.579> be<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.760> minor<00:01:03.260> I'm<00:01:04.260> going<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.710> show<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.040> a

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
would be a minor I'm going to show you a

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.980 
would be a minor I'm going to show you a
couple<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.939> ways<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.509> can<00:01:06.780> combine

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
couple of ways that you can combine

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.039 
couple of ways that you can combine
these<00:01:07.439> chords<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.009> come<00:01:08.310> up<00:01:08.520> with<00:01:08.970> different

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
these chords and come up with different

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.510 
these chords and come up with different
progressions<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:10.380> form<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.770> basis<00:01:11.280> for

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
progressions that can form the basis for

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.499 
progressions that can form the basis for
your<00:01:12.270> song<00:01:13.130> for<00:01:14.130> our<00:01:14.159> purposes<00:01:14.759> I'm<00:01:15.000> going<00:01:15.060> to

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
your song for our purposes I'm going to

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.240 
your song for our purposes I'm going to
play<00:01:15.689> each<00:01:15.930> chord<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.500> four<00:01:16.680> counts<00:01:16.890> I'm

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
play each chord for four counts I'm

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.300 
play each chord for four counts I'm
going<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.880> begin<00:01:18.150> with<00:01:18.329> a<00:01:18.360> combination<00:01:19.079> of<00:01:19.110> 1<00:01:19.680> 5

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
going to begin with a combination of 1 5

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:36.990 
going to begin with a combination of 1 5
6<00:01:21.000> 4<00:01:21.540> here's<00:01:22.290> how<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.560> sounds

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.780 

now<00:01:38.000> if<00:01:38.150> I<00:01:38.380> change<00:01:39.380> that<00:01:39.530> combination<00:01:40.130> and

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
now if I change that combination and

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.760 
now if I change that combination and
play<00:01:41.480> instead<00:01:41.870> six<00:01:42.770> five<00:01:43.520> one<00:01:44.360> four<00:01:45.020> this<00:01:45.620> is

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
play instead six five one four this is

00:01:45.770 --> 00:02:03.010 
play instead six five one four this is
what<00:01:45.920> it<00:01:46.010> would<00:01:46.100> sound<00:01:46.250> like

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.670 

obviously<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.140> can<00:02:04.290> hear<00:02:04.440> a<00:02:04.470> difference

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
obviously you can hear a difference

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.340 
obviously you can hear a difference
between<00:02:05.040> these<00:02:05.340> two<00:02:05.580> combinations<00:02:06.350> musicians

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
between these two combinations musicians

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.590 
between these two combinations musicians
will<00:02:07.470> often<00:02:07.830> use<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:08.430> number<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.479> these

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
will often use a number of these

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.810 
will often use a number of these
combinations<00:02:10.320> and<00:02:10.530> construct<00:02:11.009> their<00:02:11.280> song<00:02:11.550> in

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
combinations and construct their song in

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.930 
combinations and construct their song in
this<00:02:12.360> way<00:02:12.660> this<00:02:13.380> provides<00:02:13.770> an<00:02:13.950> easy<00:02:14.190> basis<00:02:14.760> and

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
this way this provides an easy basis and

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.970 
this way this provides an easy basis and
you<00:02:15.000> don't<00:02:15.180> have<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.510> have<00:02:15.600> a<00:02:15.630> ton<00:02:15.900> of

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
you don't have to have a ton of

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.380 
you don't have to have a ton of
understanding<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.070> musical<00:02:17.460> theory<00:02:17.820> in<00:02:18.000> order

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
understanding of musical theory in order

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.150 
understanding of musical theory in order
to<00:02:18.630> begin<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:19.020> construct<00:02:19.290> your<00:02:19.590> song<00:02:19.800> from

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
to begin to construct your song from

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.900 
to begin to construct your song from
this<00:02:20.370> format<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.500> if<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:22.650> bear<00:02:22.920> in<00:02:23.130> mind<00:02:23.370> these

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
this format so if you bear in mind these

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.000 
this format so if you bear in mind these
simple<00:02:24.330> rules<00:02:24.570> that<00:02:24.780> many<00:02:24.960> pop<00:02:25.260> songs<00:02:25.620> will
