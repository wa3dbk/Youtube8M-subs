00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.660
 hello dear friends with you as 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.190
 I am always Artyom and in this video we will unpack 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.940
 Here is a fan from the company 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.670
 aerocool 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.600
 shark series 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.890
 14 centimeters orange lights here 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.560
 I have such a box 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.060
 unpacking is about the same 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.230
 here's a fan like that 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.980
 respectively 120 millimeters 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:34.210
 You can see green but now 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.210
 let's unpack this one 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:50.149
 the fan itself 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.530
 further what is still steel 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.949
 grade as always with us on top 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.699
 it was necessary to open the top of course but I 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.699
 opened the bottom 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.280
 Now we have such equipment 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.270
 show closer to us Alex 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.190
 that's the way the whole thing looks like 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.570
 farther 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:39.210
 standard for a series of screw set and 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.390
 anti-vibration screws and buck 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.600
 cable that reduces speed 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.659
 the fan lowers the voltage to 7 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.640
 volt 12 volt fan itself 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.509
 looks like this then we 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.509
 let's see how it glows 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.200
 140 millimeters and here's a cable 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:06.060
 the cable is long enough now I 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:08.310
 I will now show it in this way 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.560
 as for its characteristics then 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.750
 back of the box we can now 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.850
 see them fan works 2 modes 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:20.730
 as i said in low mode 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:22.109
 power supply and power mode 12 volts to 6 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.410
 volt he actually lowers 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:26.880
 voltage they are up to 7 as i said so in 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.980
 general normally works 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:36.299
 fan consume 4.32 wow power 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:39.560
 current 036 amps 360 milliamperes turnovers 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:43.200
 one and a half thousand plus minus 10 percent 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:47.690
 air flow 96 5 air pressure 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:52.500
 air pressure 1.69 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:56.100
 sound 29.6 more precisely noise mode 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:02.070
 low consumption respectively 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:05.370
 18 watts a current consumption of 150 milliamps 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:08.850
 800 rpm and airflow 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:13.079
 50 pressure at the same time drops to 0 integers 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:15.150
 305 thousandths of sound noise 14 with 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.530
 half decibel 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.950
 Here is such a highlight of this 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.900
 backlit fan 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.160
 not very bright got out of her for 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.050
 backlight due to high enough 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.970
 low speed performance 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.260
 it is now connected via a buck 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.580
 cable where there is a resistor and 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.599
 accordingly, so here it is 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.400
 the camera seems not quite sure 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:39.810
 pass the nasa world backlight more 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.340
 evenly but she is pretty 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.049
 dull 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.110
 if you want something brighter then 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:49.180
 for example i have again 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.459
 similar fan from aerocool 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.640
 it is 120 millimeters respectively 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:59.700
 already the green light shines like this 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.700
 way here everything is bright 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.860
 so subscribe to the channel 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.360
 leave your comments put 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.500
 big thumbs up join the group 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.500
