00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
the goat is remove and clean so where is

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:33.249 
the goat is remove and clean so where is
the<00:01:24.710> goal<00:01:29.110> after<00:01:30.110> filtration<00:01:31.660> we<00:01:32.660> can<00:01:32.869> find<00:01:33.170> a

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
the goal after filtration we can find a

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.240 
the goal after filtration we can find a
goal<00:01:33.590> compounds<00:01:34.399> here<00:01:34.729> and<00:01:35.800> the<00:01:36.800> Queen

goal compounds here and the Queen

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.170 
goal compounds here and the Queen
solution<00:01:37.880> is<00:01:38.060> here<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.979> solution<00:01:40.550> can<00:01:41.149> be

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
solution is here the solution can be

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:48.310 
solution is here the solution can be
used<00:01:41.840> until<00:01:42.259> it<00:01:42.770> aged<00:01:46.270> so<00:01:47.270> next<00:01:47.570> time<00:01:47.899> I<00:01:48.200> will
