00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
have not been squished much will look

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.010 
have not been squished much will look
like<00:00:41.239> and<00:00:43.430> these<00:00:44.430> two<00:00:44.730> are<00:00:45.000> defective<00:00:45.629> panda

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
experimental put into the freezer

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.399 
experimental put into the freezer
because<00:01:36.420> they<00:01:36.720> become<00:01:37.020> very<00:01:37.229> very<00:01:37.470> squishy<00:01:39.409> so

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
because they become very very squishy so

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.539 
because they become very very squishy so
the<00:01:40.530> face<00:01:40.709> is<00:01:40.860> like<00:01:41.039> that<00:01:41.069> and<00:01:41.399> it's

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
the face is like that and it's

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.529 
the face is like that and it's
considerably<00:01:42.030> easy<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.689> get<00:01:43.849> tears<00:01:44.849> and<00:01:45.119> rips

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
considerably easy to get tears and rips

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.380 
considerably easy to get tears and rips
at<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.780> face<00:01:46.020> by<00:01:46.860> viscous<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.579> moderation<00:01:47.970> it

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
at the face by viscous and moderation it

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.979 
at the face by viscous and moderation it
won't<00:01:48.630> happen<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:49.429> me<00:01:50.429> that<00:01:50.819> these<00:01:51.239> panda<00:01:51.750> buns
