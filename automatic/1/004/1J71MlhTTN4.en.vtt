so<00:02:38.750> our<00:02:38.990> marination<00:02:39.440> is<00:02:39.710> ready<00:02:40.100> now<00:02:41.050> we<00:02:42.050> take

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
so our marination is ready now we take

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.620 
so our marination is ready now we take
some<00:02:42.920> tomatoes<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:44.200> capsicum<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:46.480> let's<00:02:47.480> do

some tomatoes and capsicum and let's do

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:55.450 
some tomatoes and capsicum and let's do
something<00:02:47.990> with<00:02:48.140> this<00:02:53.770> we<00:02:54.770> won't<00:02:54.980> require<00:02:55.250> the

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
something with this we won't require the

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.850 
something with this we won't require the
seeds<00:02:56.440> we<00:02:58.360> just<00:02:59.360> require<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.080> outer<00:03:00.290> part<00:03:00.740> of

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
seeds we just require the outer part of

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:01.180 
seeds we just require the outer part of
it

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
it

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:11.970
