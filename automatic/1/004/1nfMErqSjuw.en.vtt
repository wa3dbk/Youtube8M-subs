00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:15.800 
hi I'm Sylvia from the aquaponic source

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.400 
hi I'm Sylvia from the aquaponic source
and<00:00:16.040> I'm<00:00:16.130> here<00:00:16.460> today<00:00:16.610> to<00:00:16.790> talk<00:00:17.240> about

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
and I'm here today to talk about

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.400 
and I'm here today to talk about
pollination<00:00:18.490> now<00:00:19.490> you<00:00:20.119> only<00:00:20.480> really<00:00:20.960> have<00:00:21.260> to

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
pollination now you only really have to

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.230 
pollination now you only really have to
think<00:00:21.619> about<00:00:21.710> pollination<00:00:22.400> if<00:00:22.820> you're<00:00:23.000> in<00:00:23.119> an

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
think about pollination if you're in an

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.630 
think about pollination if you're in an
indoor<00:00:23.840> environment<00:00:24.770> if<00:00:25.130> you're<00:00:25.460> outdoors

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
indoor environment if you're outdoors

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.270 
indoor environment if you're outdoors
you've<00:00:26.210> got<00:00:26.449> bees<00:00:26.869> and<00:00:27.289> butterflies<00:00:27.440> and<00:00:27.860> all

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:28.280 
you've got bees and butterflies and all

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.859 
you've got bees and butterflies and all
sorts<00:00:28.610> of<00:00:28.670> pollinators<00:00:29.210> that<00:00:29.600> are<00:00:29.690> going<00:00:29.779> to

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
sorts of pollinators that are going to

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.310 
sorts of pollinators that are going to
do<00:00:30.050> the<00:00:30.199> work<00:00:30.410> for<00:00:30.440> you<00:00:31.160> you<00:00:31.910> also<00:00:32.180> only<00:00:32.930> have

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
do the work for you you also only have

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.280 
do the work for you you also only have
to<00:00:33.500> worry<00:00:33.710> about<00:00:33.860> pollination<00:00:34.870> indoors<00:00:35.870> if

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
to worry about pollination indoors if

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.470 
to worry about pollination indoors if
you're<00:00:36.739> growing<00:00:37.280> a<00:00:37.400> plant<00:00:37.640> where<00:00:38.330> you're

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
you're growing a plant where you're

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.590 
you're growing a plant where you're
consuming<00:00:39.170> the<00:00:39.379> fruit<00:00:39.800> from<00:00:40.309> that<00:00:40.580> plant<00:00:41.000> that

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
consuming the fruit from that plant that

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.720 
consuming the fruit from that plant that
comes<00:00:41.930> after<00:00:42.770> the<00:00:42.950> flower<00:00:43.220> has<00:00:43.550> been

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
comes after the flower has been

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.479 
comes after the flower has been
pollinated<00:00:44.149> so<00:00:44.780> for<00:00:45.260> example<00:00:45.489> obviously

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
pollinated so for example obviously

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.389 
pollinated so for example obviously
lettuce<00:00:46.910> and<00:00:47.239> greens<00:00:47.510> and<00:00:48.020> herbs<00:00:48.380> you<00:00:49.160> really

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
lettuce and greens and herbs you really

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:50.799 
lettuce and greens and herbs you really
don't<00:00:49.550> have<00:00:49.700> to<00:00:49.850> worry<00:00:50.030> about<00:00:50.180> pollination

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
don't have to worry about pollination

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.400 
don't have to worry about pollination
we're<00:00:51.620> talking<00:00:52.040> about<00:00:52.130> things<00:00:52.700> like<00:00:53.410> tomatoes

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
we're talking about things like tomatoes

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.250 
we're talking about things like tomatoes
and<00:00:54.770> cucumbers<00:00:55.520> and<00:00:55.940> things<00:00:56.660> where<00:00:57.020> we're

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
and cucumbers and things where we're

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.750 
and cucumbers and things where we're
actually<00:00:57.440> consuming<00:00:58.370> the<00:00:58.730> fruit<00:01:00.489> first<00:01:01.489> let's

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
actually consuming the fruit first let's

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.130 
actually consuming the fruit first let's
talk<00:01:02.000> about<00:01:02.270> plant<00:01:03.009> anatomy<00:01:04.330> here's<00:01:05.330> what<00:01:05.840> is

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
talk about plant anatomy here's what is

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.320 
talk about plant anatomy here's what is
going<00:01:06.649> on<00:01:06.770> with<00:01:07.009> plant<00:01:07.340> reproduction<00:01:07.910> first

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
going on with plant reproduction first

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.820 
going on with plant reproduction first
of<00:01:08.479> all<00:01:08.539> you've<00:01:08.720> got<00:01:08.869> male<00:01:09.080> parts<00:01:09.530> you've<00:01:09.680> got

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
of all you've got male parts you've got

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.690 
of all you've got male parts you've got
female<00:01:10.039> parts<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:11.240> male<00:01:11.509> parts<00:01:12.080> are<00:01:12.700> consists

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
female parts the male parts are consists

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.410 
female parts the male parts are consists
of<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:14.270> stamen<00:01:15.020> which<00:01:15.770> is<00:01:15.920> a<00:01:15.950> long<00:01:16.310> stem<00:01:17.090> like

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
of the stamen which is a long stem like

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.570 
of the stamen which is a long stem like
filament<00:01:18.140> that's<00:01:18.860> capped<00:01:19.220> off<00:01:19.459> with

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
filament that's capped off with

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.090 
filament that's capped off with
something<00:01:20.149> called<00:01:20.539> an<00:01:20.750> anther<00:01:21.350> and<00:01:21.649> that's

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
something called an anther and that's

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.690 
something called an anther and that's
where<00:01:22.399> the<00:01:22.550> pollen<00:01:23.149> is<00:01:23.360> now<00:01:24.259> the<00:01:24.319> female<00:01:25.130> organ

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
where the pollen is now the female organ

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.749 
where the pollen is now the female organ
is<00:01:25.849> called<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:26.270> pistol<00:01:26.899> at<00:01:27.259> the<00:01:27.950> top<00:01:28.280> of<00:01:28.580> this

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
is called the pistol at the top of this

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.270 
is called the pistol at the top of this
the<00:01:29.090> pollen<00:01:29.569> receptacle<00:01:30.410> this<00:01:30.619> is<00:01:30.800> called<00:01:31.069> the

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
the pollen receptacle this is called the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.169 
the pollen receptacle this is called the
stigma<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.740> from<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:34.009> stigma<00:01:34.520> you<00:01:34.729> go<00:01:34.940> down

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
stigma and from the stigma you go down

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:37.749 
stigma and from the stigma you go down
through<00:01:35.450> a<00:01:35.509> tube<00:01:35.869> called<00:01:36.349> the<00:01:36.590> style<00:01:37.039> and<00:01:37.610> the

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
through a tube called the style and the

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.650 
through a tube called the style and the
style<00:01:38.060> terminates<00:01:38.929> in<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.410> ovary<00:01:41.950> now

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
style terminates in the ovary now

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.309 
style terminates in the ovary now
horticulturalists<00:01:44.660> will<00:01:44.810> divide

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
horticulturalists will divide

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:48.969 
horticulturalists will divide
pollinators<00:01:46.390> into<00:01:47.390> four<00:01:47.899> separate<00:01:48.619> groups

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
pollinators into four separate groups

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.820 
pollinators into four separate groups
the<00:01:49.819> first<00:01:49.849> group<00:01:50.270> from<00:01:50.720> our<00:01:50.929> perspective<00:01:51.259> is

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
the first group from our perspective is

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.100 
the first group from our perspective is
the<00:01:52.039> easiest<00:01:52.459> these<00:01:53.179> are<00:01:53.360> called<00:01:53.569> the<00:01:53.750> self

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
the easiest these are called the self

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.070 
the easiest these are called the self
pollinating<00:01:54.830> plants<00:01:55.119> these<00:01:56.119> have<00:01:56.450> both<00:01:56.780> the

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
pollinating plants these have both the

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.559 
pollinating plants these have both the
male<00:01:57.380> organs<00:01:57.920> and<00:01:58.160> the<00:01:58.310> female<00:01:58.789> organs<00:01:59.239> within

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
male organs and the female organs within

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:03.760 
male organs and the female organs within
the<00:02:00.080> same<00:02:00.440> flower<00:02:01.060> these<00:02:02.060> are<00:02:02.450> your<00:02:03.050> plans

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
the same flower these are your plans

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.580 
the same flower these are your plans
like<00:02:04.099> beans<00:02:04.489> and<00:02:05.000> peas<00:02:05.330> and<00:02:05.690> tomatoes<00:02:06.229> that

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
like beans and peas and tomatoes that

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.609 
like beans and peas and tomatoes that
just<00:02:07.459> need<00:02:07.670> a<00:02:07.700> little<00:02:07.940> breeze<00:02:08.509> to<00:02:09.080> actually

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
just need a little breeze to actually

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.250 
just need a little breeze to actually
pollinate<00:02:10.250> or<00:02:10.489> you<00:02:11.060> know<00:02:11.180> knock<00:02:11.510> them<00:02:11.810> shake

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
pollinate or you know knock them shake

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.770 
pollinate or you know knock them shake
them<00:02:12.290> a<00:02:12.530> little<00:02:12.800> bit<00:02:13.099> but<00:02:13.610> you're<00:02:13.790> just<00:02:14.090> doing

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
them a little bit but you're just doing

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.680 
them a little bit but you're just doing
it<00:02:14.840> within<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.470> flower<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:16.670> next<00:02:17.239> group<00:02:17.480> is

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
it within the flower the next group is

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.709 
it within the flower the next group is
called<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.230> cross<00:02:18.879> pollinating<00:02:19.879> group<00:02:20.180> this

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:20.719 
called the cross pollinating group this

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.479 
called the cross pollinating group this
is<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.019> group<00:02:21.230> where<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:21.680> will<00:02:21.860> have<00:02:22.069> a<00:02:22.099> male

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
is the group where you will have a male

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:23.890 
is the group where you will have a male
flower<00:02:22.939> and<00:02:23.420> a

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
flower and a

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.380 
flower and a
male<00:02:24.079> flower<00:02:24.680> this<00:02:25.340> is<00:02:25.519> actually<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.180> biggest

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
male flower this is actually the biggest

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.600 
male flower this is actually the biggest
of<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.079> four<00:02:27.110> groups<00:02:27.709> them<00:02:27.950> has<00:02:28.189> the<00:02:28.400> most

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
of the four groups them has the most

your male flowers are the one with the
stamen<00:04:48.830> remember<00:04:49.610> that<00:04:49.789> and<00:04:50.090> at<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.330> top<00:04:50.539> is

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
stamen remember that and at the top is

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.680 
stamen remember that and at the top is
the<00:04:50.960> answer<00:04:51.500> now<00:04:51.979> the<00:04:52.039> anther<00:04:52.789> is<00:04:53.060> where<00:04:53.419> the

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
the answer now the anther is where the

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.620 
the answer now the anther is where the
powdered<00:04:54.199> pollen<00:04:54.949> actually<00:04:55.639> is<00:04:55.910> you're<00:04:56.509> going

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
powdered pollen actually is you're going

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.270 
powdered pollen actually is you're going
to<00:04:56.690> want<00:04:56.810> to<00:04:56.900> touch<00:04:57.139> that<00:04:57.470> and<00:04:57.680> see<00:04:57.860> if<00:04:57.949> some<00:04:58.160> of

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
to want to touch that and see if some of

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.610 
to want to touch that and see if some of
that<00:04:58.400> powder<00:04:58.669> comes<00:04:59.120> off<00:04:59.360> on<00:04:59.599> your<00:04:59.870> finger<00:05:00.440> if
