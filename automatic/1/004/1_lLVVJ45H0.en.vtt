00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.500
 I do not language and the rival with two 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:15.500
 environments 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.140
 collective so when I ask myself 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.529
 boss to go to the street maestro vidal in 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.460
 where I get off and ring the bell three blocks 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.460
 before eternal life 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.750
 and I swear I was lending 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:39.120
 attention you saw three blocks before the 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.120
 via and there is the way and you 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.030
 I like your mother's shell and it's 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.480
 very serious because I have so many 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.320
 friends 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.210
 on facebook 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.239
 my old friend and I have it on facebook 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.350
 and you get the notification your mom 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.050
 commented on a picture in which you are 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.300
 labeled until I cross it and I 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.119
 I say mom stop commenting on facebook 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.760
 We give you shame or embarrassment 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.260
 no mom just generates me a 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.880
 inferiority and insecurity complex 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.700
 that does not allow me to express myself fluently 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.259
 with the opposite sex or so that you stay 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.259
 lighter I do not put it I say 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:32.700
 until the two but if I can 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.920
 you know what my dream is to open up to me like that 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.880
 dress like that I want to open me like this so that 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.880
 concha gets on the floor 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.710
 but I can not already said no because 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.220
 here to arrive but I leave the look 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.620
 and it's going 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.410
 and if by cristian in winter you bathe 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.410
 of perfuming would force the center will be cold 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.679
 and there appeared a droplet prey droplet bitch 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.690
 that I will be in and green has not 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:05.000
 changed and you stay and 37 cooled that 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.080
 and I think you had to change everything from 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.080
 again I'm going nothing 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.930
 the husband but more point there is and what 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.910
 more fagot we have bought sorry 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.710
 because we endure everything well 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.360
 It can cost you with fever 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.090
 we protect cooking by washing and 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.890
 ironing already touched us knows everything 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.890
 today this is transformed into queers 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.380
 the heat 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.480
 If I'm cold, you have a fever 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.130
 and I can not go to the nutritionist because 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.050
 every time I go she tells me look 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.460
 dear you are missing red blood cells you have 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.350
 consume a lot of iron but also 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.520
 vitamin c to assimilate iron not in 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.500
 excess because it kills your blood cells 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.300
 whites and a lot of potassium the excess because 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.070
 you have calcified and many carbohydrates 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.870
 carbon that will cause you pain in 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.820
 joints so take has act 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.560
 and many proteins that are going to take you 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.810
 a little sleep so take this 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.670
 sleeping pill that they fear inflame 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.880
 a little bit delineated so it takes time 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.020
 walks and continues inflammation is not going to the 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.020
 Pain goes back says 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:22.150
 Mrs. saying hello is not everything 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.440
 slow for dogs 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.330
 If I live you dog big dog guy 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.250

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.710
