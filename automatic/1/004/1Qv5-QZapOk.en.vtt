00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
it also has the filter matrix mode check

00:00:50.730 --> 00:01:49.289 
it also has the filter matrix mode check
it<00:00:50.820> out

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.609 

all<00:01:50.299> right<00:01:50.479> so<00:01:50.659> let's<00:01:50.810> take<00:01:50.929> a<00:01:50.990> closer<00:01:51.259> look<00:01:51.380> at

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
all right so let's take a closer look at

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.649 
all right so let's take a closer look at
the<00:01:51.709> stereo<00:01:52.099> electric<00:01:52.520> mistress<00:01:52.909> as<00:01:53.329> you<00:01:53.509> can

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
the stereo electric mistress as you can

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.749 
the stereo electric mistress as you can
see<00:01:53.899> it's<00:01:54.200> got<00:01:54.349> a<00:01:54.380> normal<00:01:54.799> input<00:01:54.979> and<00:01:55.399> it's<00:01:55.640> got

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
see it's got a normal input and it's got

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.419 
see it's got a normal input and it's got
stereo<00:01:56.119> outs<00:01:56.450> three<00:01:57.020> dials<00:01:57.380> rate<00:01:57.799> flanger

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
stereo outs three dials rate flanger

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.730 
stereo outs three dials rate flanger
depth<00:01:58.670> and<00:01:58.880> chorus<00:01:59.359> depth<00:01:59.659> so<00:02:00.200> that<00:02:00.439> should<00:02:00.709> be

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
depth and chorus depth so that should be

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.529 
depth and chorus depth so that should be
easy<00:02:01.130> enough<00:02:01.429> to<00:02:01.490> set<00:02:01.759> up<00:02:01.880> I<00:02:02.000> think<00:02:02.119> it's<00:02:02.450> a

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
easy enough to set up I think it's a

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.149 
easy enough to set up I think it's a
little<00:02:02.630> easier<00:02:03.049> to<00:02:03.079> set<00:02:03.349> up<00:02:03.379> than<00:02:03.649> the<00:02:03.829> deluxe

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
little easier to set up than the deluxe

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.789 
little easier to set up than the deluxe
electric<00:02:04.700> mistress<00:02:05.200> so<00:02:06.200> where<00:02:06.409> has<00:02:06.649> the

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
electric mistress so where has the

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.039

filter<00:02:07.129> matrix<00:02:07.549> mode<00:02:07.849> gone<00:02:08.209> that's<00:02:08.539> a<00:02:08.750> switch

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
filter matrix mode gone that's a switch

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:11.140 
filter matrix mode gone that's a switch
on<00:02:09.319> the<00:02:09.440> deluxe<00:02:09.739> electric<00:02:10.160> mistress<00:02:10.549> that's<00:02:11.000> a

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
on the deluxe electric mistress that's a

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.360 
on the deluxe electric mistress that's a

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
hidden feature of the rate dial so when

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.100 
hidden feature of the rate dial so when
you<00:02:13.459> take<00:02:13.579> this<00:02:13.760> dial<00:02:14.090> below<00:02:14.450> 12<00:02:14.750> o'clock

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
you take this dial below 12 o'clock

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.080 
you take this dial below 12 o'clock
you're<00:02:15.709> in<00:02:15.829> filter<00:02:16.190> matrix<00:02:16.640> mode<00:02:16.819> and<00:02:17.000> you<00:02:17.060> can

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
you're in filter matrix mode and you can

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.809 
you're in filter matrix mode and you can
find<00:02:17.450> your<00:02:17.569> sweet<00:02:17.840> spot<00:02:17.989> and<00:02:18.319> freeze<00:02:18.819> the

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
flange sound there so there will be no

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.460 
flange sound there so there will be no
sweep<00:02:22.220> which<00:02:22.790> you<00:02:22.940> can<00:02:23.120> just<00:02:23.329> get<00:02:23.510> there<00:02:23.780> you

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
sweep which you can just get there you

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.960 
sweep which you can just get there you
know<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.799> sound<00:02:25.069> that<00:02:25.190> you<00:02:25.340> like<00:02:25.489> best<00:02:25.730> from

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
here's with the electric mistress

00:02:44.250 --> 00:04:14.480 
here's with the electric mistress
engaged

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.920 

all<00:04:15.490> right<00:04:15.670> now<00:04:16.209> let's<00:04:16.420> go<00:04:16.540> into<00:04:16.660> filter

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
all right now let's go into filter

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:42.140 
all right now let's go into filter
matrix

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:05:50.469 

Oh

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:52.820 

so<00:05:51.479> that's<00:05:51.690> it<00:05:51.840> the<00:05:51.990> stereo<00:05:52.409> electric

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
so that's it the stereo electric

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.589 
so that's it the stereo electric
mistress<00:05:53.220> if<00:05:53.550> I<00:05:53.759> could<00:05:53.940> only<00:05:54.060> bring<00:05:54.330> one

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:54.599 
mistress if I could only bring one

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:56.270 
mistress if I could only bring one
modulation<00:05:55.139> pedal<00:05:55.560> to<00:05:55.680> the<00:05:55.710> gig<00:05:55.979> it<00:05:56.159> would

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
modulation pedal to the gig it would

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.800 
modulation pedal to the gig it would
probably<00:05:56.729> be<00:05:56.879> this<00:05:57.120> one<00:05:57.389> because<00:05:57.539> it<00:05:57.780> has

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
probably be this one because it has

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.990 
probably be this one because it has
chorus<00:05:58.379> &amp;<00:05:58.590> flanger<00:05:59.250> and<00:05:59.430> it's<00:05:59.819> just

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
chorus &amp; flanger and it's just

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.820 
chorus &amp; flanger and it's just
incredibly<00:06:00.539> versatile<00:06:01.110> and<00:06:01.169> it<00:06:01.409> sounds

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
incredibly versatile and it sounds

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.710 
incredibly versatile and it sounds
