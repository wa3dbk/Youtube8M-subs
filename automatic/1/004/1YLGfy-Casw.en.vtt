00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
Wonderland is wrong and apparently when

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.800 
Wonderland is wrong and apparently when
she<00:01:20.369> went<00:01:20.670> down<00:01:20.759> there<00:01:21.119> she'd<00:01:21.330> just<00:01:21.540> kind<00:01:21.720> of

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
she went down there she'd just kind of

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.200 
she went down there she'd just kind of
screwed<00:01:22.470> everything<00:01:22.770> up<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.310> Alyssa<00:01:23.729> needs<00:01:24.060> to

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
screwed everything up so Alyssa needs to

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.969 
screwed everything up so Alyssa needs to
go<00:01:24.330> down<00:01:24.479> there<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.960> write<00:01:25.290> all<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.740> wrongs

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
that the original Alice did so it's just

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.730 
that the original Alice did so it's just
about<00:01:29.460> her<00:01:29.790> going<00:01:30.509> into<00:01:30.780> Wonderland<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.650> you
