00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.010
 want to watch is the game in the moment 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.949
 let me lie out of group i and that 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:25.199
 meets the world and European champion 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:27.900
 spain in finland so the duel of 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.740
 teams from the Iberian peninsula against 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.180
 the northern lights of europe and yes there were 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.219
 until now as a game between 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.770
 werner wise ended zero 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.770
 but zero is already off 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.770
 2007 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.530
 what can i tell you to spain the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.700
 performance of spain 93 percent 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.500
 means six wins from the last 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.199
 seven play only against 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.690
 france there was a 1 2 1 in the wm 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.899
 Quali yes before the two games in the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.180
 wm quali were won respectively 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.980
 the two and then there were still 1 5 to 1 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.409
 against panama and a 3 2 1 against 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.580
 Uruguay in the two 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:12.420
 friendly games 4 1 of them on 14 11 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.590
 10 and 1 now at 6.2 so that everything 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.180
 played what we did this year 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.820
 the Spaniards have them too 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.299
 won 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.610
 In contrast, 43 in the fin that is 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.220
 last two defeats before a victory 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.420
 before that a draw 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.579
 win defeat so 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.240
 Last but not least, there were two 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:36.390
 defeats in friendly matches 2 1 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.720
 against israel and 3 against 0 against finland 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.689
 before that a 13 0 in cyprus yes in the 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.000
 wm-quali 1 1 to 1 against georgia before 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:49.200
 even a 1 0-victory against the Czechs 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.409
 Let's see what are they 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.380
 most successful scorers 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:58.590
 there we see pedro from barcelona 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.530
 three matches 10 ramos roberto soldado 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.770
 and Jordan Alba each with a hit 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:09.520
 And what's his name now ? 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.780
 with a hit for the 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.120
 they have more winnings now too 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.700
 but have also only two games 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.650
 made can be found on the fifth 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.830
 place in this group and the Spaniards 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.450
 are on the first table place 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.550
 so let me just say how 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.060
 I see that as the game is so 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.160
 go out 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.200
 I guess the spanish are the 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.440
 easy to decide for yourself and also 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.500
 probably shoot a few goals 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:40.810
 are always good for goals and therefore 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:43.540
 I think the Spaniards win with 3 0 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.630
 maybe with 4 1 you will then 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.630
 see
