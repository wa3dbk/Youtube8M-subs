made by Nintendo it does it comes with
this<00:00:44.250> little<00:00:44.309> insert<00:00:44.969> here<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.570> games<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.870> my

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
this little insert here the games in my

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.810 
this little insert here the games in my
console<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.070> back<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.640> a

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
console and on the back of that is a

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.819 
console and on the back of that is a
code<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:48.690> enter<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.379> website

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
3ds games you get roughly sampling in

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.310 
3ds games you get roughly sampling in
North<00:00:56.309> America<00:00:56.789> like<00:00:56.910> 30<00:00:57.270> points<00:00:57.719> if<00:00:58.140> you

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
North America like 30 points if you

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.939 
North America like 30 points if you
register<00:00:58.680> those<00:00:58.949> and<00:01:00.109> again<00:01:01.109> obviously<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
register those and again obviously the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.770 
register those and again obviously the
3ds<00:01:02.280> game<00:01:02.699> comes<00:01:03.000> with<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.180> little<00:01:03.390> thing<00:01:03.600> too

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
3ds game comes with a little thing too

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.600 
3ds game comes with a little thing too
with<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> code<00:01:04.199> on<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.589> back<00:01:04.830> but<00:01:05.460> if<00:01:05.580> you

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
with the code on the back but if you

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.600 
with the code on the back but if you
register<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.360> Wii<00:01:06.720> game<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.799> like<00:01:08.070> sin<00:01:08.460> and

register a Wii game so like sin and

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.789 
register a Wii game so like sin and
Punishment<00:01:09.060> star<00:01:09.330> successor<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.290> does<00:01:10.530> come

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
points for registering one of these

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.340
