again<00:05:09.460> a<00:05:09.699> brilliant<00:05:10.570> example<00:05:10.810> of<00:05:11.199> this<00:05:11.320> is

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
again a brilliant example of this is

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.580 
again a brilliant example of this is
with<00:05:11.680> water<00:05:11.949> water<00:05:12.729> bottles<00:05:13.210> I<00:05:13.479> mean<00:05:14.289> they're

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
with water water bottles I mean they're

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.439 
with water water bottles I mean they're
everywhere<00:05:15.190> I<00:05:15.430> was<00:05:15.610> given<00:05:16.000> this<00:05:16.120> one<00:05:16.330> the

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
everywhere I was given this one the

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.749 
everywhere I was given this one the

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759 
other day on a journey back and it was

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:20.640 
other day on a journey back and it was
handy<00:05:19.240> you<00:05:19.389> know<00:05:19.509> we<00:05:19.659> grab<00:05:19.930> them<00:05:20.139> we<00:05:20.470> don't

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
handy you know we grab them we don't

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.140 
handy you know we grab them we don't
necessarily<00:05:21.280> think<00:05:21.460> but<00:05:21.639> what<00:05:21.759> am<00:05:21.880> I<00:05:21.940> going<00:05:22.060> to

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
necessarily think but what am I going to

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.999 
necessarily think but what am I going to
do<00:05:22.270> with<00:05:22.449> it<00:05:22.479> afterwards<00:05:23.020> well<00:05:23.620> actually<00:05:23.740> I'll

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:24.009 
do with it afterwards well actually I'll

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:26.249 
do with it afterwards well actually I'll
probably<00:05:24.039> use<00:05:24.460> it<00:05:24.759> for<00:05:24.940> another<00:05:25.479> concoction

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
probably use it for another concoction

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:27.990 
probably use it for another concoction
and<00:05:26.560> if<00:05:26.650> I<00:05:26.770> don't<00:05:26.830> need<00:05:27.130> it<00:05:27.310> I'll<00:05:27.550> give<00:05:27.789> it<00:05:27.880> to<00:05:27.970> a

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
and if I don't need it I'll give it to a

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.399 
and if I don't need it I'll give it to a
friend<00:05:28.060> but<00:05:29.310> if<00:05:30.310> I<00:05:30.490> had<00:05:30.729> my<00:05:31.419> trusty<00:05:31.840> water
