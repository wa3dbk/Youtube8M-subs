00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.139

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:30.970
 on several occasions 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.730
 but this time I'm going to refer only to the trips we have 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.080
 undertaken of character percent kristy with mystic 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.970
 those trips that we have made through it the Inca Trail the route of 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.320
 You have to keep calling us to blackmail 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.990
 percent to get to the citadel machu picchu 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.050

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.540
 I wanted to share with you what I have been able to reflect on that 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.120
 country and those trips and those places 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.019
 what do they do when they take people 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.030
 when driving people to that kind of places 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.420
 he is haughty to the consciences of those people 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.659
 he alluded to those memories of having been there in the past for those 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.240
 places 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.580
 of so much energy 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.710
 i percent catapult 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.540
 to put it somehow 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.150
 the 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.910
 deep reflection the mystical in the interest of the people and begins 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.070
 that internal search yes percent has not already started those places what 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.840
 they do it's kind of hurting internal finishes shot 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.119
 this natural 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.789
 who do what company do percent minds help in awakening awareness 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:42.950
 of the people who there percent come there 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.500
 as we said we have been twice with those trips 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.370
 last year 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.880
 and in this year 2009 as you know again 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.810
 from the one next door but it still took place 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.090
 I think I'm even more energetic 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.000
 x said you want 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.970
 guirao shock is a citadel 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.320
 who was discovered after full or after machu picchu 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.669
 there is a shortage of drugs 

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:11.359
 but that is not so visited 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:15.569
 is a place of mountains using when going over another side of by the way I went 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.709
 more than crossing mountains sm 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.859
 it is a path of more adventure 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.809
 But the count will also be able to experience 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:28.189
 a number of sequences and I send you percent gums yes they remit 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.499
 one kind is totally mystical and spiritual 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:35.569
 then imminent or through in April this year again they are taking on 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:36.210
 that trip 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.610
 we invite everyone 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.380
 because he really wants in English taught on one side is sober 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.680
 share them and on the other hand 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.050
 in the press room that actually 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.170
 the peru itself as so many other derek countries of the southern cone of 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.289
 Latin America and Central America 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:54.770
 they are d percent a kind of 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.219
 manet and potentially 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:59.309
 a one climate 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:02.399
 so much appropriate to explain to the paralytic 

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:03.799
 what did I nod 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:09.040
 the good as we said at the time the person remember percent for here 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.579
 we the other planet why and for what 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.950
 we are asking for this mmm experience 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.099
 percent matter of the world what the mayor 

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:22.799
 every day it becomes more difficult but through plurality 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.080
 we can not cope 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.560
 come back for a hundred more rise less condescending with ourselves not 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.290
 be so demanding with ourselves 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.370
 nor with the other 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.510
 nicol hundred then 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.620
 it's about not rejecting the changes 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.840
 because the changes being felt all over the planet by all of humanity 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.519
 I believe that the spiritual path this is the most convenient for these 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:46.659
 changes be 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.969
 as soon as possible 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:51.909
 in that span a small heavy contribution 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:53.929
 p has then raised the invitation
