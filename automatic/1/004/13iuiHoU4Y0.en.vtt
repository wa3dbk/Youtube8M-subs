00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.780
 tuned in the player this works 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.160
 without any problems so much approved 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.680
 declare that you can download it 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.440
 for mediafire links for example 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.330
 let's download one here we're going to like 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.160
 the wheels that get into each mediafire 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.140

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.420
 description of the video and it will come out is 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.700
 that you click where paulo says and 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.860
 this will not take about three seconds 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.230
 four seconds well I'm going to 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.090
 cancel because I already have it when 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.899
 we already have everything ready so 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.579
 archive 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.210
 the file that you want to download 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.250

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.530

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.420
 for example I'm going to put this notice and 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.440
 he tells me to replace the files 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.570
 because I had installed it 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.890
 previously for example the first one is 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.780
 this way I'm going to leave you with your 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.409
