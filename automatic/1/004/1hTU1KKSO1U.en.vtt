00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.720
 it will be this fantastic 4x4 scan 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.349
 to accompany us in our test 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.880
 adventure in africa destination tunisia 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.340
 motorcycling to celebrate its 100 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.780
 years has done things in big 7 maxi 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:37.059
 enduro and bmw challenge with the newest 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.750
 adventure then spoke wheels 19 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.190
 anterior motorcycle guzzi which has physically 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.170
 provided the same bike to motorcycling 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.399
 that went so well in Greece and 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:51.760
 therefore in ntx honda version pointing 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:55.030
 still on the peculiarity of the dual dct 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.660
 clutch transmission its so change 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.239
 ktm detail with the adventure then 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.239
 front hoop from 21 always 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.270
 obviously rays part for africa from 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:11.020
 sure protagonist and then suzuki that with 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.990
 the renewed model proposes the model 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.659
 more new than the eight this year we pass 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.270
 a triumph that returns from a great 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.430
 result last year in Greece still 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.340
 tip on the xvi version for well 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.740
 figure and then hammock the super ténéré e 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.369
 it looks like itself 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.850
 actually the new suspensions with 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.850
 electronic regulation 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.480
 we are at the beginning of our journey 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.620
 we left Genoa last night now 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.730
 we are on the ship we are 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.620
 engaging tunis 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.270
 the ship is curiously called cartagine 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.080
 which will also be our last 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.080
 stop in tunisia 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.940
 let's go to Tunisia to try the 7 maxi 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.979
 enduro is a place where everything is born 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.000
 practically the maxi enduros are born from 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:07.190
 africa have evolved there are a lot 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.200
 softened the electronic technology 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.820
 has yields usable also in the cities however 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.800
 let's go to where the myth is really born 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.650
 of the maxi multi enduro very much 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.420
 interesting is a little different from the usual 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.370
 especially because he has never been in 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.370
 africa with motorcycles and fascinates 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.370
 we have cow's in the 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.420
 huge bikes with road tires 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.240
 we are going to the paradise of 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.560
 off-road with the wrong bikes though 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.750
 those who buy these bikes will lose out 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.440
 co.re.com beli will certainly be there 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.400
 lots of motorcycling readers who 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.740
 impressed by the beautiful images 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.080
 of motorcycles in action on the dunes of the 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.750
 desert will wonder but why not 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.710
 you have mounted the tires really off 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.270
 road 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.430
 the reason is simple we started 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.460
 from Milan we will cross the whole 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.450
 tunisia and we will return to the editorial office for 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:03.550
 eighty percent on asphalt a little up 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.010
 dirt roads and only one 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.100
 very small digression will be made 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.890
 on the hard and therefore it seemed the thing 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.340
 more natural to equip them as well 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.010
 they leave there is so much a part it seems to me 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.480
 waste on the other hand I'm curious about 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.620
 really see what you can do with 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.830
 motion as well as are used 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.360
 by most all people 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.400
 these bikes come out with covers 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.030
 extremely street because those who 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.520
 buys substantially makes use of it between 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.560
 inverted commas or better one 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.220
 choice daughter of the trade is the daughter of the 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.220
 our times 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.950
 it is used with the sauce to take the children to 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.950
 school 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.950
 after the milan genoa the highway more 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.160
 plagued by tutors called and won 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:59.910
 after a very long crossing in the name 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.090
 24 hours up to Tunis and after 200 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.160
 kilometers of the motorway more 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:09.240
 unsteady that we have ever crossed 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:12.630
 all south towards south will be 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.790
 roads have led us to Rome 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.390
 obviously we're kidding this is yes 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:21.600
 the colosseum but the colosseum dl jam 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.970
 here you can breathe africa and it is from here that 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.200
 our adventure begins 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.970
 let's get to know the 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.550
 protagonists of our maxi test in 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.710
 tunisia from the right you see the suzuki v 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.560
 strom mille is the pool of the group 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.630
 two-cylinder l of 1000 cubic cm so much 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.690
 easy to handle low weight and price 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.720
 the lowest of all we continue with the 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.160
 ktm adventure model r is the most suri 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.960
 stragistica of the group with the circle 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.710
 21-inch front to the rear from 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.490
 18 in the dunes promises magic to his 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.330
 right 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:57.570
 bmw r 1200 gs model adventure the 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.840
 maxi 30 liters tank lots and lots 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.560
 infinite electronic protection 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.230
 unstoppable traveler 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.669
 continue with the yamaha super ténéré 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.740
 this year to a more advanced electronics 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.000
 in short, a worse engine 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.080
 what she missed last year 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.930
 to aim for victory 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.550
 we continue with the triumph tiger 1200 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.330
 If she has not changed respect 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.860
 last year 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.139
 and its strengths are always the 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.900
 themselves an engine with an infinite torque 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:24.190
 and an excellent ride comfort 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.320
 we continue with the only four 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.570
 Group cylinders is a v 4 is the honda 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.720
 crosstourer and in addition to excellent dynamics 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.490
 driving at the double clutch gearbox 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.590
 from mandello del lario el jem hai 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.990
 understood is the bike guzzi stelvio version 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.419
 ntx for her standard saddlebags 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.600
 spoke circles is the classic 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:42.600
 two cylinder of mandello 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.790
 and we also want to leave ours 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.790
 sign 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:25.220
 so far we have tried the bikes in a 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:28.160
 purely motorway route and it is me 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:32.420
 It seemed that BMW is the most protective 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:34.420
 the one with less vibrations anymore 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.430
 comfortable with driving position 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:39.740
 optimal I believe that hold and africa are 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.770
 two names that marry well cannot say 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.270
 well for what reason why 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:49.250
 this year the super ténéré wins 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:52.040
 I think the ktm r because the off-road vehicle 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.360
 you drive with great ease and 

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.470
 this year I believe most 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.510
 we'll have fun with it 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:59.360
 off-road so for me win ktm 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:03.920
 the fact that it has wheels 18 21 al 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:05.690
 place of the 17 19 of the basic version is 

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.300
 that these tires are also of 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:11.810
 very small section makes it 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:14.060
 more agile and more suited to off-road use e 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.100
 I hope something can be done in 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:19.460
 this this comparative something 

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:21.440
 significant that for tm I was by nature 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:24.770
 just think about this engine 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:26.580
 which is really exclusive engine 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.800
 plane 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.259
 we will see how it will behave however in 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.419
 africa let's see if 6 rock or six is enough 

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:35.610
 metal 

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:38.849
 I hope it 's my bike for now 

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:40.219
 preferred is called already to look at me 

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:44.189
 like a lot 

00:07:40.219 --> 00:07:48.360
 but I have to say that ktm amazed me for 

00:07:44.189 --> 00:07:51.360
 the engine and the bike that excited me 

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:55.050
 more is definitely my motoguzzi 

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:58.400
 prediction is that this year ktm will do it 

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.400
 a bad joke on the way
