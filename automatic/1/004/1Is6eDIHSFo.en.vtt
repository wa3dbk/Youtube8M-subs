00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.400
 good 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.420
 Missed a little more than two weeks 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.420
 to start the carnival 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:20.640
 carnival is success future failure 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:23.310
 scrambled memory because I say that 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:28.260
 because I get places here if you guys 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:31.560
 you can see that this is a place that 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:38.520
 Reminds me of the past carnival and such 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:44.539
 this was once an allegorical car today 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:47.039
 very hard you want a good place 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:50.250
 carnival this carnival 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.350
 the memory is the expectation but you 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:01:01.199
 seeing this kind of carnival here you 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:04.920
 there is no reminder a link keepsake is 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:11.810
 unpleasant a disaster 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:15.899
 Sometimes the doll here was something 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:19.229
 I'm talking about this because the carnival 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:23.670
 arriving a lot of people are in a state 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.330
 This allegorical car is just a souvenir of the 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.330
 That was once a day. 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:39.869
 in this state that machine that 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:44.479
 Sleeping power pieces were already seen 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.479
 very passive samba on top nowadays 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.770
 just do not're more or less a legal body 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:02.159
 a legal package 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.929
 Carnival is the time for you to turn 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.090
 there's why there's even carnival you see 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:10.560
 Where did you arrive today is from? 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.900
 the carnival is you are arriving and power 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.720
 go out on the street or anywhere 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:22.230
 the man what to show and speak carnival 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:25.019
 with shirts carnival i want 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.650
 go shirtless 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:31.620
 But you also have to be well. 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:35.420
 you do not arrive in the state you are in 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.420
 arriving the carnival and for that, nÃ© 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:49.389
 This is a sad fact, this is one thing. 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:58.329
 which does not even remember the 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:03:02.680
 greatness that there is much better because you 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:08.109
 see sadness is past 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.950
 so the tip for you guys is the only two gas 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.120
 weeks 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.900
 It's getting there to get there. 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.599
 remembering that it was the carnival was not 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:21.219
 blank cover that has this memory 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:22.870
 hence this is the remembrance within 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:26.319
 of the house what is a carnival souvenir 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:34.109
 passed without due care has no 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:34.109
 Preparation has nothing good. 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:44.459
 The tip is there everyone will give a 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:47.660
 gas in the carioca carnival arriving and is 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.660
 That's it worth
