00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:15.289
 edu per day is the technique of cultivating vegetables where the soil is not used 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.939
 only water as substrate water enriched with mineral salts 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.529
 which are absorbed directly by the agencies 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.130
 this produces vegetables with a number of advantages over vegetables 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.689
 conventional 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.190
 hygiene balanced nutrients absence of pesticides 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.339
 durability to post-harvest are the main advantages 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.820
 one can fourth the vegetables from the refrigerator without cutting the roots and so will last 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.820
 the time required for weekly consumption 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.090
 the phallus phallus hydroponics adopted the phenolic foam plate 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.020
 for germination 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.840
 which is one of the most modern options and languages ​​that the hydroponic system 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.990
 offers in the first phase 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.270
 firstly wash with abundant water from foam cake 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.510
 phenolic 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.590
 these as it comes to cut into cubes of two by two centimeters to 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.060
 facilitate the next operation 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.860
 then with wet foam begins sowing 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.420
 here we see the sowing of lettuce 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.030
 the seeds of pelleted lettuce 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.640
 are relatively large there it is possible to place on the scoresheet one in each 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.240
 phenolic foam polish body 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.130
 already the seeds of arugula we need the opening of a bottom since they are 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.990
 placed in an average of 20 units in each hole with the aid of a small funnel 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.940
 those of the watercress that was also used from the same bottom in the phenolic foam are 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.860
 smaller still starts then from a seed knocker 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.950
 each fund receives an average of 30 to 40 seeds 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.330
 done that these boards go to a cabinet with natural ventilation 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.780
 protected from direct light 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.030
 in the period of 3 to 5 days the germination 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.600
 this period varies according to the temperature of the environment and 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.999
 time of the year 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:12.500
 in this sequence we can see the germination process over three a 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.209
 five days 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.999
 after this period the cubes with the seedlings are separated and taken to the 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:23.120
 intermediate tables yet the 10 2 inches 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.890
 where the seedlings or stay the size needed to be transferred 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.349
 for the final stage of growth 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.150
 these peoples have planting spacing of 10 centimeters 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.379
 where the seedlings should remain from seven to ten days 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.230
 until they reach the height of five to eight centimeters 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:43.340
 during this time 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.660
 nutrition is balanced for young plants pH adjustment and 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.410
 water checked once a day and to be able to add more 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.660
 nutrients such as calcium magnesium potassium iron and other 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.390
 consequently 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.640
 humans in many places 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.439
 are weighed and added directly into feed tanks 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:10.639
 during the day you have to be satisfied with the water consumed by the plants how many 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:12.829
 times it is necessary to 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.319
 then the plants go to the final tables where they become 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.319
 fed with nutrients to adulthood 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.400
 here we can still see 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.450
 and outflow of nutrient water circulating in 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.349
 what are the vegetables and feeding and talking 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.739
 this system is automated through mulch and its frequency of operation 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.249
 varies according to temperature and environmental humidity 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:42.950
 as we can notice all the preparation area and the final tables are 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:46.879
 covered and has controlled solos lighting through a cover 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.479
 internally by sombrite to avoid excess light 

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:57.629
 The tables are made of polystyrene pvc and some are covered with cardboard 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.119
 aluminum to prevent water heating 

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:02.889
 current 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:08.129
 finally after a period ranging from 15 to 35 days depending on the variety 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:12.859
 vegetables and the time of the year are taken directly from the 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:18.209
 final tables and placed in the plastic bags identified and 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.009
 consumer information and very fresh shipments to key 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.229
 that deal with supermarkets in the city of sorocaba
