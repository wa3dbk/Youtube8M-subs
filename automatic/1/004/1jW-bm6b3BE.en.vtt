 [Music] 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.090
 well what we have here is a 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.059
 3d printing quadrocopters all the 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.150
 frame to frame 3d printing axes as 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.490
 can see the lakers here and the 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.410
 structure supports all the part of 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.070
 electronic where we have the 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.520
 speed controllers motors 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.250
 a camera 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.200
 that allows recording in full hd and has a 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.540
 I shot an electronic trigger that 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.650
 allows you to take pictures and videos 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.040
 remotely has 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.830
 a battery of 5 thousand 200 thousand since 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.100
 approximately has a flight time 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.110
 from 15 to 20 minutes and the system 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.200
 control forms the gps where they can 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.660
 observe the gps and the computer 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.600
 main that allows you to which cocktail 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:10.239
 have stability in flight 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:10.239

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:24.469
 [Music] 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.490
 we have this team what 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.920
 [Music] 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.009
 which is designed first in a program 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.420
 of solidworks computer and this with 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.570
 this prototype what you want to achieve 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.290
 is to improve the performance of the battery 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.460
 [Music] 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.520
 to one of the most characteristic 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.620
 important is that it is composed of 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.120
 laws that are small is a small 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.910
 filament that is being built by 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:56.200
 levels and that generates layers those layers 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:59.710
 they generate what the whole structure is 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.259
 of the drone hardware one of the 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.210
 most important characteristics is the 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.070
 electronic components the system 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.560
 navigation that allows the aircraft 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.179
 stabilize at all times and count 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.540
 with three main modes of flight a 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.870
 manual gps mode and return home so 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.349
 manual the pilot what he does is 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:24.519
 manipulate the entire post all 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:26.590
 flight components and in gps mode the 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.810
 gps helps stabilize the aircraft in 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.269
 a certain attitude and length what 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.890
 important thing about this drone is that almost not 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.110
 it makes a noise because because its structure 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.650
 It is so small that it cuts very well 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.230
 air but in turn is also light and 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.040
 light to be able to make good maneuvers 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.040
 in the team 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:58.800
