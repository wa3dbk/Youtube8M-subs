the second amazing way that fiber

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.970 
the second amazing way that fiber
contributes<00:00:29.329> to<00:00:29.480> weight<00:00:29.660> loss<00:00:29.869> is<00:00:30.230> something

contributes to weight loss is something

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.310 
contributes to weight loss is something
called<00:00:31.480> energy<00:00:32.480> density<00:00:33.410> I<00:00:33.590> like<00:00:34.489> to<00:00:34.699> call<00:00:34.940> it

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
called energy density I like to call it

calorie<00:00:36.320> density<00:00:36.860> a<00:00:37.129> calorie<00:00:37.940> is<00:00:38.000> a<00:00:38.149> unit<00:00:38.269> of

density foods have fewer calories in the

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:02.979 
density foods have fewer calories in the
same<00:00:59.479> volume<00:01:00.140> of<00:01:00.530> food<00:01:00.890> this<00:01:01.820> means<00:01:02.180> with<00:01:02.659> low

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
same volume of food this means with low

same volume of food this means with low
calorie<00:01:03.559> density<00:01:03.949> foods<00:01:04.400> you<00:01:05.180> can<00:01:05.330> eat<00:01:05.540> a<00:01:05.720> lot

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
calorie density foods you can eat a lot

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.580 
calorie density foods you can eat a lot
of<00:01:06.080> food<00:01:06.530> without<00:01:07.100> a<00:01:07.400> lot<00:01:07.880> of<00:01:08.119> calories<00:01:08.390> so<00:01:09.350> for

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
of food without a lot of calories so for

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.480 
of food without a lot of calories so for
example<00:01:09.710> this<00:01:10.340> peach<00:01:10.670> has<00:01:11.060> 51<00:01:12.009> calories<00:01:13.009> okay

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
example this peach has 51 calories okay

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.530 
example this peach has 51 calories okay
you<00:01:14.180> could<00:01:14.360> eat<00:01:14.630> a<00:01:14.840> whole<00:01:15.590> bowl<00:01:16.220> of<00:01:16.280> peaches<00:01:16.729> to

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
you could eat a whole bowl of peaches to

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.649 
you could eat a whole bowl of peaches to
equal<00:01:17.990> a<00:01:18.140> chocolate<00:01:18.740> bar<00:01:18.920> which<00:01:19.189> has<00:01:19.659> 230

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
equal a chocolate bar which has 230

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.620 
equal a chocolate bar which has 230
calories<00:01:21.140> so<00:01:21.950> that's<00:01:22.250> a<00:01:22.430> lot<00:01:22.670> to<00:01:22.700> eat<00:01:23.329> in

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
calories so that's a lot to eat in

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.399 
calories so that's a lot to eat in

ounce<00:01:27.829> for<00:01:28.219> ounce<00:01:28.399> you<00:01:28.969> will<00:01:29.119> gain<00:01:29.299> more

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
ounce for ounce you will gain more

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.270 
ounce for ounce you will gain more
weight<00:01:29.749> from<00:01:30.469> eating<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.829> chocolate<00:01:31.039> bar

weight from eating the chocolate bar

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.419 
weight from eating the chocolate bar
then<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.060> same<00:01:32.329> volume<00:01:32.719> of<00:01:33.020> peaches<00:01:33.380> now<00:01:34.219> I'm

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
then the same volume of peaches now I'm

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.700 
then the same volume of peaches now I'm
not<00:01:34.460> saying<00:01:34.939> with<00:01:35.210> 5<00:01:35.420> or<00:01:35.569> 35<00:01:36.079> that<00:01:36.380> you<00:01:36.499> can

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
not saying with 5 or 35 that you can

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.989 
not saying with 5 or 35 that you can
always<00:01:36.950> eat<00:01:37.100> peaches<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:37.640> never<00:01:37.789> have

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:37.999 
always eat peaches and never have

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:40.149 
always eat peaches and never have
chocolate<00:01:38.450> remember<00:01:39.409> everything<00:01:39.829> in
