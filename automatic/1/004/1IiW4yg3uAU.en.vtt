the<00:00:19.380> first<00:00:19.590> thing<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.949> don't<00:00:20.160> like<00:00:20.279> about

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
the first thing that I don't like about

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.910 
the first thing that I don't like about
this<00:00:20.730> macbook<00:00:21.300> pro<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.900> that<00:00:22.109> unfortunately

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
this macbook pro is that unfortunately

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.279 
this macbook pro is that unfortunately
the<00:00:23.189> UI<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.550> not<00:00:24.029> as<00:00:24.210> snappy<00:00:24.689> as<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.930> thought<00:00:25.109> it

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
the UI is not as snappy as I thought it

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.769 
the UI is not as snappy as I thought it
would<00:00:25.439> be<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:26.099> know<00:00:26.220> it's<00:00:26.369> newer<00:00:26.760> hardware<00:00:27.180> so

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
would be you know it's newer hardware so

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.580 
would be you know it's newer hardware so
I<00:00:27.810> figured<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.349> UI<00:00:28.500> would<00:00:28.859> be<00:00:30.320> snappier<00:00:31.320> for

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
I figured the UI would be snappier for

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.650 
I figured the UI would be snappier for
that<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.740> may<00:00:32.040> have<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.399> wait<00:00:32.489> for<00:00:32.550> OS<00:00:33.030> 10<00:00:33.360> El

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
that I may have to wait for OS 10 El

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.930 
that I may have to wait for OS 10 El
Capitan<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.800> come<00:00:34.950> down<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.309> pike<00:00:35.460> if<00:00:35.670> only

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
Capitan to come down the pike if only

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.270 
Capitan to come down the pike if only
because<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.300> metal<00:00:36.780> optimizations<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.950> was

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
because of metal optimizations that was

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.160 
because of metal optimizations that was
probably<00:00:38.520> one<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.000> more<00:00:39.120> jarring<00:00:39.540> changes

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
probably one of the more jarring changes

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.810 
probably one of the more jarring changes

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
about my macbook pro is that the chassis

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.200 
about my macbook pro is that the chassis
gets<00:01:09.960> dirty<00:01:10.350> easily<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.580> not<00:01:11.790> like<00:01:12.000> i'm

gets dirty easily and it's not like i'm
insanely<00:01:12.659> dirty<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.260> begin<00:01:13.530> with<00:01:13.710> i<00:01:13.890> keep<00:01:14.280> a

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
insanely dirty to begin with i keep a

insanely dirty to begin with i keep a
very<00:01:14.640> clean<00:01:15.030> workshop<00:01:15.659> it's<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.470> that

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
very clean workshop it's just that

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.700 
very clean workshop it's just that
everything<00:01:17.939> seems<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.450> discolor<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.170> macbook

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
everything seems to discolor the macbook

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.820 
everything seems to discolor the macbook
chassis<00:01:20.189> with<00:01:20.820> not<00:01:21.360> much<00:01:21.780> effort<00:01:22.200> i<00:01:22.350> think

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
chassis with not much effort i think

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.010 
chassis with not much effort i think
those<00:01:23.040> are<00:01:23.070> water<00:01:23.430> spots<00:01:24.000> but<00:01:24.240> i'm<00:01:24.360> not<00:01:24.509> sure<00:01:24.570> i

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
those are water spots but i'm not sure i

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.810 
those are water spots but i'm not sure i
should<00:01:25.350> also<00:01:25.560> note<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.369> chassis<00:01:26.790> is

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
should also note that the chassis is

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.390 
should also note that the chassis is
very<00:01:27.240> easily<00:01:27.630> cleaned<00:01:28.170> but<00:01:28.650> why<00:01:29.070> does<00:01:29.280> it

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
very easily cleaned but why does it

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.490 
very easily cleaned but why does it
attract<00:01:29.759> dirt<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.329> grime<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.810> easily<00:01:31.020> well

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
attract dirt and grime so easily well

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.020 
attract dirt and grime so easily well

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
caress that's because it's made of

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.450 
caress that's because it's made of

about<00:04:08.700> this<00:04:09.060> macbook<00:04:09.480> pro<00:04:09.720> is<00:04:09.870> that<00:04:10.050> the<00:04:10.200> HDMI

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
about this macbook pro is that the HDMI

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.380 
about this macbook pro is that the HDMI
port<00:04:11.190> is<00:04:11.340> only<00:04:11.610> output<00:04:11.940> not<00:04:12.540> input<00:04:12.600> why<00:04:14.390> why

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
port is only output not input why why

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.199 
port is only output not input why why
you<00:04:16.080> put<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.590> hole<00:04:16.860> there<00:04:17.220> obviously<00:04:17.970> things

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
you put the hole there obviously things

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.990 
you put the hole there obviously things
can<00:04:18.510> flow<00:04:18.720> in<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:19.500> out<00:04:19.680> just<00:04:20.610> so<00:04:20.730> you<00:04:20.790> know

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
can flow in and out just so you know

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.700 
can flow in and out just so you know
this<00:04:21.330> doesn't<00:04:21.570> Bend<00:04:21.930> me<00:04:22.080> out<00:04:22.200> of<00:04:22.350> shape<00:04:22.500> that

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
this doesn't Bend me out of shape that

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.920 
this doesn't Bend me out of shape that
much<00:04:22.950> I'm<00:04:23.400> just<00:04:23.730> saying<00:04:24.060> it's<00:04:24.270> reasonable<00:04:24.900> to

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
much I'm just saying it's reasonable to

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.870 
much I'm just saying it's reasonable to
expect<00:04:25.140> that<00:04:25.590> an<00:04:25.830> hdmi<00:04:26.400> port<00:04:26.430> that's

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
expect that an hdmi port that's

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.780 
expect that an hdmi port that's
perfectly<00:04:27.390> functional<00:04:28.050> as<00:04:28.230> an<00:04:28.350> hdmi<00:04:29.010> port<00:04:29.040> can

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
perfectly functional as an hdmi port can

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.570 
perfectly functional as an hdmi port can
support<00:04:30.090> both<00:04:30.300> input<00:04:30.870> and<00:04:30.900> output<00:04:31.740> another

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
support both input and output another

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.370 
support both input and output another
thing<00:04:32.820> i<00:04:32.910> don't<00:04:32.970> like<00:04:33.150> about<00:04:33.300> my<00:04:33.660> macbook<00:04:34.140> pro

when<00:04:48.930> it<00:04:49.020> comes<00:04:49.200> time<00:04:49.440> to<00:04:49.470> replace<00:04:50.250> something

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
when it comes time to replace something

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.210 
when it comes time to replace something
it's<00:04:50.970> not<00:04:51.480> very<00:04:51.900> easily<00:04:52.260> replaceable<00:04:52.860> then

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
it's not very easily replaceable then

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.650 
it's not very easily replaceable then
again<00:04:53.310> throughout<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:53.940> years<00:04:54.150> I<00:04:54.360> haven't

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
again throughout the years I haven't

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.900 
again throughout the years I haven't
done<00:04:54.960> much<00:04:55.200> upgrading<00:04:55.830> of<00:04:55.920> laptop<00:04:56.430> type<00:04:56.730> of

or a risk type of computer I tend to

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.680 
or a risk type of computer I tend to
spec<00:05:19.620> it<00:05:19.740> to<00:05:19.860> the<00:05:19.950> gills<00:05:20.130> if<00:05:20.460> I<00:05:20.670> were<00:05:21.000> to<00:05:21.390> want

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
spec it to the gills if I were to want

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.870 
spec it to the gills if I were to want
to<00:05:22.020> upgrade<00:05:22.200> any<00:05:22.740> component<00:05:23.340> in<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:23.520> system

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
to upgrade any component in the system

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.820 
to upgrade any component in the system
it<00:05:24.090> would<00:05:24.300> most<00:05:24.570> likely<00:05:24.960> be<00:05:25.260> the<00:05:25.290> internal

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
it would most likely be the internal

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.830 
it would most likely be the internal
storage<00:05:26.190> which<00:05:26.370> by<00:05:26.730> the<00:05:26.790> way<00:05:26.910> is<00:05:27.210> a<00:05:27.300> terabyte

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
storage which by the way is a terabyte

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.260 
storage which by the way is a terabyte
SSD<00:05:28.470> so<00:05:28.860> now<00:05:29.040> I've<00:05:29.310> talked<00:05:29.640> about<00:05:29.910> the<00:05:30.060> things

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
SSD so now I've talked about the things

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.060 
SSD so now I've talked about the things
that<00:05:30.330> I<00:05:30.450> like<00:05:30.720> in<00:05:30.900> one<00:05:31.110> video<00:05:31.290> I<00:05:31.500> talked<00:05:31.950> about

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
that I like in one video I talked about

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.740 
that I like in one video I talked about
the<00:05:32.280> things<00:05:32.400> I<00:05:32.580> didn't<00:05:32.880> like<00:05:32.910> in<00:05:33.180> this<00:05:33.360> video<00:05:33.690> I

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
the things I didn't like in this video I

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.510 
the things I didn't like in this video I
purchased<00:05:34.380> it<00:05:34.470> with<00:05:34.530> my<00:05:34.740> own<00:05:34.770> money<00:05:35.220> and

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
purchased it with my own money and

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.610 
purchased it with my own money and
that's<00:05:36.240> pretty<00:05:36.540> much<00:05:36.690> my<00:05:36.930> review<00:05:37.320> of<00:05:37.350> this

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
that's pretty much my review of this

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.800 
that's pretty much my review of this
macbook<00:05:38.130> pro<00:05:38.400> I<00:05:38.640> could<00:05:38.940> find<00:05:39.180> things<00:05:39.480> to<00:05:39.570> like

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
macbook pro I could find things to like

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.930 
macbook pro I could find things to like
and<00:05:40.020> dislike<00:05:40.320> about<00:05:40.470> anything<00:05:41.160> out<00:05:41.640> there<00:05:41.880> I

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
and dislike about anything out there I

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.490 
and dislike about anything out there I
think<00:05:42.060> we<00:05:42.300> all<00:05:42.420> can<00:05:42.660> cuz<00:05:42.900> there's<00:05:43.110> no<00:05:43.260> such

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
think we all can cuz there's no such

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.050 
think we all can cuz there's no such
thing<00:05:43.530> as<00:05:43.890> a<00:05:43.920> perfect<00:05:43.980> product<00:05:44.580> because

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
thing as a perfect product because

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.460 
thing as a perfect product because
what's<00:05:45.270> perfect<00:05:45.630> in<00:05:45.750> tech<00:05:45.960> today<00:05:46.230> is

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
what's perfect in tech today is

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.410 
what's perfect in tech today is
definitely<00:05:47.370> yesterday's<00:05:47.880> news<00:05:48.180> tomorrow

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420 
definitely yesterday's news tomorrow

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.720 
definitely yesterday's news tomorrow
despite<00:05:49.050> the<00:05:49.440> array<00:05:49.680> of<00:05:49.710> shortcomings<00:05:50.430> i

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
despite the array of shortcomings i

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.250 
despite the array of shortcomings i
still<00:05:51.060> believe<00:05:51.210> this<00:05:51.630> is<00:05:51.780> one<00:05:51.960> of<00:05:52.080> the<00:05:52.140> better

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
still believe this is one of the better

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.810 
still believe this is one of the better
computers<00:05:52.770> that<00:05:52.920> I've<00:05:53.070> had<00:05:53.250> a<00:05:53.280> chance<00:05:53.400> to<00:05:53.700> use

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
computers that I've had a chance to use

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.160 
computers that I've had a chance to use
and<00:05:54.210> one<00:05:54.360> of<00:05:54.450> the<00:05:54.510> things<00:05:54.720> that<00:05:54.810> I<00:05:54.930> like<00:05:55.110> about

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.170 
and one of the things that I like about

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.930 
and one of the things that I like about
Apple<00:05:55.710> is<00:05:55.830> it's<00:05:56.040> not<00:05:56.250> just<00:05:56.580> about<00:05:56.700> the

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
Apple is it's not just about the

at the macbook I don't just look at it
as<00:06:06.450> a<00:06:06.480> piece<00:06:06.780> of<00:06:06.810> hardware<00:06:07.500> I<00:06:07.680> look<00:06:08.010> at<00:06:08.160> it<00:06:08.280> as<00:06:08.400> a
