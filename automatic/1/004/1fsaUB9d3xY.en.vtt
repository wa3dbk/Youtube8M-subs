00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.179 
everything is pretty much gonna be the
same<00:01:33.479> roster<00:01:33.689> from<00:01:34.049> more<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.439> come<00:01:34.560> across<00:01:34.829> DC

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
same roster from more to come across DC

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.160 
same roster from more to come across DC
but<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.640> think<00:01:36.630> they're<00:01:36.720> just<00:01:36.750> getting<00:01:37.020> out

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
but I think they're just getting out

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.810 
but I think they're just getting out
these<00:01:37.380> characters<00:01:37.890> out<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.220> way<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.400> then

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
these characters out of the way so then

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.940 
these characters out of the way so then
they<00:01:39.000> can<00:01:39.180> reveal<00:01:39.540> like<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.840> big<00:01:40.110> ones<00:01:40.290> I'm

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
they can reveal like the big ones I'm

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.830 
they can reveal like the big ones I'm
still<00:01:41.250> hoping<00:01:41.520> for<00:01:41.579> maybe<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.180> christmas<00:01:42.720> day

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
still hoping for maybe in christmas day

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.380 
still hoping for maybe in christmas day
they<00:01:42.990> can<00:01:43.049> do<00:01:43.290> captain<00:01:43.979> cold<00:01:44.220> or<00:01:44.579> mr.<00:01:45.090> freeze

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
they can do captain cold or mr. freeze

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.960 
they can do captain cold or mr. freeze
or<00:01:45.720> anybody<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.170> know<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.409> mean<00:01:46.560> eyes<00:01:46.979> somebody

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
or anybody you know I mean eyes somebody

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.520 
or anybody you know I mean eyes somebody
cool<00:01:48.180> because<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.780> know<00:01:48.899> he<00:01:49.140> saw<00:01:49.320> in

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
cool because you know he saw in

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.310 
cool because you know he saw in
beginning<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.979> trailer<00:01:51.020> flash<00:01:52.020> was

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
beginning of the trailer flash was

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.160 
beginning of the trailer flash was
getting<00:01:52.680> hit<00:01:52.829> by<00:01:52.860> icicle<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.759> his<00:01:54.270> enemy<00:01:55.110> is

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
getting hit by icicle and his enemy is

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.330 
getting hit by icicle and his enemy is
Captain<00:01:55.500> Cold<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.009> would<00:01:56.130> be<00:01:56.189> pretty

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
Captain Cold so that would be pretty

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.609 
Captain Cold so that would be pretty
cool<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.790> I've<00:01:57.149> only<00:01:57.329> found<00:01:57.600> one<00:01:57.750> easter<00:01:58.500> egg

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
cool and I've only found one easter egg

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.830 
cool and I've only found one easter egg
guys<00:01:58.829> off<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.549> fists<00:01:59.909> trailer<00:02:00.090> it's<00:02:00.719> not

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
guys off the fists trailer it's not

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.359 
guys off the fists trailer it's not
really<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.110> big<00:02:01.320> easter<00:02:01.710> egg<00:02:01.799> but<00:02:02.009> go<00:02:02.130> ahead<00:02:02.159> and

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
really a big easter egg but go ahead and

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.930 
really a big easter egg but go ahead and
look<00:02:02.430> right<00:02:02.579> there<00:02:02.820> it's<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.210> kryptonite

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
look right there it's a kryptonite

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.210 
look right there it's a kryptonite
in<00:02:05.090> on<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:05.480> map<00:02:05.630> called<00:02:05.840> insurgency<00:02:06.620> which<00:02:07.070> is

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
in on the map called insurgency which is

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.800 
in on the map called insurgency which is
lex<00:02:07.430> luthor's<00:02:07.760> math<00:02:07.940> so<00:02:08.270> if<00:02:08.420> you<00:02:08.510> don't<00:02:08.660> need

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
lex luthor's math so if you don't need

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.290 
lex luthor's math so if you don't need
more<00:02:09.130> proof<00:02:10.130> that<00:02:10.190> Lex<00:02:10.760> Luthor<00:02:11.060> is<00:02:11.120> going<00:02:11.240> to

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
more proof that Lex Luthor is going to

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.340 
more proof that Lex Luthor is going to
be<00:02:11.390> in<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.540> game<00:02:11.690> then<00:02:11.930> I<00:02:12.020> don't<00:02:12.170> know<00:02:12.230> what<00:02:12.320> to

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
be in the game then I don't know what to

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.490 
be in the game then I don't know what to
tell<00:02:12.410> you<00:02:13.240> usually<00:02:14.240> I<00:02:14.420> take<00:02:14.900> these<00:02:15.110> trailers

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
tell you usually I take these trailers

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.170 
tell you usually I take these trailers
and<00:02:15.680> break<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:15.980> down<00:02:16.130> I<00:02:16.370> know<00:02:16.430> I<00:02:16.520> broke<00:02:16.820> out<00:02:16.970> the

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
and break it down I know I broke out the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.050 
and break it down I know I broke out the
develop<00:02:17.990> commentary<00:02:18.830> whatever<00:02:19.160> and<00:02:19.460> I<00:02:19.820> took

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
develop commentary whatever and I took

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.780 
develop commentary whatever and I took
that<00:02:20.360> thing<00:02:20.450> apart<00:02:20.600> so<00:02:21.230> I'm<00:02:22.130> assuming<00:02:22.310> that

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
that thing apart so I'm assuming that

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.400 
that thing apart so I'm assuming that
this<00:02:23.060> trailer<00:02:23.480> they<00:02:23.780> didn't<00:02:23.990> put<00:02:24.140> anything

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
this trailer they didn't put anything

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.260 
this trailer they didn't put anything
they<00:02:24.740> wanted<00:02:25.100> to<00:02:25.250> show<00:02:25.520> like<00:02:25.850> they<00:02:26.060> didn't

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
they wanted to show like they didn't

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.080 
they wanted to show like they didn't
give<00:02:26.420> us<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.900> joker<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.980> Green<00:02:28.160> Lantern<00:02:28.280> Arkham

Asylum map or any new maps watchtower

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.100 
Asylum map or any new maps watchtower
map<00:02:31.580> didn't<00:02:31.910> I<00:02:32.030> guess<00:02:32.480> they're<00:02:32.630> just<00:02:32.660> saving

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110
