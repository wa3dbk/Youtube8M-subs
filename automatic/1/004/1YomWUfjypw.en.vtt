00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
formula and so there was a lot of bottle

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.270 
formula and so there was a lot of bottle
feeding<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.840> addition<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.410> nursing<00:00:47.039> and

nursing or giving him a bottle can take

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.660 
nursing or giving him a bottle can take
20<00:00:51.780> minutes<00:00:51.809> where<00:00:52.379> you're<00:00:52.649> rooted<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
20 minutes where you're rooted to the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.840 
20 minutes where you're rooted to the
spot<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.360> if<00:00:55.020> i<00:00:55.170> had<00:00:55.350> had<00:00:55.460> mother's<00:00:56.460> sword<00:00:56.670> arm

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
spot and if i had had mother's sword arm

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.639 
spot and if i had had mother's sword arm
from<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.149> beginning<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.719> would<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:57.960> been<00:00:58.079> so

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
from the beginning it would have been so

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.099 
from the beginning it would have been so
much<00:00:58.710> easier<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.480> time<00:01:00.690> do<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.930> have<00:01:01.050> to

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
much easier to the time do you have to

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.950 
much easier to the time do you have to
supplement<00:01:01.469> with<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:01.980> bottle<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.640> be<00:01:03.600> able<00:01:03.719> to

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
supplement with a bottle to be able to

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.330 
supplement with a bottle to be able to
use<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.350> arm

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
use the arm

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.749 
use the arm
then<00:01:06.520> frees<00:01:07.149> me<00:01:07.390> up<00:01:07.420> to<00:01:07.600> be<00:01:08.079> able<00:01:08.170> to<00:01:08.759> focus

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
then frees me up to be able to focus

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.359 
then frees me up to be able to focus
more<00:01:10.210> on<00:01:10.240> my<00:01:10.570> older<00:01:10.869> son<00:01:11.079> as<00:01:11.259> well<00:01:11.439> keep<00:01:12.070> an<00:01:12.250> eye

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
more on my older son as well keep an eye

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.599 
more on my older son as well keep an eye
on<00:01:12.399> him<00:01:12.820> who<00:01:13.659> carry<00:01:13.929> his<00:01:14.079> food<00:01:14.380> or<00:01:14.920> even<00:01:15.579> just

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:15.609 
on him who carry his food or even just

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.580 
on him who carry his food or even just
play<00:01:16.179> with<00:01:16.359> him<00:01:16.509> and<00:01:16.719> give<00:01:16.869> him<00:01:16.899> a<00:01:17.020> personal

play with him and give him a personal
attention

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.789 

I<00:01:21.119> think<00:01:22.119> it's<00:01:22.240> definitely<00:01:22.450> something<00:01:23.109> a<00:01:23.409> lot

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
I think it's definitely something a lot

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.160 
I think it's definitely something a lot
of<00:01:23.950> mothers<00:01:24.460> can<00:01:24.729> use<00:01:24.939> especially<00:01:25.600> if<00:01:26.020> you

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
of mothers can use especially if you

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.969 
of mothers can use especially if you
have<00:01:26.200> more<00:01:27.130> than<00:01:27.189> one<00:01:27.369> child<00:01:28.679> you<00:01:29.679> never<00:01:29.890> know

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
have more than one child you never know

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.980 
have more than one child you never know
what<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.490> older<00:01:30.759> ones<00:01:30.939> going<00:01:31.240> to<00:01:31.299> run<00:01:31.780> off<00:01:31.960> and

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
what the older ones going to run off and

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.289 
what the older ones going to run off and
get<00:01:32.560> into<00:01:32.950> while<00:01:33.310> you're<00:01:33.549> rooted<00:01:34.060> to<00:01:34.179> the<00:01:34.210> spot

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
get into while you're rooted to the spot

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.809 
get into while you're rooted to the spot
feeding<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.049> baby<00:01:35.259> so<00:01:35.740> I<00:01:35.770> definitely<00:01:36.490> think

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:36.819 
feeding the baby so I definitely think

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:38.789 
feeding the baby so I definitely think
it's<00:01:37.060> something<00:01:37.299> a<00:01:37.600> lot<00:01:37.780> of<00:01:37.929> mothers<00:01:38.229> can<00:01:38.619> pay

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
it's something a lot of mothers can pay

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.279 
it's something a lot of mothers can pay
you<00:01:38.860> good<00:01:39.219> use<00:01:39.399> out<00:01:39.549> of<00:01:42.630> at<00:01:43.630> least<00:01:43.840> three<00:01:44.170> or
