 players did not become the first 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.679

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.899
 Live throwing a door facing 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.670

 at the end of the tie at 0 that was still in the 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.600

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.750
 players came to Zaragoza 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.209
 they also knew how to mount the cons but 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.740
 this time he had an error stolen 

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:27.140
 the sergio lozano ball put him at 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.609
 second suit and there was bill of 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.679

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:35.780

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:55.579
 only one goal in the score 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.890
 finally we would see up to 9 in this 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:00.229
 great match but with 10 it was reached 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.149
 Rest advantage for FC Barcelona 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.399
 the game followed the chances and 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.770
 he also had something to say umacon 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.629
 zaragoza in that arrival and in that shot 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.120
 that paco sedano takes the hobby in the 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.129
 grada of both Zaragoza and 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.139
 fc.barcelona more on this occasion the 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:15.920
 zaragoza but also the hobby of 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:17.360
 barça 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.310
 encouraging his people and arriving 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.110
 quickly the second goal there is the 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.720
 Fernandao's move and that heel is 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.430
 here is again the repetition as it is 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.500
 the own fernando that begins the play 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.260
 the pass that gives it to sergio lozano 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.630
 double easy easy easy play for 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.060
 the FC Barcelona that hit the post and that 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.430
 Arturo entered that he could not do anything and 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.319
 the zaragoza that lost 0-2 in this 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.880
 party more chances more shots there 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.620

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.940
 entry also in this second part and 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.310

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.230
 is the goal of aicardo of the player of 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.299
 gaditano and the fc.barcelona of the only 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.440
 sign this season of aicardo that 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.470
 would mark the first one in your account 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.269
 particular with this left-handed and we see the 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.910
 repeat as it is repositioned 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.250
 it is not exploded and as the screw with no 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.930
 they can get to arturo that even 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.640
 strip for the opposite side followed the 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.519
 occasions the set-piece play and the 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.230
 golazo go golazo of lush as the 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.810
 they put and especially like the pizza in that 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.030
 first I loosen lush the player of the fc 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.130
 barcelona and is how it breaks and how 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.810
 puts the first goal this shot is perfect 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.550
 the first feint as it is called of the 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.100
 two players if he puts her to the squad 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.990
 in a ball that meant 04 more 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.880
 arturo occasions of course also 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.800
 he had to do his own he had to 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.260
 take balls prevent the chances and 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.330
 there 's that double arturo stop for 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.660
 a magician the zaragoza more occasions played 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.640
 already from 5 mayor Zaragoza because I knew that 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.370
 if there were any because he had to come back 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.750
 this match could only be when 5 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.400
 the instructions there are of marc 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.160
 Carmona could not escape this match 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.770
 the coach of FC Barcelona balls 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.810
 stolen and again on one occasion in a 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.360
 exit to the counter that fails to perform 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.580
 a thug zaragoza arrives 05 arrives the 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.560
 chance and the shot of aicardo again 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.030
 with the left leg and thistle that puts 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.040
 that value throughout the squadron after 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.560
 of the theft of sergio lozano the best 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.170
 player no doubt this match was still 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.360
 playing of 5 umacon zaragoza and in this 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.420
 play marks the goal of honor marks the 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.920
 first the chip goal or that good pass 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.810
 that good team and especially that good 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.940
 heel with which to close the play and 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.030
 is the repetition will welcome or not 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.389
 comes to that play and played 5 and what 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.569
 toward 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.159
 well the whole team but the goal that 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.900
 he served for much remained just a 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:35.120
 minute and a half and some more goal had to 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.490
 fall on all this of Miguel what 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.749
 celebrated with his hobby he knew he did not 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.120
 was going to do this goal a lot to the team 

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:42.560
 but you had to mark it and you had to 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.020
 be there in this first game of 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.029
 quarterfinals of the cup of Spain 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.189
 futsal followed the chances 50 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:51.800
 seconds to the end and there's another 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:54.020
 time bill to do 26 to leave 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.330
 in the goalie player and put it with the 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.430
 left leg and there's the play and there 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.610
 there is the weak precise sense that 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.110
 turned the 26 on the scoreboard almost is 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.479
 about to reach the defense of zaragoza 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.129
 but in the end is the shot gets in and 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.960
 there were only 25 seconds of match left 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:11.180
 but I still had to get one more goal 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.580
 the goal of sergio lozano of course 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.500
 sergio lozano that marked the second in 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.990
 your particular account and how not always 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.419
 with a double penalty right leg and the 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.759
 ball is there that sent it to the bottom 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:25.069
 of the party network that ended the 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:27.189
 victory and the semifinals for the fc 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:27.189
 Barcelona
