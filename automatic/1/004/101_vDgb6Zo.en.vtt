at<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.920> controller<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.759> wish<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.180> controller

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
at the controller I wish the controller

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.469 
at the controller I wish the controller
was<00:01:18.750> red<00:01:19.159> because<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.460> makes<00:01:20.909> sense<00:01:21.180> as<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
was red because it makes sense as the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.880 
was red because it makes sense as the
controller<00:01:21.869> was<00:01:22.049> ready<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.350> kind<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.650> match

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
controller was ready to kind of match

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.310 
controller was ready to kind of match
the<00:01:22.920> console<00:01:23.580> well<00:01:23.790> but<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.630> what<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.930> it

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
the console well but it is what it is it

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.050 
the console well but it is what it is it
still<00:01:25.860> looks<00:01:25.890> stunning<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:26.580> different

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
still looks stunning it's different

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.280 
still looks stunning it's different
though<00:01:27.210> because<00:01:27.330> we<00:01:27.540> already<00:01:27.689> have<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.049> red

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
though because we already have a red

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.990 
though because we already have a red
controller<00:01:28.590> already<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.250> I'm<00:01:29.579> pretty<00:01:29.790> sure

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
controller already so I'm pretty sure

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.819 
controller already so I'm pretty sure
they<00:01:30.119> don't<00:01:30.329> want<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.540> release<00:01:30.810> another<00:01:31.049> red

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829
