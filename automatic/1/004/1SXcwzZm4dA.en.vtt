00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.900

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
yeah I'm not going to mess with some of

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.090 
yeah I'm not going to mess with some of
the<00:00:32.000> other<00:00:32.090> floors<00:00:32.450> I<00:00:32.840> don't<00:00:32.990> feel<00:00:33.140> I<00:00:33.410> probably

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
the other floors I don't feel I probably

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.740 
the other floors I don't feel I probably
lost<00:00:35.020> so<00:00:36.020> many<00:00:36.080> floors

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.830 

I<00:00:40.520> think<00:00:41.520> it's<00:00:41.610> kind<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.820> ridiculous<00:00:42.000> how<00:00:42.660> many

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
I think it's kind of ridiculous how many

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.400 
I think it's kind of ridiculous how many
angels<00:00:43.110> were<00:00:43.530> at<00:00:43.650> the<00:00:44.239> in<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.330> last<00:00:45.540> video<00:00:45.840> and

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
angels were at the in the last video and

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.500 
angels were at the in the last video and
that<00:00:46.590> cutscene<00:00:47.070> because<00:00:47.970> if<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.210> remember

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
that cutscene because if you remember

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.380 
that cutscene because if you remember
the<00:00:48.780> show<00:00:49.080> they<00:00:49.620> had<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.220> much<00:00:50.460> trouble<00:00:50.760> three

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
the show they had so much trouble three

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.630 
the show they had so much trouble three
against<00:00:52.350> one<00:00:52.680> 0l<00:00:53.989> i<00:00:54.989> believe<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.559> was<00:00:55.680> he<00:00:56.610> took

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
against one 0l i believe it was he took

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.420 
against one 0l i believe it was he took
down<00:00:57.030> like<00:00:57.330> all<00:00:57.540> three<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.020> them<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.470> then<00:00:59.190> Ava

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
down like all three of them and then Ava

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.630 
down like all three of them and then Ava
one<00:00:59.760> had<00:00:59.970> to<00:01:00.030> turn<00:01:00.239> like<00:01:00.420> berserk<00:01:00.900> mode<00:01:01.199> and

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
one had to turn like berserk mode and

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.729 
one had to turn like berserk mode and
end<00:01:02.640> up<00:01:02.970> costing<00:01:03.180> shinji<00:01:03.900> is<00:01:03.960> like<00:01:04.170> humanity

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
end up costing shinji is like humanity

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.460 
end up costing shinji is like humanity
for<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.369> one<00:01:05.550> part<00:01:05.900> until<00:01:06.900> they<00:01:07.050> could<00:01:07.320> bring

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
for that one part until they could bring

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:17.330 
for that one part until they could bring
him<00:01:07.650> back<00:01:07.830> from<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.160> Ava<00:01:09.440> Chrissy<00:01:10.440> one

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.060 

yeah<00:01:18.340> so<00:01:18.700> I<00:01:18.730> think<00:01:18.880> it's<00:01:19.150> kind<00:01:19.300> of<00:01:19.390> crazy<00:01:19.630> and

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
yeah so I think it's kind of crazy and

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.480 
yeah so I think it's kind of crazy and
Kinski<00:01:21.180> tends<00:01:22.180> to<00:01:22.390> get<00:01:22.600> to<00:01:22.900> the<00:01:23.530> prototype<00:01:24.250> you

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
Kinski tends to get to the prototype you

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.540 
Kinski tends to get to the prototype you
can<00:01:25.390> get<00:01:25.540> a<00:01:25.570> regular<00:01:26.020> one<00:01:26.170> it's<00:01:26.950> a<00:01:27.100> prototype

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.560 

yeah<00:01:30.550> but<00:01:30.730> I<00:01:30.760> guess<00:01:30.940> it's<00:01:31.120> the<00:01:31.180> best<00:01:31.390> they

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
yeah but I guess it's the best they

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.460 
yeah but I guess it's the best they
could<00:01:31.630> do<00:01:31.960> since<00:01:32.350> I<00:01:33.600> mean<00:01:34.600> this<00:01:34.690> isn't<00:01:34.930> I<00:01:35.200> mean

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
could do since I mean this isn't I mean

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.880 
could do since I mean this isn't I mean
to<00:01:35.710> my<00:01:35.890> knowledge<00:01:36.160> this<00:01:36.460> isn't<00:01:36.820> made<00:01:37.030> by<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
to my knowledge this isn't made by the

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.750
