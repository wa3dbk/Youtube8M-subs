00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.660
 wedge repeated the sampaio 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.279
 and then in your opinion here this time 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.470
 that she knew the group of young monica and 31 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:19.300
 this issue here that did not wake up much 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.280
 well the protagonists but it was a good 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.350
 lesson divide by 2 here in my 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.060
 opinion should be called boys and 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.170
 Girls, I think it would be a good name. 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.630
 this issue thing 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.010
 she addressed the difference between men 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.390
 and the women were very cool this 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.430
 editing here causes this 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.260
 and finally decided to risk and 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.699
 finish with 11 of the classic dating 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.739
 This was very good, huh? 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:41.590
 well this edition here as on the cover already says 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.020
 on the cover it looks like the flesh of the tite and nest 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.720
 this issue is going to address the end of 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.160
 Tite's relationship and weed that is 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.239
 a classic case for a house lock 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.820
 from the start 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.950
 see the class of the classic young monica 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.809
 meat in a doorway and even pepper 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.840
 that these business to generate more 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.790
 controversy and it's monica stayed a little bit 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.410
 Mass on this edition onion appeared until 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.610
 more so that the case does not appear until 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.130
 more than the moniker in my 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.320
 opinion to magali was also mail missa 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.880
 this issue here then was not a 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.619
 exception of feeling the protagonists 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.450
 appeared the focus was on the 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.280
 secondary characters and was a time 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.650
 and is even approaching a character 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.150
 and well in this edition shows the 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.760
 end of the relationship and how that 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.100
 people can address this in their 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.689
 life as that happens 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.310
 well you see that most of the times 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.430
 girls are the people who suffer the most 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.930
 first after first with 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.210
 men look good but then with the 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.950
 How long have you been feeling the car? 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.259
 began to feel the one who began to 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.939
 to make bad prize also approached us 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.560
 that most of the conflicts in a 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.270
 dating happens in the house mainly 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.759
 with the girls playing too much without 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.009
 to make certain things go there speak one 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.869
 thing that has hardly ever happened and 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.520
 she imagines things too much 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.979
 the boys because they try to hide the 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.090
 girls things and then it will definitely go 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.710
 generate controversy 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.600
 another thing that also 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.070
 was the difference of friends so of the 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.470
 boys and girls and girls are 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.729
 together try to help as much as possible 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.040
 already men are completely 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.319
 different each stay in yours and you 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.329
 have to give a conversation you finish 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.599
 my family there is something finished and such 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:14.950
 it 's not so over so together so 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.590
 great with girls are 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.390
 but come edit basically starts phone 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.099
 and ending with tite because she thought 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.170
 that was behind was not something that 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.840
 unfortunately it was not happening or 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.090
 thankfully it was not happening either 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.010
 and that's when you got that thing. 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.349
 where I was hiding some things 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.630
 she was exchanging messages she keeps 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.269
 girl and then of course if the film will 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.459
 hit will roll loose and there the nub 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.049
 thought I was training well this way 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.709
 that he end a relationship with 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:46.599
 line was kind of me 70% of the edition 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.910
 melancholic depression is not holding 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.989
 things have been deceiving me sad to 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.819
 damn because had finished 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.349
 relationship she could not 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.610
 imagine otherwise than in the 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.870
 strawberry with tite 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.510
 the accounts hell with 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.579
 almost 70% of the edition is lost in 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.870
 relationship even the tite shortly after 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.239
 ended up with a character right up there 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.019
 pollution that seemed ancient to 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.750
 everything is on the side 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.120
 That was kind of that fame came about 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.190
 of the tite wins without counting that the tite 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.650
 also starts dating the flesh are the 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.959
 meat that is one of the most 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.060
 pretty in lemon tree does not consider magali 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.130
 but meat is also considered one of the 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.959
 most beautiful girls on the property in the face 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.459
 everything is crazy because it reminds 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.410
 the tite began to think why then 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.900
 I was dating she was telling 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.130
 with jealousy and such and such face to face 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.109
 is considered one of the most 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.090
 of the lemon tree 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.590
 since the classic cool thing I 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.600
 I also really liked this edition. 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.190
 what kind was the recovery line was 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.470
 show how a person can 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.209
 to recover quickly from one of a 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.370
 a relationship dating back to a relationship is 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.069
 only you try to focus on something else only 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.410
 If you must think about someone else, it's you. 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.060
 Have you got to focus on another? 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.799
 You keep thinking about the same person. 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.810
 you will be sad the same way and 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.060
 You have to look for another one in 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.370
 another job not arrange jobs SRTE the 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.340
 nor employment thinking have to look for a 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.750
 job is emptying the mind about that. 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.090
 another thing that was also very cool 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.310
 this edition was to see what kind the tite did not 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.139
 supporting the meat more because meat 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.790
 has that little patricinha that can 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:15.220
 talk on the phone and something 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.109
 I turn and is speaking at all for nothing and 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.660
 even inside the cinema was born talking 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.940
 on the cell phone guy here was disappointment to 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.430
 Here the tite will try to get a date, but 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.830
 with this is in the new and had the edition and 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.080
 that he ended up with 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.909
 She does not want to nurse because she 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.800
 really forgot the possible author of 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:34.020
 mouth life and this will be shown in 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.969
 editions on the front then here 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.189
 time line and different size 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:40.560
 fun in a way I remember that in the 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:42.090
 edition of the games tournament year until you 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.110
 do not judge the games in the videogame 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.669
 as such 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.620
 so every time, the granddaughter in a way 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.270
 different in an edition and was the first 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.270
 time they finally resolved 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.370
 ending with the classic couples was a 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.800
 good experience and got well and finished 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.229
 with this couple here that I did not even care 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.690
 very much with this couple but it was not a good one 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.729
 experience for him has taken well to the end 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.530
 of a relationship but berdych is this 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.270
 Did you like the video editing? 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.860
 please leave not give joinha down 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.629
 subscribe to the channel was also not 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.409
 miss the next videos you asked 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:12.479
 to the cidh here 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:15.270
 soon I want to do this are 63 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:17.610
 It's also tricky to leave but we'll see if 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.659
 what will happen and this was one 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.879
 very good condition 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:22.529
 the considered measurement that I prefer - 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:24.120
 I would rather have the title changed 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:27.949
 but then when I was thank you for the 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.949
 Then he said that such
