00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.300
 hi friends 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.980
 extract with a solution in the part of 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.719
 electricity 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.719
 I already have a block prepared 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:25.160
 chaves combined 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:28.360
 how to go to a room 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.810
 enter and turn it off at the other end 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.870
 of the room response 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:40.329
 how to make it very simple in this way 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:42.570
 0 point has 123 terminals of the two 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.570
 sides 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.280
 one terminal to the other 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.829
 and at both ends the two terminals 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:58.140
 that go from the outside those two 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.140
 directly connected to each other 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.980
 in a 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.980
 is connected 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.830
 in the center directly to the 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.830
 feeding the positive 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.270
 in the other the lampholder comes out 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.509
 to the positive 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.460
 in positive 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:29.760
 forever 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:33.060
 in the lamp holder should go 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.020
 in the center in the middle the positive in 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.939
 the means because 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.329
 because one day we want to go and change a 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.329
 little bit 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.610
 it's from the outside that first thing 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.799
 we make is to touch the sheet at 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.810
 I touched sheet is not going to give a discharge 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.840
 electric 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.670
 Positive pressure has to go 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.670
 in the center 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.020
 at the other end 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:07.120
 to the center of the lamp amount and the one 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.120
 it's from the outside it's going to more 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:17.170
 positive the center 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.349
 the two extremes 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:24.780
 of the terminals are joined together and in 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.780
 the other portal in the other 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.580
 of the half-finished record that the 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:32.630
 medium 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.630
 to the positive 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.340
 and the outside of the lamp 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.010
 to so negative 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.760
 simple 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.930
 but defeated to serve there 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.270
 they have not understood it is not difficult 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.960
 so 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.960
 See you later
