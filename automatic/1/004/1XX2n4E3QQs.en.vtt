00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.040 
waste them so yeah to macro only reason
why<00:04:49.340> we<00:04:49.460> have<00:04:49.580> to<00:04:49.760> macro<00:04:50.240> and<00:04:50.570> three<00:04:50.840> deep

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
why we have to macro and three deep

why we have to macro and three deep
jeethu<00:04:51.800> ship<00:04:52.010> is<00:04:52.280> because<00:04:53.120> they<00:04:53.270> can<00:04:53.420> warning

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
jeethu ship is because they can warning

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.260 
jeethu ship is because they can warning
macro<00:04:54.170> and<00:04:54.670> we<00:04:55.670> don't<00:04:55.820> really<00:04:55.940> want<00:04:56.180> that

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
macro and we don't really want that

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.350
