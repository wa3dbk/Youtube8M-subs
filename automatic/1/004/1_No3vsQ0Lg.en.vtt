Lightroom<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.440> video<00:00:34.590> though<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:34.950> really

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.510 
I didn't explain why you might want to
switch<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> different<00:00:40.230> process<00:00:40.890> engine<00:00:41.340> in

00:00:46.099 --> 00:00:46.109 
one example why you might want to try a

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:49.040 
one example why you might want to try a
different<00:00:46.190> process<00:00:47.190> engine<00:00:47.670> for<00:00:48.539> an<00:00:48.629> example

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
different process engine for an example

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.470 
different process engine for an example
I<00:00:49.410> have<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.219> image<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.699> this<00:00:50.879> castle<00:00:51.359> that's

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
I have this image of this castle that's

in Central Park in New York City and as

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.209 
in Central Park in New York City and as
you<00:00:54.090> could<00:00:54.269> see<00:00:54.480> it's<00:00:54.719> terribly<00:00:55.320> underexposed

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
you could see it's terribly underexposed

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.549 
you could see it's terribly underexposed
and<00:00:56.820> what<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.030> did<00:00:57.300> was<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.480> made<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.839> virtual<00:00:58.320> copy

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
and what I did was I made a virtual copy

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.470 
and what I did was I made a virtual copy
so<00:00:58.980> right<00:00:59.190> next<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.059> exact

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
so right next to it I have the exact

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.869 
so right next to it I have the exact
same<00:01:00.600> image<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.949> we're<00:01:02.100> gonna<00:01:02.219> be<00:01:02.460> doing<00:01:02.760> this

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
same image so we're gonna be doing this

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.450 
same image so we're gonna be doing this
work<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.329> same<00:01:03.719> image<00:01:04.170> just<00:01:04.980> one<00:01:05.190> is<00:01:05.339> going

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
work on the same image just one is going

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.300 
work on the same image just one is going
to<00:01:05.519> be<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> virtual<00:01:06.120> copy<00:01:06.360> now<00:01:07.130> first<00:01:08.130> thing

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
to be a virtual copy now first thing

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.650 
to be a virtual copy now first thing
you're<00:01:08.460> gonna<00:01:08.520> think<00:01:08.880> right<00:01:09.060> we<00:01:09.210> need<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.480> open

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
you're gonna think right we need to open

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.230 
you're gonna think right we need to open
up<00:01:09.750> these<00:01:09.930> shadows<00:01:10.350> right<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:11.190> we'll<00:01:12.030> go<00:01:12.210> to

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
up these shadows right so we'll go to

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.070 
up these shadows right so we'll go to
the<00:01:13.050> basic<00:01:13.530> panel<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.570> we'll<00:01:15.570> go<00:01:15.690> down<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
the basic panel and we'll go down to the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.190 
the basic panel and we'll go down to the
shadows<00:01:16.500> tab<00:01:17.130> or<00:01:17.670> slider<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.450> should<00:01:18.720> say<00:01:18.960> and

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
shadows tab or slider I should say and

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.080 
shadows tab or slider I should say and
we'll<00:01:19.380> move<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.010> right<00:01:20.160> now<00:01:20.730> you<00:01:20.760> can

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
we'll move that to the right now you can

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.330 
we'll move that to the right now you can
see<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.360> opened<00:01:21.660> up<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.870> shadows<00:01:22.260> okay<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.100> if

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
see it opened up the shadows okay but if

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.860 
see it opened up the shadows okay but if
you<00:01:23.520> look<00:01:23.700> at<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> image<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.330> kind<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.750> this

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
you look at the image it kind of is this

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.800 
you look at the image it kind of is this
weird<00:01:25.340> kind<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.430> tone<00:01:26.700> map<00:01:27.000> look<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.510> it<00:01:27.630> that's

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
weird kind of tone map look to it that's

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.040 
weird kind of tone map look to it that's
like<00:01:27.960> an<00:01:28.080> HDR<00:01:28.560> look<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:30.390> wasn't<00:01:30.900> an

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
like an HDR look to it and it wasn't an

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.680 
like an HDR look to it and it wasn't an
HDR<00:01:31.470> shot<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:32.100> shot<00:01:32.370> it<00:01:32.520> with<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> Fuji<00:01:33.180> xt-1

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
HDR shot I shot it with a Fuji xt-1

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.380 
HDR shot I shot it with a Fuji xt-1
camera<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.230> was<00:01:34.350> 1<00:01:34.640> mm<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.760> hundreds<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.300> a

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
camera it was 1 mm to hundreds of a

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.250 
camera it was 1 mm to hundreds of a
second<00:01:36.840> at<00:01:36.990> f/11<00:01:37.320> ISO<00:01:38.130> 200<00:01:38.910> with<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> 23<00:01:40.050> million

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
second at f/11 ISO 200 with a 23 million

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.310 
second at f/11 ISO 200 with a 23 million
millimeter<00:01:40.890> lens<00:01:41.160> just<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.940> single<00:01:42.330> shot<00:01:42.600> so

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
millimeter lens just a single shot so

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.050 
millimeter lens just a single shot so
you<00:01:43.410> can<00:01:43.560> see<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.860> just<00:01:44.070> has<00:01:44.400> this<00:01:44.550> kind<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.880> odd

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
you can see it just has this kind of odd

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.900 
you can see it just has this kind of odd
look<00:01:45.660> to<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.990> what<00:01:46.650> a<00:01:46.680> lot<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:46.950> professional

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
look to it what a lot of professional

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.580 
look to it what a lot of professional
photographers<00:01:48.030> do<00:01:48.690> if<00:01:48.810> they<00:01:48.960> have<00:01:49.200> an<00:01:49.350> image

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
photographers do if they have an image

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.580 
photographers do if they have an image
where<00:01:49.800> they<00:01:49.920> have<00:01:50.130> really<00:01:50.990> you<00:01:51.990> know<00:01:52.020> shadows

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
where they have really you know shadows

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.930 
where they have really you know shadows
that<00:01:52.740> are<00:01:52.860> just<00:01:53.190> so<00:01:53.460> dark

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
that are just so dark

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.060 
that are just so dark
they'll<00:01:54.390> try<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> different<00:01:55.260> process<00:01:55.740> engine

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
they'll try a different process engine

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.110 
they'll try a different process engine
and<00:01:56.190> we're<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.490> do<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.760> on<00:01:56.940> this

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
and we're going to do that on this

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.270 
and we're going to do that on this
virtual<00:01:57.330> copy<00:01:57.870> so<00:01:58.620> we're<00:01:58.740> gonna<00:01:58.830> close<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
virtual copy so we're gonna close the

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.650 
virtual copy so we're gonna close the
basic<00:01:59.610> panel<00:01:59.790> we're<00:01:59.970> gonna<00:02:00.060> go<00:02:00.240> down<00:02:00.390> here<00:02:00.630> to

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
basic panel we're gonna go down here to

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.170 
basic panel we're gonna go down here to
camera<00:02:01.140> calibration<00:02:01.490> now<00:02:02.490> those<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.000> that

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
camera calibration now those of you that

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.590 
camera calibration now those of you that
didn't<00:02:03.540> see<00:02:03.840> episode<00:02:04.410> 16<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.600> process

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
didn't see episode 16 the process

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.270 
didn't see episode 16 the process
engines<00:02:06.960> right<00:02:07.170> here<00:02:07.380> where<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.560> says<00:02:07.590> process

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
engines right here where it says process

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.380 
engines right here where it says process
and<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.489> can<00:02:08.610> see<00:02:08.759> there's<00:02:08.970> three<00:02:09.209> different

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
and you can see there's three different

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.430 
and you can see there's three different
ones<00:02:09.690> 2010<00:02:10.319> 12<00:02:10.769> 2010<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.700> 2003<00:02:12.480> what<00:02:13.080> this<00:02:13.260> is

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
ones 2010 12 2010 and 2003 what this is

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.670 
ones 2010 12 2010 and 2003 what this is
is<00:02:13.590> over<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.950> years<00:02:14.269> Lightroom<00:02:15.269> has<00:02:15.680> changed

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
is over the years Lightroom has changed

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.810 
is over the years Lightroom has changed
the<00:02:16.860> algorithms<00:02:17.580> that<00:02:18.090> are<00:02:18.150> used<00:02:18.629> to<00:02:19.820> process

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
the algorithms that are used to process

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.450 
the algorithms that are used to process
your<00:02:21.330> image<00:02:21.630> your<00:02:22.320> images<00:02:22.800> your<00:02:23.160> image

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
your image your images your image

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.400 
your image your images your image
whatever<00:02:24.330> they've<00:02:24.720> changed<00:02:25.110> these

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
whatever they've changed these

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.330 
whatever they've changed these
algorithms

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
algorithms

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.580 
algorithms
so<00:02:26.730> they've<00:02:26.940> updated<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.599> process<00:02:28.080> engine

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
so they've updated the process engine

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.589 
so they've updated the process engine
over<00:02:29.010> these<00:02:29.190> years<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:31.670> from<00:02:32.670> Lightroom<00:02:32.940> four

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
over these years and from Lightroom four

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.949 
over these years and from Lightroom four
on<00:02:33.959> up<00:02:35.000> they've<00:02:36.000> been<00:02:36.180> using<00:02:36.420> what<00:02:36.810> they're

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
on up they've been using what they're

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.589 
on up they've been using what they're
calling<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.440> 2012<00:02:38.130> process<00:02:38.670> engine<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:39.360> like

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
calling the 2012 process engine so like

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.559 
calling the 2012 process engine so like
them<00:02:39.750> four<00:02:40.020> or<00:02:40.110> five<00:02:40.319> six<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:40.980> CC<00:02:41.459> prior<00:02:42.360> to

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
them four or five six and CC prior to

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.300 
them four or five six and CC prior to
that<00:02:42.780> they've<00:02:43.140> used<00:02:43.170> either<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.160> other

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
that they've used either of the other

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.430 
that they've used either of the other
two<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.700> know<00:02:44.970> in<00:02:45.180> Lightroom<00:02:45.510> three<00:02:45.959> they<00:02:46.260> used

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
two I know in Lightroom three they used

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.309 
two I know in Lightroom three they used
the<00:02:46.650> 2010<00:02:47.340> process<00:02:48.030> engine<00:02:48.420> so<00:02:49.080> we're<00:02:49.200> gonna

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
the 2010 process engine so we're gonna

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.199 
the 2010 process engine so we're gonna
use<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:49.860> I'm<00:02:50.220> gonna<00:02:50.370> click<00:02:50.610> on<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:50.819> and

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
use that I'm gonna click on that and

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.880 
use that I'm gonna click on that and
right<00:02:51.780> away<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.019> can<00:02:52.200> see<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.500> image<00:02:52.709> got

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
right away you can see the image got

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.979 
right away you can see the image got
darker<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:53.880> we're<00:02:54.090> going<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.390> opposite<00:02:54.810> way

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
darker so we're going the opposite way

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.949 
darker so we're going the opposite way
you<00:02:55.050> look<00:02:55.440> at<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.650> 2012<00:02:56.120> then<00:02:57.120> we<00:02:57.209> go<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.330> 2010

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
you look at the 2012 then we go to 2010

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.590 
you look at the 2012 then we go to 2010
and<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:58.830> can<00:02:58.950> see<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.250> got<00:02:59.400> darker<00:02:59.910> we're

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
and you can see it got darker we're

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.180 
and you can see it got darker we're
gonna<00:03:00.720> go<00:03:00.900> up<00:03:00.989> to<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.200> basic<00:03:01.560> panel<00:03:01.890> now<00:03:02.040> and

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
gonna go up to the basic panel now and

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.020 
gonna go up to the basic panel now and
you're<00:03:02.280> gonna<00:03:02.400> see<00:03:02.640> there's<00:03:02.819> some

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
you're gonna see there's some

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.870 
you're gonna see there's some
differences<00:03:03.780> here<00:03:03.890> we're<00:03:04.890> not<00:03:05.069> we're<00:03:05.489> missing

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
differences here we're not we're missing

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.280 
differences here we're not we're missing
the<00:03:06.150> shadows<00:03:06.860> highlights<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.430> white<00:03:09.360> slider

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
the shadows highlights and white slider

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.380 
the shadows highlights and white slider
you<00:03:10.709> can<00:03:10.739> see<00:03:11.010> we<00:03:11.160> just<00:03:11.190> have<00:03:11.459> now<00:03:11.790> recovery

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
you can see we just have now recovery

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.530 
you can see we just have now recovery
fill<00:03:13.080> light<00:03:13.349> and<00:03:13.620> brightness<00:03:14.099> in<00:03:14.549> their<00:03:14.970> place

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
fill light and brightness in their place

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.650 
fill light and brightness in their place
now<00:03:16.500> for<00:03:17.400> this<00:03:17.549> image<00:03:17.880> we<00:03:18.150> need<00:03:18.269> some<00:03:18.480> fill

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
now for this image we need some fill

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.589 
now for this image we need some fill
light<00:03:18.870> we<00:03:19.019> have<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.560> fill<00:03:20.310> in<00:03:20.580> all<00:03:21.060> this<00:03:21.299> dark

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
light we have to fill in all this dark

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.240 
light we have to fill in all this dark
area<00:03:21.840> here<00:03:22.200> so<00:03:22.230> we're<00:03:22.440> gonna<00:03:22.560> take<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:22.950> fill

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
area here so we're gonna take the fill

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.800 
area here so we're gonna take the fill
light<00:03:23.489> slider<00:03:23.819> and<00:03:24.090> move<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.360> all<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.510> way<00:03:24.750> to

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
light slider and move it all the way to

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.890 
light slider and move it all the way to
the<00:03:24.989> right<00:03:25.310> now<00:03:26.310> if<00:03:26.700> you<00:03:27.150> look<00:03:27.330> at<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.599> image

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
the right now if you look at the image

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.630 
the right now if you look at the image
and<00:03:28.140> then<00:03:28.349> we<00:03:28.440> compare<00:03:28.890> it<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.310> prior

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
and then we compare it to the prior

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.569 
and then we compare it to the prior
image<00:03:30.269> you<00:03:31.230> can<00:03:31.380> see<00:03:31.560> how<00:03:31.709> this<00:03:31.859> looks<00:03:31.920> flatter

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
image you can see how this looks flatter

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.759 
image you can see how this looks flatter
and<00:03:32.850> as<00:03:32.940> his<00:03:33.150> day<00:03:33.329> I'm<00:03:33.810> gonna<00:03:34.049> call<00:03:34.440> it<00:03:34.590> that

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
and as his day I'm gonna call it that

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.840 
and as his day I'm gonna call it that
HDR<00:03:35.459> tone<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:36.239> it<00:03:36.450> this<00:03:37.320> one<00:03:37.560> looks<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.370> me<00:03:38.579> a

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
HDR tone to it this one looks to me a

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.759 
HDR tone to it this one looks to me a
little<00:03:39.269> more<00:03:39.420> realistic<00:03:39.750> now<00:03:40.109> I<00:03:40.140> admit<00:03:40.590> this

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
little more realistic now I admit this

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.789 
little more realistic now I admit this
is<00:03:40.980> subjective<00:03:41.640> I<00:03:41.910> like<00:03:42.600> it<00:03:42.780> better<00:03:42.959> you<00:03:43.560> might

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
is subjective I like it better you might

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.120 
is subjective I like it better you might
not<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.220> might<00:03:44.250> prefer<00:03:44.810> this<00:03:45.810> one<00:03:46.019> but<00:03:46.950> what<00:03:47.100> I

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
not you might prefer this one but what I
