 welcome you with this video 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.779
 new format for our project 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.490
 to be allowed to introduce 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.470
 with the interview format we try 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.030
 in charlene regular intervals the 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.650
 opinion of the population in relation 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.230
 on various socio-critical 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.430
 Administrator and especially the opinion of 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.739
 to discuss muslims 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.890
 we also hope for that at the same time 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.990
 of course, a contribution to the campaign 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.850
 to be able to work together against incitement 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.170
 the topic of today is the same 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.300
 role of the media in relation to the 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.160
 cohabitation of people and to what extent 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.570
 the picture which currently about islam 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.670
 is drawn with the reality 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.900
 agrees to this point 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.580
 Of course I also like all ours 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.159
 Thank you and your partner 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.040
 if there are on the one hand and suggestions 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.330
 for others , please write 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.430
 were down in the comments 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.799
 that was my side of salam 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.799
 alaikum and bye until next time 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.930
 yes, of course, so I personally have 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.580
 no problems with those so I am 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.350
 I grew up here myself 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.000
 recently gone to school to 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.910
 I have whole people in the environment 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.640
 actually no problems at all good 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.500
 at the moment as well even if other people 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.840
 I have another saying I do not feel it 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.250
 as negative ob difficulties it will 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.990
 always give or earlier it was 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.850
 harmonious but not now 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.350
 more so harmonious or general 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.170
 predominantly positive Germany 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.479
 benefited from the other cultures 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.340
 benefit from it 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.440
 I actually mixed 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.160
 Experiences thus made both positive 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.810
 as well as negative 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.360
 I think it works just fine 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.759
 I experience that with me in Altona 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.119
 Every day and every culture fits 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.119
 together 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.540
 yes, the medial can be clear 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.510
 Reporting is always just lice 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.180
 The task of media should be clear 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.160
 clearer image for the population 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.870
 show when I report every evening 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.870
 I think is far too much 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.270
 it is discussed whether Islam now with 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.520
 Germany fits together or who 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.860
 now who more mark or less market 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.540
 and that has a relatively big one 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.700
 Influence also on the youth 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.340
 first learned where to go with the 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.170
 thoughts so that's I like it 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.670
 I do not have to say I think everyone 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.860
 should live peacefully under one roof 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.530
 I see that partly so we too 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.450
 Unfortunately this ends up in this pg of the 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.459
 We are now very much on the move 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.709
 flames see yes so I'm lecturer and 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.740
 Many studis of mine inform 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.730
 believes himself still on facebook and 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.740
 any conspiracy theories and 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.080
 slip out and the right direction and 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.250
 I want that very dangerous right now so 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.830
 that's changing a lot 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.830
 fast and that's dangerous I think 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.860
 so what I read a newspaper now 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:25.070
 as well as reading or listening to it on the radio 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.930
 is clearly and certainly more sure 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.340
 all are thrown into a pot 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.220
 newspaper for example morning mail picture 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.810
 newspaper at work and as always 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.360
 against islam it is always against the 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.580
 So , yes, if you belong to Islam now 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.500
 nowadays the news you are in 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.950
 of course you have television in newspapers 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.450
 so the feeling that one hate 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.770
 I find that against islam 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.330
 difficult to say where I feel it 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:53.300
 not so good again that's it 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.820
 stop there is certainly official 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.530
 in or officious media the negative 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.760
 but then I can not report it 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.760
 generalize it goes 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.450
 that goes into the branch where you say 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.240
 that's racism right now 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.940
 anti-Semitism and that means it 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.230
 just do not, of course not okay the 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.860
 makes a very dangerous impression 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.660
 So that's should therefore 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.340
 yes, it is cruel to be suggested 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.100
 You should not talk about this topic 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.780
 I do not think it's nice so you should 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.660
 actually check it off because 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.420
 germany is in the world's view 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.400
 just reduced to this decade 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.690
 exactly and that does not belong in anymore 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.340
 our world so you should too 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.570
 was not clear with carry set 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.420
 with great sensitivity 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.929
 be made has its makes times 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:51.740
 Pictures have such a power straight 

00:04:46.929 --> 00:04:53.599
 together with slogans very powerful 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.389
 you know when you do something like that 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:58.149
 or one is propaganda that is 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.539
 of course, when euro drift 

00:04:58.149 --> 00:05:01.539
 that does not work 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.259
 yes that is typical of ours 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.840
 boulevard press that is total 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:15.150
 unacceptable for me that does not work 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.349
 so that will not be there yes 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.479
 not even the people attacked 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:20.280
 but that is completely one 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.990
 world religion close and the islam becomes then 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.759
 just done bad yes look 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.310
 that's exactly what I meant what I mean 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:29.160
 mine if you make such a picture then 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.750
 is automatically he has the anti 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.849
 attitude against islam 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.349
 so to speak, we are to nell German 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:34.650
 the motto oh I always watch the focus 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:36.509
 on 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.169
 there is certainly an interesting one again 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:41.639
 negative reports about Islamists as 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:43.919
 cruel exactly the same as the quasi 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:45.000
 the same brother used to be the Jew 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.169
 today is the muscles 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.699
 I do not want to say that directly 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:52.050
 Fascist but it is my opinion 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:55.440
 even borderline it goes in the 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.909
 frame rhine where you now against a 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.960
 billion people or more 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:59.849
 billion people on this 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.860
 There is something in the whole Muslim world 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:03.599
 says and that is way too general so 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.919
 to say that it is this dark side of the 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:07.560
 Everyone wants to say that there is Islam 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.120
 has single Muslim around the world 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.009
 now these eight uncomfortable conditions 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.120
 uncomfortable truths described there 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:14.159
 will probably be in and in 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.469
 I do not see his religion that way 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:18.599
 I formulated as wrong because now 

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:20.009
 not so i do not think well either 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:21.389
 I also noticed that many are 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:22.770
 black is so if you mirror over 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:25.830
 Islam reports that one is black 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.210
 background reflected the same picture 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.219
 again, more such a dark danger 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.680
 which somehow shows up and stands 

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:33.030
 on every side of islam have the 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.169
 also read articles so more complete 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.669
 nonsense actually there and that is 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:38.210
 sad in the country where I live 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:38.210
 I do not say anymore 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:45.300
 his brother because many people let themselves 

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:47.279
 manipulate from the media 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.080
 because the only watch news what in 

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:52.559
 The news will be one-sided, of course 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:55.409
 be jan rtl or so sure 

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:57.389
 disconnection account of ard / zdf completely 

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:58.860
 even look at me now definitely 

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:02.189
 so if I hear as muslim constantly 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.959
 that I live out any belief 

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:05.969
 the dangerous one is violent 

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:09.199
 that does not belong to germany then 

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:09.199
 of course I feel marginalized
