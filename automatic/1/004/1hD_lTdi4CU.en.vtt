use<00:04:20.160> boiling<00:04:20.580> water<00:04:20.790> to<00:04:21.950> brew<00:04:22.950> it<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.430> that

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
use boiling water to brew it and that

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.980 
use boiling water to brew it and that
requires<00:04:24.870> a<00:04:24.990> temperature<00:04:25.470> low<00:04:26.010> it's<00:04:26.490> about

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
requires a temperature low it's about

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.080 
requires a temperature low it's about
185<00:04:27.990> degrees<00:04:28.500> I<00:04:28.830> think<00:04:29.250> sometimes<00:04:29.730> if<00:04:29.940> you

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
185 degrees I think sometimes if you

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.880 
185 degrees I think sometimes if you
have<00:04:30.120> the<00:04:30.450> more<00:04:30.630> dirty<00:04:30.930> part<00:04:31.200> it's<00:04:31.440> borderline

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
have the more dirty part it's borderline

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.409 
have the more dirty part it's borderline
then<00:04:32.700> it<00:04:32.880> really<00:04:34.100> because<00:04:35.100> she<00:04:35.430> colors<00:04:35.910> tend

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
then it really because she colors tend
