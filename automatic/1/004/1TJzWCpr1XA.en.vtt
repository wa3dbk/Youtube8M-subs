 hello people from 'youtube' who speaks to them is with four and I would like to say that 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.570
 from today to videos tutorials help to eliminate the virus or other 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.269
 annoying files that have the fucking mother xd 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.659
 today I come to talk about a virus called recycled 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.050
 is a virus that by objective gathers information from the windows folder in the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.720
 local disk and once that is done it is deployed and begins to eliminate 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.079
 files that you copied from the windows folder 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:35.210
 in a few words send your pc to the crap now let's start how 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.500
 get rid of this bug 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.670
 the first thing will be to go to my pc and open the local disk 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.520
 eye if they have memory device or is more than a local disk do the same 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.400
 process and look in the other local disks to see if he stayed in one of 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.540
 they 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.570
 once we are on the local disk we look for the tools tab 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.170
 from there we go to folder options 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.640
 and then disable hide windows protected files 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.820
 and we disable hiding file extensions 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.110
 this will allow us to find the recycled folder 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.030
 Once the folder is located, we observe that there is a file with icons of the 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.190
 recycling bin what happens is that people care a lot about this 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.850
 type of file 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.740
 Well, let me tell you that in the recycle folder there is no ex 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.680
 ceo of the trash and the virus 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.740
 the file that I show you in the video is the former headquarters the trash 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.659
 now they wonder how we can verify that 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.370
 The recycled virus has different types of commands and generally the number of 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.370
 commands always ends with the following numbers 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.850
 1 0 1 3 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.110
 this is the final number of the virus commands and this is the final command of 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.110
 lecce from the wastebasket 1 0 0 3 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.350
 remember the command of the ex is always one 0 0 3 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:12.930
 If the file ends with a different final code or has more than one 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.530
 recycling bin worry about that is the virus 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:20.619
 now we start with disinfection 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:26.659
 with several writings I created a new recycled kibble 2009 the file is called 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:31.499
 recycled quilter disable the explorer point exel begins disinfection 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.419
 Once downloaded, the file is executed 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:41.069
 do not move anything from the access where it will be installed from there, it will perform all the 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.069
 process and will confirm if they have the virus or not 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:49.589
 the other way to eliminate the recycled virus are from the cmb but it's very 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:54.409
 difficult and very long the process and if you make a mistake you send yourself to the shit 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.239
 your pc xd 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.319
