00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
that's in 17 days because today is the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.550 
that's in 17 days because today is the
start<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.109> 18,000<00:00:22.920> few<00:00:23.100> years<00:00:23.660> I<00:00:24.660> have<00:00:25.380> to

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
start of the 18,000 few years I have to

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.220 
start of the 18,000 few years I have to
say<00:00:26.000> vegetable<00:00:27.000> drink<00:00:27.240> I'm<00:00:27.420> starting<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.019> get

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
say vegetable drink I'm starting to get

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.830 
say vegetable drink I'm starting to get
into<00:00:28.529> those<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.710> lot<00:00:29.010> more<00:00:29.189> now<00:00:29.510> I'm<00:00:30.510> finding

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
into those a lot more now I'm finding

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.290 
into those a lot more now I'm finding
that<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.679> think<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.430> need<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.700> do<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.120> think

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
that I think I need to do that I think

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.690 
that I think I need to do that I think
that<00:00:33.570> what's<00:00:33.930> happened<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.530> had<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.399> bit<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.579> a

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
that what's happened is had a bit of a

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.280 
that what's happened is had a bit of a
slowdown<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.210> my<00:00:36.450> weight<00:00:36.660> loss<00:00:36.690> in<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.079> last

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
slowdown of my weight loss in the last

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.709 
slowdown of my weight loss in the last
probably<00:00:37.680> two<00:00:37.800> or<00:00:37.950> three<00:00:38.070> days<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.719> think

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
probably two or three days I think

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.810 
probably two or three days I think
that's<00:00:39.960> caused<00:00:40.559> by<00:00:40.739> having<00:00:41.129> too<00:00:41.309> much<00:00:41.460> food<00:00:41.700> to

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
that's caused by having too much food to

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.369 
that's caused by having too much food to
Noren<00:00:42.149> or<00:00:42.239> vegetable<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:42.809> if<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.020> are<00:00:43.140> on<00:00:43.260> this

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
Noren or vegetable so if you are on this

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.880 
Noren or vegetable so if you are on this
juice<00:00:44.370> fast<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:45.390> juice<00:00:45.629> juice<00:00:45.989> diets<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.559> think

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
juice fast the juice juice diets I think

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.709 
juice fast the juice juice diets I think
need<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.370> have<00:00:47.579> more<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.120> component<00:00:48.450> and

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
need to have more of a component and

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.350 
need to have more of a component and
vegetable<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.770> yes<00:00:50.309> I've<00:00:50.550> taken<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.180> plunge

and pears but to a lesser degree so I

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.609

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
think why I work done up I did that

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.170 
think why I work done up I did that
yesterday<00:01:28.799> actually<00:01:29.189> cut<00:01:29.549> down<00:01:29.759> dramatically

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
on the amount of fruit and I don't think

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.620 
on the amount of fruit and I don't think
it's<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.100> surprise<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.790> lost<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> half<00:01:33.509> a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
it's a surprise that I lost and a half a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.109 
it's a surprise that I lost and a half a

to the vegetable drink it's hard to get

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.219 
to the vegetable drink it's hard to get
used<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.000> for<00:01:45.149> me<00:01:45.299> because<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.810> like<00:01:46.049> the

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
used to for me because I like the

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.560 
used to for me because I like the
sweetness<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.649> fruit<00:01:46.979> but<00:01:47.790> I'm<00:01:48.030> thinking<00:01:48.450> that

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570

it's<00:01:48.720> more<00:01:48.899> important<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.409> do<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.770> and

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
it's more important to do that and

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.050 
it's more important to do that and
obviously<00:01:50.040> if<00:01:50.399> it's<00:01:50.490> going<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.700> help<00:01:50.759> me<00:01:50.909> lose
