00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
every time I snipe so my killstreaks I

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.200 
every time I snipe so my killstreaks I
believe<00:00:55.640> are<00:00:56.020> spiking<00:00:57.520> attack<00:00:58.520> helicopter

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
believe are spiking attack helicopter

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.100 
believe are spiking attack helicopter
and<00:00:59.570> blackbird<00:01:01.180> this<00:01:02.180> isn't<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:03.470> bat<00:01:03.740> wool<00:01:04.129> I

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
and blackbird this isn't the bat wool I

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.750 
and blackbird this isn't the bat wool I
guess<00:01:06.110> I<00:01:06.500> have<00:01:06.770> a<00:01:06.800> better<00:01:07.100> sniper<00:01:07.250> gameplay

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
guess I have a better sniper gameplay

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.430 
guess I have a better sniper gameplay

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.190 
much just pretty basic I've already got
another<00:02:14.459> thing<00:02:14.790> done<00:02:15.000> it's<00:02:15.209> just<00:02:15.420> my<00:02:15.569> name<00:02:15.840> and

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
another thing done it's just my name and

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.190 
another thing done it's just my name and
like<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.160> names<00:02:17.580> like<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.569> letters<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:19.050> mean

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
like the names like the letters I mean

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.800 
like the names like the letters I mean
fall<00:02:19.500> apart<00:02:19.830> when<00:02:20.670> they<00:02:21.060> hit<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.360> ground<00:02:21.480> and

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
fall apart when they hit the ground and

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.600 
fall apart when they hit the ground and
they<00:02:21.900> bounce<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.530> they<00:02:22.650> spin<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.130> stuff<00:02:23.400> it

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
they bounce and they spin and stuff it

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.030 
they bounce and they spin and stuff it
looks<00:02:24.569> really<00:02:24.720> glossy<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.440> looks<00:02:25.620> pretty

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
looks really glossy and looks pretty

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.790 
looks really glossy and looks pretty
sharp<00:02:26.220> so<00:02:27.170> probably<00:02:28.170> put<00:02:28.319> that<00:02:28.440> in<00:02:28.560> front<00:02:28.709> of

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
sharp so probably put that in front of

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.070 
sharp so probably put that in front of

wear that shit around there they're just

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.460 
wear that shit around there they're just
caution<00:04:18.829> party<00:04:19.160> or<00:04:19.280> something<00:04:20.320> what<00:04:21.320> do<00:04:21.380> you

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470

use someone funny looking motherfucker

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.960 
use someone funny looking motherfucker
so<00:04:24.650> I<00:04:24.680> guess<00:04:24.830> I<00:04:25.070> should<00:04:25.220> explain<00:04:25.520> a<00:04:25.640> little<00:04:25.820> bit

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
so I guess I should explain a little bit

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.970 
so I guess I should explain a little bit
more<00:04:26.150> of<00:04:26.360> what<00:04:26.900> happens<00:04:27.260> when<00:04:27.440> I<00:04:27.470> transfer

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
more of what happens when I transfer

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.090 
more of what happens when I transfer
from<00:04:28.220> my<00:04:28.280> mom's<00:04:28.580> my<00:04:28.910> dad's<00:04:29.530> so<00:04:30.530> basically<00:04:31.070> my

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
from my mom's my dad's so basically my

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.200 
from my mom's my dad's so basically my
mom's<00:04:31.520> is<00:04:32.290> probably<00:04:33.290> the<00:04:33.440> best<00:04:33.680> place<00:04:34.210> because

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
mom's is probably the best place because

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.490 
mom's is probably the best place because
I<00:04:35.570> have<00:04:35.980> the<00:04:36.980> HD<00:04:37.610> TV<00:04:37.970> and<00:04:38.240> the<00:04:38.900> computer<00:04:38.930> right

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
I have the HD TV and the computer right

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.340 
I have the HD TV and the computer right
beside<00:04:39.830> each<00:04:39.860> other<00:04:40.390> so<00:04:41.390> that's<00:04:41.840> where<00:04:42.110> I<00:04:42.140> keep

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
beside each other so that's where I keep

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.850 
beside each other so that's where I keep
my<00:04:42.410> PVR<00:04:43.370> and<00:04:43.880> that's<00:04:44.810> why<00:04:44.960> I<00:04:44.990> record<00:04:45.470> all<00:04:45.530> my
