00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.870
 the chewing gum comes in the form of balls 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.790
 of all sizes and colors but for 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.480
 explode balloons nothing better than chewing gum 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.480
 pink ball 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.690
 everything starts with a rubber base the 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.000
 substance that makes chewing gum 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.580
 chewable traditionally the base 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.560
 came from the resin of the trees today 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.040
 in day it is synthetic and is made of 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.930
 plastic and rubber is poured the base of 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:41.110
 gum in a mixer and then it 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:42.910
 It adds coloring and flavoring when 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.820
 begins to mix, a syrup is poured 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.530
 of glucose to sweeten the recipe as 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.150
 it is liquid helps to soften the base of 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.320
 rubber 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.320
 for me 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.940
 then dextrose is added a 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.280
 powder sweetener mixes the 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.050
 ingredients for about 20 minutes 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.530
 when stirring , melting heat is produced 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.530
 all 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.900
 the mixture is ready when it achieves 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.460
 bread dough consistency is 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.120
 transports in a truck to a 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.380
 Pre extrusion machine 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.450
 push the mixture through a 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.280
 narrow opening as if removed 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.470
 tube toothpaste by pressing what 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.240
 this transforms the voluminous more into 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.440
 Thin and manageable strips that can 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.440
 go through the extruders 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.369
 the instructors crush each strip to 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.689
 that reaches the true width of a chewing gum 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.250
 gets the shape of a continuous strip and 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.660
 long it will be cut into pieces more 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.660
 small later 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.430
 this extrusion process heats the 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:22.099
 rubber if it will be cut and wrapped now 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.659
 the package would be pasted so the 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.269
 next step is the room 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:28.220
 refrigeration the gum will remain in 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:38.629
 she for 15 minutes at temperatures 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:40.129
 between 3 and 7 degrees Celsius when 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:43.879
 the chewing gum comes out 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:45.560
 cold to cut it and wrap it a 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.609
 machine performs both tasks in a 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.609
 fraction of a second 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.560
 in slow motion you can see how the 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.390
 continuous tape of chewing gum enters by a 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.350
 extreme while the machine cuts it 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.900
 in small pieces 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.090
 the device pushes each piece to a 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.440
 waxed paper wrapper and then 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.430
 the paper is rolled on both ends 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.430
 to close it 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.719
 The machine processes in 900 pieces of 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.719
 chewing gum to the minute 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.269
 ah 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.400
 the last step is packing the 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.110
 chewing gum go to a scale that 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.070
 automatically weighs in the amount 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.070
 exact per box 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.019
 i 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.080
 Y 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.670
 the box is sealed with plastic 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.269
 make it hermetic 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.609
 this keeps chewing gums fresh 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.319
 the reason why the gum is pink is 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.710
 because it was the only color that walter 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:27.949
 dinner was at hand when he invented it in 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:30.400
 1928 and this color has remained since 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.400
 so
