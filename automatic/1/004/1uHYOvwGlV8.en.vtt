that age just working on dance I guess

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.420

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
way I'm just kind of like what Sean said

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.440 
way I'm just kind of like what Sean said
I<00:01:07.560> paid<00:01:08.190> a<00:01:08.220> lot<00:01:08.399> of<00:01:08.430> attention<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.090> details

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
I paid a lot of attention to details

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.240 
I paid a lot of attention to details
whether<00:01:09.690> that<00:01:09.960> be<00:01:10.080> within<00:01:10.289> music<00:01:10.710> or<00:01:10.950> within

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
whether that be within music or within

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.730 
whether that be within music or within
dancing<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.690> movement<00:01:12.869> wise<00:01:13.350> or

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
dancing the movement wise or

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.700 
dancing the movement wise or
choreography<00:01:14.550> concepts<00:01:15.479> directing<00:01:16.440> things

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
choreography concepts directing things

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.700 
choreography concepts directing things
like<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.509> if<00:01:18.509> you've<00:01:19.170> seen<00:01:19.380> any<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
like that if you've seen any of the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.249 
like that if you've seen any of the
company's<00:01:20.039> work<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.940> like<00:01:21.119> what<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.810> see<00:01:22.050> I

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
company's work you like what you see I

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.870 
company's work you like what you see I
guess<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:22.920> would<00:01:23.099> be<00:01:23.190> a<00:01:23.220> good<00:01:23.369> example<00:01:23.490> of

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
guess that would be a good example of

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.440 
guess that would be a good example of
that<00:01:23.940> I<00:01:25.429> don't<00:01:26.429> know<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.729> love<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.090> dance<00:01:27.209> I'd

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
that I don't know I love to dance I'd

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.630 
that I don't know I love to dance I'd
love<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.660> teach<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:28.140> love<00:01:28.410> to<00:01:28.800> direct<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.429> think

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
love to teach I love to direct I think

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.460 
love to teach I love to direct I think
it's<00:01:29.789> always<00:01:30.300> finding<00:01:30.840> something<00:01:30.899> new<00:01:31.229> with

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
it's always finding something new with

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.290 
it's always finding something new with
in<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.220> keeps<00:01:32.429> me<00:01:32.550> going<00:01:32.789> and<00:01:32.910> wants<00:01:33.179> me

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
in that that keeps me going and wants me

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.570 
in that that keeps me going and wants me
to<00:01:33.390> continue<00:01:34.020> because<00:01:34.289> in<00:01:35.280> my<00:01:35.429> opinion

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
to continue because in my opinion

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.339 
to continue because in my opinion
there's<00:01:36.060> there's<00:01:36.390> no<00:01:36.539> right<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.080> there's<00:01:37.200> no

00:01:37.339 --> 00:01:37.349 
there's there's no right and there's no

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:39.050 
there's there's no right and there's no
wrong<00:01:37.560> within<00:01:37.920> our<00:01:38.130> craft<00:01:38.399> you<00:01:38.610> kind<00:01:38.849> of<00:01:38.910> just

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
wrong within our craft you kind of just

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.510 
wrong within our craft you kind of just
keep<00:01:39.840> going<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.380> keeps<00:01:40.590> evolving<00:01:40.830> and<00:01:41.190> you

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
keep going and it keeps evolving and you

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.889 
keep going and it keeps evolving and you
got<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.759> just<00:01:41.849> stay<00:01:42.119> current<00:01:42.360> with<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.690> and<00:01:42.810> I

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
got to just stay current with it and I

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.719 
got to just stay current with it and I
guess<00:01:43.050> the<00:01:43.649> drive<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.009> push<00:01:44.190> and<00:01:44.399> stay<00:01:44.580> current

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
guess the drive to push and stay current

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.460 
guess the drive to push and stay current
with<00:01:44.910> all<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.209> stuff<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.569> is<00:01:46.110> what<00:01:46.319> really
