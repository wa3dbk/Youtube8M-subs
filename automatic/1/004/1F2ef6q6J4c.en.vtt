00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.240
 next to me is martin pieters van het 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.559
 company geofox-lexmond 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.240
 you specialize in 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.990
 soil research can do something about it 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.360
 to tell 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.220
 yes we do ground guessing at the moment 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.340
 inquiry with us 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.550
 ground radar system that is your system what 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.010
 radio or money or broadcasts and the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.849
 reflections are collected 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.230
 Reflections can arise on the right too 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.110
 who are still in the ground of one 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.780
 old water mill we do not bring 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.160
 geofox-lex mouth image 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.500
 conducts this type of research as normal 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.570
 spoken out to put cables and pipes on 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.100
 to trace but also for example to 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.700
 layer thicknesses of asphalt 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.039
 and that will be since 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.690
 ten years now applied in 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.239
 netherlands and 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.780
 well that is for archeology 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.329
 that applied and basis is the place 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.770
 very suitable for applying 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.580
 spinning around 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.270
 What we see in the image now is that we are on 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.250
 about two meters from the starting point 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.240
 a pretty strong reflection 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.860
 green 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:20.780
 at two approximately 2 meters 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.090
 and that could mean that her and 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.360
 and rock in the ground 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.340
 that is already some activity of 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.750
 to fox lexmond 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.880
 no we basically do one 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.390
 environmental research in the broadest sense of 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.380
 the word 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.759
 so we do the very simple 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.939
 environmental research have soil investigations up to 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.939
 the most complex remediation 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:49.200
 we with 130 colleagues and spread over 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.340
 three branches and this this land 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.130
 Guessed investigations are very bad 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.600
 specialized because there are only three 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.360
 four companies in the Netherlands that 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.610
 conduct research in this way 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.659
 we are here at one and archaeological 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.520
 site 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.619
 now the measurements are done when 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.719
 we can anticipate the results 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.459
 and then in what form we get it 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.790
 then 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.560
 the results will be in one 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.640
 on the recordings that are now being made 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.069
 are put into a software program 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.400
 in a computer a model that made 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.140
 then a pseudo the idea 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.410
 record of and then we can just later 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.739
 in 3d s yes but this whole location 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.379
 see 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.500
 so from above from the side from below 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.940
 you can actually view all points of view yourself 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.640
 choose 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.720
 we are here on the banks of the range 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.940
 brook 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.500
 and I stand here with two young can 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.390
 you just tell who you are and 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.329
 why you are here 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.340
 i'm jeff ana and i'm here for 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.840
 she jumped school 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.859
 we do a profile assignment to this 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.470
 subject and that money from our 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:01.049
 final exam say it counts and I live 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.480
 large part must have a total of 80 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:07.079
 so you are in for an hour 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.090
 must be a social internship 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.739
 subject of this internship quite something 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.599
 why did you choose this 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.180
 yes the subject works it chosen that 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.769
 is the first of its kind 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.180
 other people say it or we already 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.590
 hundreds of papers of made 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.019
 and this is really the first 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.150
 what little to do with in with them 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.160
 work with no or say fuck 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.049
 so that label is so interesting so it is 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.829
 something new it is not yet what others 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.139
 have already done so 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:33.959
 no it is completely new so have it 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:35.609
 you fax the body completely 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.090
 approached or has your school thereby 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.889
 assisted 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.599
 i don't know how it is behind the scenes 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:41.760
 just happened 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.519
 school has us with this under the name 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.530
 this say there were several 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.510
 topics with other companies and such 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.959
 but this is where it comes to the 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:55.739
 good students in between if possible 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:57.510
 employees and purpose of say the 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.519
 so on the one hand you commit the caramel 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.400
 college and geofox-lexmond 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:04.270
 students are interested in, say, the 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.730
 bertha side of 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:11.920
 from our field and you can see that 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.080
 yes that we have to do a lot about that 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.820
 students interested in saying 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.110
 to get and 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.780
 but i think they are with such kind 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:24.280
 Research very, very fast 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:26.020
 be interested anyway the back yard 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.730
 almost nobody knows one here 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.790
 watermill has stood and they are 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.990
 research on that then together with 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.990
 with us from geofox-lexmond
