00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.380
 hello my name is vitaly in this 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:08.790
 video we will again disassemble the laptop 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:16.350
 this is packard bell 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:22.359
 p 5w model from 0 we start disassembly from that 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:25.310
 that remove all the screws and the bottom cover 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:28.009
 holding two screws my unscrew and 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.500
 on the edges of the cover snaps on there 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.400
 Specially recesses are possible with the help 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.890
 screwdrivers 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:38.920
 under the kids and pull over come out 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.890
 snaps 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:47.769
 under the bottom cover are located 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:55.699
 modules modules module wifi and 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:59.030
 hard drive hard drive pull left 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.860
 there is a special one and a bitch 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.769
 plastic clear is hard to see 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.740
 you can pull him hard left 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.170
 drive it comes out of the connector but honestly 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.210
 saying I did not succeed therefore 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.240
 I had to pry neatly 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:19.189
 screwdriver only after this connector 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:23.680
 went on already so after 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.680
 connector came out remove the hard drive 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.909
 also under the bottom cover there is still 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.229
 additional screws 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:36.320
 they can also unscrew pay 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.210
 note that the bottom screws are shorter than all 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.460
 the rest but there are markings 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:49.869
 childless your own when you build 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:49.869
 what screw where to tighten then especially 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:58.510
 drive we held as usual on 1 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.510
 cogs his twisting dreary 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:08.300
 the battery on the latch is red 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.120
 This engine can be a screwdriver 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.280
 gently gently move to the right and 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.940
 the battery will rise after that 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:20.690
 and extract under it is five more 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:25.730
 screws shorter than all the rest of them too 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:29.500
 unscrew the module after that 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.989
 Wi-Fi carefully disconnect the wires 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:37.030
 unscrew screw it on one module 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.030
 will rise you can retrieve it 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:52.220
 turn over the laptop and screwdriver 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:55.709
 gently hook the bottom cover it doesn't 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.700
 is the value of the keyboard on 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:03.299
 snaps gently snaps when 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.530
 lift it up we turn on 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:09.209
 keyboard further 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:15.750
 disconnecting the cable and the touchpad cable can 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:18.889
 its keyboard itself is also on 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:23.879
 snaps on the perimeter neatly 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:28.040
 snap off after the keyboard 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:31.830
 people whip shift it up to the monitor 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:35.190
 after that we will see two plumes 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.730
 the loop of the keyboard itself will be released 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.350
 and power button cable 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:45.180
 they gently remove the locks 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:51.600
 females pull out the train and here we see everything 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:54.030
 motherboard wires coming from 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.120
 wi-fi module attached maternal 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.950
 we stick out the tape with the tape 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:04.230
 wires otherwise they will prevent further 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:08.550
 us remove the motherboard also 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.790
 need to unscrew and remove the upper left 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.790
 speaker 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:22.430
 motherboard held by two 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.430
 bolts and at least what for them 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:33.930
 disconnect the right speaker connector 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:40.760
 connect the microphone connector disconnect 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.760
 cable yusb and monitor cable 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:47.060
 all after that 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:50.640
 motherboard need to lift and 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:54.150
 move it to the right but take your time and 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:57.210
 take out because there is still under it 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.960
 power connector motherboard need 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:04.600
 reject monitor 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.600
 and gently disconnect the power plug 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:11.660
 all after this motherboard 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:19.910
 fully accessible and in my case i 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:23.120
 took the vacuum cleaner and gently removed the dust from 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.430
 cooling fan made 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.270
 this is to check how much 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.270
 it is effective 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.490
 This method of cleaning, that is 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:36.650
 without opening without disassembling completely 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.620
 the cooling system is just vacuuming 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.280
 and in the future now we will analyze and 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:46.200
 we'll see 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:48.660
 or how many remained in whether 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:52.070
 in such a way to use not 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.070
 disassemble completely cooling systems 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.380
 will continue 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:03.240
 disassembly connect the wires that 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.240
 feed the cooling system fan 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.990
 in order to disassemble the cooler we need 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:13.000
 completely remove it from the motherboard 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:15.350
 unscrew the screws that hold 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.880
 remove the cooler very carefully not 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.880
 damage the motherboard 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:28.310
 the fan is held in place by three screws 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:31.660
 unscrew them can be a fan 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.660
 take the case 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.750
 let's see what's inside that is 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:42.800
 after you have vacuumed 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:45.580
 in general, the plates are no longer clogged 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.580
 anyway there is still dust 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:52.040
 they can be removed 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:55.100
 brush ordinary brush can be 

00:06:52.040 --> 00:07:00.250
 used to draw thin well and 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:03.950
 vacuum cleaner in general since the fan is removed 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:09.100
 you can no longer be afraid 

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:11.760
 flush the entire housing the inside 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:17.630
 and these records 

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:17.630
 under the stream of water dry the battery 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.720
 my case thermal grease was completely 

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.919
 withered 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.919
 I deleted 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:37.620
 neatly cleaned with a napkin remove 

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:42.300
 remnants of old thermal paste with microchips 

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:43.680
 we put a new thin uniform layer 

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.960
 all by 

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:49.480
 this can be assembled laptop 

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.190
 sequentially in reverse order 

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:54.230
 be careful 

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:56.650
 Thank you all leave comments to 

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.650
 new meetings
