00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
person jaak this oh yeah the answer is a

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.230 
person jaak this oh yeah the answer is a
two<00:01:14.040> x<00:01:14.780> squared<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:17.640> then<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.820> have<00:01:17.940> the<00:01:18.090> dumb

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
two x squared and then you have the dumb

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.469 
two x squared and then you have the dumb
jock<00:01:18.450> which<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:19.550> the<00:01:20.550> super<00:01:21.030> stereo<00:01:21.300> typical
