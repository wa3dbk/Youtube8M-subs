00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 the digital ignition wind farm forms 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.220
 I 'm here now. 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.309
 while waiting for my flight to san diego 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.309
 I'm here at the airport in the los angeles 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.889
 At the famous airport I decided 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.570
 record and to record this video with a 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.900
 balcony for you 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.980
 Dude, I was now in the master mind at 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.550
 Arizona with this lot of people 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.140
 interesting and one of the ways I 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.230
 I think I have to be it may be that 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.269
 has noticed me approaching and 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.480
 learn from the people I admire 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.480
 a lot is doing the interview matters with 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.149
 area that you are and always has an expert 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.690
 this area has always been smart are 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:45.030
 so one step ahead of one of you one 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.930
 step above you or full up 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.989
 you 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.719
 in that one at that exact moment 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.340
 Even while I'm going to talk, I'll go further. 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.379
 it's the people saying something, but anyway 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.809
 how would other video made better say 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.539
 perfect but so I 've done in 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.600
 interviews and I advise you to invite 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.960
 this is one of the habits in my situations 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.420
 that I have more than I have more 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.920
 I benefit from an interview for three 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.330
 motives one because it is selfishly minded I 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.650
 I want to get close to that person I 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.270
 I want to learn from that person when 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.090
 propose to do an interview with her 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.680
 a kind of excuse that most 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.840
 of people accept to ask question 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.939
 they respond to 2 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.290
 I strongly believe in entrepreneurship 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.909
 have the strength to change the world and I 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.710
 I believe that I interview people 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.259
 I make this experience of these people 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.420
 for people like you the world will be 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:47.310
 a better world then this part of 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.960
 contribution and third party because 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.990
 interviews as well as bring a good 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.329
 impact they attract the audience of my 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.630
 own channels people look for them 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.600
 like they share these interviews 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.939
 So yes it is the famous win win win and 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.460
 So that's why I see a lot. 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.259
 few people intentionally with this 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.720
 strategy making it happen with 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.880
 interviews 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.770
 that's when more people are watching the 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.890
 interviews my blog does not keep going 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.840
 finally understand how to do more but I 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.090
 intentionally invites 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.980
 interviews as part of their strategy 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.350
 content I think it will do a good 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.020
 for the world is going to make a 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.500
 Giant comb for you with a 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.510
 person because you will finally you will 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.070
 finally have the opportunity to find the 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.720
 your heroes just ask something 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.880
 by his heroes who generally do not 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.850
 I would ask and 3 will kiss 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.730
 your business because it will attract 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.530
 audience nothing is so valuable business 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.120
 as the audience and long 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.910
 I thought it was very complicated here 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.350
 in mine in my backpack she made some 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.860
 more interviews from a camera than 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.200
 call canon 5d mark 3 is a one camera 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.310
 I paid 5 thousand euros with the glasses 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.530

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.540

 for iphone and it's really cool people 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.470
 never imagine we will go 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.900
 interview the latter's face 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.940
 series that I had the opportunity to 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.810
 invite multiple people interviewed 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.780
 one of them is the master of the house is bad is 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.580
 This guy is a publisher who 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.799
 more publishes the book d 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.260
 personal development is the world tÃ¡ 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.019
 Incredible this I learned a lot with 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.690
 believe it or not and we always stay 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.120
 I do not know if you're bold that you know 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.860
 I 'm not only a person, it 's super shy to 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.870
 be a day out if it's a few events 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.300
 Alves will see a super team person I 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.850
 I have to ask you and what I do. 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.040
 I always put on mobile the theory of 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.020
 three goals so right the last video 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.420
 I talked about the theory of the three goals 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.800
 I always put it on when I'm going to have a 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.260
 goal between is always put three 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:50.160
 people or three goals is a goal that is 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:52.650
 incredibly difficult the team would 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.390
 climbing the walls 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.580
 champagne a metric that the ok 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:00.570
 America is not a goal that is very good 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:02.460
 and the goal is that it 's what's up, so I 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.920
 I advise you to let your 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.750
 business he think of the three people three 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.040
 people you could not interview 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.620
 you will necessarily succeed but with 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.450
 With you writing this, your cell phone. 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.650
 a paper or anything goes 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.330
 starting to hit an intention is 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.070
 incredible, I already speak another video 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.160
 incredible when you receive an intention 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.930
 and let your brain work its 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.480
 subconscious to work on this intention is 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.160
 amazing when we go back to 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.380
 we are able you believe it will 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.810
 and the first person the person who would be 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:34.200
 legal and what you think can be the 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:37.050
 second person would be great, I would not 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.430
 Do you know if you can get masks and have a 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.990
 good chance lets say like this 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.300
 work without a good chance that 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.980
 third person 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.860

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.300

 My cell phone that likes to read these things.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:05.640
 intention can bring to you may anyway

 video is making a difference to 

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.100
 you can cause a friend sharing 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:32.280
 share was not simply 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:34.710
 so it's facebook or that type does not 

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:39.600
 makes a sharing sharing 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:41.070
 with the direction is a sharing in 

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.390
 staff does not share with that 

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.460
 person you think makes the difference 

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:46.580
 if you want to differentiate in the background of your 

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:49.590
 My heart, you think it makes a difference. 

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:52.530
