00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.270 

okay<00:04:39.730> soso<00:04:40.110> starts<00:04:41.110> right<00:04:41.440> after<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.889> second

then you hold the board after that they

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.510 
then you hold the board after that they
do<00:04:52.500> what<00:04:53.500> I<00:04:53.530> just<00:04:53.740> taught<00:04:53.919> you<00:04:53.950> this<00:04:54.250> part<00:04:56.520> and

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
do what I just taught you this part and

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.240 
do what I just taught you this part and
then<00:04:57.760> you<00:04:57.880> finish<00:04:58.120> them<00:04:58.419> on<00:04:58.600> the<00:04:58.919> acorn<00:04:59.919> our

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
then you finish them on the acorn our

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:06.900 
then you finish them on the acorn our
fourth<00:05:01.000> fret<00:05:01.300> a<00:05:01.480> chord<00:05:01.900> so<00:05:05.370> and<00:05:06.370> then<00:05:06.580> you<00:05:06.760> go

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
fourth fret a chord so and then you go

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.230 
fourth fret a chord so and then you go
on<00:05:07.180> to<00:05:07.480> a<00:05:07.510> solo<00:05:08.139> which<00:05:08.470> starts<00:05:09.280> on<00:05:09.400> D<00:05:09.669> the<00:05:10.060> D

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
on to a solo which starts on D the D

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:21.970 
on to a solo which starts on D the D
string<00:05:10.479> 6<00:05:10.840> fret<00:05:13.800> good<00:05:14.800> a<00:05:14.830> g-string

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.640 

and<00:05:22.790> so<00:05:23.060> that<00:05:23.180> sounds<00:05:23.420> like<00:05:23.480> this<00:05:26.440> same<00:05:27.440> thing

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
and so that sounds like this same thing

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:40.560 
and so that sounds like this same thing
is<00:05:27.770> said<00:05:27.800> this<00:05:30.730> finish<00:05:31.730> on<00:05:32.090> the<00:05:32.300> D<00:05:32.510> string<00:05:32.540> six

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.780 

this<00:05:41.570> party

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.180 

so<00:05:46.420> that's<00:05:46.630> basically<00:05:46.840> if<00:05:47.380> for<00:05:47.680> guitar<00:05:47.980> one

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
so that's basically if for guitar one

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.790 
so that's basically if for guitar one
but<00:05:48.730> there's<00:05:49.360> also<00:05:49.630> a<00:05:49.840> second<00:05:50.380> guitar<00:05:50.650> in

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
but there's also a second guitar in

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.340 
but there's also a second guitar in
there<00:05:51.010> doing<00:05:51.370> the<00:05:52.060> backup<00:05:52.630> chords<00:05:53.020> for<00:05:53.230> it

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.350 
there doing the backup chords for it

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.770 
there doing the backup chords for it
which<00:05:54.040> the<00:05:54.580> chord<00:05:54.820> it's<00:05:55.060> only<00:05:55.180> three<00:05:55.480> chords

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
which the chord it's only three chords

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.140 
which the chord it's only three chords
and<00:05:56.140> they<00:05:56.290> only<00:05:56.500> play<00:05:56.800> during<00:05:57.010> the<00:05:57.160> verse<00:05:57.340> so

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
and they only play during the verse so

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:04.800 
and they only play during the verse so
it's<00:06:01.560> and<00:06:02.560> so<00:06:03.100> this<00:06:03.520> strumming<00:06:03.760> is<00:06:03.940> just<00:06:04.150> four

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
it's and so this strumming is just four

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:20.000 
it's and so this strumming is just four
for<00:06:05.140> each<00:06:05.320> segment<00:06:15.960> of<00:06:16.960> them<00:06:17.950> because<00:06:18.310> there's

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
for each segment of them because there's

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:25.200 
for each segment of them because there's
it<00:06:21.010> repeats<00:06:21.580> itself<00:06:21.910> so<00:06:22.560> that's<00:06:23.560> it<00:06:23.920> for<00:06:24.730> her

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
it repeats itself so that's it for her

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.780 
it repeats itself so that's it for her
just<00:06:25.750> remember<00:06:26.260> capo<00:06:26.680> on<00:06:26.830> first<00:06:27.130> fret<00:06:27.490> and

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:27.790 
just remember capo on first fret and

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.880 
just remember capo on first fret and
those<00:06:28.540> chords<00:06:28.990> and<00:06:29.110> they<00:06:29.230> do<00:06:29.290> not<00:06:29.590> play

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:29.890
