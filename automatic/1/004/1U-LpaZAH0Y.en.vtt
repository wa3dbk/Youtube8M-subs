00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 matthew clarkin the dark vador girondins 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.009
 and well the words were clearly very 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.910
 clear if we win we can play other 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.529
 thing that maintaining 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.210
 otherwise it's over matthew clarkin 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.349
 big-aged place who appreciates the but the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.030
 Girondines she just won a 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.830
 ball on adverse introduction julien 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.240
 go here alert pierre bernard a balloon 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.680
 on the wings for blair connor who is going 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.210
 withstand three defenders before 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.369
 maybe to sneak in to go 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.050
 mark the test difficult to say but in 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.029
 anyway studded sir will he do 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.800
 call to the video we've been playing for four 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.050
 minutes only and here blair connor 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.869
 who resisted ma'afu mates and aurillac 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.189
 and for maybe going flatter 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.620
 difficult really hard to get 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.120
 an opinion then so we'll settle a 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.989
 simply rely on blair 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.969
 connor who gives us an indication 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.660
 for him well he misses some 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.129
 centimeters 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.350
 but look at sir finally cost 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.010
 decides to validate this essay after 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.289
 transformation 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.600
 bordeaux and raphael ibanez puts 7 to 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.350
 0 has been playing for four minutes in this 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.700
 meet 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.050
 seven minutes later we find 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.610
 again the fronts at the party and stone 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.199
 Bernard here who himself stick 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.640
 transversal total alert and lula who 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.620
 only has to recover the ball and 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.219
 to have a wonderful dip in 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.199
 the aim 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.850
 melissa andré nogas the rain here has 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.710
 made the game conditions very 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.840
 difficult but board we realize a 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.430
 start of perfect match dominators in 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.040
 conquest and full of realism at the moment 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.510
 to score it so leads 14 to 0 after a 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.610
 quarter of an hour and well the oyonnaxiens 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.810
 in the trap are forced to react and 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.210
 as often they are thanks to their 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.070
 forward with here nemetschek powered by 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.610
 all his partners behind the line 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.100
 in-goal 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.479
 a pride reaction of the promoted who goes 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.110
 maybe just wake up this 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.460
 Ooyonnax team 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.990
 always looking for a first 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.520
 victory this season outside 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.650
 the test is transformed 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.360
 Bordeaux only leads 14 to 7 but if 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.890
 you have the balls to create a breach in 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.570
 the defense he's stopped on the line 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.430
 40 meters but Julian remains seized of 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.350
 his ball and without defenders facing him 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.240
 except a straight line to complete his 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.399
 race between the poles there too the 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.780
 Realism Bordeaux will have done wonders 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.399
 at the beginning of the meeting a few 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.740
 missed tackles also on the side 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.619
 which makes the task of 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.090
 julien rey three tries to 1 the break is 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.740
 so made for this Bordeaux team 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.180
 criticized lately for his 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.020
 lack of fighting spirit but who 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.880
 today really put back the slopes 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.079
 at their match the art king enjoyed the 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.859
 show he would like to go back in 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.600
 second period 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:06.670
 a second act well started by this 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.670
 team of oyonnax barnard 2 on penalty 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.319
 brings back the promoted to 21 10 only problem this 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.180
 evening in the ranks of the promoted Monday 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.890
 cycling which has cost a lot 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.170
 Ozonaxians for this high plating on 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.739
 marc is bound the kerr gets a carton 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.989
 yellow 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.549
 in numerical superiority then burgundy 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.080
 get loose like a dirty habit and 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.640
 produces a lot of rugby matthew 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.560
 clarkin this one who just got into 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.510
 game he alert charles saubusse who did 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.640
 alternative to prolong the 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.319
 Fabien defensive back foot cibray 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.670
 misses the ball just as his 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.200
 partners you have the balls also 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.910
 only player to have all-inclusive blair 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.280
 connor who comes here to remove this 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.170
 balloon and flatten behind the line 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.970
 there too we will call on the video 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.099
 for this fourth try be no out 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.390
 game starting from the action step forward 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.099
 at the moment of flattening 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.019
 Ceps can therefore be validated and 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.540
 connor afford a doubled that allows 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.549
 bordeaux then play to lead 28 to 10 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.810
 the victory is apparently acquired but 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.400
 raphaël ibanez asks his players 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.379
 to fetch the offensive bonus 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.660
 that they do for that still marked a 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.430
 times and 15 against 14 thanks to this good 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.260
 work from the forwards and well a benefit 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.670
 in progress and reported pierre bernard 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.590
 haller will try a diagonal 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.780
 completely missed will come back so 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.299
 where the penalty jumps it 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.769
 fault was whistled look good number 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.269
 6 louis benoît madaule who plays 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.920
 quickly it is easy and earth for 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.200
 flatten in the goal and so score 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.269
 the 5th test of his Bordeaux team 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.590
 rules to prevail not ultimately 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.060
 35,10 and away from the red zone 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.709
 a third success this season 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.630
 embellished for the first time 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.580
 offensive bonus point of hogs to say 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.210
 the air capital 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.210
