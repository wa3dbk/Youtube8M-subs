00:00:02.078 --> 00:00:04.219
 This is an extraordinary case we've got to deal with. 

00:00:04.251 --> 00:00:04.954
 &lt;i&gt; Dr. Haritopoulos &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:00:05.085 --> 00:00:06.987
 It's been years since I've seen something similar. 

00:00:07.653 --> 00:00:08.564
 Yes, yes Lazaros, 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.626
 He's got creativity, prolific ideas ... 

00:00:11.028 --> 00:00:12.594
 I'll recommend him to Cambridge University. 

00:00:13.205 --> 00:00:15.290
 Flemish? Yes, Flemish! 

00:00:16.078 --> 00:00:17.284
 Applications are open? 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:19.362
 Okay, I'll let him know. 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.110
 Yes, please? 

00:00:24.156 --> 00:00:26.103
 Professor, what do you recommend me? 

00:00:26.596 --> 00:00:28.296
 Anastasis, things are simple. 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.612
 You have the choices of Cambridge, Oxford, MIT ... 

00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:34.754
 for ... molecular cooking!

 We're waiting for you! 

00:01:18.131 --> 00:01:20.613
 Today we are making a pizza! 

00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:22.877
 In fact, we will make a pizza dough, 

00:01:23.086 --> 00:01:25.816
 and we'll see what ingredients we have so to 'decorate' it! 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.087
 Let's see! 

00:01:27.605 --> 00:01:29.803
 &lt;i&gt; True Testimonial &lt;/ i&gt;: Are you tired of trying to make 

00:01:29.803 --> 00:01:30.899
 &lt;i&gt; True Testimonial &lt;/ i&gt;: An unsuccessful pizza dough? 

00:01:31.142 --> 00:01:32.496
 &lt;i&gt; True Testimonial &lt;/ i&gt;: Are all your friends making fun of you, 

00:01:32.496 --> 00:01:33.694
 &lt;i&gt; True Testimonial &lt;/ i&gt;: saying you can not even make 

00:01:33.694 --> 00:01:34.795
 &lt;i&gt; True Testimonial: &lt;/ i&gt; and dough for pizza? 

00:01:35.243 --> 00:01:36.290
 &lt;i&gt; True Testimonial &lt;/ i&gt;: Have you made rich 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.628
 &lt;i&gt; True Testimonial: &lt;/ i&gt; all of the pizzerias in the city center? 

00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:39.225
 &lt;i&gt; True Testimonial &lt;/ i&gt;: Now, 'Try This at Home' ... 

00:01:40.034 --> 00:01:43.408
 We pour here two glasses of lukewarm water. 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:46.296
 Water's ready. 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.829
 We add the yeast. 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.465
 We'll use 8 grams of yeast. 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.487
 We add some sugar as well. 

00:01:53.951 --> 00:01:54.972
 And one drop of olive oil. 

00:01:55.344 --> 00:01:56.553
 We mix it with a fork. 

00:02:07.331 --> 00:02:09.074
 After this impressive time-lapse, 

00:02:09.074 --> 00:02:10.222
 let's continue with our recipe. 

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:12.025
 We'll start pouring the flour. 

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:15.279
 We pour a big amount first, 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:17.775
 and then start mixing slowly. 

00:02:18.177 --> 00:02:20.393
 When you see it is still liquid, pour more flour. 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.365
 Nice. And now mix with your hands. 

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:26.024
 Do not forget, our flour needs to be sifted ... 

00:02:26.948 --> 00:02:28.041
 ... before we pour it in. 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.610
 We pour some more, until the dough does not stick to our hands. 

00:02:33.898 --> 00:02:35.135
 We kneaded the dough! 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.840
 We poured some flour on the top, 

00:02:37.097 --> 00:02:38.928
 We cover it with a shrink wrap and we wrap it, 

00:02:38.928 --> 00:02:41.090
 either with some towels or a blanket, 

00:02:41.376 --> 00:02:43.042
 so let the yeast activate. 

00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:44.092
 Logo! 

00:02:44.614 --> 00:02:46.647
 We take the dough, after we have left it to rise a bit. 

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.274
 We have spread some flour on the table. 

00:02:48.948 --> 00:02:49.935
 We put it here. 

00:02:50.463 --> 00:02:50.973
 Good. 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.127
 So, you can see it now and see how fluffy it is. 

00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:55.624
 Now I'll cut it. 

00:02:57.238 --> 00:02:58.322
 I'll leave this aside. 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.306
 And now I start rolling out and stretching with my hands. 

00:03:03.084 --> 00:03:04.921
 We'll put it on baking paper, you'll see why. 

00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:07.534
 Perfect. 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.672
 Be careful not to create any holes! 

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:14.263
 WHAT'S THAT INGREDIENT? 

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:18.025
 IT'S ... 

00:03:18.668 --> 00:03:20.002
 TOMATO! 

00:03:23.575 --> 00:03:24.468
 We've stretched the dough, 

00:03:24.468 --> 00:03:26.785
 and now we can add to our pizza any ingredients we want, 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.646
 without any restrictions. 

00:03:29.744 --> 00:03:31.698
 Let's add the sauce first. 

00:03:31.972 --> 00:03:33.178
 The sauce I'm using today, 

00:03:34.037 --> 00:03:35.518
 since I did not have a shop-bought one, 

00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:37.386
 I took some tomatoes and grated them. 

00:03:38.237 --> 00:03:40.371
 You do not cook the sauce, it will be cooked in the oven. 

00:03:40.686 --> 00:03:42.237
 I did not put any flavor in it, 

00:03:42.237 --> 00:03:44.969
 because I want my pizza to have the taste of the vegetables i will put in. 

00:03:45.278 --> 00:03:48.158
 As you can see, I'm leaving some space close to the edges, 

00:03:48.407 --> 00:03:49.915
 and I will later tell you why. 

00:03:50.024 --> 00:03:51.191
 Mamma Napoli! 

00:03:51.416 --> 00:03:52.469
 We'll start putting the vegetables. 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.510
 Since the vegetables will shrivel up inside the oven, 

00:03:56.052 --> 00:03:57.151
 do not hesitate, add many of them. 

00:03:58.218 --> 00:04:00.102
 Put vegetables everywhere. 

00:04:01.295 --> 00:04:03.170
 I have cut green and red pepper. 

00:04:03.798 --> 00:04:05.170
 Put on the top like this. 

00:04:07.243 --> 00:04:10.393
 We cut fresh mushrooms into slices and add them. 

00:04:10.798 --> 00:04:13.838
 We'll do a trick now for the vegetables to stick on the dough. 

00:04:14.326 --> 00:04:16.840
 We want the ingredients to stick with the pizza dough. 

00:04:17.133 --> 00:04:18.865
 Try to find holes to put it in. 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.985
 Down here. 

00:04:21.181 --> 00:04:23.048
 We add some carrots as well. 

00:04:23.314 --> 00:04:26.189
 Try to cut the carrots into thin and diagonal slices. 

00:04:26.441 --> 00:04:28.168
 We will spread a lot of kasseri on the top, 

00:04:28.674 --> 00:04:29.636
 so it's for it to melt. 

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:33.199
 We'll put kasseri in the edges, making a stuffed crust. 

00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:37.194
 Push it in a little. 

00:04:39.465 --> 00:04:41.085
 Put a lot of kasseri, it will be tasty. 

00:04:43.269 --> 00:04:44.159
 In this side too. 

00:04:44.385 --> 00:04:49.655
 Good! And now we start turning the crust inwards, 

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:51.376
 to 'trap' the kasseri inside. 

00:04:52.076 --> 00:04:57.334
 In the oven, the kasseri will melt in the crust. 

00:05:00.225 --> 00:05:00.979
 Nice. 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.225
 Like this. 

00:05:06.503 --> 00:05:08.072
 The last step before we put it in the oven! 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.531
 We'll put some feta cheese cubes on the top. 

00:05:12.483 --> 00:05:14.003
 I would say it's a mediterranean pizza, 

00:05:14.003 --> 00:05:16.790
 so we'll make it more Mediterranean by adding some olives too. 

00:05:17.254 --> 00:05:18.633
 Let's see how to cut the olives easily. 

00:05:18.772 --> 00:05:21.685
 Looking at our olives like this, we place the knife here carefully. 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:22.961
 We push it a bit. 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.931
 Then the olive pit can be removed very easily. Look! 

00:05:30.177 --> 00:05:32.114
 We put the olives on the top. 

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:36.395
 The pizza is ready to get in the oven for 30-35 minutes. 

00:05:36.807 --> 00:05:38.754
 When the dough starts getting golden, 

00:05:38.929 --> 00:05:39.749
 take it out. 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.522
 Dimitra, read the ingredients for us! 

00:05:43.119 --> 00:05:45.590
 'Vegetable Pizza', ingredients for 2 pizzas: 

00:05:46.064 --> 00:05:49.119
 800 g of flour, 8 g of yeast, 

00:05:49.442 --> 00:05:52.089
 2 glasses of lukewarm water, some sugar, 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.179
 a few drops of virgin olive oil, and any ingredients you like. 

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:57.726
 The pizza is out! 

00:05:58.063 --> 00:06:00.137
 As you can see, it's golden. 

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:02.946
 It's become crispy, and you'll see that when I cut it. 

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:08.000
 It's thin, it has kept the colors, 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.847
 the peppers, the olives, the cheese, 

00:06:10.595 --> 00:06:11.961
 the mushrooms, the carrots ... 

00:06:12.508 --> 00:06:14.455
 I think we should try it! 

00:06:14.774 --> 00:06:16.164
 That's all for this week!

00:06:24.896 --> 00:06:28.284
 Um, but we said it was going to be the other one ... 

00:06:28.866 --> 00:06:29.662
 - The other one! 

00:06:29.755 --> 00:06:31.175
