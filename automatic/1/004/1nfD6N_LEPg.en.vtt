00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.269
 look at 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:17.880
 I show you today is the right must 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.960
 after writing this blog with a stain 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.970
 have published patterns in rounds 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.760
 karben 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.480
 that's always the question if you like it 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.190
 can work in italy 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:38.489
 I tried that and it works 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.170
 but something different like that in round and 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.430
 this professional how do I do mine 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.559
 video of it 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.550
 I use again of hedges has the 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.469
 cool 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:55.520
 It has a running length of 65 meters 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:58.289
 160 grams and I have a nail 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:10.159
 I'll keep that in a pattern 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:10.159
 lobule and suggest the 16 make a 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:37.860
 10 12 13 14 15 16 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:43.320
 So you work with this pattern 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:48.020
 make a betrayed number the first 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.020
 I knit series jack mesh 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:20.480
 but only in this first rally afterwards 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:24.650
 each had committed series begins 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:28.880
 the meat pattern i work the edge 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.520
 Masha and the after will be from now 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.790
 always two machines together from 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:39.320
 Knitted the second machine before the 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:42.050
 knit first right and then the 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.650
 stripping the first stitch on the right and both 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.280
 let the nail drift 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:52.459
 sting again in the quote stitch 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:56.540
 knit this right and then the first one 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:59.000
 knit the second on the right 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.120
 I prick it considered here with the 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.560
 thumb something tight so they do not over 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.560
 the first one slipped 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.820
 and at the people of the needle 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.820
 slide 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.000
 and the next 2 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:40.220
 and the fight then do the work 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:43.120
 because of you knit at knit left and 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:48.590
 also knit the first stitch of life 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:53.660
 The pattern looks like this 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:58.280
 From now on always two left turn off 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:01.489
 Knitted as the second before the first 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:08.209
 knit marge on the left and then the first 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:11.110
 machine left the second left and the 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.110
 us teams 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.480
 and again the dead links and the 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.970
 first left and we end with one 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.970
 mesh left and make the edge 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:02.020
 and these two rows are repeated 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:07.000
 constantly stricker so the edge most in 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:08.910
 the hinrich and then start immediately 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.010
 the injuries 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:21.330
 this became right and the first right 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:26.040
 the second right and the first right 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:31.360
 the second right and the first judge 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:33.910
 we stop here is the second stitch 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:40.810
 with the thumb firmly so that they do not over 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:42.850
 the first corpse slips and then comes 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.470
 you actually with this duty 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.470
 must be doing very well there 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:06:02.340
 and now important in the back room first 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:06.610
 after working on a marius 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:11.400
 and then only with the injuries or 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.400
 start the commitments 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:52.020
 and again with a left 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:57.479
 machines and the fast and so they are 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:07:00.680
 this bad pattern i wish 

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:00.680
