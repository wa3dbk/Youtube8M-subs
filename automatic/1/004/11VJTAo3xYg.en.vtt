00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
unlimited substitute so I can do the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.469

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.280 
example younger players different combos
could<00:01:35.850> be<00:01:35.939> pretty<00:01:36.060> good<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.600> huge<00:01:36.930> thing<00:01:37.140> is

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
could be pretty good the huge thing is

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.710 
could be pretty good the huge thing is
player<00:01:37.560> training<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.460> uh<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.540> pretty

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
player training so uh this is pretty

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.990 
player training so uh this is pretty
much<00:01:39.810> something<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.920> huge<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.970> know

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
much something that is huge you know

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.660 
much something that is huge you know
players<00:01:42.450> can<00:01:42.630> improve<00:01:43.049> base<00:01:43.979> like<00:01:44.340> fo<00:01:44.520> hit

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
players can improve base like fo hit
