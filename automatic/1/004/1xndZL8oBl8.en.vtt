what<00:03:34.799> they<00:03:34.920> did<00:03:35.390> but<00:03:36.390> it<00:03:36.540> just<00:03:36.570> smells<00:03:36.989> so<00:03:37.170> good

what they did but it just smells so good

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.349 
what they did but it just smells so good
like<00:03:37.799> I<00:03:37.980> don't<00:03:38.040> know<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:38.609> packaging<00:03:39.150> like

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
like I don't know and the packaging like

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.300 
like I don't know and the packaging like
I<00:03:39.510> just<00:03:39.660> think<00:03:39.900> perfume<00:03:40.230> packaging<00:03:40.709> is<00:03:40.859> really

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
I just think perfume packaging is really

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.180 
I just think perfume packaging is really
worth<00:03:41.519> while<00:03:42.260> you<00:03:43.260> know<00:03:43.380> having<00:03:44.040> good

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
worth while you know having good

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.099 
worth while you know having good
packaging<00:03:44.670> for<00:03:44.940> like<00:03:45.120> makeup<00:03:45.359> and<00:03:45.630> stuff<00:03:45.840> it's

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
packaging for like makeup and stuff it's

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.349 
packaging for like makeup and stuff it's
nice<00:03:46.500> but<00:03:46.980> not<00:03:47.160> necessary<00:03:47.910> but<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.150> think

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
nice but not necessary but I think

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.690 
nice but not necessary but I think
perfume<00:03:48.720> packaging<00:03:49.109> is<00:03:49.230> 100%<00:03:49.709> necessary<00:03:49.980> it's

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
perfume packaging is 100% necessary it's

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.789 
perfume packaging is 100% necessary it's
just<00:03:50.850> beautiful<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:52.170> only<00:03:52.290> thing<00:03:52.440> is<00:03:52.560> this<00:03:52.680> is
