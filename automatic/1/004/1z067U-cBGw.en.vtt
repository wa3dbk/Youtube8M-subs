 the driver of a foreign car at full speed knocks down 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.809

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.930
 quite warm others at the same time 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.670
 literally floods cyclone snow 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.160
 did their job in Siberia and in the middle 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.870

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.960

 bowling one person died 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.220

 snowfall on the highway Ufa Beloretsk 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.610
 met 20 cars 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.260
 because of the snowstorm visibility was minimal 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.299
 for some reason the driver was pressed down hard 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.220
 gas and when seen ahead of the landfill of 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.320
 broken cars were too late 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.390
 before driving 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.310
 it is necessary to ensure the health of all 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.710
 car systems apply tires with 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.330
 winter tread pattern use 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.880
 seat belts in yourself 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.619
 and all passengers as well as provide 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.170
 unobstructed circular view of 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.640
 traffic situation from the driver's seat 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.470
 sometimes driving after a heavy 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.040
 precipitation was turning into extreme 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.140
 occupation 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.030
 snow falls asleep on the go 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.189
 virtually invisible no wonder that 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.780
 approaching each other these drivers too 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.180
 saw at the last moment they could 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.009
 avoid ramming on the border of Chuvashia 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.810
 Tatarstan came together several four 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.250
 dodging a collision with each 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.850
 another they blocked the entire track and 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.500
 curb 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.960
 movement was able to recover only 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.430
 after 7 hours the speed of the car should 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.680
 fit road and 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.390
 meteorological conditions as well 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.180
 provide full control over 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.619
 driving a vehicle 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.989
 the driver must avoid sharp 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.050
 braking maneuvers and rebuilds 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.370
 follow 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.620
 spare distance to moving 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.780
 ahead of the vehicle 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.580
 as well as the necessary side troll 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.260
 but even where there was not 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.210
 extreme snowfall drivers all 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.280
 fought here well the ring road 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.720
 Petersburg driver mercedes too 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.580
 drove quickly after losing 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.160
 control and hit a bump stop and 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.050
 flew under the wheels of his companion to 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.490
 happily up to the present they are calendar 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.920
 spring in the greater territory of Russia 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.540
 it does not last long and if you do not lose 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.610
 vigilance and do not get involved in speed 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.200
 then chances to meet her without body 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.480
