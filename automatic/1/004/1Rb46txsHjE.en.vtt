tassa over a Demerest but they couldn't

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.220 
tassa over a Demerest but they couldn't
pull<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.790> financing<00:00:36.570> together<00:00:36.809> until<00:00:37.110> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
pull the financing together until the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.750 
pull the financing together until the
next<00:00:37.410> year<00:00:37.649> we<00:00:37.800> had<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.920> window<00:00:38.280> where<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:38.520> can

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
next year we had a window where we can

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.060

five million or some

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.859 
five million or some
that<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.560> write<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.549> script<00:01:35.939> hearse<00:01:36.659> the

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.499 
that I write the script hearse the
actors<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.530> then<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.640> try<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.210> make<00:01:39.450> sure

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
actors and then I I try to make sure

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.149 
actors and then I I try to make sure
they<00:01:39.840> give<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.140> performance<00:01:40.530> while<00:01:40.979> we're

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
they give a performance while we're

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.560 
they give a performance while we're
shooting<00:01:41.399> that's<00:01:41.700> as<00:01:41.880> close<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.390> one<00:01:42.540> I

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
shooting that's as close to the one I

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.260 
shooting that's as close to the one I
saw<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:42.840> my<00:01:42.990> head<00:01:43.380> while<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.250> was<00:01:44.520> writing<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:45.030> if

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
saw in my head while I was writing it if

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.080 
saw in my head while I was writing it if
not<00:01:45.479> better<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.170> now<00:01:46.830> it's<00:01:47.460> usually<00:01:47.850> better

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
not better and now it's usually better

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.969 
not better and now it's usually better
like<00:01:48.570> when<00:01:48.600> i<00:01:48.780> was<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.020> kid<00:01:49.049> i<00:01:49.289> always<00:01:49.500> felt

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
like when i was a kid i always felt

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.590 
like when i was a kid i always felt
thought<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.430> knew<00:01:50.580> exactly<00:01:50.700> everyone<00:01:51.450> should

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
thought I knew exactly everyone should

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.359 
thought I knew exactly everyone should
