00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
shelves when I was a little kid and I

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.990 
shelves when I was a little kid and I
always<00:01:32.970> made<00:01:33.210> little<00:01:33.420> scenes<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:35.000> I've

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
always made little scenes and I've

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.460 
always made little scenes and I've
always<00:01:36.180> believed<00:01:36.630> about<00:01:36.780> playing<00:01:37.140> with<00:01:37.320> your
