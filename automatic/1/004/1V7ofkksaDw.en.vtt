turn on my six thousand case or in your
case<00:02:08.369> could<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.729> there<00:02:08.940> 10<00:02:09.150> X<00:02:09.330> or<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.660> 10,000

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
case could be there 10 X or the 10,000

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.610 
case could be there 10 X or the 10,000
case<00:02:10.290> will<00:02:10.530> run<00:02:10.770> both<00:02:12.110> that's<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.200> good<00:02:13.320> fan

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
case will run both that's the good fan

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
case will run both that's the good fan
it's<00:02:15.110> so<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.350> ten<00:02:16.650> loud<00:02:16.920> that's<00:02:17.130> kind<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.370> quiet

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
it's so so ten loud that's kind of quiet

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.760 
it's so so ten loud that's kind of quiet
I<00:02:17.850> mean<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.350> were<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.440> go<00:02:19.530> back<00:02:19.710> here<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:21.770> could

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
I mean I were to go back here I could

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.740 
I mean I were to go back here I could
hear<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.040> little<00:02:23.160> bit<00:02:23.340> back<00:02:23.460> here<00:02:23.790> but<00:02:24.480> if<00:02:24.600> I

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
hear it a little bit back here but if I

between the bulbs they don't break which
is<00:03:07.410> good<00:03:07.560> but<00:03:07.830> get<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.670> take<00:03:08.910> that<00:03:09.090> out<00:03:09.239> remove

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
is good but get to take that out remove

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.870 
is good but get to take that out remove
this<00:03:09.870> like<00:03:10.610> in<00:03:11.610> plastic<00:03:12.180> sheet<00:03:12.420> they<00:03:12.600> put<00:03:12.810> on

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
this like in plastic sheet they put on

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.640 
this like in plastic sheet they put on
like<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.270> splash<00:03:15.510> guard<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:16.080> take<00:03:16.350> that<00:03:16.470> off

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
like the splash guard you take that off

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.990 
like the splash guard you take that off
and<00:03:16.680> we<00:03:16.920> could<00:03:17.040> take<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.340> outfit<00:03:17.730> would

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
and we could take that outfit would

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.660 
and we could take that outfit would
melts<00:03:18.360> most<00:03:18.570> likely<00:03:18.930> because<00:03:19.020> it<00:03:19.280> can<00:03:20.280> get<00:03:20.459> hot

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
melts most likely because it can get hot

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.449 
melts most likely because it can get hot
but<00:03:20.970> mine<00:03:21.120> isn't<00:03:21.300> like<00:03:21.480> it<00:03:21.600> too<00:03:21.750> hot<00:03:22.340> it's<00:03:23.340> not
