just about to go riding but I figured

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.480 
I'd do that review for you guys real
quick<00:00:25.019> but<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.670> start<00:00:26.880> out<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.980> 2005<00:00:28.980> CBR

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
quick but to start out it is a 2005 CBR

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.020 
quick but to start out it is a 2005 CBR
600<00:00:29.970> f4<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.349> I<00:00:31.349> have<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.859> banana<00:00:31.980> C<00:00:32.340> which<00:00:32.700> I

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
600 f4 I I have the banana C which I

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.639 
600 f4 I I have the banana C which I
actually<00:00:33.180> like<00:00:33.390> it's<00:00:33.809> not<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.170> aesthetically

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
actually like it's not so aesthetically

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.209 
actually like it's not so aesthetically
pleasing<00:00:34.739> but<00:00:35.450> it's<00:00:36.450> very<00:00:36.690> very<00:00:36.899> comfortable

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
pleasing but it's very very comfortable

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.130 
pleasing but it's very very comfortable
the<00:00:38.219> only<00:00:38.399> issue<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:39.510> can<00:00:39.629> see<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.899> slant

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
the only issue is you can see the slant

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.810 
the only issue is you can see the slant
on<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.379> when<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.860> have<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.010> passenger<00:00:41.370> they

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
on it when you have a passenger they

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.760 
on it when you have a passenger they
pretty<00:00:42.360> much<00:00:42.540> pump<00:00:42.989> your<00:00:43.170> back<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.559> entire

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
pretty much pump your back the entire

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.889 
pretty much pump your back the entire
time<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.700> mean<00:00:45.059> if<00:00:45.149> you're<00:00:45.270> into<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.600> cool

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
time so I mean if you're into that cool

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.380 
time so I mean if you're into that cool
but<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.280> little<00:00:47.399> annoying<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:48.210> me

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
but it's a little annoying to me

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.029 
but it's a little annoying to me
especially<00:00:49.260> if<00:00:49.590> they<00:00:49.649> don't<00:00:49.829> know<00:00:49.890> how<00:00:49.980> to

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
especially if they don't know how to

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.650 
especially if they don't know how to
ride<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.550> push<00:00:50.730> on<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> tank<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.360> support

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
ride and push on the tank to support

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.709 
ride and push on the tank to support
themselves<00:00:51.809> but<00:00:52.910> it's<00:00:53.910> still<00:00:54.120> it's<00:00:54.390> a

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
themselves but it's still it's a

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.209 
themselves but it's still it's a
comfortable<00:00:55.140> seat<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.649> think<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.920> offers<00:00:56.010> a

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
comfortable seat and I think it offers a

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.920 
comfortable seat and I think it offers a
little<00:00:56.430> more<00:00:56.550> storage<00:00:56.760> than<00:00:57.149> just<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.629> single

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
little more storage than just a single

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.180 
little more storage than just a single
rear<00:00:58.170> cowl<00:00:58.379> with<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.859> split<00:00:59.520> seat<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:01.190> get

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
rear cowl with the split seat so to get

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.780 
rear cowl with the split seat so to get
to<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:03.449> just<00:01:03.480> get<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.619> little<00:01:04.799> key<00:01:05.519> slot

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
to it you just get that little key slot

peg<00:01:45.869> down<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.350> put<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.890> helmet<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.250> there<00:01:47.520> open

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
peg down I put the helmet on there open

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.460 
peg down I put the helmet on there open
up<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.000> visor<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.869> thread<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.259> lock

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
up the visor and I thread that lock

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.960 
up the visor and I thread that lock
through<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.829> visor<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.220> then<00:01:50.549> through<00:01:50.850> this

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
through the visor and then through this

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.450 
through the visor and then through this
hole<00:01:51.210> right<00:01:51.240> here<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.899> lock<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.799> up<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.100> then

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
hole right here and lock it up and then

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.789 
hole right here and lock it up and then
the<00:01:53.579> helmet<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.060> secured<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.600> bike<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.350> if

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
the helmet is secured to the bike so if

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.380 
the helmet is secured to the bike so if
it's<00:01:55.979> nice<00:01:56.100> out<00:01:56.310> that's<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.670> way<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.850> store<00:01:57.270> my

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
it's nice out that's the way I store my

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.429 
it's nice out that's the way I store my
helmet<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.869> don't<00:01:58.020> have<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.200> carry<00:01:58.380> it

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
helmet so you don't have to carry it

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.690 
helmet so you don't have to carry it
anywhere<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:59.670> also<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.840> disc<00:02:01.290> lock<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:02.460> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
anywhere I also have a disc lock on the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.550 
anywhere I also have a disc lock on the
rear<00:02:02.880> brake<00:02:03.119> there<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:04.049> goes<00:02:04.200> through<00:02:04.469> the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
rear brake there and it goes through the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.709 
rear brake there and it goes through the
holes<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.070> rear<00:02:05.219> brake<00:02:05.490> locks<00:02:06.270> up<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:06.630> you

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
holes in the rear brake locks up so you

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.949 
holes in the rear brake locks up so you
can't<00:02:06.899> roll<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.200> bike<00:02:08.209> so<00:02:09.209> with<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.539> in<00:02:09.780> with

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
can't roll the bike so with that in with

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.240 
can't roll the bike so with that in with
the<00:02:10.050> forks<00:02:10.319> being<00:02:10.500> locked<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.860> left<00:02:11.069> you

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
the forks being locked to the left you

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.720 
the forks being locked to the left you
hope<00:02:11.400> that's<00:02:11.580> enough<00:02:11.730> anti-theft

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
hope that's enough anti-theft

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.940 
hope that's enough anti-theft
people<00:02:12.909> to<00:02:12.970> think<00:02:13.150> twice<00:02:13.349> but<00:02:14.349> when<00:02:14.769> push

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
people to think twice but when push

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.110 
people to think twice but when push
comes<00:02:15.159> to<00:02:15.190> shove<00:02:15.400> if<00:02:15.550> somebody<00:02:15.790> wants<00:02:16.000> your

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
comes to shove if somebody wants your

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.240 
comes to shove if somebody wants your
bike<00:02:16.269> they're<00:02:16.629> going<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.810> take<00:02:16.959> it<00:02:17.159> you<00:02:18.159> know

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
bike they're going to take it you know

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.860 
bike they're going to take it you know
four<00:02:18.700> or<00:02:18.730> five<00:02:18.879> guys<00:02:19.090> can<00:02:19.330> lift<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.569> bike<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:19.810> go

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
four or five guys can lift a bike and go

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.500 
four or five guys can lift a bike and go
back<00:02:20.049> in<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.230> truck<00:02:20.379> so<00:02:21.120> it's<00:02:22.120> just<00:02:22.330> one<00:02:22.480> of

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
back in the truck so it's just one of

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.729 
back in the truck so it's just one of
the<00:02:22.629> risks<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:22.900> take<00:02:22.930> and<00:02:23.409> that's<00:02:23.560> why<00:02:23.680> you

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
the risks you take and that's why you

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.369 
the risks you take and that's why you
have<00:02:23.860> insurance<00:02:24.129> so<00:02:24.870> undertale<00:02:25.870> storage<00:02:26.170> is

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
have insurance so undertale storage is

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.460 
have insurance so undertale storage is
okay<00:02:26.739> I<00:02:26.769> guess<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:28.060> battery<00:02:28.390> is<00:02:28.629> deep<00:02:29.230> down

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
okay I guess the battery is deep down

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.380 
okay I guess the battery is deep down
there<00:02:29.680> in<00:02:29.830> this<00:02:29.920> little<00:02:30.040> central<00:02:30.489> spot<00:02:31.120> there

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
there in this little central spot there

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.000 
there in this little central spot there
you<00:02:31.750> can't<00:02:31.989> really<00:02:32.140> hold<00:02:32.290> anything<00:02:32.739> in<00:02:32.890> there

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
you can't really hold anything in there

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.759 
you can't really hold anything in there
just<00:02:33.190> rolls<00:02:33.430> round<00:02:33.640> bounces<00:02:34.120> around<00:02:34.239> so<00:02:34.769> it's

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
just rolls round bounces around so it's

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.309 
just rolls round bounces around so it's
just<00:02:35.890> this<00:02:36.040> little<00:02:36.310> under<00:02:36.670> tail<00:02:36.879> there<00:02:37.120> but<00:02:38.080> I

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
just this little under tail there but I

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.250 
just this little under tail there but I
find<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.250> be<00:02:39.280> sufficient<00:02:39.940> for<00:02:40.110> what<00:02:41.110> I<00:02:41.140> do

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
find it to be sufficient for what I do

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.110 
find it to be sufficient for what I do
when<00:02:41.860> I<00:02:41.890> commute<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.400> really<00:02:42.640> I<00:02:42.819> carry<00:02:43.060> a

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
when I commute I really I carry a

when I commute I really I carry a
backpack<00:02:43.360> anyway<00:02:43.900> so<00:02:43.959> not<00:02:44.739> a<00:02:44.769> big<00:02:44.950> deal<00:02:45.190> but

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
backpack anyway so not a big deal but

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.539 
backpack anyway so not a big deal but
moving<00:02:46.510> up<00:02:46.660> I<00:02:46.840> my<00:02:47.200> program<00:02:47.650> tank<00:02:48.310> pad

really talk that hard because I'm

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.569 
really talk that hard because I'm

laying<00:02:57.790> on<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.030> tank<00:02:58.239> but<00:02:58.569> it's<00:02:59.109> still<00:02:59.260> a<00:02:59.319> nice

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
laying on the tank but it's still a nice

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.800 
laying on the tank but it's still a nice
addition<00:02:59.859> to<00:02:59.950> have<00:03:00.129> I<00:03:00.459> actually<00:03:01.239> tried<00:03:01.569> to<00:03:01.599> get

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
addition to have I actually tried to get

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.080 
addition to have I actually tried to get
some<00:03:01.959> stomp<00:03:02.200> grips<00:03:02.500> for<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.769> side<00:03:02.950> here<00:03:03.250> so

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
some stomp grips for the side here so

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.000 
some stomp grips for the side here so
you<00:03:04.390> could<00:03:04.480> have<00:03:04.660> some<00:03:04.840> grip<00:03:05.530> there<00:03:05.739> but<00:03:05.920> they

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
you could have some grip there but they

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.680 
you could have some grip there but they
never<00:03:06.190> stuck<00:03:06.519> correctly<00:03:07.000> which<00:03:07.269> kind<00:03:07.629> of

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
never stuck correctly which kind of

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.119 
never stuck correctly which kind of
sucks<00:03:07.900> that's<00:03:08.140> a<00:03:08.230> waste<00:03:08.410> of<00:03:08.530> 50<00:03:08.799> bucks<00:03:08.980> but

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
sucks that's a waste of 50 bucks but

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:10.020 
sucks that's a waste of 50 bucks but
what<00:03:09.459> are<00:03:09.519> you<00:03:09.579> going<00:03:09.670> to<00:03:09.760> do

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
what are you going to do

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.509 
what are you going to do
so<00:03:10.239> moving<00:03:10.930> up<00:03:11.019> to<00:03:11.109> the<00:03:11.140> gas<00:03:11.349> tank<00:03:11.560> some<00:03:12.190> tanks

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
so moving up to the gas tank some tanks

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.479 
so moving up to the gas tank some tanks
screw<00:03:12.819> off<00:03:13.000> this<00:03:13.720> one<00:03:13.900> is<00:03:14.049> just<00:03:14.170> a<00:03:14.290> simple<00:03:14.489> flip

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
screw off this one is just a simple flip

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.110 
screw off this one is just a simple flip
that<00:03:15.670> up<00:03:15.819> stick<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.810> key<00:03:16.959> in<00:03:17.549> push<00:03:18.549> down<00:03:18.790> turn

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
that up stick the key in push down turn

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.259 
that up stick the key in push down turn
to<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.329> right<00:03:19.769> fold<00:03:20.769> it<00:03:20.919> up<00:03:21.040> so<00:03:21.669> I<00:03:21.970> think

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
to the right fold it up so I think

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.990 
to the right fold it up so I think
that's<00:03:22.510> pretty<00:03:22.690> simple<00:03:22.930> pretty<00:03:23.169> cool<00:03:24.000> and

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
that's pretty simple pretty cool and

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.210 
that's pretty simple pretty cool and
then<00:03:25.690> moving<00:03:25.930> up<00:03:26.139> to<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.410> -<00:03:27.299> we<00:03:28.299> have<00:03:28.599> a<00:03:29.349> pretty

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
then moving up to the - we have a pretty

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.300 
then moving up to the - we have a pretty
standard<00:03:30.639> -<00:03:30.880> I<00:03:31.090> think<00:03:31.859> you<00:03:32.859> know<00:03:32.980> standard

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310
