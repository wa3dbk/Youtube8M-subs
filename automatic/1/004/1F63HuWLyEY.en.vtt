00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.650
 raymond wales in europe then we 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:14.799
 get into trouble how many 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.579
 time the first rounds hadrons would 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:20.329
 even more conditional on disemboweled in 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.759
 europe to fade 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:26.210
 finally eighteenth century by the less than 10 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:28.340
 years whose rhododendron was born on 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.340
 foothills of the Himalayas in the area 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.930
 south east of the Himalayas yet it's not 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.370
 the same climate in Brittany it is 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.930
 really it's not even climate this 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.760
 is not even the same floor so 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.570
 the addition if you want a soil 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.969
 wet and bitter acid a supply of water 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.359
 permanent allows the Bretons to 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:49.190
 develop correctly you are I 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:50.600
 fell in love happy I am 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.120
 passionate about nature that's why I 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.839
 think and I sought to discover their 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.219
 on the back from its origin until 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:00.589
 currently you who are passionate 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.030
 rhododendron lovers sold months 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:03.319
 give them give me all 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.940
 strengths that could do that I have 

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:06.620
 want to grow at home we 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.500
 let's go back and there you are the agent of the 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.409
 rhododendron alesi and will roll can 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.660
 bring you a lot of happiness by 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.620
 the times of flowering one can have 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.360
 by choosing its varieties these species 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.400
 will run in bloom from 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.620
 February until September 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.170
 does the rhododendron m and needs 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.460
 to make north of loire 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.770
 it can tolerate sunshine 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.390
 quite important on the other hand south of the 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.490
 I think it's better to 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.870
 plant in partial shade so that 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.700
 flowering is the longest 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.860
 possible a flowering rhododendron 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.810
 summer must be planted in London 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.670
 otherwise the flowering is too short 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.120
 that it is the range of colors that we 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.890
 can find 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.810
 you can find all the colors 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.910
 possible except blue the others 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.450
 colors is found a rhododendron of the 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.760
 bright red of the show almost black the 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.920
 buttons generally future 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.370
 flowers appear very early very early 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.860
 the buttons are always formed at the end 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.630
 from the summer before flowering 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.460
 there is a specific size to do on 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.170
 the rhododendron 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.350
 we let live all is well one 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.950
 principle to remember the size of 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.170
 camellia rhododendrons of a magnolia must 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.209
 to be done immediately the flowering ends 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.890
 the last flower is barely fans and 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.970
 that you have to pay just nothing 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.230
 did not have a little tip for 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.819
 remove the faded flowers on the 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.950
 rhododendrons 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:31.000
 if we leave the faded flowers in 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.410
 places sexual function continues and 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.970
 to consume a lot 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.160
 of energy and goats 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.170
 so we remove the faded flower in 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.620
 learning completely quickly and in 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.030
 breaking the button then you talked 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.370
 of the sexual function of rhododendron 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.260
 yes what is this is the 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.110
 flowering simply as they are 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.660
 hermaphrodites report sex or female 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.390
 with a good track he and then of 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.130
 stamens so both functions are 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.290
 insured by the same plane geof a few 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.300
 ex ps i think for example the renaudin 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.750
 dron and masculine and masculine he wears 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.200
 well his name 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.280
 they wear well he does not have a family 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.840
 all the big jobs are scented 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.730
 do not have all the assets the 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.489
 fragrant psi rhododendrons a few 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.920
 rhododendrons are perfumed so 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:17.680
 extraordinary then the perfume it is 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.570
 very subtle and he is not haunted by 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.120
 the expense of time at all it's a 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.579
 apple honeysuckle fragrance and 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.140
 lemon mix and at which moment of the 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.239
 day we better perceive the park the 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.110
 morning of course to the roger allard to 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.490
 elected lost 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.750
 playful rhododendrons dock in his 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.050
 container what to do 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.270
 you can start by enjoying it 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.340
 blooming by leaving it to the pot but in 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.260
 watering it regularly and when it's 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.360
 blooming is over you remove the 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.550
 flowers and you plant your will join 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.860
 in the open ground to do this it takes 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.840
 dig a hole that is about 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.880
 three times the size of the mound in 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.460
 width especially the depth does not have 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.380
 a lot of importance the racing of the rose 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.450
 from the north remains very very very 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.450
 superficial fashion must be planted 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.910
 at ground level not in depth a 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.730
 very abundant watering and then you 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.900
 pay employment the manure if possible of 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.850
 horse manure cost of the material 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.310
 organic on December 1st to the first 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.010
 no technical nemo to make remember 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.130
 to amateurs that this is the entrance to 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.130
 Winter
