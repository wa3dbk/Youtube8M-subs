of the goggle the sinister is really
flat<00:00:16.080> yeah<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:17.039> x5<00:00:17.430> has<00:00:17.670> taken<00:00:18.090> has<00:00:18.630> taken

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
flat yeah the x5 has taken has taken

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.390 
flat yeah the x5 has taken has taken
this<00:00:19.080> brow<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.650> lifted<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.010> up<00:00:20.039> about<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.340> half

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
this brow and lifted it up about a half

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.599 
this brow and lifted it up about a half
an<00:00:20.760> inch<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.689> what<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:21.960> see<00:00:22.199> there<00:00:22.410> is<00:00:22.609> no

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
know everything outside of that

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.140 
know everything outside of that
the<00:00:29.800> other<00:00:29.920> thing<00:00:30.160> we've<00:00:30.310> done<00:00:30.340> is<00:00:30.820> we've

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
the other thing we've done is we've

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.870 
the other thing we've done is we've
taken<00:00:31.180> our<00:00:31.990> hinge<00:00:32.259> points<00:00:32.619> here<00:00:32.770> and<00:00:32.980> we've

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 
taken our hinge points here and we've

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.550 
taken our hinge points here and we've
actually<00:00:34.030> created<00:00:34.690> an<00:00:34.960> outrigger<00:00:35.260> type

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:35.560 
actually created an outrigger type

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.770 
actually created an outrigger type
system<00:00:35.950> which<00:00:36.100> is<00:00:36.250> you<00:00:36.940> know<00:00:37.000> highly<00:00:37.330> used<00:00:37.570> in

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
system which is you know highly used in

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.830 
system which is you know highly used in
like<00:00:37.960> inter<00:00:38.920> goggles<00:00:39.130> and<00:00:39.520> motocross<00:00:39.840> what

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
like inter goggles and motocross what

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.770 
like inter goggles and motocross what
the<00:00:40.960> outrigger<00:00:41.320> does<00:00:41.590> is<00:00:41.920> it<00:00:42.400> it<00:00:42.790> pulls<00:00:43.059> a

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
the outrigger does is it it pulls a

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.439 
the outrigger does is it it pulls a
pulsar<00:00:44.470> hinge<00:00:44.710> point<00:00:44.980> out<00:00:45.160> to<00:00:45.340> about<00:00:45.430> here<00:00:45.760> and

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
pulsar hinge point out to about here and

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:47.700 
pulsar hinge point out to about here and
what<00:00:46.840> that's<00:00:47.020> going<00:00:47.110> to<00:00:47.170> do<00:00:47.320> is<00:00:47.410> it's<00:00:47.440> going<00:00:47.620> to

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
what that's going to do is it's going to

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.869 
what that's going to do is it's going to
help<00:00:47.800> pull<00:00:48.070> your<00:00:48.220> goggle<00:00:48.550> a<00:00:48.580> little<00:00:48.760> bit

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
help pull your goggle a little bit

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.160 
help pull your goggle a little bit
further<00:00:49.000> back<00:00:49.270> in<00:00:49.449> the<00:00:49.480> helmet<00:00:49.840> and<00:00:49.870> create<00:00:50.140> a

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
further back in the helmet and create a

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.900 
further back in the helmet and create a
better<00:00:50.350> seal<00:00:50.650> it's<00:00:51.250> going<00:00:51.370> to<00:00:51.430> make<00:00:51.550> a<00:00:51.580> huge

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
better seal it's going to make a huge

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.360 
better seal it's going to make a huge
change<00:00:51.940> now<00:00:52.420> the<00:00:52.480> sinister<00:00:52.930> works<00:00:53.260> it's<00:00:53.800> feels

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
change now the sinister works it's feels

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.960 
change now the sinister works it's feels
performs<00:00:55.150> we've<00:00:55.809> also<00:00:56.019> added<00:00:56.530> a<00:00:56.800> new<00:00:57.400> lens

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
performs we've also added a new lens

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.689 
performs we've also added a new lens
coating<00:00:58.330> we've<00:00:58.860> gone<00:00:59.860> with<00:01:00.010> a<00:01:00.100> polycarbonate

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
coating we've gone with a polycarbonate

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.270 
coating we've gone with a polycarbonate
outside<00:01:01.239> lens<00:01:01.480> which<00:01:01.690> we've<00:01:02.020> already<00:01:02.140> had<00:01:02.440> and

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
then we've also put a polycarbonate lens

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.010 
then we've also put a polycarbonate lens
on<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.050> inside<00:01:05.380> too<00:01:05.590> which<00:01:06.430> is<00:01:06.640> huge<00:01:07.600> I<00:01:07.869> mean

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
on the inside too which is huge I mean

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.540 
on the inside too which is huge I mean
that's<00:01:08.140> a<00:01:08.350> that's<00:01:08.530> a<00:01:08.649> huge<00:01:08.890> step<00:01:08.920> up<00:01:09.220> for<00:01:09.399> us

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
right now in medical and military

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.340 
right now in medical and military
applications<00:01:16.479> and<00:01:16.780> we're<00:01:16.960> going<00:01:17.170> to<00:01:17.200> be<00:01:17.289> the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
applications and we're going to be the

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
applications and we're going to be the
first<00:01:17.560> ones<00:01:17.800> to<00:01:17.890> take<00:01:18.130> this

about that opinion colorways for the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.250 
about that opinion colorways for the
evolution<00:01:25.410> helmet<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:26.580> have<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:27.000> fire<00:01:27.300> we

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
evolution helmet we have a fire we

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.680 
evolution helmet we have a fire we
have<00:01:28.440> our<00:01:28.590> froth<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:29.280> evolution<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.180> then<00:01:30.570> a

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
have our froth on evolution and then a

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.890 
have our froth on evolution and then a
stealth<00:01:31.050> mat<00:01:31.620> helmet<00:01:32.160> here<00:01:32.600> so<00:01:33.600> these<00:01:33.720> are

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
stealth mat helmet here so these are

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.360 
stealth mat helmet here so these are
just<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.170> few<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.440> the<00:01:34.650> new<00:01:34.740> colors<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.280> these

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
just a few of the new colors and these

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.800 
just a few of the new colors and these
are<00:01:35.490> actually<00:01:35.760> just<00:01:35.940> prototypes<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.540> we<00:01:36.690> have

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
are actually just prototypes so we have

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.410 
are actually just prototypes so we have
out<00:01:36.960> right<00:01:37.140> now<00:01:37.260> so<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:37.680> don't<00:01:37.710> even<00:01:37.950> have<00:01:38.420> you

program this year again we're we're in
prototyping<00:02:01.979> stages<00:02:02.400> right<00:02:02.520> now<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.820> we<00:02:02.940> just

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
prototyping stages right now and we just

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.710 
prototyping stages right now and we just
don't<00:02:03.360> have<00:02:03.630> one<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:03.960> display<00:02:05.479> it's<00:02:06.479> going<00:02:06.660> to

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
don't have one to display it's going to

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.450 
don't have one to display it's going to
be<00:02:06.810> lighter<00:02:07.020> it's<00:02:07.290> going<00:02:07.410> to<00:02:07.440> be<00:02:07.530> stronger<00:02:07.860> the

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
be lighter it's going to be stronger the

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.980 
be lighter it's going to be stronger the
fit<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.700> finish<00:02:08.820> is<00:02:09.119> going<00:02:09.240> to<00:02:09.300> be<00:02:09.360> better<00:02:09.570> so

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
fit and finish is going to be better so

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.990 
fit and finish is going to be better so
basically<00:02:10.410> we're<00:02:10.709> taking<00:02:11.040> an<00:02:11.580> already
