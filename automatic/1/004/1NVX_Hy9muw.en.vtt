drawback with doing this is I you need

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.579 
drawback with doing this is I you need
to<00:00:48.399> get<00:00:48.519> this<00:00:48.729> green<00:00:49.360> in<00:00:49.570> the<00:00:49.720> same<00:00:49.989> position

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
to get this green in the same position

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:53.219 
to get this green in the same position
every<00:00:50.979> time<00:00:51.190> you<00:00:51.399> use<00:00:51.430> the<00:00:51.670> trick<00:00:52.120> a<00:00:52.390> trick

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:53.229 
every time you use the trick a trick

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:56.729 
every time you use the trick a trick
that<00:00:53.439> I<00:00:53.470> use<00:00:53.949> is<00:00:54.220> to<00:00:54.629> place<00:00:55.629> a<00:00:55.839> hay<00:00:56.140> bale<00:00:56.170> in

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
that I use is to place a hay bale in

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.429 
that I use is to place a hay bale in
between<00:00:57.220> the<00:00:57.369> gap<00:00:57.640> between<00:00:58.390> your<00:00:58.869> neighbors

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
they are ready or not it is best to use

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.910 
they are ready or not it is best to use
gold<00:01:36.180> chickens<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.840> fill<00:01:37.079> your<00:01:37.229> cube<00:01:37.530> to
