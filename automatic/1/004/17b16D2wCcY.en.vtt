00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.769
 to catch them 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.050
 It seems a typical attraction of 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.859
 Disneyland I seem the same entangling 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.050
 but good does not matter 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.900
 we are in this kind of spiral eye 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.730
 wall and only one lap and it's worth not 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.930
 I know how we ball two because it's supposed 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.160
 that is super difficult is can not be 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.019
 it's just a turn and they're three 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.430
 kilometers so let's see if we can 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.170
 We passed for the moment no one was spending it on 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.170
 first person the first person gives me 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.700
 trust did not give these kids 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.230
 difficult actually this line very much 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.489
 because there is something there is a moment that does not 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.230
 he knows if he 's face upside down 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.140
 side to another side in one dimension 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:51.600
 parallel to that of the holy people 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.059
 we got up here you have to turn to 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.710
 evaluate eye for what we have 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.289
 bimbo windows windows good kids 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.160
 everything absolutely controlled and was 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.770
 just what I wanted to do 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.090
 obviously my mother management will think 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.239
 that has been luck you know but that says 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.239
 man 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.230
 he has to catch he has to catch more 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.150
 OK OK 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.380
 to the best that each turn or is a 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.450
 back but you have to go and give two 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.250
 sometimes the spiral to the best who knows 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.500
 that idea of â€‹â€‹my mind has just come up 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.600
 it would be something quite reasonable worth 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.100
 a me that goes ahead and the one that goes 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.290
 first it's called the merchant man that 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.960
 no lighter is does not mess or mercer such 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.910
 which is worth, so there's no reason to do 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.910
 I'm worth jumping around here 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:48.570
 let's go that will be the first one in perfect 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.240
 state gave my mother my mother 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.650
 subscribers that I have to teach you to 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.010
 how to do to fall with the four 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.010
 legs on the ground 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.540
 has come back to sprout but please if the 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.490
 Subscriber merchero we all know that you 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.750

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.790
 few plan to convert your car with 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.370
 lighters 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.370
 jump and move on to the first 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.050
 you have because I would not 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.250
 because now with this but now you are going to 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.960
 see is that very many spirals 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.670
 they are taking out lately those that 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.710
 they are very pretty 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.450
 well called favorites write houses in 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.910
 the country and here I leave you with the subscriber 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.910
