00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.120
 hello I am Sunday of tute of DIY 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.490
 this time I will explain the way 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.320
 it is used to make the spike and the box 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.360
 in wood is an efficient way 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.029
 besides not very complicated to join the 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.470
 woods we started by making the box 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.660
 we trace with the help of a pencil the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.480
 metro the box that we want to open then 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.110
 we use the squads to trace those 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.150
 brands 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.579
 in my case it gives a depth of mass 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.200
 about 2 centimeters to the box a width 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.579
 of one centimeter and a length of 5 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.770
 centimeters long that will have the 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.480
 penalties 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.770
 to make the box I will use a 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.880
 drill to express wood is 8 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.140
 millimeters 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.930
 she is a home buyer that has 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.550
 manufactured both the column drill to 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.800
 from the drill column support by 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.050
 the drill and see how to do it I leave you the 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.700
 link in the upper left of 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.800
 this way you get a box shape 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.490
 quick easy and some results more than 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.470
 acceptable for we see it 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.940
 little by little we are lending the wood 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.290
 using the depth stop to not 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.420
 move on from those 2 centimeters that 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.740
 we look for in addition to the lateral stops 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.540
 who have the homemade cooperator for 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.680
 get the 5 centimeters of box and 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.450
 after a retouching we get the 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.219
 box now we have 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.750
 now it's the turn of the spike 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:16.640
 we use to trace with a pencil the 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.140
 measures that we are going to give in this case 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.759
 those that will have something more than one centimeter 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:25.700
 and half of spike and it will have a 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.369
 centimeter wide and will have all the 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.390
 length of width of the wood that is going to be 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.189
 5 cm 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.539
 obviously the size of the spike 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.610
 It has to match the box 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.950
 so that the spikes enter the box and 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.810
 look good I'm presenting it and in 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.360
 principle because the measures coincide 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.100
 with others to make the spikes 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.630
 we can use a cutting table as it is 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.909
 my case but we can also use a 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.180
 Jig one ingletadora a saw 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.160
 manual wood what we have at home 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.660
 and the task is to eliminate the 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.400
 wood this one gets to make the spikes 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.860
 in case of using a cutting table as 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.390
 in my case it will be both passed with much 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.070
 careful and considering the height 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.229
 of the disk so as not to eliminate more wood and 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.500
 so get a spike with the measurements 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.170
 that interests us in this case the spades 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.020
 we said it was going to have a thickness of one 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.260
 centimeter 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.640
 a depth of 2 and the long all 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.960
 white of the mother who are five 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.910
 centimeters there we have the stacks of 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.680
 terminals 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.600
 and finally and using a lime 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.600
 round one side of the spike for 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.640
 that enters perfectly in the box will be 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.470
 question of going to the file to a 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:34.420
 lateral of the spike until rounding 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.250
 its edges there we have it 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.590
 it has remained rounded and we tested it 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.730
 to see if between perfectly we have it 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.100
 you have to enter with a little 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.440
 resistance because then the union with the 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.560
 tail is perfect we have entered 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:53.319
 perfectly and is glued to the box the 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.390
 Tang come on, everything works fine 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.909
 good if you thought interesting dale 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.379
 I like and share the video subscribed to 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.139
 channel to see the new video that goes 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:06.209
 going up besides supporting in my work 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:06.209
 greetings and until the next video
