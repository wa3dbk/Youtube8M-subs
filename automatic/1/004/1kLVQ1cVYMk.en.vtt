these<00:00:54.480> are<00:00:54.660> Keens<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.350> probably<00:00:56.160> tell<00:00:56.340> by<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
these are Keens in probably tell by the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.090 
these are Keens in probably tell by the
toe<00:00:56.789> design<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.570> pretty<00:00:57.809> distinctive<00:00:58.379> these

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
toe design it's pretty distinctive these

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.660 
toe design it's pretty distinctive these
are<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.460> target<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.090> mids<00:01:01.340> I'm<00:01:02.340> just<00:01:02.460> going<00:01:02.609> to

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
are the target to mids I'm just going to

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.260 
are the target to mids I'm just going to
put<00:01:03.420> one<00:01:03.570> other<00:01:03.750> way<00:01:03.870> here<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:05.119> they're<00:01:06.119> both

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
put one other way here so they're both

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.340 
put one other way here so they're both
the<00:01:06.330> same<00:01:06.510> ones<00:01:07.470> right<00:01:07.680> ones<00:01:07.920> left<00:01:09.260> so<00:01:10.260> it's

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
the same ones right ones left so it's

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.350 
the same ones right ones left so it's
kind<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.530> what<00:01:10.650> they<00:01:10.740> look<00:01:10.860> like<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:12.240> got

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
kind of what they look like so it's got

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.880 
kind of what they look like so it's got
this<00:01:12.479> nice<00:01:12.689> big<00:01:12.900> loop<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.409> back<00:01:13.560> for

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
this nice big loop on the back for

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.560 
this nice big loop on the back for
pulling<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.310> on<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.670> found<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.060> was<00:01:15.180> one<00:01:15.330> thing

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
pulling it on I found that was one thing

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.730 
pulling it on I found that was one thing
that<00:01:15.900> other<00:01:16.650> boots<00:01:16.950> have<00:01:17.670> had<00:01:17.850> before<00:01:18.000> lacked

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
that other boots have had before lacked

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.200 
that other boots have had before lacked
we'll<00:01:19.740> see<00:01:19.920> if<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.189> lasts<00:01:20.460> it's<00:01:20.820> kind<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.090> an

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
we'll see if that lasts it's kind of an

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.039 
we'll see if that lasts it's kind of an
external<00:01:22.340> wrapping<00:01:23.340> which<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:24.000> different<00:01:24.869> I'm

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
external wrapping which is different I'm

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:25.810 
external wrapping which is different I'm
not

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
not

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.550 
not
it<00:01:26.820> wasn't<00:01:27.240> sure<00:01:27.360> if<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.570> was<00:01:27.689> totally<00:01:28.049> sold<00:01:28.380> on

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
it wasn't sure if I was totally sold on

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:37.399 
it wasn't sure if I was totally sold on
that<00:01:28.619> or<00:01:28.950> not<00:01:29.009> but<00:01:30.170> we'll<00:01:31.170> see<00:01:34.490> the<00:01:36.259> reason<00:01:37.259> get

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
that or not but we'll see the reason get

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.950 
that or not but we'll see the reason get
on<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.680> off<00:01:37.770> easy<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.340> lace<00:01:38.490> up<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:39.479> kind<00:01:39.900> of

on and off easy to lace up is kind of

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.410 
on and off easy to lace up is kind of

is not super light but I tried a few
other<00:02:15.770> pairs<00:02:16.160> on<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:16.700> this<00:02:16.790> seemed<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.180> give

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
other pairs on and this seemed to give

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.880 
other pairs on and this seemed to give
the<00:02:17.360> most<00:02:17.660> stability<00:02:20.230> it'll<00:02:21.230> be<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:21.800> other

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
the most stability it'll be the other

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.580 
the most stability it'll be the other
ones<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.760> tread<00:02:23.060> see<00:02:23.540> or<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:23.930> sole<00:02:24.290> of<00:02:24.320> it

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
ones the the tread see or the sole of it

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.620 
ones the the tread see or the sole of it
seem<00:02:24.860> to<00:02:24.890> be<00:02:25.100> you<00:02:25.520> know<00:02:25.610> fairly<00:02:25.910> loose<00:02:26.270> and

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
seem to be you know fairly loose and

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.290 
seem to be you know fairly loose and
it'd<00:02:27.140> be<00:02:27.230> good<00:02:27.380> for<00:02:27.440> light<00:02:28.370> trail<00:02:28.670> hiking<00:02:28.970> but

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
it'd be good for light trail hiking but

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.240 
it'd be good for light trail hiking but
I'm<00:02:29.390> not<00:02:29.510> sure<00:02:29.780> for<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.380> kind<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:30.620> trails<00:02:30.890> I<00:02:31.070> go

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
I'm not sure for the kind of trails I go

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.730 
I'm not sure for the kind of trails I go
on<00:02:31.460> from<00:02:31.730> time<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.120> time<00:02:32.230> so<00:02:33.230> I<00:02:33.260> wanted<00:02:33.560> more

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
breathable membrane on the inside so I

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.310
