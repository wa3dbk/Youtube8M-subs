note inside here I have a fine plate it

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.570 
note inside here I have a fine plate it
helps<00:04:01.510> cut<00:04:01.780> it<00:04:01.900> even<00:04:02.170> smaller<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:02.830> actually

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
helps cut it even smaller and actually

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.490 
helps cut it even smaller and actually
makes<00:04:03.849> it<00:04:04.030> kind<00:04:04.269> of<00:04:04.330> mushy<00:04:04.659> which<00:04:05.049> is<00:04:05.170> what<00:04:05.349> you

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
makes it kind of mushy which is what you

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.910 
makes it kind of mushy which is what you
want<00:04:07.230> guide<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.560> casing<00:04:09.129> off<00:04:10.230> do<00:04:11.230> not<00:04:11.260> over

going to have to tie that off here's how
you<00:04:45.280> make<00:04:45.520> the<00:04:45.760> links<00:04:46.180> decide<00:04:47.110> how<00:04:47.350> long<00:04:47.410> you

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
you make the links decide how long you

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:57.060 
you make the links decide how long you
want<00:04:48.070> it<00:04:48.130> and<00:04:49.139> pinch<00:04:51.810> and<00:04:54.120> twist<00:04:55.919> give<00:04:56.919> it<00:04:57.010> a

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
want it and pinch and twist give it a

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.460 
want it and pinch and twist give it a
couple<00:04:57.250> twists<00:04:57.669> like<00:04:57.849> that<00:04:58.090> and<00:04:58.360> then<00:04:59.050> move<00:04:59.289> on

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
couple twists like that and then move on

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.320 
couple twists like that and then move on
to<00:04:59.620> the<00:04:59.740> next<00:04:59.860> one<00:05:00.130> the<00:05:00.220> next<00:05:00.250> one<00:05:00.760> will<00:05:01.300> be

to the next one the next one will be

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.510 
to the next one the next one will be
twisted<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:01.990> opposite<00:05:02.500> direction<00:05:02.860> so<00:05:03.190> you

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
twisted the opposite direction so you

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:21.030 
twisted the opposite direction so you
won't<00:05:08.099> unlock<00:05:09.099> that<00:05:10.050> so<00:05:11.050> on<00:05:11.260> and<00:05:11.440> so<00:05:11.560> forth

using the s hooks that you've created
from<00:05:36.650> wire<00:05:37.990> make<00:05:38.990> sure<00:05:39.230> the<00:05:39.380> meat<00:05:39.590> is<00:05:39.740> not

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
from wire make sure the meat is not

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.190 
from wire make sure the meat is not
touching<00:05:40.430> each<00:05:40.520> other<00:05:40.810> because<00:05:41.810> you<00:05:41.930> want<00:05:42.080> the

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
touching each other because you want the

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.030 
touching each other because you want the
smoke<00:05:43.210> to<00:05:44.210> go<00:05:44.360> all<00:05:44.570> the<00:05:44.600> way<00:05:44.810> around<00:05:45.170> and<00:05:45.410> all

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
smoke to go all the way around and all

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.650 
smoke to go all the way around and all
the<00:05:46.130> way<00:05:46.250> through<00:05:46.750> each<00:05:47.750> link<00:05:49.180> it's<00:05:50.180> best<00:05:50.540> to

the way through each link it's best to

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.750 
the way through each link it's best to
use<00:05:50.780> a<00:05:51.050> digital<00:05:51.530> meat<00:05:51.980> thermometer<00:05:52.630> and<00:05:54.760> to

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
use a digital meat thermometer and to

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.170 
use a digital meat thermometer and to
place<00:05:56.030> it<00:05:56.300> inside<00:05:56.480> one<00:05:57.320> of<00:05:57.350> the<00:05:57.500> links<00:05:58.150> so<00:05:59.150> you

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
place it inside one of the links so you

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.250 
place it inside one of the links so you
can<00:05:59.420> monitor<00:05:59.720> the<00:06:00.230> internal<00:06:00.410> temperature<00:06:02.260> we

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
can monitor the internal temperature we

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.280 
can monitor the internal temperature we
