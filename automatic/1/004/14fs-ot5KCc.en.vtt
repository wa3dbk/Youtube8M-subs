jumps and tumbling after you've mastered

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.709 
jumps and tumbling after you've mastered
your<00:00:10.500> roundoff<00:00:11.070> you're<00:00:11.940> able<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.420> start

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
your roundoff you're able to start

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.079 
your roundoff you're able to start
moving<00:00:12.929> on<00:00:13.230> into<00:00:13.620> more<00:00:14.009> advanced<00:00:14.460> tumbling

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
moving on into more advanced tumbling

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.599 
moving on into more advanced tumbling
now<00:00:15.780> advanced<00:00:16.260> tumbling<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:17.039> most<00:00:17.340> easily

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
now advanced tumbling is most easily

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.840 
now advanced tumbling is most easily
done<00:00:18.420> in<00:00:18.890> combination<00:00:19.890> from<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.340> roundoff

done in combination from a roundoff

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.220 
done in combination from a roundoff
because<00:00:21.420> you're<00:00:21.539> going<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.750> get<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.900> lot<00:00:22.199> of

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
because you're going to get a lot of

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.370 
because you're going to get a lot of
momentum<00:00:23.300> demonstrated<00:00:24.300> right<00:00:24.510> here<00:00:24.869> are<00:00:25.080> the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
momentum demonstrated right here are the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.660 
momentum demonstrated right here are the
steps<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.830> you're<00:00:26.010> going<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.220> take<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.580> a

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
steps that you're going to take in a

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.580 
steps that you're going to take in a
back<00:00:26.849> handspring<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.630> highly<00:00:28.439> recommend

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
back handspring I highly recommend

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.650 
back handspring I highly recommend
starting<00:00:29.220> out<00:00:29.460> with<00:00:29.580> spotters<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.510> going

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
starting out with spotters this is going

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.330 
starting out with spotters this is going
to<00:00:30.720> be<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.900> best<00:00:31.140> way<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:32.009> learn<00:00:32.130> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
to be the best way to learn the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.549 
to be the best way to learn the
movements<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:33.000> slow<00:00:33.270> motion<00:00:33.540> then<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.320> can<00:00:34.469> go

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
movements in slow motion then you can go

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.860 
movements in slow motion then you can go
ahead<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.860> take<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.250> from<00:00:35.460> there<00:00:35.550> now<00:00:36.540> we<00:00:36.600> can

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
ahead and take it from there now we can

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.410 
ahead and take it from there now we can
also<00:00:37.110> do<00:00:37.500> all<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.680> these<00:00:37.950> tumbles<00:00:38.640> which<00:00:39.239> we're

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
also do all of these tumbles which we're

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.780 
also do all of these tumbles which we're
going<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.629> call<00:00:39.780> standing<00:00:40.559> format<00:00:41.040> instead<00:00:41.280> of

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
going to call standing format instead of

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.459 
going to call standing format instead of
running<00:00:42.149> which<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.480> linked<00:00:42.809> on<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.290> round

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
running which is linked on to the round

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.529 
running which is linked on to the round
off<00:00:43.649> now<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:44.579> important<00:00:45.120> when<00:00:45.420> you're

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
off now it's important when you're

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.139 
off now it's important when you're
learning<00:00:45.809> your<00:00:46.530> back<00:00:46.680> handspring<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:48.000> have

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
learning your back handspring to have

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.540 
learning your back handspring to have
tons<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.989> matted<00:00:49.500> floors<00:00:49.800> these<00:00:50.219> are<00:00:50.370> going<00:00:50.489> to

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
tons of matted floors these are going to

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.790 
tons of matted floors these are going to
be<00:00:50.610> provided<00:00:51.210> by<00:00:51.690> your<00:00:51.870> facility<00:00:52.440> when<00:00:52.680> you're

be provided by your facility when you're

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.040 
be provided by your facility when you're
tumbling<00:00:53.039> now<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:53.969> correct<00:00:54.449> position<00:00:54.930> to

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
tumbling now the correct position to

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.420 
tumbling now the correct position to
start<00:00:55.350> off<00:00:55.469> with<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.710> back<00:00:55.920> handspring

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
start off with the back handspring

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.220 
start off with the back handspring
you're<00:00:57.210> going<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.420> want<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.690> bend<00:00:57.960> at<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
you're going to want to bend at the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.250 
you're going to want to bend at the
knees<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.980> rock<00:00:59.460> back<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.120> your<00:01:00.270> heels<00:01:00.570> as<00:01:00.840> you

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
take off so it's really important your

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.969 
take off so it's really important your
spotter<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.539> going<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.750> be<00:01:03.840> behind<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.409> we're

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
and landing on the palms of our hands

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.700 
and landing on the palms of our hands
make<00:01:09.689> sure<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.960> can<00:01:10.110> keep<00:01:10.290> your<00:01:10.409> arms

straight and you want to do a little

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.910 
straight and you want to do a little
shrug<00:01:12.390> at<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.630> shoulder<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.260> then<00:01:13.770> you're

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
shrug at the shoulder and then you're

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.100 
shrug at the shoulder and then you're
going<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.070> pop<00:01:14.310> out<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.850> similarly<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.080> how

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
going to pop out of it similarly to how

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.070 
going to pop out of it similarly to how
you<00:01:16.259> would<00:01:16.380> pop<00:01:16.710> out<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.640> handstand<00:01:18.080> now

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
you would pop out of a handstand now

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.410 
you would pop out of a handstand now
it's<00:01:19.409> also<00:01:19.680> important<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.610> learn<00:01:20.759> once<00:01:21.210> you've

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
it's also important to learn once you've

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.749 
it's also important to learn once you've
mastered<00:01:21.600> your<00:01:21.960> back<00:01:22.140> handspring<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.220> second

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
mastered your back handspring the second

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.219 
mastered your back handspring the second
high<00:01:23.939> level<00:01:24.299> skill<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.750> going<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:24.990> be<00:01:25.110> your

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
high level skill is going to be your

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.830 
high level skill is going to be your
tuck<00:01:25.560> now<00:01:26.520> first<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.180> need<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.420> master<00:01:27.750> your

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
tuck now first you need to master your

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.380 
tuck now first you need to master your
tuck<00:01:28.110> jump<00:01:28.500> which<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.430> going<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:29.700> this

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390

mastered<00:02:41.010> your<00:02:41.129> layout<00:02:41.549> you<00:02:42.150> can<00:02:42.329> start<00:02:42.599> doing

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
mastered your layout you can start doing

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.140 
mastered your layout you can start doing
fools<00:02:43.290> which<00:02:43.680> are<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:43.920> most<00:02:44.099> fun<00:02:44.430> tumbling<00:02:45.000> a

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
fool is going to be a layout in this

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.349 
fool is going to be a layout in this
position<00:02:48.540> with<00:02:49.319> a<00:02:49.500> full<00:02:49.860> rotation<00:02:50.400> in<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.120> air

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.630 
position with a full rotation in the air
those<00:02:51.989> are<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.200> most<00:02:52.379> difficult<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.190> tumbling

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
those are the most difficult of tumbling

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.180 
those are the most difficult of tumbling
passages<00:02:54.239> good<00:02:55.109> way<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.319> master<00:02:55.739> those<00:02:55.890> is

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
passages good way to master those is

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.910 
passages good way to master those is
using<00:02:56.549> trampolines<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.870> can<00:02:58.049> use<00:02:58.170> foam<00:02:58.530> pits

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
using trampolines you can use foam pits

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.650 
using trampolines you can use foam pits
and<00:02:59.220> also<00:02:59.970> definitely<00:03:00.629> use<00:03:01.019> lots<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:01.410> mats
