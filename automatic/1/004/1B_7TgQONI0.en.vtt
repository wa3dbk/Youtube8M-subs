Darren

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.600 

so<00:00:59.700> we're<00:00:59.850> out<00:00:59.880> using<00:01:00.300> a

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
so we're out using a

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.090 
so we're out using a
greenhouse<00:01:01.090> we<00:01:01.750> have<00:01:01.870> quite<00:01:02.530> a<00:01:02.560> few<00:01:02.620> colonies

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
greenhouse we have quite a few colonies

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.890 
greenhouse we have quite a few colonies
here<00:01:03.310> this<00:01:03.490> is<00:01:03.640> one<00:01:03.820> of<00:01:03.850> them<00:01:04.059> the<00:01:04.420> first<00:01:04.660> part

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
here this is one of them the first part

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.450 
here this is one of them the first part
of<00:01:04.989> our<00:01:05.080> experiment<00:01:05.740> is<00:01:05.860> going<00:01:06.160> to<00:01:06.340> be

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
of our experiment is going to be

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.730 
of our experiment is going to be
capturing<00:01:06.910> these<00:01:07.290> we're<00:01:08.290> only<00:01:08.440> going<00:01:08.590> to<00:01:08.680> be

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
capturing these we're only going to be

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.780 
capturing these we're only going to be
capturing<00:01:09.130> foragers<00:01:09.640> because<00:01:10.090> we'll<00:01:10.390> have<00:01:10.630> to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
capturing foragers because we'll have to

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.310 
capturing foragers because we'll have to
actually<00:01:12.790> be<00:01:12.910> seeing<00:01:13.180> if<00:01:13.360> these<00:01:13.540> foragers<00:01:13.990> can

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
actually be seeing if these foragers can

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.719 
actually be seeing if these foragers can
learn<00:01:14.710> we<00:01:15.640> do<00:01:15.880> this<00:01:16.060> by<00:01:16.390> coming<00:01:17.260> up<00:01:17.350> to<00:01:17.470> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
learn we do this by coming up to the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.320 
learn we do this by coming up to the
high<00:01:18.729> and<00:01:19.950> capturing<00:01:20.950> them<00:01:21.190> right<00:01:22.000> as<00:01:22.180> they're

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
high and capturing them right as they're

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:31.880 
high and capturing them right as they're
taking<00:01:22.660> off

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.360 

here<00:01:32.460> we<00:01:32.580> go<00:01:32.700> one<00:01:33.510> beat<00:01:33.690> up<00:01:33.870> captured<00:01:34.410> so<00:01:35.220> now

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
here we go one beat up captured so now

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.790 
here we go one beat up captured so now
will<00:01:35.700> cold<00:01:36.090> enough<00:01:36.270> size<00:01:36.570> them<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.080> harness

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
will cold enough size them and harness

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.460 
will cold enough size them and harness
them<00:01:38.010> they<00:01:38.220> can<00:01:38.340> get<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:38.520> with<00:01:38.580> our<00:01:38.730> experiment

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.130 

so<00:01:44.040> after<00:01:44.730> we<00:01:44.850> have<00:01:45.030> captured<00:01:45.450> some<00:01:45.480> bees<00:01:45.810> in

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
so after we have captured some bees in

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.410 
so after we have captured some bees in
their<00:01:46.440> little<00:01:46.650> vials<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.160> that's<00:01:47.760> it's<00:01:47.970> cold

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
their little vials and that's it's cold

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.960 
their little vials and that's it's cold
anesthetize<00:01:48.990> them<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.830> freezer<00:01:50.250> for<00:01:50.550> a

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
anesthetize them in the freezer for a

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.020 
anesthetize them in the freezer for a
few<00:01:51.180> moments<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:51.690> they're<00:01:51.840> nice<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:51.990> sleepy

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
few moments so they're nice and sleepy

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.660 
few moments so they're nice and sleepy
we<00:01:54.030> are<00:01:54.840> ready<00:01:55.080> to<00:01:55.290> harness<00:01:55.560> them<00:01:55.770> assuming<00:01:56.580> I

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
we are ready to harness them assuming I

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.860 
we are ready to harness them assuming I
could<00:01:56.730> open<00:01:59.210> them<00:02:00.210> out<00:02:00.360> here<00:02:02.570> how<00:02:03.570> long<00:02:03.720> have

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
could open them out here how long have

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.540 
could open them out here how long have
they<00:02:03.900> been<00:02:03.960> frozen<00:02:04.290> for<00:02:04.410> they've<00:02:05.310> been<00:02:05.460> in

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
they been frozen for they've been in

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.220 
they been frozen for they've been in
there<00:02:05.700> for<00:02:05.730> about<00:02:05.910> five<00:02:06.180> minutes<00:02:06.330> sometimes

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
there for about five minutes sometimes

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.620 
there for about five minutes sometimes
it<00:02:07.500> takes<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.950> little<00:02:08.310> bit<00:02:08.610> longer<00:02:08.760> sometimes<00:02:09.360> a

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
it takes a little bit longer sometimes a

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.780 
it takes a little bit longer sometimes a
little<00:02:09.690> bit<00:02:09.840> less<00:02:10.080> depending<00:02:10.649> on<00:02:10.800> the

little bit less depending on the
particular<00:02:12.090> be<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:13.550> go<00:02:14.550> ahead<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:14.970> we<00:02:15.030> have

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
particular be and go ahead and we have

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.000 
particular be and go ahead and we have
these<00:02:15.330> metal<00:02:15.840> tubes<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.680> we're<00:02:16.830> gonna<00:02:16.920> use

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
these metal tubes that we're gonna use

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.540 
these metal tubes that we're gonna use
for<00:02:17.220> harnessing<00:02:18.000> them<00:02:18.830> she's<00:02:19.830> waking<00:02:20.250> up<00:02:20.340> so

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
for harnessing them she's waking up so

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.530 
for harnessing them she's waking up so
I'm<00:02:20.640> gonna<00:02:20.760> put<00:02:21.000> her<00:02:21.120> in<00:02:21.300> there<00:02:23.390> stick<00:02:24.390> her

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
I'm gonna put her in there stick her

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.500 
I'm gonna put her in there stick her
right<00:02:24.780> in<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:24.930> bottom<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.440> tube<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.980> just

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
right in the bottom of the tube and just

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.580 
right in the bottom of the tube and just
push<00:02:27.510> her<00:02:27.630> up<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.810> little<00:02:27.840> bit<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:28.320> then<00:02:28.560> I

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
push her up a little bit and then I

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.890 
push her up a little bit and then I
usually<00:02:29.040> take<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.280> little<00:02:29.400> bit<00:02:29.700> of<00:02:31.070> paper<00:02:32.070> and

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
usually take a little bit of paper and

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.720 
usually take a little bit of paper and
make<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.020> nice<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.200> cushy<00:02:34.590> in<00:02:34.770> there<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.400> also

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
make it nice and cushy in there and also

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:36.830 
make it nice and cushy in there and also
so<00:02:35.850> they<00:02:35.970> won't<00:02:36.060> climb<00:02:36.330> out<00:02:36.540> at<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.690> bottom

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
so they won't climb out at the bottom

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.450 
so they won't climb out at the bottom
and<00:02:37.130> decide<00:02:38.130> to<00:02:39.980> participate<00:02:40.980> more<00:02:41.010> actively

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
and decide to participate more actively

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.120 
and decide to participate more actively
in<00:02:41.940> our<00:02:42.060> experiment<00:02:42.570> so<00:02:43.260> we<00:02:43.380> just<00:02:43.530> push<00:02:43.830> her

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
in our experiment so we just push her

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.610 
in our experiment so we just push her
right<00:02:44.460> up<00:02:44.790> what<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.810> hell<00:02:45.960> well<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.170> can<00:02:46.320> see

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
right up what the hell well you can see

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.560 
right up what the hell well you can see
that<00:02:47.090> but<00:02:48.090> just<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:48.540> that<00:02:48.750> her<00:02:49.470> antenna<00:02:50.480> in<00:02:51.480> her

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
that but just so that her antenna in her

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.420 
that but just so that her antenna in her
head<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:51.870> her<00:02:52.140> Baba's<00:02:52.470> Kassar<00:02:52.890> out<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.340> then

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
head and her Baba's Kassar out and then

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.650 
head and her Baba's Kassar out and then
I'm<00:02:53.520> gonna<00:02:53.610> go<00:02:53.790> ahead<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.060> grab<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.239> piece<00:02:54.480> of

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
I'm gonna go ahead and grab a piece of

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.890 
I'm gonna go ahead and grab a piece of
tape<00:02:54.840> here<00:02:56.239> and<00:02:59.120> stick<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.270> right<00:03:00.390> on<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.690> side

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
tape here and stick it right on the side

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.710 
tape here and stick it right on the side
of<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.140> tube<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:02.030> usually<00:03:03.030> push<00:03:03.420> her<00:03:03.570> forward

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
of the tube I usually push her forward

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.229 
of the tube I usually push her forward
so<00:03:03.989> she's<00:03:04.230> nice<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:05.310> cozy<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:08.000> and<00:03:09.000> just

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
so she's nice and cozy and and just

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.080 
so she's nice and cozy and and just
secure<00:03:09.450> her<00:03:09.900> in<00:03:10.050> there<00:03:10.650> hmm<00:03:12.440> like<00:03:13.440> that<00:03:14.090> and

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
secure her in there hmm like that and

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.920 
secure her in there hmm like that and
then<00:03:15.209> we<00:03:15.330> pick<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.720> stand<00:03:16.110> for<00:03:16.440> her<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:17.930> she's

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
then we pick a stand for her and she's

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.890 
then we pick a stand for her and she's
ready<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.290> go

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.600 

we're<00:03:24.900> gonna<00:03:24.990> be<00:03:25.170> eating<00:03:25.350> them<00:03:25.830> for<00:03:26.370> three

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
we're gonna be eating them for three

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.560 
we're gonna be eating them for three
hours<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:27.710> temperature<00:03:28.710> which<00:03:28.770> is<00:03:29.510> similar<00:03:30.510> to

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
hours a temperature which is similar to

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.390 
hours a temperature which is similar to
that<00:03:30.720> in<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:30.930> flight<00:03:31.170> so<00:03:31.380> they're<00:03:31.800> nicer<00:03:32.130> Lots

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
that in the flight so they're nicer Lots

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.250 
that in the flight so they're nicer Lots
we<00:03:33.180> need<00:03:33.330> to<00:03:33.420> starve<00:03:33.660> them<00:03:33.810> for<00:03:33.990> three<00:03:34.140> hours

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
we need to starve them for three hours

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.480 
we need to starve them for three hours
so<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.650> they're<00:03:34.890> more<00:03:35.070> receptive<00:03:35.250> to

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
so that they're more receptive to

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.190 
so that they're more receptive to
learning<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:36.150> then<00:03:36.630> after<00:03:36.930> that<00:03:37.050> we<00:03:37.170> can

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
learning and then after that we can

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.540 
learning and then after that we can
start<00:03:37.440> our<00:03:37.650> trials

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.220 

so<00:03:43.550> after<00:03:43.970> we<00:03:44.120> have<00:03:44.240> strapped<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.630> beads<00:03:44.840> into

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
so after we have strapped the beads into

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.580 
so after we have strapped the beads into
the<00:03:45.440> harnesses<00:03:45.970> we<00:03:46.970> want<00:03:47.180> to<00:03:47.270> do<00:03:47.390> is<00:03:47.720> use<00:03:48.380> the

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
the harnesses we want to do is use the

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.770 
the harnesses we want to do is use the
pers<00:03:49.250> a<00:03:49.430> otherwise<00:03:49.790> known<00:03:50.090> as<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:50.270> proboscis

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
extension reflex to see how well beats

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:00.580

learn<00:03:54.160> when<00:03:55.160> associated<00:03:55.820> with<00:03:56.380> food<00:03:57.380> and<00:03:59.590> we

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
learn when associated with food and we

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.810 
learn when associated with food and we
have<00:04:00.800> a<00:04:01.510> lemon<00:04:02.510> scent<00:04:03.470> and<00:04:03.770> a<00:04:04.430> peppermint

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
have a lemon scent and a peppermint

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.070 
have a lemon scent and a peppermint
scent<00:04:05.210> and<00:04:05.930> we<00:04:06.110> want<00:04:06.320> to<00:04:06.380> see<00:04:06.560> if<00:04:07.690> we<00:04:08.690> can<00:04:08.870> train

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
scent and we want to see if we can train

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.190 
scent and we want to see if we can train
the<00:04:09.200> beads<00:04:09.380> to<00:04:09.650> respond<00:04:10.100> to<00:04:10.310> the<00:04:10.430> lemon<00:04:10.700> scent

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
the beads to respond to the lemon scent

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.110 
the beads to respond to the lemon scent
given<00:04:12.200> every<00:04:13.070> reward<00:04:13.190> which<00:04:13.880> is<00:04:14.000> sugar<00:04:14.650> and

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
given every reward which is sugar and

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.070 
given every reward which is sugar and
after<00:04:17.120> a<00:04:17.450> few<00:04:17.930> trials<00:04:18.140> they<00:04:18.950> will<00:04:19.250> respond<00:04:19.670> to

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
after a few trials they will respond to

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.410 
after a few trials they will respond to
lemon<00:04:21.080> scent<00:04:21.320> only<00:04:21.530> and<00:04:21.950> will<00:04:22.880> stick<00:04:23.150> out<00:04:23.270> the

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
lemon scent only and will stick out the

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.610 
lemon scent only and will stick out the
top<00:04:23.600> or<00:04:23.870> their<00:04:24.110> proboscis<00:04:25.300> expecting<00:04:26.300> food

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
top or their proboscis expecting food

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.260 
top or their proboscis expecting food
and<00:04:27.620> we<00:04:27.770> have<00:04:27.920> the<00:04:28.010> control<00:04:28.340> which<00:04:28.850> is<00:04:28.880> just<00:04:29.210> a

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
and we have the control which is just a

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.080 
and we have the control which is just a
peppermint<00:04:29.540> scent<00:04:29.900> just<00:04:30.650> make<00:04:30.800> sure<00:04:31.010> that

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
peppermint scent just make sure that

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.000 
peppermint scent just make sure that
they<00:04:32.090> are<00:04:32.150> responding<00:04:32.810> to<00:04:33.200> the<00:04:33.500> lemon<00:04:33.740> scent

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
they are responding to the lemon scent

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.620 
they are responding to the lemon scent
and<00:04:34.570> only<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:35.690> lemon<00:04:35.930> scent<00:04:37.150> so<00:04:38.150> we<00:04:38.270> can<00:04:38.420> go

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
and only the lemon scent so we can go

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.329 
and only the lemon scent so we can go
ahead<00:04:38.720> and<00:04:38.930> begin<00:04:39.020> the<00:04:39.320> traps

00:04:43.329 --> 00:04:43.339 

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:45.260 

okay

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
okay

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.149 
okay
so<00:04:46.270> I'll<00:04:47.259> go<00:04:47.439> ahead<00:04:47.680> and<00:04:47.830> walk<00:04:47.949> you<00:04:48.069> through

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.159 
so I'll go ahead and walk you through

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:51.450 
so I'll go ahead and walk you through
the<00:04:48.400> trials<00:04:48.729> that<00:04:48.849> we<00:04:48.969> do<00:04:49.259> we<00:04:50.259> have<00:04:50.439> one<00:04:50.680> B<00:04:50.860> that

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
the trials that we do we have one B that

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.769 
the trials that we do we have one B that
has<00:04:51.490> not<00:04:51.789> been<00:04:51.909> trained<00:04:52.180> yet<00:04:53.369> and<00:04:54.569> the<00:04:55.569> first

00:04:55.769 --> 00:04:55.779 
has not been trained yet and the first

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:57.659 
has not been trained yet and the first
thing<00:04:55.899> that<00:04:55.930> we<00:04:56.110> do<00:04:56.259> is<00:04:56.469> pop<00:04:56.770> them<00:04:56.919> with<00:04:57.460> five

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
thing that we do is pop them with five

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:04.559 
thing that we do is pop them with five
seconds<00:04:58.029> of<00:04:58.919> the<00:04:59.919> lemon<00:05:00.219> scent<00:05:02.520> and<00:05:03.520> she's<00:05:04.419> not

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:04.569 
seconds of the lemon scent and she's not

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:06.420 
seconds of the lemon scent and she's not
associated<00:05:05.139> with<00:05:05.289> a<00:05:05.319> lot<00:05:05.529> with<00:05:05.770> the<00:05:05.889> scent<00:05:06.219> yet

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
associated with a lot with the scent yet

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.670 
associated with a lot with the scent yet
so<00:05:07.180> she<00:05:07.270> has<00:05:07.479> not<00:05:07.659> stuck<00:05:07.930> out<00:05:08.050> her<00:05:08.139> bra<00:05:08.379> skits

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
so she has not stuck out her bra skits

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.909 
so she has not stuck out her bra skits
and<00:05:08.860> we<00:05:09.849> want<00:05:10.029> to<00:05:10.149> reward<00:05:10.389> her<00:05:10.689> and<00:05:11.589> she's

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
and we want to reward her and she's

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:18.899 
and we want to reward her and she's
feeding<00:05:13.649> okay<00:05:14.649> and<00:05:16.949> she<00:05:17.949> did<00:05:18.099> respond<00:05:18.550> to

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:18.909 
feeding okay and she did respond to

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:21.420 
feeding okay and she did respond to
those<00:05:19.300> scent<00:05:19.599> and<00:05:19.899> the<00:05:20.259> food<00:05:20.499> so<00:05:21.189> we're<00:05:21.339> gonna

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
those scent and the food so we're gonna

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.820 
those scent and the food so we're gonna
go<00:05:21.580> go<00:05:21.729> ahead<00:05:21.939> write<00:05:22.120> that<00:05:22.270> down

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
go go ahead write that down

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.309 
go go ahead write that down
and<00:05:24.629> we<00:05:25.629> do<00:05:25.749> this<00:05:25.870> with<00:05:26.110> a<00:05:26.379> few<00:05:26.620> other<00:05:26.680> bees<00:05:26.979> and

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319 
and we do this with a few other bees and

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:30.360 
and we do this with a few other bees and
after<00:05:29.319> we're<00:05:29.469> done<00:05:29.559> with<00:05:29.620> all<00:05:29.830> the<00:05:29.919> bees<00:05:30.099> we

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
after we're done with all the bees we

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.219 
after we're done with all the bees we
wait<00:05:30.550> for<00:05:30.789> five<00:05:30.969> minutes<00:05:30.999> as<00:05:31.809> a<00:05:31.870> resting

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
wait for five minutes as a resting

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:34.709 
wait for five minutes as a resting
period<00:05:32.379> and<00:05:32.800> then<00:05:32.949> we<00:05:32.979> start<00:05:33.279> to<00:05:33.339> control<00:05:33.719> and

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:34.719 
period and then we start to control and

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:36.779 
period and then we start to control and
the<00:05:34.839> control<00:05:35.169> is<00:05:35.770> basically<00:05:36.159> the<00:05:36.339> same<00:05:36.490> thing

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:36.789 
the control is basically the same thing

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:39.719 
the control is basically the same thing
we<00:05:37.509> puff<00:05:37.839> them<00:05:38.080> for<00:05:38.499> a<00:05:38.709> total<00:05:39.009> of<00:05:39.069> ten<00:05:39.279> seconds

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
we puff them for a total of ten seconds

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:45.179 
we puff them for a total of ten seconds
and<00:05:42.270> when<00:05:43.270> we're<00:05:43.419> puffing<00:05:43.719> them<00:05:43.899> we're<00:05:44.499> just

00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:45.189 
and when we're puffing them we're just

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:47.179 
and when we're puffing them we're just
puffing<00:05:45.490> them<00:05:45.639> and<00:05:45.909> not<00:05:46.149> giving<00:05:46.659> them<00:05:46.779> reward

00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:47.189 
puffing them and not giving them reward

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:53.040 
puffing them and not giving them reward
so<00:05:48.189> that<00:05:48.309> serves<00:05:48.520> our<00:05:48.699> the<00:05:48.789> control<00:05:50.069> and<00:05:52.050> after

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
so that serves our the control and after

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.749 
so that serves our the control and after
we've<00:05:53.259> done<00:05:53.289> a<00:05:53.949> few<00:05:54.339> amount<00:05:54.459> of<00:05:54.580> beads

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:54.759 
we've done a few amount of beads

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:57.420 
we've done a few amount of beads
eventually<00:05:55.589> the<00:05:56.589> bees<00:05:56.740> will<00:05:56.889> become<00:05:57.129> trained

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
eventually the bees will become trained

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.999 
eventually the bees will become trained
with<00:05:57.699> the<00:05:58.149> lemon<00:05:58.539> scent<00:05:58.779> and<00:05:59.199> they<00:05:59.649> will<00:05:59.770> stick

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:00.009 
with the lemon scent and they will stick

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:02.070 
with the lemon scent and they will stick
out<00:06:00.159> their<00:06:00.370> proboscis<00:06:00.639> without<00:06:01.389> giving<00:06:01.899> the

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
out their proboscis without giving the

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.529 
out their proboscis without giving the
reward<00:06:02.409> source<00:06:02.709> so<00:06:03.519> we<00:06:03.999> have<00:06:04.149> a<00:06:04.180> bee<00:06:04.360> that's

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:04.539 
reward source so we have a bee that's

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:06.119 
reward source so we have a bee that's
already<00:06:04.689> trained<00:06:05.019> she's<00:06:05.529> been<00:06:05.709> through<00:06:05.919> a<00:06:05.949> few

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:06.129 
already trained she's been through a few

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:09.659 
already trained she's been through a few
trials<00:06:06.519> and<00:06:07.949> Shannon<00:06:08.949> will<00:06:09.069> puff<00:06:09.279> her<00:06:09.399> with<00:06:09.639> a

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669 
trials and Shannon will puff her with a

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.629 
trials and Shannon will puff her with a
lemon<00:06:09.969> scent<00:06:10.180> and<00:06:11.050> you<00:06:11.919> might<00:06:12.069> be<00:06:12.219> able<00:06:12.279> to<00:06:12.399> see

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 
lemon scent and you might be able to see

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:15.119 
lemon scent and you might be able to see
that<00:06:12.969> she<00:06:13.749> does<00:06:13.930> actually<00:06:14.229> respond<00:06:14.800> to<00:06:14.919> the

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:15.129 
that she does actually respond to the

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:16.469 
that she does actually respond to the
lemon<00:06:15.370> scent<00:06:15.580> she's<00:06:15.879> sticking<00:06:16.149> at<00:06:16.240> Harbor

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 
lemon scent she's sticking at Harbor

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:19.170 
lemon scent she's sticking at Harbor
baskets<00:06:16.930> and<00:06:17.289> then<00:06:17.889> just<00:06:18.459> to<00:06:18.550> reinforce<00:06:18.759> the

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
baskets and then just to reinforce the

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.089 
baskets and then just to reinforce the
training<00:06:19.539> I'm<00:06:20.289> gonna<00:06:20.469> go<00:06:20.589> ahead<00:06:20.680> and<00:06:20.860> feed<00:06:21.009> her

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:21.099 
training I'm gonna go ahead and feed her

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:25.949 
training I'm gonna go ahead and feed her
again<00:06:21.339> and<00:06:22.029> she<00:06:22.709> responds<00:06:23.709> and<00:06:24.959> that's

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:25.959 
again and she responds and that's

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:35.100 
again and she responds and that's
basically<00:06:26.259> the<00:06:26.349> trial

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:43.590
