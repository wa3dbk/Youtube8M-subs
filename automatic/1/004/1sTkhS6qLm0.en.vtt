bullet some other kind of construction
very<00:03:03.230> likely<00:03:03.500> could<00:03:03.709> have<00:03:03.829> hit<00:03:03.950> that<00:03:03.980> bone<00:03:04.280> and

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
very likely could have hit that bone and

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.300 
very likely could have hit that bone and
just<00:03:04.579> gone<00:03:04.790> to<00:03:05.000> pieces<00:03:05.209> but<00:03:06.079> this<00:03:06.439> one<00:03:06.680> holds

just gone to pieces but this one holds

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.909 
just gone to pieces but this one holds
together<00:03:07.579> does<00:03:08.239> it<00:03:08.419> look<00:03:08.629> great<00:03:08.900> but<00:03:09.560> it<00:03:09.709> keeps

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:09.919 
together does it look great but it keeps

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:11.349 
together does it look great but it keeps
on<00:03:10.069> penetrating<00:03:10.519> it<00:03:10.700> does<00:03:10.819> the<00:03:10.939> job<00:03:11.120> that's

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
on penetrating it does the job that's

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:12.819 
on penetrating it does the job that's
right<00:03:11.599> i<00:03:11.629> mean<00:03:11.840> even<00:03:12.109> though<00:03:12.349> you<00:03:12.409> don't<00:03:12.620> get

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
right i mean even though you don't get

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.770 
right i mean even though you don't get
that<00:03:13.010> typical<00:03:13.519> performance<00:03:13.730> that<00:03:14.299> you<00:03:14.389> expect

that typical performance that you expect

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.199 
that typical performance that you expect
to<00:03:14.930> see<00:03:15.200> from<00:03:15.620> a<00:03:15.769> triple<00:03:16.010> shock<00:03:16.310> it<00:03:16.760> still

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
to see from a triple shock it still

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.039 
to see from a triple shock it still
performs<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:18.109> took<00:03:18.919> the<00:03:19.069> animal<00:03:19.400> down

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
performs and took the animal down

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.969 
performs and took the animal down
consistent<00:03:21.049> performance<00:03:21.500> is<00:03:21.590> just<00:03:21.709> about

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:21.979 
consistent performance is just about

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:23.680 
consistent performance is just about
everything<00:03:22.430> you<00:03:22.760> want<00:03:23.090> in<00:03:23.329> hunting

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
everything you want in hunting
