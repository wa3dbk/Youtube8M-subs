00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.000 
Graham Nash doing a winna beer this song
is<00:00:09.570> another<00:00:09.750> great<00:00:10.050> example<00:00:10.110> of<00:00:10.590> alternate

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
is another great example of alternate

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.440 
is another great example of alternate
tuning<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.610> so<00:00:11.880> I'm<00:00:11.940> going<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.120> show<00:00:12.269> you<00:00:12.360> how

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
tuning and so I'm going to show you how

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.299 
tuning and so I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:12.480> tune<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.900> guitar<00:00:13.019> first<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.799> then<00:00:14.190> what

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
to tune the guitar first and then what

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.790 
to tune the guitar first and then what
you<00:00:14.400> should<00:00:14.549> probably<00:00:14.730> do<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.560> pause<00:00:16.560> the

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
you should probably do is pause the

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.950 
you should probably do is pause the
video<00:00:17.039> retune<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.880> guitar<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.420> then<00:00:18.779> come

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
video retune the guitar and then come

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.630 
video retune the guitar and then come
right<00:00:18.990> back<00:00:19.140> I'm<00:00:19.710> going<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:19.980> keep<00:00:20.100> going<00:00:20.130> with

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
right back I'm going to keep going with

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.130 
right back I'm going to keep going with
the<00:00:21.119> thought<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.330> you've<00:00:21.630> paused<00:00:21.900> it

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
the thought that you've paused it

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.200 
the thought that you've paused it
someplace<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.650> between<00:00:22.949> though<00:00:23.100> okay<00:00:23.400> okay

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
someplace in between though okay okay

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.099 
someplace in between though okay okay
keep<00:00:24.420> an<00:00:24.539> eye<00:00:24.660> on<00:00:24.750> this

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
keep an eye on this

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.609 
keep an eye on this
so<00:00:25.320> what<00:00:25.470> here's<00:00:25.710> our<00:00:25.890> tuning<00:00:27.439> we're<00:00:28.439> going<00:00:28.560> to

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
so what here's our tuning we're going to

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.800 
so what here's our tuning we're going to
tune<00:00:28.830> our<00:00:29.010> top<00:00:29.250> string<00:00:29.630> to<00:00:30.630> e

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
tune our top string to e

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.430 
tune our top string to e
can<00:00:31.500> stay<00:00:31.740> e<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:33.290> string<00:00:34.290> goes<00:00:34.500> up<00:00:34.739> D<00:00:36.110> D<00:00:37.110> string

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
can stay e a string goes up D D string

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.650 
can stay e a string goes up D D string
stays<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.010> same<00:00:38.989> g<00:00:39.989> string<00:00:40.290> stays<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.770> same

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
stays the same g string stays the same

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.100 
stays the same g string stays the same
B<00:00:42.660> string<00:00:43.020> gets<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.440> down<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.750> D<00:00:45.750> string

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
B string gets to down to a and D string

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.529 
B string gets to down to a and D string
gets<00:00:46.469> tuned<00:00:46.800> Eastern<00:00:47.640> gets<00:00:47.820> tuned<00:00:48.000> down<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.390> D

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
gets tuned Eastern gets tuned down to D

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.760 
gets tuned Eastern gets tuned down to D
so<00:00:49.050> again<00:00:49.079> our<00:00:49.410> tuning<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.770> going<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.950> be<00:00:50.070> e<00:00:50.570> B<00:00:51.770> D

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
so again our tuning is going to be e B D

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.549 
so again our tuning is going to be e B D
G<00:00:53.270> a<00:00:55.250> D<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.449> has<00:00:57.660> always<00:00:57.870> become<00:00:58.320> known
