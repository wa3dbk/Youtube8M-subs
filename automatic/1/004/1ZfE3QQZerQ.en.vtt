00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
to get into all our clocking you just

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.230 
to get into all our clocking you just
want<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.379> slap<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.830> CPU<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.549> here<00:01:05.729> or<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> computer

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
want to slap a CPU in here or a computer

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.570

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
system and not have to worry about it so

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.670 
system and not have to worry about it so
much<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.479> still<00:01:09.720> overclock<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.200> FX

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
much you can still overclock the FX

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.880 
much you can still overclock the FX
series<00:01:10.950> but<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.640> FX<00:01:12.110> 4170<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.320> an<00:01:13.439> excellent

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
series but the FX 4170 is an excellent

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.300

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
CPU clock that four-point-two bigger so

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.740 
CPU clock that four-point-two bigger so
you<00:01:17.549> know<00:01:17.729> if<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.880> don't<00:01:18.119> want<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.630> much

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
you know if you don't want to so much

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.960 
you know if you don't want to so much
get<00:01:19.020> into<00:01:19.229> overclocking<00:01:19.799> all<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.790> know

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
get into overclocking all that you know

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.050 
get into overclocking all that you know
you<00:01:21.630> know<00:01:21.720> witchcraft<00:01:22.490> overclocking<00:01:23.490> then

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
you know witchcraft overclocking then

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.450 
you know witchcraft overclocking then
you<00:01:24.570> might<00:01:24.780> want<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.140> go<00:01:25.290> with<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:26.130> know<00:01:26.250> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
you might want to go with you know the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.630 
you might want to go with you know the
FX<00:01:27.170> but<00:01:28.170> still<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.860> film<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.820> film<00:01:30.060> 2<00:01:31.280> 965<00:01:32.280> B

is<00:01:33.180> an<00:01:33.360> amazing<00:01:34.229> CPU<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.310> cannot<00:01:35.970> go

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
is an amazing CPU and you cannot go

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.230 
is an amazing CPU and you cannot go
wrong<00:01:36.659> with<00:01:36.740> purchasing<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.890> now<00:01:38.490> that's<00:01:38.880> my

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
wrong with purchasing it now that's my

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.730 
wrong with purchasing it now that's my
opinion<00:01:39.570> then<00:01:39.900> I'd<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.229> hear<00:01:40.320> from<00:01:40.470> you

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
opinion then I'd like to hear from you

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.639 
opinion then I'd like to hear from you
what<00:01:41.100> do<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.310> think<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.939> best<00:01:42.180> overall

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
what do you think is the best overall

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.249 
what do you think is the best overall

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
people actually buy AMD CPUs over Intel

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.749 
people actually buy AMD CPUs over Intel
CPUs<00:01:52.290> because<00:01:52.590> luggable<00:01:52.860> think<00:01:53.100> Intel<00:01:53.399> CPUs

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759
