00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
they've placed a couple labels over here

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.410 
they've placed a couple labels over here
for<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.350> new<00:00:16.470> iPad<00:00:16.859> that's<00:00:17.100> because<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:18.060> iPad

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
for the new iPad that's because the iPad

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.740 
for the new iPad that's because the iPad
2<00:00:18.980> is<00:00:19.980> pretty<00:00:20.400> much<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.789> same<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.210> used<00:00:21.600> to

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
2 is pretty much the same and it used to

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.540 
2 is pretty much the same and it used to
fit<00:00:21.869> on<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.199> as<00:00:22.320> well<00:00:22.500> I'm<00:00:23.010> assuming<00:00:23.130> that's

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
fit on that as well I'm assuming that's

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.980 
fit on that as well I'm assuming that's
what<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.820> says<00:00:24.000> under<00:00:24.150> here<00:00:24.420> but<00:00:24.539> either<00:00:24.750> way

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
what it says under here but either way

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.070 
what it says under here but either way
this<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.740> zag<00:00:26.039> HD<00:00:26.490> no<00:00:26.640> sag<00:00:26.880> HD<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.390> an<00:00:27.539> upgrade

this is a zag HD no sag HD is an upgrade

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.169 
this is a zag HD no sag HD is an upgrade
from<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.470> previous<00:00:28.920> zag<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.029> adds

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
from the previous zag and that it adds

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.020 
from the previous zag and that it adds
clarity<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.320> more<00:00:31.769> glass-like<00:00:32.130> feel<00:00:32.759> I

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
clarity and a more glass-like feel I

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.120 
clarity and a more glass-like feel I
actually<00:00:33.329> have<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.719> on<00:00:33.780> my<00:00:33.930> iPhone<00:00:34.380> 4s<00:00:34.680> here

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
actually have it on my iPhone 4s here

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.910 
actually have it on my iPhone 4s here
and<00:00:35.309> it's<00:00:36.000> really<00:00:36.390> nice<00:00:36.719> it's<00:00:37.140> hard<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.770> tell

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
and it's really nice it's hard to tell

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.410 
and it's really nice it's hard to tell
it's<00:00:38.100> on<00:00:38.190> other<00:00:38.520> than<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:38.969> made<00:00:39.180> for<00:00:39.360> a

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
it's on other than that it's made for a

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.940 
it's on other than that it's made for a
case<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.020> has<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> little<00:00:40.440> bit<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.710> lip

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
case so it has a little bit of a lip

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.770 
case so it has a little bit of a lip
here<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.760> case<00:00:41.940> can<00:00:42.180> fit<00:00:42.450> over<00:00:42.750> it

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
here so that the case can fit over it

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.200 
here so that the case can fit over it
and<00:00:43.050> not<00:00:43.620> interfere<00:00:44.100> with<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.399> zag<00:00:44.640> but

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
and not interfere with the zag but

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.630 
and not interfere with the zag but
overall<00:00:45.480> really<00:00:45.629> nice<00:00:46.170> his<00:00:46.710> stayed<00:00:47.010> put<00:00:47.370> you

can<00:00:47.820> see<00:00:48.000> here<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:49.050> can't<00:00:49.230> really<00:00:49.379> tell<00:00:49.620> that

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
can see here you can't really tell that

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.279 
can see here you can't really tell that
it's<00:00:49.920> there<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:51.059> does<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> nice<00:00:51.449> job<00:00:51.539> so

the<00:01:00.059> same<00:01:00.239> sheet<00:01:00.570> now<00:01:00.780> what<00:01:00.960> they've<00:01:01.109> done<00:01:01.289> is

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
the same sheet now what they've done is

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.110 
the same sheet now what they've done is
upgraded<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.399> little<00:01:02.609> bit<00:01:02.730> harder

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
upgraded this it's a little bit harder

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.170 
upgraded this it's a little bit harder
material<00:01:03.570> than<00:01:03.719> before<00:01:04.080> less<00:01:04.290> rubbery<00:01:04.739> and

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
material than before less rubbery and

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.060 
material than before less rubbery and
that<00:01:06.180> being<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.140> way<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.650> makes<00:01:07.950> it

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
that being the way that it is makes it

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.560 
that being the way that it is makes it
actually<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> little<00:01:08.580> bit<00:01:08.700> easier<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.060> put<00:01:09.330> on

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
actually a little bit easier to put on

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.109 
actually a little bit easier to put on
your<00:01:09.840> device<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.860> here<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.159> have<00:01:11.430> an<00:01:11.580> iPad<00:01:11.880> with

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
your device so here I have an iPad with

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.020 
your device so here I have an iPad with
me<00:01:12.650> that<00:01:13.650> I've<00:01:13.770> used<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.189> many<00:01:14.340> reviews<00:01:14.790> and

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
me that I've used in many reviews and

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.820 
me that I've used in many reviews and
I'm<00:01:15.240> going<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.570> be<00:01:15.630> placing<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.140> on<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.470> this

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
I'm going to be placing it on this this

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.550 
I'm going to be placing it on this this
is<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.130> one<00:01:17.250> my<00:01:17.430> kids<00:01:17.700> use<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.060> most<00:01:18.240> and

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
is the one my kids use the most and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.840 
is the one my kids use the most and
because<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.890> figured<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.670> would<00:01:20.820> be

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
because of that I figured it would be

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.179 
because of that I figured it would be
appropriate<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.479> put<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.810> on<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.439> one<00:01:22.650> so

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
appropriate to put it on this one so

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.830 
appropriate to put it on this one so
I'll<00:01:23.310> go<00:01:23.430> ahead<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.759> place<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.330> here<00:01:24.689> and

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
I'll go ahead and place it on here and

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.810 
I'll go ahead and place it on here and
what<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.470> want<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.740> do<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.009> wash<00:01:26.189> your<00:01:26.220> hands

so<00:01:36.689> I'll<00:01:36.840> go<00:01:36.960> ahead<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.320> start<00:01:38.009> placing<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.549> on

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
so I'll go ahead and start placing it on

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.920 
so I'll go ahead and start placing it on
and<00:01:38.820> we'll<00:01:38.909> take<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.060> look<00:01:39.299> at<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.689> little

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
and we'll take a look at it in a little

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.240 
and we'll take a look at it in a little
bit<00:01:40.049> now<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.070> have<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.640> zag<00:01:41.909> HD<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.750> place<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.500> a

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
bit now I have the zag HD in place and a

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.520 
bit now I have the zag HD in place and a
lot<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.790> people<00:01:45.119> get<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:45.930> little<00:01:46.259> spray

on the back make sure it's on your hands

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.980 
on the back make sure it's on your hands

little<00:01:58.290> tip<00:01:58.590> for<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.070> may<00:01:59.369> have<00:01:59.399> not<00:01:59.729> had

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
little tip for you that may have not had

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.219 
little tip for you that may have not had
installed<00:02:00.210> one<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.479> these<00:02:00.630> before<00:02:00.990> what<00:02:01.140> they

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
installed one of these before what they

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.420 
installed one of these before what they
do<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.439> they<00:02:01.530> give<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.770> little<00:02:01.950> squeegee

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
do is they give you a little squeegee

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.850 
do is they give you a little squeegee
and<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.899> squeegee<00:02:03.899> out<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.380> air<00:02:04.500> bubbles

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
and you squeegee out the air bubbles

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.690 
and you squeegee out the air bubbles
there's<00:02:05.040> actually<00:02:05.280> an<00:02:05.340> air<00:02:05.399> bubble<00:02:05.549> right

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
there's actually an air bubble right

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.059 
there's actually an air bubble right
here<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.810> squeegee<00:02:07.259> out<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.500> air<00:02:07.619> bubble<00:02:07.950> if

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
here you squeegee out the air bubble if

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.369 
here you squeegee out the air bubble if
it's<00:02:08.190> nuts<00:02:08.369> if<00:02:08.819> it's<00:02:08.970> not<00:02:09.090> sliding<00:02:09.509> well<00:02:09.810> spray

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
it's nuts if it's not sliding well spray

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.990 
it's nuts if it's not sliding well spray
a<00:02:10.410> little<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:10.890> solution<00:02:11.220> on<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.640> top<00:02:11.819> of

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
a little of that solution on the top of

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.590 
a little of that solution on the top of
it

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
it

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.880 
it
but<00:02:12.690> other<00:02:12.840> than<00:02:12.900> that<00:02:13.080> what<00:02:13.410> you<00:02:13.500> want<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.740> do

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
but other than that what you want to do

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.590 
but other than that what you want to do
at<00:02:14.160> least<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.640> find<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.270> when<00:02:15.480> I'm

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
at least that I find is when I'm

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.630 
at least that I find is when I'm
installing<00:02:15.960> it<00:02:16.230> instead<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.470> just<00:02:16.680> wiping<00:02:17.520> all

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
installing it instead of just wiping all

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.490 
installing it instead of just wiping all
of<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:17.940> liquid<00:02:18.150> back<00:02:18.510> into<00:02:18.840> maybe<00:02:18.990> through

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
of that liquid back into maybe through

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.830 
of that liquid back into maybe through
this<00:02:19.650> seal<00:02:19.920> if<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.280> was<00:02:20.370> broken<00:02:20.640> what<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.690> want

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
this seal if it was broken what you want

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.110 
this seal if it was broken what you want
to<00:02:21.900> do<00:02:21.990> is<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.350> hold<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.770> like<00:02:22.800> this<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.490> put<00:02:24.090> a

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
to do is I hold it like this and put a

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.340 
to do is I hold it like this and put a
little<00:02:24.330> thing<00:02:24.510> underneath<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.050> you<00:02:25.110> can<00:02:25.230> see

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
little thing underneath it you can see

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.050 
little thing underneath it you can see
there's<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.560> few<00:02:25.710> drops<00:02:26.040> around<00:02:26.250> on<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.670> on<00:02:26.910> the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
there's a few drops around on the on the

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.570 
there's a few drops around on the on the
table<00:02:27.360> here<00:02:27.540> what<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.200> do<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.560> squeegee<00:02:29.130> away

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
table here what I do is I squeegee away

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.220 
table here what I do is I squeegee away
from<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.030> so<00:02:30.450> what<00:02:30.600> it's<00:02:30.750> doing<00:02:30.810> is<00:02:31.110> it

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
from it so what it's doing is it

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.190 
from it so what it's doing is it
actually<00:02:31.650> hangs<00:02:32.190> upside<00:02:32.520> down<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.270> falls<00:02:34.020> out

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
actually hangs upside down and falls out

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.530 
actually hangs upside down and falls out
the<00:02:34.410> side<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:35.460> way<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.760> does<00:02:35.940> not<00:02:36.210> land

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
the side and that way it does not land

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.040 
the side and that way it does not land
all<00:02:37.530> over<00:02:37.950> everything<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.430> have<00:02:38.690> inside<00:02:39.690> the

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
all over everything I have inside the

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.050 
all over everything I have inside the
iPad<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.620> damage<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.160> now<00:02:41.520> you<00:02:41.640> are<00:02:41.760> supposed

that's<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.380> long<00:02:46.560> time<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:47.010> know<00:02:47.040> in<00:02:47.340> my

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
that's a long time you know in my

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.880 
that's a long time you know in my
particular<00:02:48.120> case<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.870> don't<00:02:48.930> it's<00:02:49.350> actually<00:02:49.710> on

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
particular case I don't it's actually on

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.380 
particular case I don't it's actually on
well<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.250> do<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.610> but<00:02:50.760> I've<00:02:50.880> done<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.180> enough

well I do it but I've done it enough

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.270 
well I do it but I've done it enough

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
times that I don't get water anywhere

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.650 
times that I don't get water anywhere
near<00:02:53.460> any<00:02:53.640> of<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.850> ports<00:02:54.180> or<00:02:54.330> anything

near any of the ports or anything

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.480 
near any of the ports or anything
because<00:02:55.020> well<00:02:55.800> I've<00:02:55.920> done<00:02:56.070> it<00:02:56.220> a<00:02:56.280> few<00:02:56.310> times

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
because well I've done it a few times

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
air bubbles right in this little edge

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.520 
air bubbles right in this little edge
here<00:03:24.300> not<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:24.930> big<00:03:25.140> deal

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
works great still you can see it's

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.300 
works great still you can see it's
sliding<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.660> lock<00:03:30.840> but<00:03:31.770> we'll<00:03:31.890> take<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.070> look

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
sliding the lock but we'll take a look

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.950 
sliding the lock but we'll take a look
at<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:32.520> after<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:32.970> dries<00:03:33.210> so<00:03:33.420> you<00:03:33.510> can<00:03:33.660> see<00:03:33.840> the

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
at it after it dries so you can see the

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.770 
at it after it dries so you can see the
difference<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:34.530> this<00:03:35.040> actually<00:03:35.520> has<00:03:35.700> an<00:03:35.850> HD

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
difference and this actually has an HD

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.870 
difference and this actually has an HD
on<00:03:36.960> it<00:03:37.140> that's<00:03:37.350> dry<00:03:37.680> looked<00:03:38.370> like<00:03:38.550> this<00:03:38.700> before

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
on it that's dry looked like this before

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.460 
on it that's dry looked like this before
with<00:03:39.390> all<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.510> streaks<00:03:39.930> in<00:03:40.080> it<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:40.320> things

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
and clears up so give it some time and

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.860 
and clears up so give it some time and
we'll<00:03:44.100> take<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.250> look<00:03:44.430> at<00:03:44.580> it<00:03:44.700> in<00:03:44.790> a<00:03:44.850> moment<00:03:45.000> the

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.080 
probably been 72 hours at this point
it's<00:04:39.419> fully<00:04:39.810> clear<00:04:40.380> cured<00:04:41.220> and<00:04:41.460> everything<00:04:41.880> I

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
it's fully clear cured and everything I

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.510 
it's fully clear cured and everything I
feels<00:04:42.780> just<00:04:43.110> like<00:04:43.169> this<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.830> glass<00:04:44.100> I<00:04:44.340> don't

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
feels just like this the glass I don't

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.770 
feels just like this the glass I don't
know<00:04:44.580> what<00:04:44.790> they've<00:04:44.940> done<00:04:45.150> but<00:04:45.330> it<00:04:45.450> really

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
know what they've done but it really

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.690 
know what they've done but it really
feels<00:04:46.050> like<00:04:46.200> the<00:04:46.320> glass<00:04:46.680> it's<00:04:46.950> not<00:04:47.130> as<00:04:47.310> rubbery

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
feels like the glass it's not as rubbery

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.420 
feels like the glass it's not as rubbery
as<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.060> old<00:04:48.210> one<00:04:48.419> and<00:04:48.690> it's<00:04:49.590> much<00:04:49.860> nicer<00:04:50.310> than

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
as the old one and it's much nicer than

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.790 
as the old one and it's much nicer than
the<00:04:50.490> other<00:04:50.730> the<00:04:51.240> other<00:04:51.360> zags<00:04:51.810> of<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.139> past<00:04:52.380> as

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
the other the other zags of the past as

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.670 
the other the other zags of the past as
far<00:04:52.860> as<00:04:53.130> the<00:04:53.550> orange<00:04:54.360> peel<00:04:54.600> effect<00:04:54.720> how<00:04:55.500> that

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
far as the orange peel effect how that

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.590 
far as the orange peel effect how that
you<00:04:55.770> do<00:04:55.950> see<00:04:56.160> with<00:04:56.340> some<00:04:56.580> zags<00:04:56.880> looking<00:04:57.360> down

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
you do see with some zags looking down

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.200 
you do see with some zags looking down
it<00:04:57.810> you<00:04:58.320> really<00:04:58.890> can't<00:04:59.130> see<00:04:59.430> it<00:04:59.550> I<00:04:59.730> mean<00:04:59.940> there

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
it you really can't see it I mean there

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.870 
it you really can't see it I mean there
there<00:05:00.720> may<00:05:00.930> be<00:05:00.960> some<00:05:01.440> but<00:05:02.160> if<00:05:02.280> there<00:05:02.460> is<00:05:02.610> it's

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
there may be some but if there is it's

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.300 
there may be some but if there is it's
it's<00:05:03.210> very<00:05:03.300> hard<00:05:03.840> to<00:05:03.900> tell<00:05:04.500> if<00:05:04.740> it's<00:05:04.950> actually

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
it's very hard to tell if it's actually

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.610 
it's very hard to tell if it's actually
there<00:05:05.520> maybe<00:05:05.790> with<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.120> screen<00:05:06.390> off<00:05:06.620> you

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
there maybe with the screen off you

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.840 
there maybe with the screen off you
could<00:05:07.800> see<00:05:07.980> it<00:05:08.100> a<00:05:08.130> little<00:05:08.280> bit<00:05:08.490> when<00:05:08.730> the

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
could see it a little bit when the

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.400 
could see it a little bit when the
screens<00:05:09.150> on<00:05:09.390> it's<00:05:09.630> it's<00:05:10.050> pretty<00:05:10.290> much

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
screens on it's it's pretty much

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.320 
screens on it's it's pretty much
impossible<00:05:10.740> to<00:05:11.070> see<00:05:11.250> the<00:05:11.280> orange<00:05:11.580> peel<00:05:11.820> effect

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
impossible to see the orange peel effect

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.350 
impossible to see the orange peel effect
so<00:05:12.750> overall<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:13.590> zag<00:05:13.800> HD<00:05:14.220> is<00:05:14.370> is<00:05:14.550> really<00:05:15.330> a

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
so overall the zag HD is is really a

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.830 
so overall the zag HD is is really a
nice<00:05:15.630> skin<00:05:15.960> and<00:05:16.860> hopefully<00:05:17.400> more<00:05:17.640> skins<00:05:18.000> going

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
to do what they've done with this or

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.880

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
perhaps there are more skins out there

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.800
