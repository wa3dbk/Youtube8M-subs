going to scan the bottom part of the car

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.690 
going to scan the bottom part of the car
the<00:01:35.770> next<00:01:35.950> step<00:01:36.310> is<00:01:36.609> in<00:01:36.999> tools<00:01:37.509> is<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:39.159> finest

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
the next step is in tools is the finest

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.469 
the next step is in tools is the finest
serial<00:01:40.090> registration<00:01:41.700> once<00:01:42.700> this<00:01:42.909> process<00:01:43.179> is

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
serial registration once this process is

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.020 
serial registration once this process is
finished<00:01:43.899> you<00:01:44.229> get<00:01:44.439> information<00:01:44.770> about<00:01:45.399> the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
finished you get information about the

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.590 
finished you get information about the
registration<00:01:46.810> error<00:01:47.350> so<00:01:48.100> this<00:01:48.670> is<00:01:48.819> usually<00:01:49.030> in

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
registration error so this is usually in

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.580 
registration error so this is usually in
column<00:01:49.990> quality<00:01:50.560> a<00:01:50.859> big<00:01:51.850> number<00:01:52.299> means<00:01:52.600> a<00:01:52.960> big

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
column quality a big number means a big

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.620 
column quality a big number means a big

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
error small numbers a small error so you

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.139 
error small numbers a small error so you
want<00:01:55.929> to<00:01:56.020> have<00:01:56.139> a<00:01:56.350> small<00:01:56.679> number<00:01:56.829> in<00:01:57.310> order<00:01:57.969> to

fairly<00:02:51.610> good<00:02:52.230> registration<00:02:53.230> quality<00:02:53.680> in<00:02:53.950> this

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
fairly good registration quality in this

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.340 
fairly good registration quality in this
case<00:02:54.850> we<00:02:55.120> improve<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.720> quality<00:02:55.750> from<00:02:56.440> 2.8<00:02:57.340> to

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
case we improve the quality from 2.8 to

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:05.460 
case we improve the quality from 2.8 to
1.7<00:03:01.110> next<00:03:02.110> we<00:03:02.380> go<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:02.680> tools<00:03:04.470> global

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
1.7 next we go to tools global

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.710 
1.7 next we go to tools global
registration<00:03:08.700> optics<00:03:09.700> to<00:03:09.850> did<00:03:10.180> its<00:03:10.300> best<00:03:10.510> to

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
registration optics to did its best to

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.220 
registration optics to did its best to
align<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.500> frames<00:03:11.830> and<00:03:12.130> now<00:03:13.060> we<00:03:13.120> can<00:03:13.750> fuse

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
align the frames and now we can fuse

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.220 
align the frames and now we can fuse
these<00:03:14.920> single<00:03:15.490> frames<00:03:15.790> together<00:03:16.060> so<00:03:16.540> we<00:03:16.930> go<00:03:17.200> to

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
these single frames together so we go to

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:29.130 
these single frames together so we go to
tools<00:03:17.950> and<00:03:19.620> go<00:03:20.620> to<00:03:20.680> fusion<00:03:25.770> and<00:03:27.540> as<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.570> result

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
tools and go to fusion and as a result

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:36.390 
tools and go to fusion and as a result
we<00:03:29.710> get<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:31.200> 3d<00:03:32.200> model<00:03:32.830> of<00:03:33.730> our<00:03:34.360> toy<00:03:34.870> car<00:03:35.400> the

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
we get the 3d model of our toy car the

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.960 
we get the 3d model of our toy car the
next<00:03:36.550> step<00:03:36.940> is<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:37.690> remove<00:03:38.070> this<00:03:39.070> box<00:03:39.820> and<00:03:40.709> all

the model race okay we're going to align
our<00:04:27.020> two<00:04:27.350> scans<00:04:27.770> so<00:04:28.490> it<00:04:28.639> blows<00:04:28.850> the<00:04:29.090> top<00:04:29.449> scan

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
our two scans so it blows the top scan

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.020 
our two scans so it blows the top scan
and<00:04:30.130> green<00:04:31.130> is<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.970> bottom<00:04:32.479> scan<00:04:32.870> in<00:04:33.860> order<00:04:34.610> to

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
and green is the bottom scan in order to

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.430 
and green is the bottom scan in order to
align<00:04:35.419> both<00:04:36.139> scans<00:04:36.800> I<00:04:37.100> have<00:04:37.520> to<00:04:37.699> define<00:04:38.440> points

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
align both scans I have to define points

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.270 
align both scans I have to define points
on<00:04:39.639> both<00:04:40.639> data<00:04:41.199> which<00:04:42.199> share<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:42.979> same

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
on both data which share the same

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.689 
on both data which share the same
position<00:04:43.970> for<00:04:44.180> example<00:04:44.470> this<00:04:45.470> point<00:04:45.830> and<00:04:46.160> this

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:46.699 
position for example this point and this

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:54.040 
position for example this point and this
one<00:04:48.160> this<00:04:49.160> pine<00:04:49.550> and<00:04:49.850> this<00:04:52.060> then<00:04:53.060> the<00:04:53.660> back<00:04:53.900> of

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
one this pine and this then the back of

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:04.689 
one this pine and this then the back of
the<00:04:54.199> car<00:04:54.639> for<00:04:55.639> example<00:04:56.830> this<00:04:57.830> point<00:04:58.220> and<00:05:03.699> this

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
the car for example this point and this

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:15.779 
the car for example this point and this
point<00:05:05.080> okay<00:05:06.669> and<00:05:07.669> turn<00:05:09.699> here<00:05:10.699> we<00:05:10.880> are

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:22.420 

and<00:05:16.960> finally<00:05:17.960> we<00:05:18.440> can<00:05:18.680> fuse<00:05:19.400> these<00:05:20.360> two<00:05:21.430> scans

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
and finally we can fuse these two scans

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:29.930 
and finally we can fuse these two scans
to<00:05:23.000> one<00:05:23.240> single<00:05:23.599> model

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.860 

and<00:05:30.940> here<00:05:31.330> we<00:05:31.479> are<00:05:32.910> you<00:05:33.910> can<00:05:34.120> see<00:05:34.389> that<00:05:34.660> the

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
and here we are you can see that the

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.020 
and here we are you can see that the
mesh<00:05:35.770> still<00:05:36.490> has<00:05:36.729> some<00:05:37.510> holes<00:05:38.460> we<00:05:39.460> can<00:05:39.699> easily

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
mesh still has some holes we can easily

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.270 
mesh still has some holes we can easily
fill<00:05:40.660> these<00:05:40.960> holes<00:05:41.580> at<00:05:42.580> the<00:05:42.790> edges<00:05:43.210> point<00:05:43.540> and

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
fill these holes at the edges point and

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.520 
fill these holes at the edges point and
you<00:05:45.280> can<00:05:45.490> see<00:05:45.729> all<00:05:46.000> this<00:05:46.690> tiny<00:05:47.020> little<00:05:47.229> holes

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
you can see all this tiny little holes

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:53.730 
you can see all this tiny little holes
just<00:05:48.510> click<00:05:49.510> on<00:05:49.690> select<00:05:50.080> all<00:05:50.290> and<00:05:52.229> let<00:05:53.229> them<00:05:53.440> be
