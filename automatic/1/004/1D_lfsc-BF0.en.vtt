think theater is that there is a way

00:02:30.519 --> 00:03:03.490 
think theater is that there is a way
again<00:03:00.400> if<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.640> way<00:03:01.790> to<00:03:01.850> win<00:03:02.180> is<00:03:02.390> this<00:03:02.630> because

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
again if the way to win is this because

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.530 
again if the way to win is this because
what<00:03:03.890> most<00:03:04.040> of<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.459> dealers<00:03:04.850> are<00:03:04.880> doing<00:03:05.360> is

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
what most of the dealers are doing is

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:13.000 
what most of the dealers are doing is
this<00:03:09.970> right<00:03:10.970> so<00:03:11.780> that's<00:03:11.930> why<00:03:12.170> I<00:03:12.200> said<00:03:12.320> it's

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.770 
this right so that's why I said it's
back<00:03:13.280> pumped<00:03:13.730> now<00:03:15.910> what<00:03:16.910> you<00:03:17.090> do<00:03:17.299> is<00:03:17.480> you<00:03:17.630> grab
