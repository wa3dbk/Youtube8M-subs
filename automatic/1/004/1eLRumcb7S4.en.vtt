you<00:03:02.030> are<00:03:02.150> correct<00:03:02.420> Byron<00:03:02.959> they<00:03:03.440> did<00:03:03.739> do<00:03:03.920> a

you are correct Byron they did do a
flyover<00:03:04.310> today<00:03:04.640> a<00:03:05.150> very<00:03:05.630> long<00:03:05.989> one<00:03:06.320> but<00:03:06.560> never

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
flyover today a very long one but never

flyover today a very long one but never
publicized<00:03:08.090> it<00:03:08.600> to<00:03:09.080> me<00:03:09.230> that<00:03:09.440> is<00:03:09.560> very<00:03:09.830> telling

this is the first time they did not
publish<00:03:12.800> a<00:03:13.040> flyover<00:03:13.720> so<00:03:14.720> definitely<00:03:14.959> a<00:03:15.230> heads

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
publish a flyover so definitely a heads

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.400 
publish a flyover so definitely a heads
up<00:03:15.830> something<00:03:16.340> is<00:03:16.519> very<00:03:17.450> much<00:03:17.630> going<00:03:17.900> on<00:03:18.140> down

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
up something is very much going on down

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.270 
up something is very much going on down
in<00:03:18.440> Louisiana<00:03:18.850> as<00:03:19.850> we<00:03:20.180> speak<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:21.070> time<00:03:22.070> to<00:03:22.160> pay

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
in Louisiana as we speak so time to pay

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.830 
in Louisiana as we speak so time to pay
attention<00:03:22.700> enjoy<00:03:23.209> why<00:03:23.390> can't<00:03:23.660> everybody
