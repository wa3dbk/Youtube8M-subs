on<00:00:15.219> with<00:00:15.460> the<00:00:15.490> video

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.940 

and<00:01:16.040> today<00:01:16.310> I<00:01:16.340> want<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:16.700> give<00:01:16.820> some<00:01:17.060> tips<00:01:17.300> about

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
and today I want to give some tips about

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.800 
and today I want to give some tips about
just<00:01:18.950> living<00:01:19.190> off<00:01:19.550> the<00:01:19.730> grid<00:01:19.880> that<00:01:20.240> probably<00:01:20.720> a

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
just living off the grid that probably a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.530 
just living off the grid that probably a
lot<00:01:20.870> of<00:01:21.080> people<00:01:21.350> don't<00:01:21.470> think<00:01:21.590> of<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:22.580> it<00:01:23.390> took

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
lot of people don't think of and it took

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.110 
lot of people don't think of and it took
me<00:01:23.720> a<00:01:23.750> long<00:01:23.930> time<00:01:23.990> to<00:01:24.460> figure<00:01:25.460> out<00:01:25.700> a<00:01:25.730> lot<00:01:26.000> of

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
me a long time to figure out a lot of

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.060 
me a long time to figure out a lot of
these<00:01:26.210> things<00:01:26.480> they're<00:01:27.230> not<00:01:27.350> a<00:01:27.380> real<00:01:27.620> big<00:01:27.830> deal

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
these things they're not a real big deal

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.590 
these things they're not a real big deal
but<00:01:28.370> it<00:01:28.490> just<00:01:28.670> kind<00:01:28.850> of<00:01:28.940> helps<00:01:29.150> make<00:01:29.330> life

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
but it just kind of helps make life

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.280 
but it just kind of helps make life
easier

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
easier

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.710 
easier
and<00:01:30.800> one<00:01:31.730> of<00:01:31.760> the<00:01:31.940> things<00:01:32.150> that<00:01:32.390> I<00:01:32.450> want<00:01:32.630> to

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
and one of the things that I want to

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.400 
and one of the things that I want to
talk<00:01:32.840> about<00:01:33.020> today<00:01:33.440> is<00:01:34.060> your<00:01:35.260> generator

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
talk about today is your generator

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.950 
talk about today is your generator
whenever<00:01:37.040> you're<00:01:37.310> off<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.670> grid

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
whenever you're off the grid

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.870 
whenever you're off the grid
occasionally<00:01:38.960> you<00:01:39.170> need<00:01:39.350> generator<00:01:39.920> whenever

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
occasionally you need generator whenever

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.530 
occasionally you need generator whenever
it's<00:01:41.410> 1015<00:01:42.410> degrees<00:01:42.590> below<00:01:43.130> zero<00:01:43.700> outside<00:01:43.940> and

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
it's 1015 degrees below zero outside and

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.300 
it's 1015 degrees below zero outside and
you've<00:01:44.660> got<00:01:44.900> a<00:01:44.930> battery<00:01:45.530> in<00:01:45.770> this<00:01:46.010> thing<00:01:46.280> that

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
you've got a battery in this thing that

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.060 
you've got a battery in this thing that
you're<00:01:46.729> gonna<00:01:46.910> try<00:01:47.210> to<00:01:47.240> start<00:01:47.660> it<00:01:47.810> with<00:01:47.840> a<00:01:48.350> lot

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
you're gonna try to start it with a lot

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.980 
you're gonna try to start it with a lot
of<00:01:49.190> times<00:01:49.400> those<00:01:49.670> batteries<00:01:50.150> just<00:01:50.180> don't<00:01:50.660> work

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
of times those batteries just don't work

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.800 
of times those batteries just don't work
so<00:01:51.850> one<00:01:52.850> of<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:53.000> things<00:01:53.150> I<00:01:53.330> do<00:01:53.390> in<00:01:53.720> the

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
so one of the things I do in the

so one of the things I do in the
wintertime<00:01:54.080> with<00:01:54.470> my<00:01:54.650> setup<00:01:54.920> is<00:01:55.280> I<00:01:55.550> got<00:01:55.760> me<00:01:55.910> one

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
wintertime with my setup is I got me one

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.630 
wintertime with my setup is I got me one
of<00:01:56.150> these<00:01:56.240> little<00:01:56.650> dollar<00:01:58.900> it's<00:01:59.900> a<00:02:00.640> it's

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
called a dish pan I got it from Dollar

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.950 
called a dish pan I got it from Dollar
Tree<00:02:03.590> for<00:02:04.100> one<00:02:04.310> dollar<00:02:04.640> and<00:02:05.510> I<00:02:05.630> take<00:02:05.930> my

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.230 
Tree for one dollar and I take my
battery<00:02:06.560> out<00:02:06.650> of<00:02:06.830> the<00:02:06.979> generator<00:02:07.580> and<00:02:07.850> I<00:02:07.940> put

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
battery out of the generator and I put

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.680 
battery out of the generator and I put
it<00:02:08.390> inside<00:02:08.630> of<00:02:09.170> this<00:02:09.380> pan<00:02:09.830> in<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.369> house

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
it inside of this pan in the house

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.080 
it inside of this pan in the house
some<00:02:12.140> places<00:02:12.380> inconspicuous<00:02:13.070> you<00:02:13.820> know<00:02:13.940> in<00:02:14.030> a

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
some places inconspicuous you know in a

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.699 
some places inconspicuous you know in a
closet<00:02:14.330> or<00:02:14.660> something<00:02:14.690> but<00:02:15.230> just<00:02:15.440> so<00:02:15.560> that

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
closet or something but just so that

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.460 
closet or something but just so that
battery<00:02:16.070> doesn't<00:02:16.400> get<00:02:17.330> down<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.750> that<00:02:17.780> minus

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
battery doesn't get down to that minus

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.800 
battery doesn't get down to that minus
15<00:02:18.980> degrees<00:02:19.400> or<00:02:19.670> whatever<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.269> stays<00:02:20.510> warm

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
15 degrees or whatever it stays warm

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.890 
15 degrees or whatever it stays warm
then<00:02:21.650> I<00:02:21.739> bring<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.100> outside<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:23.090> I<00:02:23.450> attach<00:02:23.870> it

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
then I bring it outside and I attach it

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.940 
then I bring it outside and I attach it
to<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:25.280> generator<00:02:26.030> using<00:02:26.570> jumper<00:02:27.230> cables<00:02:27.650> so

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
to the generator using jumper cables so

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.830 
to the generator using jumper cables so
that<00:02:28.100> way<00:02:28.250> I<00:02:28.280> don't<00:02:28.400> have<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.880> work<00:02:29.150> boats<00:02:29.480> and

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
that way I don't have to work boats and

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.320 
that way I don't have to work boats and
all<00:02:29.930> that<00:02:30.110> stuff<00:02:30.380> I<00:02:30.590> bring<00:02:30.800> it<00:02:30.950> out<00:02:31.070> I<00:02:31.400> clip<00:02:32.300> it

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
all that stuff I bring it out I clip it

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.070 
all that stuff I bring it out I clip it
on<00:02:32.630> I<00:02:33.019> start<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.130> generator<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:35.209> whenever<00:02:36.019> I

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
on I start the generator and whenever I

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.720 
on I start the generator and whenever I
come<00:02:36.260> back<00:02:36.380> out<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:36.709> shut<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.040> generator<00:02:37.459> off

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
come back out to shut the generator off

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.020 
come back out to shut the generator off
I<00:02:38.030> unclip<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.810> battery<00:02:39.310> take<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:40.430> back<00:02:40.580> inside

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
I unclip the battery take it back inside

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.720 
I unclip the battery take it back inside
and<00:02:41.360> put<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:41.630> back<00:02:41.750> in<00:02:41.959> this<00:02:42.080> pan<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:42.709> I'm<00:02:43.550> good

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
and put it back in this pan and I'm good

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.940 
and put it back in this pan and I'm good
to<00:02:43.850> go<00:02:43.880> next<00:02:44.330> time<00:02:44.480> but<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.140> generator<00:02:45.560> starts

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
to go next time but the generator starts

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.830 
to go next time but the generator starts
every<00:02:46.220> time<00:02:46.459> that<00:02:46.700> way<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.269> it's<00:02:47.570> been<00:02:47.810> a

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
every time that way and it's been a

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.750 
every time that way and it's been a
great<00:02:48.140> help<00:02:48.470> for<00:02:48.680> me<00:02:48.860> especially<00:02:49.010> whenever

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
great help for me especially whenever

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.910 
great help for me especially whenever
you<00:02:49.910> got<00:02:50.030> a<00:02:50.090> foot<00:02:50.360> of<00:02:50.510> snow<00:02:50.540> on<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:50.959> ground<00:02:51.080> and

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
you got a foot of snow on the ground and

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.199 
you got a foot of snow on the ground and
you<00:02:52.820> absolutely<00:02:53.120> need<00:02:53.780> it<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:55.760> other<00:02:55.910> thing

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
you absolutely need it the other thing

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.040 
you absolutely need it the other thing
that<00:02:56.239> I<00:02:56.510> want<00:02:56.720> to<00:02:56.750> talk<00:02:56.959> about<00:02:57.110> is<00:02:58.870> when<00:02:59.870> you

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
that I want to talk about is when you

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.990 
that I want to talk about is when you
run<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.440> generator<00:03:00.890> if<00:03:01.130> you're<00:03:01.310> on<00:03:01.459> solar

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
run the generator if you're on solar

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.680 
run the generator if you're on solar
like<00:03:02.269> me

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
like me

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.140 
like me
when<00:03:04.380> it's<00:03:04.560> cloudy<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:05.220> still<00:03:05.610> get<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:05.940> little

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
when it's cloudy you still get a little

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.089 
when it's cloudy you still get a little
bit<00:03:06.300> of<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.660> charge<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.290> even<00:03:07.349> worst<00:03:07.770> case

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
bit of a charge and even worst case

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.750 
bit of a charge and even worst case
scenario<00:03:08.760> for<00:03:08.849> me<00:03:09.380> during<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.739> day<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.190> even

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
scenario for me during the day and even

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.839 
scenario for me during the day and even
if<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.090> get<00:03:12.150> up<00:03:12.480> in<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.810> voltages<00:03:13.440> low<00:03:13.860> the

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
if I get up in the voltages low the

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.530 
if I get up in the voltages low the
panel's<00:03:15.300> will<00:03:15.599> still<00:03:16.849> maintain<00:03:17.849> that<00:03:17.880> voltage

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
panel's will still maintain that voltage

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.449 
panel's will still maintain that voltage
through<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.410> day<00:03:19.650> even<00:03:20.190> though<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.310> don't

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
through the day even though I don't

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.059 
through the day even though I don't
really<00:03:20.700> get<00:03:21.030> much<00:03:21.269> of<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.540> charge<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:22.739> what<00:03:22.890> I<00:03:22.920> do

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
really get much of a charge so what I do

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.430 
really get much of a charge so what I do
is<00:03:23.370> I<00:03:23.519> just<00:03:23.550> kind<00:03:24.000> of<00:03:24.150> endure<00:03:24.599> through<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.200> day

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
is I just kind of endure through the day

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.500 
is I just kind of endure through the day
instead<00:03:25.950> of<00:03:26.069> starting<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.819> generator<00:03:27.269> up

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
instead of starting the generator up

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.479 
instead of starting the generator up
when<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:27.810> get<00:03:28.470> up<00:03:28.650> in<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:28.890> morning<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:29.340> say<00:03:29.459> oh

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
when I get up in the morning and say oh

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.430 
when I get up in the morning and say oh
gosh<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:30.000> battery<00:03:30.300> voltage<00:03:30.360> is<00:03:30.840> low<00:03:31.050> let<00:03:31.319> me

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
gosh the battery voltage is low let me

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.830 
gosh the battery voltage is low let me
start<00:03:31.769> it<00:03:31.920> well<00:03:32.489> I<00:03:32.610> sort<00:03:32.880> of<00:03:32.970> just<00:03:33.180> limp<00:03:33.480> along

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
start it well I sort of just limp along

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.840 
start it well I sort of just limp along
through<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.349> day<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:34.800> then<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:34.980> what<00:03:35.280> I<00:03:35.310> do<00:03:35.459> is

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
through the day and then it what I do is

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.729 
through the day and then it what I do is
I<00:03:36.090> wait<00:03:36.330> until<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.750> end<00:03:36.959> of<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.200> day<00:03:37.380> when<00:03:37.620> the

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
I wait until the end of the day when the

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.309 
I wait until the end of the day when the
sun's<00:03:38.010> going<00:03:38.430> down<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:38.970> then<00:03:39.690> I<00:03:39.930> will<00:03:40.140> come

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
sun's going down and then I will come

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.830 
sun's going down and then I will come
out<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:40.709> start<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.130> generator<00:03:41.600> once<00:03:42.600> the

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
out and start the generator once the

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.539 
out and start the generator once the
sun's<00:03:43.080> down<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:43.650> I<00:03:43.709> know<00:03:43.769> I'm<00:03:44.040> not<00:03:44.069> gonna<00:03:44.340> make

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
sun's down and I know I'm not gonna make

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.789 
sun's down and I know I'm not gonna make
any<00:03:44.730> more<00:03:44.940> Bower<00:03:45.180> what<00:03:45.989> that<00:03:46.170> does<00:03:46.380> is<00:03:46.620> that

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
any more Bower what that does is that

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.089 
any more Bower what that does is that
conserves<00:03:47.280> even<00:03:47.730> more<00:03:47.970> gasoline<00:03:48.739> by<00:03:49.739> doing

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
conserves even more gasoline by doing

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.940 
conserves even more gasoline by doing
that<00:03:50.420> I'm<00:03:51.420> only<00:03:51.630> running<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.140> generator<00:03:52.590> once

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
that I'm only running the generator once

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.880 
that I'm only running the generator once
in<00:03:53.190> a<00:03:53.310> day<00:03:53.489> instead<00:03:53.760> of<00:03:53.910> twice<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:55.049> I<00:03:55.620> still

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
in a day instead of twice and I still

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.830 
in a day instead of twice and I still
run<00:03:56.069> it<00:03:56.220> for<00:03:56.430> about<00:03:56.700> an<00:03:56.849> hour<00:03:56.970> hour<00:03:57.360> and<00:03:57.510> a<00:03:57.630> half

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
run it for about an hour hour and a half

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.199 
run it for about an hour hour and a half
to<00:03:58.080> charge<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.590> batteries<00:03:59.069> up<00:03:59.310> we<00:03:59.910> do<00:04:00.060> our

to charge the batteries up we do our

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.030 
to charge the batteries up we do our

there's<00:04:14.400> been<00:04:14.609> occasions<00:04:15.239> where<00:04:15.510> our<00:04:15.690> weight

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
there's been occasions where our weight

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.250 
there's been occasions where our weight
has<00:04:16.229> run<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.590> generator<00:04:17.100> and<00:04:17.810> by<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:18.870> time

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
Sun actually comes out for a while and

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.029 
Sun actually comes out for a while and
those<00:04:24.750> two<00:04:24.990> or<00:04:25.140> three<00:04:25.169> four<00:04:25.680> hours<00:04:26.010> of

those two or three four hours of
sunshine<00:04:26.520> that<00:04:27.030> I<00:04:27.090> get<00:04:27.330> during<00:04:27.539> the<00:04:27.660> day

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
sunshine that I get during the day

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.409 
sunshine that I get during the day
totally<00:04:28.919> charges<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.520> system<00:04:29.940> up<00:04:30.120> and<00:04:30.240> then<00:04:30.390> I

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
totally charges the system up and then I

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:31.940 
totally charges the system up and then I
don't<00:04:30.660> even<00:04:30.720> have<00:04:30.930> to<00:04:31.050> run<00:04:31.200> the<00:04:31.289> generator<00:04:31.710> at

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
don't even have to run the generator at

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.670 
don't even have to run the generator at
all<00:04:32.100> so<00:04:33.060> when<00:04:33.750> you<00:04:33.780> run<00:04:34.020> your<00:04:34.169> generator

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
all so when you run your generator

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.159 
all so when you run your generator
during<00:04:34.979> the<00:04:35.250> day<00:04:35.460> as<00:04:35.729> as<00:04:36.060> important<00:04:36.750> as

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
during the day as as important as

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:38.870 
during the day as as important as
running<00:04:37.530> it<00:04:37.770> when<00:04:37.919> your<00:04:38.070> voltage<00:04:38.430> is<00:04:38.639> low

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
running it when your voltage is low

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.310 
running it when your voltage is low
because<00:04:39.150> if<00:04:39.450> you're<00:04:39.600> generating<00:04:39.780> enough

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
because if you're generating enough

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.950 
because if you're generating enough
electricity<00:04:40.580> to<00:04:41.580> at<00:04:41.700> least<00:04:41.910> maintain<00:04:42.300> where

you're at even though they might be low
then<00:04:46.139> at<00:04:46.289> the<00:04:46.440> end<00:04:46.590> of<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:46.800> day<00:04:46.979> run<00:04:47.340> that

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
then at the end of the day run that

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.520 
then at the end of the day run that
generator<00:04:48.030> get<00:04:48.330> things<00:04:48.600> charged<00:04:49.050> up<00:04:49.229> and<00:04:49.440> then

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
generator get things charged up and then

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.840 
generator get things charged up and then
when<00:04:49.650> you<00:04:49.740> go<00:04:49.889> to<00:04:49.950> bed<00:04:50.160> at<00:04:50.340> night<00:04:50.490> you<00:04:50.520> got<00:04:50.789> a

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
when you go to bed at night you got a

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.700 
when you go to bed at night you got a
full<00:04:51.180> battery<00:04:51.389> bank<00:04:51.930> keeping<00:04:52.260> your<00:04:52.350> battery

the out of the weather helps helps your
reliability<00:04:56.819> on<00:04:57.240> that<00:04:57.539> putting<00:04:58.380> it<00:04:58.470> in<00:04:58.620> this

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.950 

okay<00:05:08.400> another<00:05:08.639> tip<00:05:08.940> that<00:05:08.970> I<00:05:09.180> want<00:05:09.360> to<00:05:09.479> give<00:05:09.690> is

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
okay another tip that I want to give is

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.990 
okay another tip that I want to give is
a<00:05:10.199> little<00:05:10.470> chore<00:05:10.740> of<00:05:10.770> sweeping<00:05:11.490> off<00:05:11.699> those

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
a little chore of sweeping off those

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.600 
a little chore of sweeping off those
solar<00:05:12.330> bands<00:05:12.889> one<00:05:13.889> thing<00:05:14.130> that<00:05:14.370> I've<00:05:14.460> always

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
solar bands one thing that I've always

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.600 
solar bands one thing that I've always
had<00:05:15.000> an<00:05:15.120> issue<00:05:15.270> with<00:05:15.720> with<00:05:16.020> these<00:05:16.340> is<00:05:17.340> the

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
had an issue with with these is the

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.510 
had an issue with with these is the
handle<00:05:18.120> is<00:05:18.300> not<00:05:18.630> quite<00:05:19.169> long<00:05:19.590> enough<00:05:19.620> to<00:05:20.310> reach

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
handle is not quite long enough to reach

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.120 
handle is not quite long enough to reach
all<00:05:20.759> the<00:05:20.849> way<00:05:20.880> up<00:05:21.150> the<00:05:21.300> panel's<00:05:21.720> because<00:05:22.130> my

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
all the way up the panel's because my

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.550 
all the way up the panel's because my
array<00:05:23.400> is<00:05:23.669> about<00:05:23.940> 15<00:05:24.449> feet<00:05:24.780> out<00:05:24.840> from<00:05:25.349> where<00:05:25.530> I

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
array is about 15 feet out from where I

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.999 
array is about 15 feet out from where I
can<00:05:25.860> reach<00:05:26.039> it<00:05:26.250> at<00:05:26.370> at<00:05:26.460> any<00:05:26.639> point<00:05:27.139> so<00:05:28.139> with<00:05:28.979> a

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.009 
can reach it at at any point so with a

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:31.129 
can reach it at at any point so with a
regular<00:05:29.460> garage<00:05:29.789> push<00:05:30.180> broom<00:05:30.509> I<00:05:30.660> don't<00:05:30.870> quite

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
regular garage push broom I don't quite

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.570 
regular garage push broom I don't quite
reach<00:05:31.440> that<00:05:31.770> and<00:05:32.490> I<00:05:33.270> was<00:05:34.340> going<00:05:35.340> through<00:05:35.520> a

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
reach that and I was going through a

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.820 
reach that and I was going through a
bunch<00:05:35.759> of<00:05:35.910> my<00:05:36.060> stuff<00:05:36.360> once<00:05:36.720> and<00:05:37.139> my<00:05:37.410> concrete

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
bunch of my stuff once and my concrete

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.540 
bunch of my stuff once and my concrete
working<00:05:38.310> tool<00:05:38.520> and<00:05:39.060> I<00:05:39.720> realized<00:05:40.199> that<00:05:40.770> I<00:05:41.250> had

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
working tool and I realized that I had

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.189 
working tool and I realized that I had
these<00:05:42.470> concrete<00:05:43.470> poles<00:05:43.740> here<00:05:44.120> for<00:05:45.120> doing<00:05:45.630> like

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
these concrete poles here for doing like

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:48.409 
these concrete poles here for doing like
floating<00:05:46.620> and<00:05:47.009> finished<00:05:47.400> rounds<00:05:47.880> you<00:05:48.030> can<00:05:48.060> buy

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 
floating and finished rounds you can buy

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:50.810 
floating and finished rounds you can buy
these<00:05:48.479> there<00:05:48.930> in<00:05:49.050> six<00:05:49.349> foot<00:05:49.560> lengths<00:05:50.039> you<00:05:50.669> can

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
these there in six foot lengths you can

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.320 
these there in six foot lengths you can
get<00:05:51.000> them<00:05:51.120> in<00:05:51.270> aluminum<00:05:51.780> like<00:05:52.020> this<00:05:52.319> or<00:05:52.800> in

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
get them in aluminum like this or in

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.730 
get them in aluminum like this or in
fiberglass<00:05:54.330> but<00:05:54.690> what<00:05:54.840> I<00:05:54.870> like<00:05:55.139> about<00:05:55.319> them<00:05:55.650> is

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
fiberglass but what I like about them is

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.629 
fiberglass but what I like about them is
you<00:05:55.949> can<00:05:55.979> attach<00:05:56.970> these<00:05:57.330> end<00:05:57.750> to<00:05:57.900> end<00:05:58.139> and<00:05:58.830> I've

00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 
you can attach these end to end and I've

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:02.060 
you can attach these end to end and I've
got<00:05:59.909> some<00:06:00.240> that'll<00:06:00.599> go<00:06:00.810> out<00:06:01.080> to<00:06:01.380> eighteen<00:06:01.770> feet

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
got some that'll go out to eighteen feet

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.159 
got some that'll go out to eighteen feet
but<00:06:02.460> I<00:06:02.550> only<00:06:02.639> need<00:06:02.880> twelve<00:06:03.240> feet<00:06:03.509> in<00:06:03.720> this<00:06:03.870> case

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
but I only need twelve feet in this case

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:06.649 
but I only need twelve feet in this case
so<00:06:04.470> that<00:06:04.500> I<00:06:04.710> can<00:06:04.919> reach<00:06:05.070> the<00:06:05.310> top<00:06:05.340> panel<00:06:05.849> and

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:06.659 
so that I can reach the top panel and

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:08.719 
so that I can reach the top panel and
the<00:06:06.960> thing<00:06:07.199> that's<00:06:07.349> really<00:06:07.680> nice<00:06:08.009> about<00:06:08.070> this

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:08.729 
the thing that's really nice about this

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:12.770 
the thing that's really nice about this
is<00:06:09.539> it<00:06:09.810> just<00:06:10.080> so<00:06:10.320> happens<00:06:10.830> to<00:06:11.099> fit<00:06:11.449> my<00:06:12.449> garage

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
is it just so happens to fit my garage

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.610 
is it just so happens to fit my garage
broom<00:06:13.199> head<00:06:13.820> and<00:06:14.840> and<00:06:15.840> then<00:06:15.990> I<00:06:16.080> can<00:06:16.289> go<00:06:16.440> out<00:06:16.590> and

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
broom head and and then I can go out and

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.330 
broom head and and then I can go out and
sweep<00:06:17.039> those<00:06:17.250> pails<00:06:17.639> and<00:06:18.530> I<00:06:19.530> can<00:06:19.740> get<00:06:19.889> all<00:06:20.039> the

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
sweep those pails and I can get all the

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.060 
sweep those pails and I can get all the
way<00:06:20.460> to<00:06:20.490> that<00:06:20.729> top<00:06:21.030> panel<00:06:21.509> just<00:06:21.830> by<00:06:22.830> using

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
way to that top panel just by using

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.520 
way to that top panel just by using
these<00:06:23.340> concrete<00:06:23.820> coats<00:06:24.210> I<00:06:24.570> don't<00:06:25.199> remember

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
these concrete coats I don't remember

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.529 
these concrete coats I don't remember
how<00:06:25.800> much<00:06:26.009> these<00:06:26.250> run<00:06:26.550> because<00:06:26.880> I<00:06:27.090> bought<00:06:27.389> them

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 
how much these run because I bought them

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:30.740 
how much these run because I bought them
so<00:06:27.750> long<00:06:27.960> ago<00:06:28.320> but<00:06:28.680> it<00:06:29.460> really<00:06:29.940> lets<00:06:30.330> me<00:06:30.449> reach

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750 
so long ago but it really lets me reach

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.810 
so long ago but it really lets me reach
all<00:06:31.080> the<00:06:31.380> way<00:06:31.500> up<00:06:31.710> to<00:06:31.949> the<00:06:32.070> top<00:06:32.310> and<00:06:32.610> sweep

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
all the way up to the top and sweep

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.390 
all the way up to the top and sweep
those<00:06:33.030> panels<00:06:33.509> off<00:06:33.750> so<00:06:34.560> even<00:06:34.919> if<00:06:35.070> you<00:06:35.190> have

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 
those panels off so even if you have

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.879 
those panels off so even if you have
panels<00:06:35.880> on<00:06:36.090> the<00:06:36.210> roof<00:06:36.389> of<00:06:36.570> your<00:06:36.599> house<00:06:36.930> you<00:06:37.710> can

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:37.889 
panels on the roof of your house you can

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:40.310 
panels on the roof of your house you can
probably<00:06:38.430> get<00:06:38.940> enough<00:06:39.210> of<00:06:39.360> these<00:06:39.479> poems<00:06:39.810> and

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
probably get enough of these poems and

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.409 
probably get enough of these poems and
as<00:06:40.979> long<00:06:41.159> as<00:06:41.190> you're<00:06:41.460> strong<00:06:41.759> enough<00:06:41.789> to

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419 
as long as you're strong enough to

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:44.330 
as long as you're strong enough to
handle<00:06:42.659> that<00:06:43.080> length<00:06:43.409> going<00:06:43.860> up<00:06:44.009> you<00:06:44.190> can

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 
handle that length going up you can

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.490 
handle that length going up you can
probably<00:06:44.669> sleeping<00:06:45.060> off<00:06:45.180> your<00:06:45.389> roof<00:06:45.599> and<00:06:45.960> the

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 
probably sleeping off your roof and the

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.230 
probably sleeping off your roof and the
reason<00:06:46.800> that<00:06:46.919> I<00:06:47.039> say<00:06:47.250> it's<00:06:47.400> important<00:06:48.000> to<00:06:48.090> get

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 
reason that I say it's important to get

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.600 
reason that I say it's important to get
that

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.610 
that

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.570 
that
no<00:06:48.729> off<00:06:48.909> your<00:06:49.120> panels<00:06:49.569> a<00:06:50.530> lot<00:06:51.069> of<00:06:51.189> people<00:06:51.490> are

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:51.580 
no off your panels a lot of people are

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.249 
no off your panels a lot of people are
under<00:06:51.789> the<00:06:51.909> impression<00:06:52.030> that<00:06:52.569> well<00:06:52.900> if<00:06:53.080> it's

clear you can still get enough
