00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.440
 Hello everyone, how are you? 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 do this kind of video 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.340
 focusing only on one type of face 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.100
 and talk about beard hairstyles and talk 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.019
 of sunglasses or normal cases and things 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.640
 well, because you have done so many 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.039
 questions you keep me doing you look at me 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.070
 mail everyone not logical some 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.869
 and a lot of doubts about everything 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.970
 measure your face for what it was 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.739
 start with the round face because it's a 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.499
 type of face that you have many doubts 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.909
 there are a lot of questions and I do not know 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:31.890
 I want to tell you that for the next 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:33.629
 video that you make of this kind of 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.190
 videos can you tell me in the 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.840
 comments what kind of face do you have that 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.910
 be the next position that lengthens to 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.100
 the rectangular stop inverted trouble 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.989
 a diamond and then then every two 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.910
 weeks or there about every two or so 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.589
 three weeks I'll do a video focusing 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.300
 in each type of face that on the other hand 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:49.949
 I hope you like the idea I had in 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.170
 the video that I have to use in all 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.940
 types of each together in developing it in 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.140
 different videos I hope you like it and 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.360
 to support that idea 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.130
 you have already explained quickly what 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.510
 I have thought of doing and the idea of 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.820
 these videos and so on we're going to 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.710
 start already the first and essential before 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.240
 it's nothing to know if your round face 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.860
 because if your face is not round this 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.659
 more video for you and before 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.970
 follow I have to say that one thing that 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.040
 causes a lot of confusion is to confuse 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.600
 Round face or rounded face with each 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.009
 fat has nothing to do with the 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.100
 proportion of your face that is 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.440
 round with you that fat face in 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.700
 plan after you have the others and 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.640
 things like that you do not have to see a 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.750
 thing with the other nothing we follow you can 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.970
 know if your round face 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.830
 just looking at the mirror there are people 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.740
 that simply looking at himself he knows it 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.450
 not doing it needs anything else but if not 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.399
 you are in that case then you have to 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.679
 measure your face you have to come face 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.840
 it may seem like something extremely 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.640
 weird or weird but it 's the only way 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.619
 to know what kind of face we have at 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.810
 one hundred percent the first step is to measure ourselves 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.789
 the length of the face from which the 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.320
 hair on the forehead to the bone here 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.850
 of the chin when we have this 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.360
 As we noted in the paper and 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.730
 we divide between three and the 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.710
 we have to take into account is from the 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.540
 work from our nose to the bone 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.160
 again from the chin and with this 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.900
 second distance in which to divide it from 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.640
 do anything considering that I will 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.710
 put a face here and all the 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.750
 things well pointed out and explained 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.640
 I will give an example so that it is already 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.470
 completely clear let's say that long 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.450
 of your face measures 21 centimeters 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.400
 that divided by 3 are 7 and the 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.410
 distance from under the nose to the 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.240
 chin measures 6 so if we compare 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.010
 the first measure is 7 centimeters 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.350
 with the second that are 6 centimeters 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.780
 it is clear that the long measure is greater 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.790
 that the little one so it will only be 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.740
 round if the first measure is greater 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.270
 that the second measure if it is giving us 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.400
 that the first is greater than the second 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.320
 then it is us round decade once 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.090
 that we already have this, we have to measure the 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.890
 width of our face because we have to 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.390
 rule out that it's square so 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.580
 we have to measure the width of the 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.680
 temples of the cheekbones and jaw 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.090
 if the three measures are equal our 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.100
 face if the square so this 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.280
 video is not for you either and if they are 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.480
 different then yes that would be round 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.040
 before you start with hairstyles and with 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.750
 the beards I will tell you in a very 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.550
 fast 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.440
 or lenses that go with the face type 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.850
 round and simply the glasses that go 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.160
 to be proportionate to our type 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.420
 of round face in this case are going to be 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.280
 the glasses that are square or 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.260
 rectangular and on the contrary if your 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.550
 face was square or rectangular then 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.350
 It would be better than the glasses because times 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.670
 something rounded would simply be 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.320
 choose some glasses that were 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.209
 contrary to our way of our 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.010
 face and I take to say that in 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.720
 these videos do not talk about tastes every 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.980
 one can put what he prefers what 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.709
 more likes that we only talk 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.200
 from an objective and proportionate point 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.820
 to the angles of our face now 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.320
 we focus on the hairstyles that 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.540
 basically you have to take into account two 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.130
 things the first would be to take a cut 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.110
 long to disguise the roundness of 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.459
 your face or center the largest volume 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.770
 of hair on top of the 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.750
 head or is done here and that would be for 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.730
 Give a longer feel to your 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.200
 I know it's just two things but 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.360
 with these two things you can get a 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.250
 bunch of hairstyles and how will you suppose or 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.110
 If I do not tell you, I 'll avoid things 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.209
 It would be quite the opposite 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.400
 would be the hair shaved hair all the same 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.989
 without form and to finish as for 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.810
 beards what is recommended are the 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.819
 beards 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.620
 unequal elongated beards their 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.239
 companies to cut the width a bit 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.130
 of our face and the only thing that is 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.140
 I would advise would be the full beard 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.610
 basically it would be a kind of beard for 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.470
 lengthen our bottom part of the 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.230
 head or face and reduce the 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.910
 roundness so far the video I hope 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.500
 that you have liked that it has served you 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.209
 that you have clarified doubts if it has 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.739
 liked do not forget to give me like that 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.840
 So in that way I saw that the 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.520
 videos you like goodbye serves and if you have 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.200
 it was clear then you can put some 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.850
 question in the comments of course 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.980
 because I believe that I have nothing to say 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.130
 so see you next video until 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.130
 then
