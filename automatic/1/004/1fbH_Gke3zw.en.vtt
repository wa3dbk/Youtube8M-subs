00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.770

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.260
 memory card for sony playstation 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.880
 Naturally as they say on the Internet should 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.729
 be at least released 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.729
 3 megabytes of space but better I advise 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.720
 about four closer to 4 well and us 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.670
 will need more 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.850
 blank CD I try on 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.299
 dvd drive 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.229
 not to sit on the divid Well 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.930
 let's get down to business 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.729
 first you need to download the program image 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:38.790
 launcher this program to run 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:41.250
 lucky files with the elf extension on the 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.130
 console you will run these files 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.159
 either from a flash drive or from a hard disk 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.149
 Well, download this image and write 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.280
 on a blank disk 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:56.070
 Further we copy on the free mc boot USB stick 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.040
 insert it into the console as well 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.570
 memory card from the console 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.299
 connect to the console after all 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.450
 This recorded disc is inserted into 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.330
 console and turn on and and now our 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.770
 the task to run flash drives file free ems 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.640
 but which we copied 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:19.200
 this file with elf extension 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.900
 here we press the circle and get the file 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.500
 conductor 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.770
 now choose the masses and that is yusbi 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.250
 console connector 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:37.190
 select and run the desired file and 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.190
 the menu will now appear freams fuck 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:45.290
 to install it on a memory card 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.290
 choose multi version install 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.450
 at the end of the installation, remove the disk and 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.630
 reboot the console disk in principle 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.460
 we will no longer need 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.690
 Now in the menu of your console should 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.920
 new items to choose from 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:33.410
 Now we will consider as 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.310
 run games from the sega console and carried 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.770
 naturally there are others 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.680
 emulators for sony playstation others 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.970
 consoles but i will look exactly these in 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.890
 whichever you want 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.050
 emulate you relevant 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.390
 emulators, we need to pump itself 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.670
 Roma with games, too, they need everything 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:55.220
 off on a flash drive that you will later 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.220
 connect to the playstation 2 itself 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:02.130
 note that to run games with 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.260
 flash drives in the emulator should be 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.420
 this possibility is provided that is 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.050
 after running the emulator you will need 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:13.080
 to choose 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:18.270
 flash media inserted into the console on 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:21.710
 sege i chose p gene and for snes dream 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:24.870
 station as an emulator 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:29.300
 proceed to launch after the appearance 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:32.480
 console menu select ulaunchelf and 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:36.690
 go file browser 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:42.260
 Now we are looking for the necessary emulator file. 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:47.280
 which we need here I choose sega and 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:50.720
 I run this file well, naturally further 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.720
 already working with the emulator itself 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.080
 nothing 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:00.340
 but there is nothing in principle clear 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:03.639
 we choose yusb and further we look for where at us rum 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:08.050
 lie run the desired rum and 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:12.040
 enjoy the game well and to run 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:15.610
 other files with the elf extension just 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.710
 reboot the console and go back to 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:23.470
 guide through ulaunchelf 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:25.720
 and run the file we need naturally 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.050
 can also be through a USB flash drive or hard 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.000
 console disk play games 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.910
 pre convert to 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.730
 special images that go and 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:40.030
 suitable for such a launch all this 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:42.610
 done through the program open ps2 loader 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.470
 but I will not tell you about it 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.890
 You can calmly read all this in 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:50.760
 There is nothing difficult on the internet 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.760
 all success
