earning<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.350> profit<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.949> think<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.969> big

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
earning a profit I think it's a big

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.650 
earning a profit I think it's a big
insight<00:00:58.379> for<00:00:58.739> students<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.430> business<00:01:00.359> can

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
insight for students that business can

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.920 
insight for students that business can
be<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:01.140> tool<00:01:01.770> for<00:01:02.340> changing<00:01:02.699> society<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.809> I

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
be a tool for changing society and I

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.719 
be a tool for changing society and I
think<00:01:04.170> we<00:01:04.439> can<00:01:04.680> bring<00:01:05.309> about<00:01:05.430> that

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
think we can bring about that

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.250 
think we can bring about that
