00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.910
 bad news for marvel images of 

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:09.620
 mockingjay and also both a gambit 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.620
 welcome to television 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.280
 the marvel movie saga has been 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.410
 encountered a problem in its phase 3 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.869
 and is that adman has run out 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.430
 director edward wright it is not clear if 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.349
 has been fired or if it was because he 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.660
 wanted but there are the bright differences 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.610
 creative and that they no longer have 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.230
 director the movie dead man has his 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.150
 cast and you have a whole but it 's here at 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.650
 end director if they already have to sign 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.620
 a quick director to continue with the 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.750
 movie or will have to be back nothing 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.790
 remember that it was cool for many years 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.500
 already in the production of and man many 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.239
 marvel movies have had enough 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.580
 problems made the incredible hulk the 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.920
 he had problems with his actor Edward 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.750
 norton ironman also robert deception 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.090
 he had problems sometimes with iron man 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.280
 I'm not a favor the director of the saga 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.750
 of iron man had as they say problems 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.750
 has never been revealed exactly what 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.729
 it also happened of rising howard because 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.280
 Manuel is usually very closed in 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.530
 these things and that is what they say or 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.810
 the fucking street and it seems to be good that 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.290
 if the world by side will replace it 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.750
 surely quickly but still it is 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.880
 a little bitch because bus as 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.409
 has been the director of zombies party of 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.170
 Welcome to the end of the world 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.049
 and 'fatal weapon' was a big bet 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.819
 for this great movie and now without a 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.110
 director so much popularity as 

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:33.690
 it loses quite 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.870
 images of the shooting of the games of the 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.370
 hunger 'mockingjay surely part 1 in 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.100
 which we can see Jennifer Lawrence 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.990
 like the first one a hood and super mine 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.030
 hidden and then we can see it a bit 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.680
 normal and walking around there we also have 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.140
 the first image of julianne moore 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.910
 making soul coin and here we have 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.670
 another one of julianne moore with the deceased 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:57.440
 philip seymour hoffman and a woody 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.440
 harrelson thinking 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.649
 tatum that we have seen in the 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:05.200
 used in class 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.420
 in college or assault the power or 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.000
 soon on jupiter ascending it 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.080
 rumored that it could be change in the 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.080
 next x-men movies 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.980
 and to get that you've been in 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.600
 negotiations for it and although not yet 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.220
 is one hundred percent signed 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.350
 contract seems to be that all this is 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.120
 correct and that is already confirmed but 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.610
 that's not yet one hundred percent signed 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.010
 the contract so it seems but let's 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.750
 that our watch that channing tatum goes 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.400
 to be gambit so that movie is not 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.890
 Of course they say it could come out in x-men 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.840
 apocalypse but who knows already 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.450
 we can see in the movie of origin is 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.580
 I sell it could come out in the new 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.410
 Dow I sell or maybe I have a movie of my own 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.790
 for him almost all the criticism of x-men 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.260
 days of the future past say that 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.260
 you compete with mercury 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.410
 and therefore it has made us wait 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.390
 confirmation that we will return to 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.130
 see in x-men apocalypse the sequel that 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.720
 already a lot of people are preparing 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.060
 critical at the time for the pints that 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.739
 I was wearing but it seems that already when 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.110
 people have seen the movie has changed 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.690
 pretty opinion 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:29.310
