00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.630

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.430
 opinion of people as it is being 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.410
 solved for me that was a problem of 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.489

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.469
 bbb portal was reading 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.140

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.960
 I'm going to prove that my baby has already 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.800

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:56.640
 So you take my way, I did it. 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.989

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.450
 thing pb leaves the law of tc 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.479

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.170
 etc 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.540

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.780
 that was that fault line of 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.870

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.200
 updating the pv usually returns the 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:23.020
 Back home, it was for you. 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.170
 the site that was not opening that did not 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:29.160
 No one was showing it back. 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:34.990
 it works 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:37.060
 it works and until then a game did not give 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.480
 no satisfaction I'm trying to do 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.970
