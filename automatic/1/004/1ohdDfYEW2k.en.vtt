when<00:00:09.510> Eugene's<00:00:10.080> duplicate<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.370> process

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
when Eugene's duplicate is a process

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.689 
when Eugene's duplicate is a process
called<00:00:12.570> DNA<00:00:13.700> replication<00:00:15.590> it<00:00:16.590> makes<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.190> second

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
called DNA replication it makes a second

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.480 
called DNA replication it makes a second
set<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:17.970> genes<00:00:18.420> like<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.080> one<00:00:19.289> people<00:00:20.039> so

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
set of genes like the one people so

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.560 
set of genes like the one people so
there's<00:00:20.789> no<00:00:21.650> variation<00:00:22.650> variation<00:00:23.570> if

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
there's no variation variation if

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.170 
there's no variation variation if
there's<00:00:24.810> two<00:00:25.019> DNA<00:00:25.680> strands<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.670> your<00:00:26.910> cells

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
there's two DNA strands and your cells

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.450 
there's two DNA strands and your cells
can<00:00:27.359> excellent<00:00:28.080> then<00:00:28.920> your<00:00:29.039> cells<00:00:29.250> can

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
can excellent then your cells can

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.690 
can excellent then your cells can
duplicate<00:00:29.849> duplicate<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.219> s<00:00:32.489> phase

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
now it's time for my gaze to bind

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.640 
now it's time for my gaze to bind
everything<00:03:00.820> together<00:03:02.790> now<00:03:03.790> there's<00:03:04.150> two

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
everything together now there's two

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.800 
everything together now there's two
strands<00:03:05.650> of<00:03:05.709> DNA<00:03:07.560> whoa<00:03:09.239> when<00:03:10.239> you<00:03:10.450> change

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
strands of DNA whoa when you change

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.449 
strands of DNA whoa when you change
duplicate<00:03:11.680> is<00:03:12.100> a<00:03:12.130> process<00:03:12.610> called<00:03:13.299> DNA

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
duplicate is a process called DNA

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.930 
duplicate is a process called DNA
replication<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:17.500> makes<00:03:17.769> the<00:03:17.980> second<00:03:18.489> set<00:03:18.730> of

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
replication it makes the second set of

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.400 
replication it makes the second set of
genes<00:03:19.209> like<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.870> one<00:03:20.079> before<00:03:20.320> so<00:03:20.829> there's<00:03:21.549> no

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
genes like the one before so there's no

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.430 
genes like the one before so there's no
variation<00:03:23.410> variation<00:03:24.269> if<00:03:25.269> there's<00:03:25.540> two<00:03:25.750> DNA

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
variation variation if there's two DNA

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.670 
variation variation if there's two DNA
strands<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:27.400> your<00:03:27.640> cell<00:03:27.880> can<00:03:28.120> expand<00:03:28.870> then

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
strands and your cell can expand then

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.430 
strands and your cell can expand then
your<00:03:29.799> cells<00:03:30.010> can<00:03:30.220> duplicate<00:03:30.579> duplicate<00:03:31.540> and

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
your cells can duplicate duplicate and

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.920 
your cells can duplicate duplicate and
in<00:03:32.829> these<00:03:33.010> fans<00:03:33.549> of<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:33.970> cell<00:03:34.269> cycle<00:03:34.480> it

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
in these fans of the cell cycle it

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.560 
in these fans of the cell cycle it
happens<00:03:35.440> so<00:03:35.890> you're<00:03:36.340> still<00:03:36.579> developed<00:03:37.299> and

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
happens so you're still developed and

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.019 
happens so you're still developed and
