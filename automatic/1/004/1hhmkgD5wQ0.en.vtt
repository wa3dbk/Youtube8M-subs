00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.520
 cows to give milk 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.259
 the milk goes to the cooperative 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:11.009
 and he has a chance 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.129
 s and chocolate milk from 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.279
 the corporation were taken from the dairy farmers' members 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:20.729
 wall street cobras is going to merge the members within the new 

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:21.550
 company 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.060
 be equivalent 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.329
 and that was not the case 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.959
 one of the major problems associated with the merger of FrieslandCampina 

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:30.469
 We had to solve different types of certificate and we had to solve 

00:00:30.469 --> 00:00:32.230
 bonds for members 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.739
 the doctors and medical certificate england 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.989
 depository receipts for shares and issued for bonds in the new 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.649
 combination might make the members different in this vision 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.649
 and that is not desirable 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.290
 the corporation must of course be equality between all members 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.420
 changes a major problem but what we had to solve 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.420
 so the members had to and securities unclear 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.420
 and of course expect nothing in return 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.719
 it is therefore extra vigilance with Friesland Campina 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:10.520
 and now vision is put on the market in cement with its the only ones that lendelede 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.370
 is ringing 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.070
 the idea is that such a new instrument must of course be tradable 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.980
 otherwise it just loses its being 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.000
 that was crucial for the success of the transposition 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.120
 And the trust in the new member bonds it is unusual for 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.290
 a bank to book only those that grace their members 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.290
 why is it unusual it is forever he is not an end date 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.800
 Well what a burden then it was us that we have the negotiability of 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.190
 to be able to guarantee member bonds 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.970
 and the rabobank has played an important role in this 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.840
 one jumped and made sure we got it 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.840
 vanden borre after our members could guarantee 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.420
 reason to exclude a free from becoming it is a reason that is 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.430
 a limited group 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.710
 with that, that practice is not guaranteed and with that visas attract 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.710
 kampina asked if we could guarantee that and we did that 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.620
 gouda is just like friesland campina to the corporations understand us 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.640
 problems very big 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.080
 what the tukker normal circulation a good way to be able to work together 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.469
 switch over this type of problem 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:27.779
 because it was important for the merger and because vincent appiah was important 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:28.789
 customer is for us 

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:30.879
 and then something extra done 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:31.809
 normal
