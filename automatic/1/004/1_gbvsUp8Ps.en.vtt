actually unless the person wants most

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.030 
actually unless the person wants most
traffic<00:02:31.120> but<00:02:31.360> if<00:02:31.960> this<00:02:32.380> person<00:02:32.770> is<00:02:32.800> getting

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
traffic but if this person is getting

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.650 
traffic but if this person is getting
more<00:02:33.100> traffic<00:02:33.310> that<00:02:33.850> those<00:02:34.240> are<00:02:34.390> as<00:02:34.450> good

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
more traffic that those are as good

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.300 
more traffic that those are as good
chance<00:02:34.990> like<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.350> our<00:02:35.470> creations<00:02:35.950> could<00:02:36.160> get

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
chance like the our creations could get

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.370 
chance like the our creations could get
flashed<00:02:36.640> I<00:02:36.820> don't<00:02:37.030> know<00:02:37.180> if<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:38.020> guess<00:02:38.170> it's<00:02:38.320> a
