00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:09.780
 [Music] 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.030
 So friends there we are now behind the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.370
 knife and behind the press conference 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.160
 and that is not really correct 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.130
 succeeded by the p6 but 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.540
 Basically it's a g6 where that 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.070
 I can now classify exactly 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.789
 do not tell you exactly 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.430
 In any case, it is very related 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.199
 with the smp 6 and I have one like that 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.860
 I'm a little suspicious 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.079
 Quite remember the price 249 euro 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.530
 has been is that something 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.040
 cheaper version of the essent p6 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.510
 his 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.880
 From the principle we see the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.380
 Form language is only the same when 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.850
 I remember correctly so I am 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.010
 directly from the press conference now 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.710
 here and only have a few things left 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.860
 In the back of the head there is the device in six 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.020
 have three software and colors 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.450
 three like it here so a 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.670
 begin to arrange a bit metallic 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.170
 as always very briefly around the device around 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.770
 So we have those back here 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.409
 quite normal regular 5 megapixel camera 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.060
 with a corresponding led light the 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.219
 me now look if there is something 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.630
 even of five megapixels not as 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:18.299
 Somewhat wrong days down here 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.249
 in turn , according to the speaker 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.039
 on the other side nothing will 

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:25.170
 to the mono speaker 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:26.639
 it is as always kept very flat on 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.159
 So we have the right side 

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:32.609
 power button or standby 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.319
 Button above the volume rocker yes 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:36.060
 the material produced, I can not even 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.219
 so to speak, I would almost say that 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.359
 the plastic but also that would be me 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:40.610
 again message we will be here 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:43.010
 week 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.420
 be on the ice again be present 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.650
 and we get that a little bit 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.780
 look in more detail because of that 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.880
 of course this pre-report here 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.330
 which is not as detailed surely 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.340
 up here in the micro usb port and me 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.370
 look no further microphone opening 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.410
 here on the left side is even more 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.790
 Nothing 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.360
 that is not true down here 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.870
 we probably the 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.119
 headphone jack and down here yes 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.039
 is probably the opening for that 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.140
 microphone back then and the 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.390
 through we come to the front 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.160
 on the front yes what we have there 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.880
 I'll leave it here on the list 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.560
 I do not think it's exactly like that 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.910
 so big that needs also to 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.670
 as big as the front camera is 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.500
 then we have here as said the 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.970
 speakers for phone calls and the 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.900
 corresponding button does that 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.580
 gets at times 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:38.239
 this is a 4.5 inch qhd 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:43.820
 display a bit here with it 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:47.150
 you look that 960 x 540 pixels at 245 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.799
 gpi dissolves so that still I see 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.489
 right here is still something of the 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.810
 camera 5 megapixel front camera and 8 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.410
 megapixel camera 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.030
 Okay, then this seems to be no five 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.640
 to be but one night then I have 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.450
 this with my eyes no longer here 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.430
 to be able to see 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.920
 ok so then the bag camera 8 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.750
 be megapixel and the front camera one 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.330
 5 megapixels of course that relatively 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.860
 exceptional for a front camera 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.450
 okay, what beats under for the here 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.500
 cpu herz that might still be 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.980
 be interesting 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:22.610
 a qualcomm snapdragon processor 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:28.150
 clocked with four core, and each core 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:31.840
 1.2 ghz cpu 1 gb ram and 4 gigabytes 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:35.470
 Program memory expandable 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.680
 micro sd card and a 2000 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.540
 milliampereh strong battery where 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.550
 now here the sim card must come in 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.800
 I honestly confess I did 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.390
 not seen and not where the sd 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.549
 card comes in probably you can 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.930
 I can take off the back here 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.190
 at the fair is now here right now 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.799
 not see it, but as I said that 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.330
 I bring and I deliver to you the na 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.709
 is indeed only times only the first 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.950
 to gain an impression 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.799
 from the device is so again 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.910
 high with own user surface of the 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.980
 look at times just what might 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.400
 What would be interesting is the operating system 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:12.690
 is that one does not have so synonymous first 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.739
 said is a look here again 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:19.500
 I already mentioned the cpu 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:21.180
 android 4.3 okay we were just told 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.580
 actually 4.4 but maybe meant 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.080
 to allow other devices that good 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.730
 now for the first time for the first impressive 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.850
 been here by him high at 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.280
 essent g6 i already wanted with empire 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.840
 say as I said there are still some 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.730
 other videos afterwards if we can 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.140
 device again in detail and have 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.230
 also get the press messages 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.150
 have of the corresponding facts and 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.200
 technical data until then until 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:49.350
 next video from barcelona by mbc 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.090
 2013 if you liked the video 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.740
 will not subscribe now and 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.030
 Maybe it's about twittering google + 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.440
 or facebook 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.440
 So that needs to know 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.480
 Munich 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.740
 the whole 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.909
 [Music] 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.909
 in short, that of the healthy
