can't be going out there and getting
over<00:06:30.720> anxious<00:06:31.050> and<00:06:31.590> giving<00:06:32.520> up<00:06:32.610> points<00:06:33.060> and

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
over anxious and giving up points and

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.250 
over anxious and giving up points and
I'm<00:06:33.270> still<00:06:33.710> still<00:06:35.720> fine-tuning<00:06:36.720> that<00:06:37.230> a

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:37.260 
I'm still still fine-tuning that a

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.370 
I'm still still fine-tuning that a
little<00:06:37.650> bit<00:06:37.800> but<00:06:38.420> let's<00:06:39.420> go<00:06:39.630> out<00:06:39.750> I<00:06:39.990> mean<00:06:40.050> go

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380 
little bit but let's go out I mean go

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.100 
little bit but let's go out I mean go
out<00:06:40.410> there<00:06:40.710> push<00:06:41.010> the<00:06:41.160> pace<00:06:41.370> and<00:06:41.760> score<00:06:42.690> points

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110 
out there push the pace and score points

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.980 
out there push the pace and score points
that's<00:06:43.320> what<00:06:43.530> it's<00:06:43.650> about<00:06:43.740> so<00:06:44.630> putting<00:06:45.630> fuel

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990 
that's what it's about so putting fuel

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.470 
that's what it's about so putting fuel
physics<00:06:46.500> and<00:06:47.000> Friday<00:06:48.000> you<00:06:48.180> have<00:06:48.270> another

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:48.480 
physics and Friday you have another

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.600 
physics and Friday you have another
opportunity

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
opportunity

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.270 
opportunity
