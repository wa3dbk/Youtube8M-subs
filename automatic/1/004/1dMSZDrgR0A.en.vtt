00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.110 

picture<00:01:38.700> nut<00:01:38.850> my<00:01:39.030> might<00:01:39.570> not<00:01:39.720> be<00:01:39.840> clear<00:01:41.120> so

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
picture nut my might not be clear so

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.480 
picture nut my might not be clear so
there<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.780> still<00:01:43.680> need<00:01:43.830> to<00:01:44.360> weld<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.510> a

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
there it is I still need to weld in a

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.990 
there it is I still need to weld in a
bottom<00:01:47.930> baffle<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.370> goes<00:01:50.370> all<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.730> way<00:01:50.940> to

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
bottom baffle that goes all the way to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.540 
bottom baffle that goes all the way to
the<00:01:51.350> end<00:01:52.350> over<00:01:52.560> there<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:53.010> way<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.280> smoke

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
the end over there that way the smoke

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.130 
the end over there that way the smoke
goes<00:01:54.060> under<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.360> baffle<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.010> then

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
goes under the baffle and then

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.300 
goes under the baffle and then
penetrates<00:01:58.140> everything<00:01:58.650> through<00:01:58.860> here<00:01:59.160> and

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
penetrates everything through here and

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.590 
penetrates everything through here and
then<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.729> has<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.880> go<00:02:00.120> out<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.330> pipe<00:02:02.420> I'm<00:02:03.420> also

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
then it has to go out the pipe I'm also

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.280 
then it has to go out the pipe I'm also
going<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.870> build<00:02:04.080> a<00:02:04.170> little<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.890> drip<00:02:05.670> pan<00:02:06.290> which

going to build a little a drip pan which

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.290 
going to build a little a drip pan which
I<00:02:07.410> could<00:02:07.560> put<00:02:07.680> water<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.640> maybe<00:02:08.820> steam
