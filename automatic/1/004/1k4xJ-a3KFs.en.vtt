this<00:00:00.750> is<00:00:00.960> a<00:00:01.050> week<00:00:01.439> high<00:00:01.650> and<00:00:02.100> we<00:00:02.190> want<00:00:02.429> to

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
this is a week high and we want to

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.380 
this is a week high and we want to
combine<00:00:02.939> it<00:00:03.149> with<00:00:03.179> this<00:00:03.689> new<00:00:04.319> swarm<00:00:04.650> hive<00:00:05.390> but

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
combine it with this new swarm hive but

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.299 
combine it with this new swarm hive but
first<00:00:06.690> we<00:00:06.899> have<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.170> consolidate<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:08.099> two

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
first we have to consolidate the two

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.209 
first we have to consolidate the two
boxes<00:00:08.880> into<00:00:09.480> one<00:00:10.110> box<00:00:10.290> take<00:00:10.620> some<00:00:10.830> useful

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
boxes into one box take some useful

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.629 
boxes into one box take some useful
frames<00:00:11.580> from<00:00:11.969> one<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.360> put<00:00:12.509> it<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.750> other

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:13.639 
frames from one and put it the other

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.450 
frames from one and put it the other
once<00:00:14.639> we're<00:00:14.849> down<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.420> one<00:00:15.450> box<00:00:16.139> tonight<00:00:16.770> we'll

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
once we're down to one box tonight we'll

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.429 
once we're down to one box tonight we'll
move<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.180> move<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.990> other<00:00:19.020> hive

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
move that and move it to the other hive

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.550 
move that and move it to the other hive
and<00:00:19.680> put<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:19.920> on<00:00:20.010> top<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:21.140> give<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.320> little

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
and put it on top so give it a little

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.830 
and put it on top so give it a little
smoke<00:00:25.550> take<00:00:26.550> off<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.000> lid<00:00:27.210> with<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> little

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
smoke take off the lid with a little

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.370 
smoke take off the lid with a little
smoke<00:00:28.109> under<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.590> lid<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:29.929> want<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.019> pick<00:00:31.199> this

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
because we're going to be taking those

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:56.700 
because we're going to be taking those
frames<00:00:48.660> in

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.330 

probably<00:00:57.489> keep<00:00:57.730> that<00:00:57.760> frame<00:00:59.160> give<00:01:00.160> a<00:01:00.190> little

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
probably keep that frame give a little

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.600 
probably keep that frame give a little

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
we're getting ready to move this box

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.500 
we're getting ready to move this box
down<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.080> swarm<00:02:20.410> hive

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
down to the swarm hive

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.370 
down to the swarm hive
we've<00:02:22.510> reduced<00:02:23.019> it<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.230> one<00:02:23.590> box<00:02:24.989> it's<00:02:25.989> best<00:02:26.290> to

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
we've reduced it to one box it's best to

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.990 
we've reduced it to one box it's best to
do<00:02:26.560> this<00:02:26.590> at<00:02:26.950> night<00:02:28.019> because<00:02:29.019> all<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.430> forges

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
do this at night because all the forges

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.090 
do this at night because all the forges
are<00:02:31.269> hopefully<00:02:32.049> in<00:02:32.170> there<00:02:34.500> here<00:02:35.500> we<00:02:35.650> are<00:02:35.680> down

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
are hopefully in there here we are down

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
are hopefully in there here we are down
to<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:37.079> target<00:02:38.079> hive<00:02:41.400> we've<00:02:42.400> sealed<00:02:42.700> off<00:02:42.940> the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
to the target hive we've sealed off the

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.140 
to the target hive we've sealed off the
entrance<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.400> queenless<00:02:45.400> box<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:49.000> we're

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
entrance to the queenless box and we're

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.180 
entrance to the queenless box and we're
going<00:02:49.329> to<00:02:49.390> use<00:02:49.600> a<00:02:49.630> newspaper<00:02:49.989> technique<00:02:50.890> for

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
going to use a newspaper technique for

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.420 
going to use a newspaper technique for
combining<00:02:51.640> them<00:02:53.790> I'll<00:02:54.790> put<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.660> paper<00:02:55.900> down

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
combining them I'll put the paper down

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.940 
combining them I'll put the paper down
tape<00:02:57.430> it

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:10.290 

where<00:03:03.580> to<00:03:03.670> go<00:03:06.060> here<00:03:07.060> we<00:03:07.420> go<00:03:08.879> it's<00:03:09.879> stuck<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.269> my

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
where to go here we go it's stuck to my

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:20.210 
where to go here we go it's stuck to my
sleeve

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.730 

the<00:03:20.730> paper<00:03:21.030> is<00:03:21.300> used<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.840> slow<00:03:22.200> down<00:03:22.500> the

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
the paper is used to slow down the

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.270 
the paper is used to slow down the
combination<00:03:23.520> of<00:03:23.820> one<00:03:24.240> box<00:03:24.600> with<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.020> other<00:03:25.280> so

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
combination of one box with the other so

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.700 
combination of one box with the other so
that<00:03:26.520> the<00:03:26.820> pheromones<00:03:27.480> of<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.930> Queen<00:03:28.260> can

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
that the pheromones of the Queen can

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.950 
that the pheromones of the Queen can
drip<00:03:29.160> throughout<00:03:29.550> so<00:03:29.940> that<00:03:29.970> they<00:03:30.360> will<00:03:30.510> accept

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
drip throughout so that they will accept

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.250 
drip throughout so that they will accept
the<00:03:31.140> Queen<00:03:31.410> as<00:03:31.650> their<00:03:31.830> own<00:03:32.690> we're<00:03:33.690> punching

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
the Queen as their own we're punching

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.420 
the Queen as their own we're punching
little<00:03:34.710> holes<00:03:34.890> with<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:36.350> nail<00:03:37.350> so<00:03:37.680> that<00:03:37.710> some

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
little holes with a nail so that some

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.550 
little holes with a nail so that some
