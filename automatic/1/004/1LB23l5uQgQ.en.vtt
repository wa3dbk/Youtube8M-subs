00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.889
 the backpack photo vanguard sky terminals 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.780
 48 we could see here we're staying at 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.880
 abdominal and pectoral level 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.300
 we will look a little closer 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.640
 bag capacity approaching or so on 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:29.180
 the classic front the tripod always 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.180
 no problem 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.040
 apple tree a storage space in front 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.739
 so that's the portable part 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.390
 document 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:43.879
 so here whose klaus that comes with 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:47.719
 the plano bag a friend a 13 inches 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.829
 maximum capacity so it's indicated 14 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.739
 so we can put all kinds 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.579
 of pens documents so that's enough 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:59.059
 deep enough is wide enough 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.870
 second storage space 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.939
 it's behind men's bag 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.610
 see this the zips are quite rare 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.060
 nature is really well protected so 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.610
 paris here a broad enough space there 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:22.670
 there are big binoculars a viewfinder 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:26.070
 video a big flash micro wallet 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.670
 curious add a phone a 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.470
 battery charger yes it really is a 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:40.740
 big confidence with me I put that back 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:42.299
 multiple tac and it passes compartments 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.280
 from the bottom up it's the really comparing 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.280
 dedicated to photography 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.020
 here you see the greenhouse we can see the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.210
 system erp system there really the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.790
 padding at the back this is 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.890
 really to make them big 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:01.350
 hike with a lot of material so 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.700
 here we have a reflex that loses matters 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.190
 confirm you see we still have 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.920
 spasms so we can put 24 36 years or 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.350
 if he is riding with a 70 of 102.8 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.880
 stable and then we have a second and 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.959
 a third reason that they are the 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.090
 masters in there on it in height 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.880
 since it's a bag and deep country so 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.750
 in addition we put a punk is all pretty 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.610
 after you have the dimensions 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:31.190
 of the bag 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:36.720
 here we are about 28 cm wide 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:39.200
 we are on a sand that is 23 cm and in 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.200
 depth 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:52.250
 but on a bag that does I not if you 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:54.990
 can see 17 cm here was the small logo 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.460
 reindeer cover to the rain cover that 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.250
 allows you to completely cover the 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.820
 bag to protect it in this case of 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:09.300
 bad weather we will show you how 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:11.280
 have access to the fast space that when 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.690
 he is carrying so when I speak it 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.880
 like that I will have access to my 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.010
 material but I do not want I do not want to 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.730
 stop 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.920

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:35.310
 memories and there hop I quickdraw game can 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:37.640
 shooter I put back my case nothing 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.640
 simpler 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.290
 I put on the back and I can leave 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.270
 that's a little bit of what it gives when 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.620
 it is worn 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.220
 that's what we could say about on this 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.709
