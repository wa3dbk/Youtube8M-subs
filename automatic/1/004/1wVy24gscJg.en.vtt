it in it's that simple

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.840 
it in it's that simple
we've<00:01:10.740> got<00:01:10.829> a<00:01:10.859> three<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.280> half<00:01:11.399> inch<00:01:11.639> for

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
we've got a three and a half inch for

so again all we're gonna do is take this

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:20.359 
so again all we're gonna do is take this
out<00:01:18.899> of<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.049> box<00:01:19.259> set<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.679> down<00:01:19.709> in<00:01:19.950> place<00:01:19.979> and

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
out of the box set it down in place and

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.539 
out of the box set it down in place and
strap<00:01:20.609> it<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:21.859> okay<00:01:22.859> so<00:01:22.920> what<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.219> have<00:01:23.249> is<00:01:23.459> we

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
strap it in okay so what we have is we

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.800 
strap it in okay so what we have is we
have<00:01:23.579> two<00:01:23.700> different<00:01:23.939> size<00:01:24.240> chocks<00:01:24.569> and<00:01:24.659> what

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
have two different size chocks and what
