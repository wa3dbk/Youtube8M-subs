the<00:01:41.790> one<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.000> stood<00:01:42.180> out<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.450> most<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:42.930> me

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
the one that stood out the most for me

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.080 
the one that stood out the most for me
in<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.560> Germany<00:01:43.979> OPI<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> next<00:01:44.880> color

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
in the Germany OPI so the next color

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.450 
in the Germany OPI so the next color
have<00:01:45.390> by<00:01:45.600> OPI<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.799> don't<00:01:46.979> know<00:01:47.130> Jacques

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460
