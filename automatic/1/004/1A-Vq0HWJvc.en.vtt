what<00:00:00.179> is<00:00:00.299> it<00:00:00.450> PVC<00:00:01.020> mean<00:00:01.230> well<00:00:01.860> a<00:00:01.890> PVC<00:00:02.429> is<00:00:02.879> a

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
what is it PVC mean well a PVC is a

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.300 
what is it PVC mean well a PVC is a
premature<00:00:03.659> ventricular<00:00:04.200> contraction<00:00:05.190> and

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
premature ventricular contraction and

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.030 
premature ventricular contraction and
it's<00:00:05.790> an<00:00:05.940> extra<00:00:06.509> beat<00:00:06.750> so<00:00:07.319> again<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.770> heart

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
it's an extra beat so again the heart

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.400 
it's an extra beat so again the heart
upper<00:00:08.730> chamber<00:00:09.210> lower<00:00:09.450> chamber<00:00:10.050> upper

upper chamber lower chamber upper

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.140 
upper chamber lower chamber upper
chamber<00:00:10.860> then<00:00:11.070> if<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.309> lower<00:00:11.519> chamber<00:00:11.910> throws

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
chamber then if the lower chamber throws

chamber then if the lower chamber throws
in<00:00:12.330> an<00:00:12.450> extra<00:00:12.870> beat<00:00:13.080> that's<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.769> PVC<00:00:14.299> can<00:00:15.299> you

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
in an extra beat that's a PVC can you

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.480 
in an extra beat that's a PVC can you
see<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:15.780> on<00:00:15.929> electrocardiogram<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:17.160> can

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
see that on electrocardiogram you can

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.359 
see that on electrocardiogram you can
yes<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:19.199> activity<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:20.010> comes<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
yes and the activity that comes the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.220 
yes and the activity that comes the
electrocardiogram<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.539> beat<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:21.900> coming

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
electrocardiogram the beat is coming

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.570 
electrocardiogram the beat is coming
from<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.529> muscle<00:00:22.890> but<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.160> puts<00:00:23.430> out

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
from the muscle but it puts out

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.700 
from the muscle but it puts out
electrical<00:00:24.060> current<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:25.199> that's<00:00:25.500> right

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
electrical current that that's right

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.990 
electrical current that that's right
that's<00:00:25.859> exactly<00:00:26.010> right<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.699> can<00:00:26.849> see

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
that's exactly right and you can see

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.700 
that's exactly right and you can see
that<00:00:27.119> as<00:00:27.300> an<00:00:27.420> extra<00:00:27.630> spike<00:00:28.199> on<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
that as an extra spike on the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.730 
that as an extra spike on the
electrocardiogram<00:00:29.369> now<00:00:29.970> that's<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.840> premature

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
electrocardiogram now that's a premature

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.639 
electrocardiogram now that's a premature
ventricular<00:00:32.030> that's<00:00:33.030> what<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.750> ventricle

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
ventricular that's what is the ventricle

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.380 
ventricular that's what is the ventricle
that's<00:00:35.100> from<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.430> lower<00:00:35.460> chamber<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
that's from the lower chamber the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.630 
that's from the lower chamber the
pumping<00:00:36.780> chance<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.290> big<00:00:37.530> pump<00:00:37.950> right<00:00:38.340> how

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
pumping chance the big pump right how

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.600 
pumping chance the big pump right how
about<00:00:38.940> an<00:00:39.260> atrial<00:00:40.260> premature<00:00:41.010> contraction

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
about an atrial premature contraction

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.729 
about an atrial premature contraction
right<00:00:42.059> that's<00:00:42.360> when<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.660> extra<00:00:43.200> beat<00:00:43.410> comes

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
right that's when the extra beat comes

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.740 
right that's when the extra beat comes
from<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.100> upper<00:00:44.399> chamber<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:44.969> an<00:00:45.090> extra<00:00:45.570> beat

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
from the upper chamber so an extra beat

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.779 
from the upper chamber so an extra beat
can<00:00:46.020> be<00:00:46.230> thrown<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.739> from<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.039> upper<00:00:47.190> chamber

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
can be thrown in from the upper chamber

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.209 
can be thrown in from the upper chamber
or<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.390> lower<00:00:48.600> chamber<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.500> how<00:00:49.920> does<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
or the lower chamber so how does the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.740 
or the lower chamber so how does the
patient<00:00:50.579> feel<00:00:50.760> if<00:00:50.969> they've<00:00:51.120> got<00:00:51.300> an<00:00:51.420> extra

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
patient feel if they've got an extra

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.080 
patient feel if they've got an extra
beat<00:00:51.899> apiaceae

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
beat apiaceae

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.459 
beat apiaceae
premature<00:00:54.090> atrial<00:00:54.329> contraction<00:00:55.230> or

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
premature atrial contraction or

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.959 
premature atrial contraction or
premature<00:00:55.770> ventricular<00:00:56.280> how<00:00:56.699> does<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
premature ventricular how does the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.490 
premature ventricular how does the
patient<00:00:57.360> feel<00:00:57.480> how<00:00:57.660> do<00:00:57.719> they<00:00:58.020> know<00:00:58.289> it

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
patient feel how do they know it

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.160 
patient feel how do they know it
sometimes<00:00:58.920> well<00:00:59.489> oftentimes<00:01:00.180> people<00:01:00.809> feel

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
sometimes well oftentimes people feel

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.590 
sometimes well oftentimes people feel
like<00:01:01.350> their<00:01:01.590> heart<00:01:01.829> skipped<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.550> beat<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:03.420> if

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
like their heart skipped a beat so if

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.050 
like their heart skipped a beat so if
they<00:01:03.719> can<00:01:03.960> sense<00:01:04.409> their<00:01:04.769> heartbeat<00:01:05.309> they<00:01:05.790> feel

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
they can sense their heartbeat they feel

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.060 
they can sense their heartbeat they feel
like<00:01:06.240> they<00:01:06.450> actually<00:01:06.600> missed<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.470> beat<00:01:07.710> and

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
like they actually missed a beat and

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.160 
like they actually missed a beat and
that<00:01:08.640> afterwards<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.540> heart<00:01:09.720> comes<00:01:09.960> back

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
that afterwards the heart comes back

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.620 
that afterwards the heart comes back
strong<00:01:10.799> because<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.820> has<00:01:11.970> longer<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.420> fill

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
strong because it has longer to fill

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.660 
strong because it has longer to fill
that's<00:01:13.229> exactly<00:01:13.680> right<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:13.890> it's<00:01:14.220> pumping<00:01:14.520> out

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
that's exactly right so it's pumping out

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.730 
that's exactly right so it's pumping out
more<00:01:14.700> blood<00:01:15.060> right<00:01:15.390> there<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.380> there's<00:01:16.619> a

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
more blood right there but so there's a

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.310 
more blood right there but so there's a
long<00:01:17.340> pause<00:01:17.820> after<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.630> extra<00:01:19.020> beat<00:01:19.140> where

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
long pause after that extra beat where

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.200 
long pause after that extra beat where
the<00:01:19.409> heart<00:01:19.590> really<00:01:19.770> can<00:01:20.070> fill<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.700> up<00:01:20.850> that's

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
the heart really can fill so up that's

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.550 
the heart really can fill so up that's
right<00:01:21.420> how<00:01:21.689> do<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.840> know<00:01:21.960> if<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.200> dangerous

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
right how do you know if it's dangerous

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.190 
right how do you know if it's dangerous
or<00:01:22.710> not<00:01:22.740> dangerous<00:01:23.299> well<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.840> very<00:01:25.049> good

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
or not dangerous well it's a very good

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.140 
or not dangerous well it's a very good
question<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.070> that's<00:01:26.430> something<00:01:26.939> that

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
question and that that's something that

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.090 
question and that that's something that
actually<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.990> physician<00:01:28.560> helps<00:01:28.950> to

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
actually the the physician helps to

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.300 
actually the the physician helps to
figure<00:01:29.430> out<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.880> would<00:01:30.450> say<00:01:31.130> we're<00:01:32.130> more

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
figure out I would say we're more

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.249 
figure out I would say we're more
worried<00:01:32.670> about<00:01:32.759> dangerous<00:01:33.420> heart<00:01:33.810> beats<00:01:34.049> for

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
worried about dangerous heart beats for

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.899 
worried about dangerous heart beats for
somebody<00:01:34.650> with<00:01:34.829> heart<00:01:35.100> disease<00:01:35.579> like

more of them right in the first case
when<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.479> exercise<00:01:57.780> if<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.500> extra<00:01:58.860> beats<00:01:59.040> go

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
when you exercise if the extra beats go

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.819 
when you exercise if the extra beats go
away<00:01:59.610> or<00:01:59.820> smooth<00:02:00.270> out<00:02:00.600> with<00:02:00.810> exercise<00:02:01.290> that's

away or smooth out with exercise that's
good<00:02:02.189> that's<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.610> good<00:02:02.640> finding<00:02:03.119> if<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.750> gets

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
good that's a good finding if it gets

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.109 
good that's a good finding if it gets
worse<00:02:04.259> with<00:02:04.619> exercise<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.759> can<00:02:05.939> be<00:02:06.060> a

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
worse with exercise that can be a

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.449 
worse with exercise that can be a
serious<00:02:06.390> finding<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.350> if<00:02:07.530> it's<00:02:07.710> worse<00:02:08.069> then

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
serious finding and if it's worse then

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.160 
serious finding and if it's worse then
you<00:02:08.700> have<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.970> go<00:02:09.090> further<00:02:09.390> on<00:02:09.690> in<00:02:09.929> the

there<00:02:19.650> are<00:02:19.890> medications<00:02:20.580> for<00:02:21.120> example<00:02:21.180> there

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720

there are medications for example there
medications<00:02:22.319> called<00:02:22.560> beta<00:02:22.890> blockers<00:02:23.489> that

medications called beta blockers that
block<00:02:24.390> adrenaline<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.220> buffers<00:02:26.970> the
