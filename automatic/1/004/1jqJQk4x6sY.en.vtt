Wednesday<00:00:03.300> September<00:00:03.720> 26th<00:00:04.529> and<00:00:04.710> I<00:00:04.740> thought

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
Wednesday September 26th and I thought

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.490 
Wednesday September 26th and I thought
I'd<00:00:05.130> do<00:00:05.279> an<00:00:05.430> update<00:00:05.879> on<00:00:06.150> some<00:00:06.509> citrus<00:00:07.230> trees

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
I'd do an update on some citrus trees

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.390 
I'd do an update on some citrus trees

here this here's the shamoto sour orange
I<00:00:12.080> haven't<00:00:13.080> tried<00:00:13.259> this<00:00:13.500> yet<00:00:13.740> but<00:00:14.009> I<00:00:14.070> guess

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
I haven't tried this yet but I guess

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.599 
I haven't tried this yet but I guess
it's<00:00:14.460> very<00:00:14.549> sour<00:00:15.059> it's<00:00:15.560> an<00:00:16.560> orange<00:00:16.920> flavor<00:00:17.250> and

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
it's very sour it's an orange flavor and

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.200 
it's very sour it's an orange flavor and
it's<00:00:17.970> good<00:00:18.210> for<00:00:18.410> Mama<00:00:19.410> Wade's<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:20.060> don't<00:00:21.060> think

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
it's good for Mama Wade's I don't think

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.980 
it's good for Mama Wade's I don't think
you<00:00:21.300> eat<00:00:21.930> them<00:00:22.109> directly<00:00:22.560> off<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.800> tree<00:00:23.990> here

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
you eat them directly off the tree here

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.330 
you eat them directly off the tree here
is<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.430> Satsuma<00:00:27.080> the<00:00:28.080> extent<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.980> tree<00:00:29.189> this

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
is a Satsuma the extent of the tree this

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.519 
is a Satsuma the extent of the tree this
is<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.519> dwarf<00:00:29.849> tree<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:30.449> it's<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.960> root<00:00:31.170> stock

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
is a dwarf tree so it's on a root stock

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.990 
is a dwarf tree so it's on a root stock
that<00:00:31.769> keeps<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.880> dwarfed<00:00:33.210> size<00:00:34.850> so<00:00:35.850> they're

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
that keeps it dwarfed size so they're

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.920 
that keeps it dwarfed size so they're
still<00:00:36.210> green<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:37.100> tree<00:00:38.100> here<00:00:38.660> this<00:00:39.660> last

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
still green on this tree here this last

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.740 
still green on this tree here this last
week<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.350> September<00:00:43.370> this<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.550> my<00:00:44.730> first<00:00:45.210> Meyer

lemon tree that I purchased and I cut

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.650 
lemon tree that I purchased and I cut
back<00:00:48.270> severe<00:00:48.719> elite<00:00:49.670> months<00:00:50.670> ago<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.480> check

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
back severe elite months ago and check

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.450 
back severe elite months ago and check
out<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.020> video<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.530> maybe<00:00:52.890> I'll<00:00:53.100> link<00:00:53.280> it

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
out the video on that maybe I'll link it

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.139 
out the video on that maybe I'll link it
to<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:53.850> video<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:55.550> it's<00:00:56.550> just<00:00:56.789> packed<00:00:56.969> with

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
to this video and it's just packed with

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.750 
to this video and it's just packed with
flowers<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.930> fact<00:00:58.260> it's<00:00:59.070> got<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.340> be<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> best

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
flowers in fact it's got to be the best

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.639 
flowers in fact it's got to be the best
thing<00:01:00.059> going<00:01:00.090> now<00:01:00.539> for<00:01:00.600> bees<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.379> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
thing going now for bees and the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.549 
thing going now for bees and the
bumblebees<00:01:02.420> actually<00:01:03.420> sleep<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.290> flower

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
bumblebees actually sleep on the flower

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.570 
bumblebees actually sleep on the flower
during<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> night

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
during the night

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.090 
during the night
I<00:01:05.960> guess<00:01:06.960> they<00:01:07.140> figure<00:01:07.439> why<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.650> leave<00:01:07.860> if<00:01:07.979> I

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
I guess they figure why I leave if I

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.649 
I guess they figure why I leave if I
just<00:01:08.310> stay<00:01:08.520> right<00:01:08.700> here<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:09.180> have<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> nice

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
with ripening by Vince look at the size

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.630 
with ripening by Vince look at the size
of<00:01:48.459> this<00:01:48.549> lemon<00:01:48.939> here<00:01:49.149> and<00:01:49.299> the<00:01:50.049> size<00:01:50.409> of<00:01:50.649> that

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
of this lemon here and the size of that

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.440 
of this lemon here and the size of that
branch<00:01:52.229> let's<00:01:53.229> see<00:01:53.409> how<00:01:53.530> it<00:01:53.649> stays<00:01:53.920> on<00:01:54.159> there

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.940 

and<00:01:58.450> this<00:01:58.630> one's<00:01:58.869> not<00:01:58.989> doing<00:01:59.349> too<00:01:59.500> good<00:01:59.709> I

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
and this one's not doing too good I

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.010 
and this one's not doing too good I
don't<00:02:00.009> know<00:02:00.220> it<00:02:01.119> seemed<00:02:01.420> like<00:02:01.450> it<00:02:01.750> was<00:02:01.869> doing

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
don't know it seemed like it was doing

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.100 
don't know it seemed like it was doing
better<00:02:02.560> and<00:02:03.009> then<00:02:03.130> I<00:02:03.450> know<00:02:04.450> for<00:02:04.659> the<00:02:04.750> rootstock

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
better and then I know for the rootstock

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.990 
better and then I know for the rootstock
here<00:02:05.530> just<00:02:05.799> requires<00:02:06.280> really<00:02:06.700> hot

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
here just requires really hot

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.580 
here just requires really hot
temperatures<00:02:07.390> but<00:02:07.840> this<00:02:07.989> is<00:02:08.110> a<00:02:08.170> tango

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
temperatures but this is a tango

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.309 
temperatures but this is a tango
mandarin<00:02:09.069> and<00:02:10.000> it<00:02:10.360> seemed<00:02:10.569> to<00:02:10.690> start<00:02:10.989> going

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
mandarin and it seemed to start going

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.470 
mandarin and it seemed to start going
downhill<00:02:11.709> again<00:02:12.099> so<00:02:12.640> I<00:02:12.959> just<00:02:15.209> fertilized<00:02:16.209> it

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
downhill again so I just fertilized it

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.059 
downhill again so I just fertilized it
which<00:02:16.629> I<00:02:16.780> don't<00:02:16.959> know<00:02:17.049> if<00:02:17.110> I'm<00:02:17.290> under<00:02:17.590> watering

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
which I don't know if I'm under watering

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.800 
which I don't know if I'm under watering
it<00:02:18.190> all<00:02:18.340> over<00:02:18.819> watering<00:02:19.209> it<00:02:19.450> it's<00:02:19.599> a<00:02:19.660> really

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
it all over watering it it's a really

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.559 
it all over watering it it's a really
good<00:02:20.110> drainage<00:02:20.470> soil<00:02:20.859> mix<00:02:21.190> here<00:02:21.400> but<00:02:21.700> maybe<00:02:22.450> I

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
good drainage soil mix here but maybe I

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.270 
good drainage soil mix here but maybe I

need to bring this inside and put it on
a<00:02:24.310> heat<00:02:24.489> map<00:02:24.730> I<00:02:26.760> really<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:28.480> best<00:02:28.660> thing<00:02:28.900> right

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
a heat map I really the best thing right

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:39.080 
a heat map I really the best thing right
now<00:02:29.139> is<00:02:29.650> this<00:02:30.639> is<00:02:32.069> another<00:02:34.170> Harare<00:02:35.170> Satsuma

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090

they're<00:02:40.090> not<00:02:40.209> as<00:02:40.389> orange<00:02:40.810> as<00:02:40.930> I<00:02:41.109> remember<00:02:41.620> them

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
they're not as orange as I remember them

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.180 
they're not as orange as I remember them
I<00:02:41.980> headed<00:02:42.160> up<00:02:42.340> against<00:02:42.819> the<00:02:43.090> wall<00:02:44.190> south

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
I headed up against the wall south

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.309 
I headed up against the wall south
facing<00:02:45.459> wall<00:02:45.819> against<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.540> foundation<00:02:47.170> all

facing wall against the foundation all

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.940 
facing wall against the foundation all
last<00:02:47.590> year<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.160> I<00:02:49.049> know<00:02:50.049> maybe<00:02:50.230> he's<00:02:50.440> just<00:02:50.500> the

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
last year and I know maybe he's just the

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.479 
last year and I know maybe he's just the
overcast<00:02:51.430> today<00:02:52.079> but<00:02:53.079> they<00:02:53.739> seem<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.010> be<00:02:54.250> ripe

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
overcast today but they seem to be ripe

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.550 
overcast today but they seem to be ripe
the<00:02:54.760> skin<00:02:55.060> seems<00:02:55.329> to<00:02:55.510> be<00:02:55.599> separated<00:02:56.200> from<00:02:56.380> the

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
the skin seems to be separated from the

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.890 
the skin seems to be separated from the
inside<00:02:56.950> these<00:02:57.790> are<00:02:58.000> called<00:02:58.180> zipper<00:02:58.540> appeals

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
inside these are called zipper appeals

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.729 
inside these are called zipper appeals
because<00:02:59.319> they<00:02:59.560> just<00:02:59.739> peels<00:03:00.730> so<00:03:00.970> easily<00:03:01.739> now

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
because they just peels so easily now

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.319 
because they just peels so easily now
they<00:03:02.919> think<00:03:03.069> about<00:03:03.250> it<00:03:03.549> it's<00:03:03.730> almost<00:03:03.849> like<00:03:04.120> the

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
they think about it it's almost like the

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.690 
they think about it it's almost like the
citrus<00:03:04.569> version<00:03:05.200> of<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.709> tongue<00:03:06.010> it<00:03:06.130> is<00:03:06.310> where

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
citrus version of the tongue it is where

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.089 
citrus version of the tongue it is where
where<00:03:06.880> they're<00:03:07.060> right<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:08.410> skin<00:03:08.739> doesn't

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
where they're right the skin doesn't

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:10.830 
where they're right the skin doesn't
even<00:03:09.220> seem<00:03:09.489> to<00:03:09.579> be<00:03:09.790> attached<00:03:10.120> to<00:03:10.299> the<00:03:10.540> fruit

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
even seem to be attached to the fruit

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.280 
even seem to be attached to the fruit
inside<00:03:12.419> where<00:03:13.419> it's<00:03:13.510> just<00:03:13.599> a<00:03:13.750> protective

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
inside where it's just a protective

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.490 
inside where it's just a protective
coating

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
coating

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.030 
coating
so<00:03:16.310> we'll<00:03:16.790> pick<00:03:16.940> one<00:03:17.120> of<00:03:17.240> these<00:03:17.330> and<00:03:17.570> see<00:03:18.040> what

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
so we'll pick one of these and see what

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.240 
so we'll pick one of these and see what
they<00:03:19.160> look<00:03:19.340> like<00:03:19.370> inside<00:03:20.560> but<00:03:21.560> yeah<00:03:21.740> this<00:03:22.040> is

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
they look like inside but yeah this is

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.870 
they look like inside but yeah this is
this<00:03:23.030> isn't<00:03:23.330> a<00:03:23.390> dwarf<00:03:23.690> this<00:03:23.960> here<00:03:24.230> is<00:03:24.380> a<00:03:24.880> could

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
this isn't a dwarf this here is a could

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.110 
this isn't a dwarf this here is a could
be<00:03:26.060> a<00:03:26.090> full-sized<00:03:26.600> tree<00:03:27.080> if<00:03:27.140> I<00:03:27.380> was<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.740> live<00:03:28.120> or

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
be a full-sized tree if I was to live or

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.310 
be a full-sized tree if I was to live or
I<00:03:29.150> lived<00:03:29.450> in<00:03:29.990> Florida<00:03:30.460> and<00:03:31.930> they<00:03:32.930> could<00:03:33.140> see

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
I lived in Florida and they could see

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.900 
I lived in Florida and they could see
the<00:03:33.440> difference<00:03:33.800> here<00:03:33.980> this<00:03:34.190> is<00:03:34.370> producing

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
the difference here this is producing

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.630 
the difference here this is producing
ripe<00:03:35.090> fruit<00:03:35.420> with<00:03:35.600> the<00:03:35.690> other<00:03:35.810> ones<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:37.340> dwarf

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
ripe fruit with the other ones the dwarf

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.050 
ripe fruit with the other ones the dwarf
variety<00:03:38.090> is<00:03:38.270> still<00:03:38.540> green<00:03:39.700> so<00:03:40.700> I<00:03:40.790> don't<00:03:41.000> know

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
variety is still green so I don't know

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.220 
variety is still green so I don't know
if<00:03:41.150> that<00:03:41.270> has<00:03:41.450> to<00:03:41.570> do<00:03:41.690> with<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.930> rootstock<00:03:42.320> or

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
if that has to do with the rootstock or

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.350 
if that has to do with the rootstock or
for<00:03:45.230> whether<00:03:45.410> it's<00:03:45.620> a<00:03:45.710> dwarf<00:03:45.830> or<00:03:46.130> not<00:03:46.310> but<00:03:46.820> so

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
for whether it's a dwarf or not but so

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.460 
for whether it's a dwarf or not but so
let's<00:03:47.540> go<00:03:47.660> ahead<00:03:47.840> and<00:03:47.930> pick<00:03:48.080> one<00:03:48.260> of<00:03:48.350> these

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
let's go ahead and pick one of these

00:03:48.470 --> 00:04:03.620 
let's go ahead and pick one of these
sets<00:03:49.250> two<00:03:49.430> oranges<00:03:50.140> we<00:03:51.140> go

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
like the skin is separated from the
