00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 all good mood with you i 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.569
 Anthony today decided to build the most 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.519
 ordinary house minecraft why am I 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.210
 decided to build today this particular 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.860
 construction 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.240
 yes because lately I 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.980
 noticed that so far most 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.199
 Minecraft players build the most 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.760
 ordinary primitive type of construction 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.980
 that is, the usual box 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.020
 but as a home and I decided somehow 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.029
 a little diversify something to add 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.570
 grace to this house and show more 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.800
 less such a typical don which can 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.679
 use different buildings then 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.420
 there is for example you live or play and 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.860
 even on the same server you can 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.530
 quietly use this building 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.780
 somehow build it I think it will turn out 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.430
 quite sparingly and so I decided 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.190
 record this video today 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.620
 proper scheme you see on the screen then 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.840
 there is a number of blocks in length wide 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.070
 more or less kind of house which should 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.960
 get in the end 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.960
 and let's get started
