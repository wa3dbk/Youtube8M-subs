00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.289 

but<00:01:16.890> um<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.759> bb's<00:01:19.369> obviously<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.580> previous

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
but um the bb's obviously the previous

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.760 
but um the bb's obviously the previous
owner<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.630> believe<00:01:21.990> used<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.470> maybe<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.740> couple

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
owner I believe used it maybe a couple

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.340 
owner I believe used it maybe a couple
times<00:01:23.220> but<00:01:23.400> not<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.700> many<00:01:23.909> times<00:01:24.350> because

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
times but not that many times because

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.859 
times but not that many times because
these<00:01:26.280> tools<00:01:26.549> were<00:01:26.850> never<00:01:27.119> opened<00:01:27.540> up<00:01:27.600> out<00:01:27.780> of

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
the original bag and I guess this is to

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.870 
the original bag and I guess this is to
help<00:01:29.610> take<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.970> gun<00:01:30.119> apart<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:31.020> here's<00:01:31.590> the

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
help take the gun apart and here's the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.700 
help take the gun apart and here's the
orange<00:01:32.880> plug<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.509> goes<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.470> case

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
orange plug that goes in it in case

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.609
