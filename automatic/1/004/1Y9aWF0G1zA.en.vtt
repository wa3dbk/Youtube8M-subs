00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.500
 So today's video you see how you yours 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.840
 can sharpen sharp iron 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.629
 you can not do anything about it except as one 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.400
 belt sander and so scherf stone 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:14.990
 the has also hours in my 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.770
 last video where i see the usa 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.690
 have done 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:22.670
 so I'll stop again this degree 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:26.119
 in the distant what I actually now 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.859
 just have to keep in mind is that this 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.070
 angle of your sting already 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.480
 or not is he's just 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.800
 it should not always be maintained here 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.580
 the angle will change with this one 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.470
 Rounding is created so I will now 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.620
 still rushing out here a little bit outside 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.900
 are so you can see better how 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.800
 a lot and how fast from the cutting edge 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.800
 is removed 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.379
 should that be with the brand times 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.570
 from the vote this sandpaper what 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.550
 This is sad on this Wandschneider 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.780
 Sixties sandpaper but I had 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.909
 in use for so long 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.400
 that these grains are actually 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.650
 not at all because of this 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.170
 Body as heavy as so are so from 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.350
 apart are the cut already 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.720
 very sharp but you can stop if 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.979
 the angle at the cutting edge 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.020
 You do not have to adjust like that anymore 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.119
 set quickly 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.130
 but once it's set, yes 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.170
 wonderful to start only after 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.360
 you're only sharpening your edge and 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.590
 not somehow bring right angle 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.190
 You would not need a cooling water 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.690
 because that makes itself very fast 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.380
 better a little quieter now 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.380
 happens 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.340
 So I really do not have anything yet 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.170
 I am only a few times over cut 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.799
 the sandpaper in gear and mine 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.170
 cutting edge 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.790
 is already finished if you are 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.340
 or if the iron on the 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.370
 back is a little crooked or that 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.250
 helmet then you can still the mirror 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.620
 Grind page on the sheet of paper 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:02.209
 so that this games page nicely 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:05.590
 scarce will remove in the change step 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:08.750
 we again with the whetstone the grad 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.099
 So first my 4000 kÃ¶rnung 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.349
 and later again to polish the 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.349
 Eight thousand can if you yours 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.879
 scherf stone must have participated 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.959
 you're just bad at taking both 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:24.379
 first set it with the cutting edge and 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.590
 it's over in a few fast trains 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:36.019
 the rough side of the stone becomes so 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:37.609
 Graz well away now you can already 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.260
 make the first test if the cutting edge 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.359
 already pretty sharp 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.400
 and if you're on this side about the 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.530
 Cutting edge then you notice that here 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.419
 no gradiometer 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.519
 However, if one behind it the 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:51.560
 stands so turned around you realize completely 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.510
 clear that there is still a degree 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.310
 this degree is still going on 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.510
 remove and we do the same as 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.909
 before that too 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:04.340
 we hold that notes and that 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:08.150
 piece of iron hold very flat so no 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:11.769
 too big angle in the lower cutting edge 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.879
 Once again, some trains are ground 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:19.780
 Here you really see that very much 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:19.780
 fast they are user friendly 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.370
 Check if the cutting is still grad 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.690
 Degree 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.330
 and now you can see well again 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.270
 that here again the cut a 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.340
 very low for free and that and there 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.740
 go over it now and now 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.190
 but not so often because that's just it 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.060
 still very little is over and see 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.690
 really is 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:51.340
 very sharp when you remove the degree 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:54.590
 you can hand over to polishing 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:58.760
 I use the whetstone again 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:01.340
 the side is going to be some liquid 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.780
 whetstone is now massive again 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.070
 Let's see our cutting edge again 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:17.090
 go over the place for schlei 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:19.340
 polish the other side and that's it 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:23.270
 we already need the cutting one 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:25.389
 to dry and feel 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.010
 you can really see that is 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:31.520
 razor sharp those have it here 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:34.430
 a latte clamped that is spruce 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.169
 and you know how to spruce marx yes 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.190
 Rip out when you see the stars side 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:43.639
 edited now I have my graz 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.460
 business pier and we try 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:46.760
 here are a few trains from the front 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.789
 to decrease 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.470
 you can really recognize it 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:58.780
 cuts and tears that should not 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:06:04.100
 out at this long stand you can see 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:08.590
 the very sharp is the iron that could 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:11.750
 you with an iron what we say yes 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.210
 duller is like this one can do that 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.410
 do not do 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.660
 So that is there actually a really 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.660
 good test 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:22.610
 and if you have such a nice side 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.800
 edited to check if he 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.889
 Sharp is removed 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.320
 at the same time the degree of a whole 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:35.120
 fine straight one does not make directly away 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:37.190
 could the removed you so you can 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:41.479
 good at recognizing that every cut 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:45.410
 chips are getting finer and finer 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:47.990
 for example here so you something times 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.479
 again with me in this video have so 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:53.450
 Seen how to use these flat sting irons 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:54.749
 sharpens and next theaf video see 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.270
 you how to be this wise 

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:59.770
 but because I'm allowed one more here 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.719
 It really has to build a better station 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.159
 I could do that in this 

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:04.779
 video do not do so next time 

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:05.969
 video you see how to get such a 

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:08.889
 workshop can install 

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:12.159
 and that's it, I mean never with me 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:15.699
 said a shorter video smaller today 

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:17.669
 but also one i hope it has you like 

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:20.669
 always liked 

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:20.669
 33
