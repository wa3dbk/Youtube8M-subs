that you could learn chords 1 2 3 4 5 6
7<00:00:18.750> 8<00:00:18.990> 9<00:00:19.230> 10<00:00:19.529> 11<00:00:19.680> 12<00:00:19.920> 12<00:00:21.740> roots<00:00:22.740> 12<00:00:23.189> basic<00:00:23.670> notes

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
7 8 9 10 11 12 12 roots 12 basic notes

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.990 
7 8 9 10 11 12 12 roots 12 basic notes
that<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.050> can<00:00:25.260> build<00:00:25.470> chords<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:26.039> okay<00:00:26.400> so

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
that you can build chords on okay so

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.730 
that you can build chords on okay so
there's<00:00:27.180> only<00:00:27.300> 12<00:00:27.720> major<00:00:27.990> chords<00:00:28.170> because

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
there's only 12 major chords because

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.730 
there's only 12 major chords because
when<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.160> get<00:00:29.510> done<00:00:30.510> with<00:00:30.539> those<00:00:30.840> 12<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.529> just

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
when you get done with those 12 you just

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.100 
when you get done with those 12 you just
play<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.920> same<00:00:32.250> chord<00:00:32.640> an<00:00:32.820> octave<00:00:33.149> higher<00:00:33.390> or

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
play the same chord an octave higher or

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.959 
play the same chord an octave higher or
an<00:00:34.320> octave<00:00:34.680> lower<00:00:34.710> okay<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.430> they're<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.940> same

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
an octave lower okay so they're the same

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.930 
an octave lower okay so they're the same
thing<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.440> 12<00:00:37.739> are<00:00:37.890> very<00:00:38.190> easy<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.670> learn

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
thing so the 12 are very easy to learn

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.319 
thing so the 12 are very easy to learn
because<00:00:39.800> scales<00:00:40.800> chords<00:00:41.760> are<00:00:42.000> made<00:00:42.149> out<00:00:42.300> of

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
because scales chords are made out of

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.479 
because scales chords are made out of
scales<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.170> word<00:00:43.290> scale<00:00:43.800> comes<00:00:44.190> from<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
scales the word scale comes from the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.610 
scales the word scale comes from the
Latin<00:00:44.820> word<00:00:44.850> La<00:00:45.210> Scala<00:00:45.629> which<00:00:45.750> means<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.320> ladder

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
Latin word La Scala which means a ladder

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.709 
Latin word La Scala which means a ladder
of<00:00:46.920> notes<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.489> runs<00:00:47.730> from<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.000> root<00:00:48.300> up<00:00:48.510> to

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
of notes that runs from the root up to

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.930 
of notes that runs from the root up to
the<00:00:48.840> octave<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.620> octave<00:00:50.100> oh<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.460> octopus

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
the octave the octave oh the octopus

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.229 
the octave the octave oh the octopus
note<00:00:51.270> okay<00:00:52.289> eighth<00:00:52.680> notes<00:00:53.010> higher<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.670> if<00:00:54.000> I

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
note okay eighth notes higher so if I

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.540 
note okay eighth notes higher so if I
take<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.690> root<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.710> first<00:00:55.980> note<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.520> third

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
take the root the first note the third

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.450 
take the root the first note the third
note<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> fifth<00:00:57.660> note<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.230> scale

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
note and the fifth note of the scale

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.510 
note and the fifth note of the scale
that<00:00:59.460> makes<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.059> major<00:01:00.329> chord<00:01:00.809> for<00:01:01.170> that

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
that makes the major chord for that

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.179 
that makes the major chord for that
particular<00:01:02.520> note<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:03.000> that's<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.359> C<00:01:03.660> chord<00:01:04.470> C

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
particular note so that's a C chord C

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.500 
particular note so that's a C chord C
major<00:01:05.460> chord<00:01:05.670> okay<00:01:06.890> now<00:01:07.890> if<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.369> build<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.939> chord

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
major chord okay now if I build a chord

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.420 
major chord okay now if I build a chord
on<00:01:09.720> any<00:01:09.930> other<00:01:10.140> note<00:01:10.500> then<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.799> have<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.250> know

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
on any other note then I have to know

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.859 
on any other note then I have to know
that<00:01:11.670> scale<00:01:12.180> okay

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
that scale okay

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.690 
that scale okay
so<00:01:13.290> let's<00:01:13.530> learn<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.920> formula<00:01:14.340> for<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.549> major

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
so let's learn the formula for a major

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.550 
so let's learn the formula for a major
scale<00:01:14.939> first<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.509> all<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.930> then<00:01:16.140> once<00:01:16.439> you

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
scale first of all and then once you

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.649 
scale first of all and then once you
learn<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.770> you've<00:01:17.130> got<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.430> me<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.790> formula

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
learn that you've got it me the formula

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.810 
learn that you've got it me the formula
for<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> major<00:01:19.049> scale<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> whole<00:01:20.130> step<00:01:20.520> not<00:01:20.790> a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
for a major scale is a whole step not a

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.120 
for a major scale is a whole step not a
half<00:01:21.090> step<00:01:21.360> but<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.600> whole<00:01:21.840> step<00:01:22.170> then<00:01:22.890> another

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
half step but a whole step then another

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.210 
half step but a whole step then another
whole<00:01:23.400> step<00:01:23.729> then<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.330> half<00:01:24.659> step<00:01:24.860> then<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> whole

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
whole step then a half step then a whole

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.789 
whole step then a half step then a whole
step<00:01:26.580> then<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.119> whole<00:01:27.420> step<00:01:27.750> then<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.170> whole<00:01:28.470> step

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
step then a whole step then a whole step

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.460 
step then a whole step then a whole step
then<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> half<00:01:29.430> step<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:30.450> see<00:01:30.689> that's<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.259> whole

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
then a half step you see that's a whole

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.140 
then a half step you see that's a whole
step<00:01:31.710> because<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.189> got<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.400> black<00:01:32.820> key<00:01:33.119> in

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
step because it's got a black key in

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.120 
step because it's got a black key in
between<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.840> got<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> key<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.320> between<00:01:34.409> that's

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
between it's got a key in between that's

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.950 
between it's got a key in between that's
a<00:01:35.340> half<00:01:35.549> step<00:01:35.579> because<00:01:36.150> there's<00:01:36.299> nothing<00:01:36.509> but

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
a half step because there's nothing but

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.020 
a half step because there's nothing but
dust<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.500> there<00:01:37.680> just<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.220> crack<00:01:38.490> okay

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
dust in there just a crack okay

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.060 
dust in there just a crack okay
hopefully<00:01:39.600> not<00:01:39.930> too<00:01:40.110> much<00:01:40.290> dust<00:01:40.619> or<00:01:40.799> I'll<00:01:40.860> get

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
hopefully not too much dust or I'll get

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.460 
hopefully not too much dust or I'll get
in<00:01:41.130> trouble<00:01:41.250> as<00:01:41.490> my<00:01:41.610> wife<00:01:42.110> that's<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.259> whole

in trouble as my wife that's a whole

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.350 
in trouble as my wife that's a whole
step<00:01:43.770> that's<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.250> whole<00:01:44.460> step<00:01:44.759> that's<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.149> whole

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
step that's a whole step that's a whole

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.569 
step that's a whole step that's a whole
step<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.869> half<00:01:45.899> step<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.530> quickly<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.430> know

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
step and a half step so quickly you know

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.310 
step and a half step so quickly you know
the<00:01:47.610> formula<00:01:48.060> now<00:01:48.390> for<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> major<00:01:48.780> scale<00:01:48.960> don't

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
the formula now for a major scale don't

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.050 
the formula now for a major scale don't
you<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> whole<00:01:49.829> whole<00:01:50.729> half<00:01:51.450> whole<00:01:52.280> whole<00:01:53.280> whole

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
you a whole whole half whole whole whole

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.350 
you a whole whole half whole whole whole
half<00:01:54.780> okay<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.250> if<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.460> start<00:01:56.790> on<00:01:56.909> any<00:01:57.119> other

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
half okay so if I start on any other

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.480 
half okay so if I start on any other
note<00:01:57.659> then<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.170> have<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.799> go<00:01:58.920> up<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.159> whole<00:01:59.340> step

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
note then I have to go up a whole step

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.670 
note then I have to go up a whole step
from<00:02:01.240> that<00:02:01.420> note<00:02:01.659> don't<00:02:01.900> I<00:02:01.960> can't<00:02:02.380> go<00:02:02.470> there

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
from that note don't I can't go there

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.469 
from that note don't I can't go there
because<00:02:02.860> that's<00:02:02.979> a<00:02:03.100> half<00:02:03.250> step<00:02:03.280> so<00:02:03.760> my<00:02:04.240> rule

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
because that's a half step so my rule

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.440 
because that's a half step so my rule
says<00:02:04.720> go<00:02:04.900> up<00:02:04.960> a<00:02:05.049> whole<00:02:05.229> step<00:02:06.090> now<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.119> go<00:02:07.360> up

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
says go up a whole step now I go up

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.499 
says go up a whole step now I go up
another<00:02:07.690> whole<00:02:07.930> step<00:02:08.759> now<00:02:09.759> I<00:02:09.789> go<00:02:10.060> up<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.270> half

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
another whole step now I go up a half

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:18.540 
another whole step now I go up a half
step<00:02:10.890> then<00:02:11.890> a<00:02:11.920> whole<00:02:12.430> full<00:02:13.360> full<00:02:14.260> yeah<00:02:17.550> so

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
step then a whole full full yeah so

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.530 
step then a whole full full yeah so
that's<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.940> major<00:02:19.150> scale<00:02:19.600> starting<00:02:20.110> on<00:02:20.290> B<00:02:21.540> you

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
that's a major scale starting on B you

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.570 
that's a major scale starting on B you
see<00:02:22.750> how<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:22.930> figure<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.440> out<00:02:23.470> by<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.280> rule<00:02:24.550> of

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
see how I figure that out by the rule of

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.130 
see how I figure that out by the rule of
full<00:02:25.000> whole<00:02:25.510> half<00:02:25.840> whole<00:02:26.290> whole<00:02:27.900> may<00:02:28.900> seem

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
full whole half whole whole may seem

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.840 
full whole half whole whole may seem
confusing<00:02:29.350> at<00:02:29.770> first<00:02:29.800> but<00:02:30.100> you<00:02:30.220> catch<00:02:30.430> on<00:02:30.640> real

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
confusing at first but you catch on real

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.650 
confusing at first but you catch on real
quickly<00:02:31.180> okay<00:02:32.020> so<00:02:32.709> if<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.550> that's<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.330> scale

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
quickly okay so if that that's the scale

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.080 
quickly okay so if that that's the scale
of<00:02:34.989> B<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:35.680> it<00:02:35.769> is<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.280> if<00:02:36.370> I<00:02:36.489> take<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.880> root

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
of B and it is and if I take the root

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.000 
of B and it is and if I take the root
third<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.780> fifth<00:02:37.870> of<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.440> major<00:02:38.650> scale

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
third and fifth of the major scale

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.120 
third and fifth of the major scale
that's<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.970> B<00:02:40.150> major<00:02:40.450> chord<00:02:40.870> okay<00:02:41.709> now<00:02:41.890> let's

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
that's the B major chord okay now let's

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.440 
that's the B major chord okay now let's
go<00:02:42.250> down<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.430> learning<00:02:42.760> those<00:02:42.910> courts<00:02:43.239> great
