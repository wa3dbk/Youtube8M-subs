basic<00:00:47.129> types<00:00:48.379> now<00:00:49.379> if<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.219> take<00:00:50.399> Belial<00:00:50.879> which

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
basic types now if you take Belial which

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.750 
basic types now if you take Belial which
is<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.780> leader<00:00:52.289> guy<00:00:52.590> for<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.039> deathwing<00:00:53.489> you

can also take a banner so if you take

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.840 
can also take a banner so if you take
Belial<00:00:59.930> one<00:01:00.949> Deathwing<00:01:01.949> terminator<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
Belial one Deathwing terminator in the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.830 
Belial one Deathwing terminator in the
army<00:01:03.210> can<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.799> company<00:01:05.640> standard<00:01:06.210> and

within 12 inches can reroll a leadership

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.600 
within 12 inches can reroll a leadership
type<00:01:13.200> tests<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.780> also<00:01:15.780> they<00:01:16.140> add<00:01:16.350> one<00:01:17.189> to

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
type tests and also they add one to

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.700 
type tests and also they add one to
their<00:01:17.759> attacks<00:01:18.229> characteristic<00:01:19.229> which<00:01:19.470> is

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
their attacks characteristic which is

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.600 
their attacks characteristic which is
huge<00:01:20.689> especially<00:01:21.689> with<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.650> giant<00:01:22.950> mountain

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
huge especially with this giant mountain

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.679 
huge especially with this giant mountain
of<00:01:24.020> special<00:01:25.020> weapons<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:26.270> forget<00:01:27.270> about<00:01:27.299> how

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
of special weapons so forget about how

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.969 
of special weapons so forget about how
good<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.320> now<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.700> was<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.979> project

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
good that is now this was a project

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.760 
good that is now this was a project
where<00:01:32.430> we<00:01:32.640> were<00:01:32.790> matching<00:01:33.329> here's<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.500> drop

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
where we were matching here's the drop

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.300 
where we were matching here's the drop
pod<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.280> needed<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.729> matched<00:01:36.500> so<00:01:37.500> as<00:01:37.979> you

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
pod that needed to be matched so as you

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.080 
pod that needed to be matched so as you
can<00:01:38.460> see<00:01:38.930> we<00:01:39.930> got<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.380> pretty<00:01:41.070> darn<00:01:41.400> close<00:01:41.820> I

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
can see we got it pretty darn close I

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.330 
can see we got it pretty darn close I
think<00:01:42.299> you'd<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.720> look<00:01:43.130> you'd<00:01:44.130> have<00:01:44.250> to

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
think you'd have to look you'd have to

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.020 
think you'd have to look you'd have to
look<00:01:44.579> pretty<00:01:44.820> closely<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.479> find<00:01:45.750> any<00:01:46.049> sort<00:01:46.380> of

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
look pretty closely to find any sort of

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.929 
look pretty closely to find any sort of
variation<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.860> what<00:01:49.860> we<00:01:50.040> did<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.509> matching<00:01:51.509> is

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
variation on what we did and matching is

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.330 
variation on what we did and matching is
really<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:53.970> specialty<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.630> our<00:01:55.020> studio<00:01:55.470> however

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
really a specialty of our studio however

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.850 
really a specialty of our studio however
we<00:01:56.610> don't<00:01:56.759> match<00:01:57.000> technique<00:01:57.630> we<00:01:58.200> have<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.560> be

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
we don't match technique we have to be

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.730 
we don't match technique we have to be
allowed<00:01:59.219> just<00:01:59.430> kind<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.759> go<00:01:59.939> about<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.740> the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
allowed just kind of go about it in the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.899 
allowed just kind of go about it in the
way<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:01.920> we<00:02:02.450> need<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.479> do<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.909> that's

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
way that we need to do it and that's

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.639 
way that we need to do it and that's
really<00:02:06.119> all<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.750> have<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.140> say<00:02:07.170> about<00:02:07.320> this

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
really all that I have to say about this

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:25.070 
really all that I have to say about this
one<00:02:07.860> hope<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.280> enjoyed
