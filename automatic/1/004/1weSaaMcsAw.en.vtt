00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
last one I did one on the Newell Oriole

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.500 
last one I did one on the Newell Oriole
setting<00:00:08.429> spray<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:08.849> that<00:00:08.940> was<00:00:09.059> so<00:00:09.269> much<00:00:09.450> fun

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
setting spray and that was so much fun

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.709 
setting spray and that was so much fun
so<00:00:10.410> my<00:00:10.710> thoughts<00:00:11.070> are<00:00:11.280> probably<00:00:11.849> not<00:00:12.150> what<00:00:12.570> you

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
so my thoughts are probably not what you

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.330

smooth going on and that could be

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.360

because it's set up a little bit

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.539 
because it's set up a little bit
differently<00:01:10.560> these<00:01:10.799> don't<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> specific

differently these don't have a specific

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.990 
differently these don't have a specific
name<00:01:12.180> but<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.200> color<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.740> 700<00:01:14.670> notice

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.609 
name but this is the color in 700 notice
me<00:01:15.180> nudes<00:01:15.479> but<00:01:15.750> these<00:01:15.900> are<00:01:16.020> supposed<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.409> have

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
me nudes but these are supposed to have

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.530 
me nudes but these are supposed to have
skin<00:01:16.950> conditioners<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.880> make<00:01:18.090> them<00:01:18.270> glide

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
skin conditioners that make them glide

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.630 
skin conditioners that make them glide
on<00:01:18.750> really<00:01:19.049> smoothly<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:20.009> do<00:01:20.070> think<00:01:20.490> they

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
on really smoothly and I do think they

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.060

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
have great pigmentation the only thing

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.070 
have great pigmentation the only thing
is<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.400> they're<00:01:23.549> about<00:01:23.729> $6.99<00:01:24.570> $7.99

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
is that they're about $6.99 $7.99

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.410 
is that they're about $6.99 $7.99

their product is going to apply it but I

just don't like this I don't know if
it's<00:02:06.119> just<00:02:06.240> because<00:02:06.360> I'm<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.750> brush<00:02:07.170> girl<00:02:07.500> or

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
it's just because I'm a brush girl or

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.770 
it's just because I'm a brush girl or
what<00:02:08.069> but<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.670> just<00:02:08.910> find<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.569> really

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
what but I just find that this really

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.900 
what but I just find that this really
just<00:02:09.899> smears<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.619> foundation<00:02:11.400> all<00:02:11.610> over<00:02:11.640> my

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
just smears the foundation all over my

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.330 
just smears the foundation all over my
face<00:02:12.090> in<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.959> demo<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.470> do<00:02:13.530> half<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:14.040> my

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
face in the demo I do half of my

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.729 
face in the demo I do half of my
faced<00:02:14.489> with<00:02:14.519> this<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.989> you<00:02:16.140> can<00:02:16.290> really<00:02:16.440> see

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
faced with this and you can really see

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.280 
faced with this and you can really see
that<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.099> is<00:02:17.220> fairly<00:02:17.700> streaky<00:02:18.420> because<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.170> is

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
that it is fairly streaky because it is

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.440 
that it is fairly streaky because it is
such<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.530> silky<00:02:20.069> foundation<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:20.940> always<00:02:21.269> make

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
such a silky foundation so I always make

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.059 
such a silky foundation so I always make

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
sure to go in with a brush just to

is pretty good I was expecting not to

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.199 
is pretty good I was expecting not to
love<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.739> because<00:02:31.860> whenever<00:02:32.250> there's<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.730> silky

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209

love it because whenever there's a silky
foundation<00:02:33.840> even<00:02:34.200> though<00:02:34.319> I<00:02:34.349> do<00:02:34.500> have<00:02:34.830> dry

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
foundation even though I do have dry

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.880 
foundation even though I do have dry
skin<00:02:35.519> I<00:02:35.730> typically<00:02:36.420> like<00:02:36.840> ones<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.379> set<00:02:37.709> on

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
staying power but with this one I was

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.460 
staying power but with this one I was
really<00:02:41.790> pleased<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.420> see<00:02:42.629> that<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:43.200> didn't

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
really pleased to see that it didn't

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.890 
really pleased to see that it didn't
settle<00:02:43.709> into<00:02:44.010> my<00:02:44.129> fine<00:02:44.430> lines<00:02:44.760> at<00:02:45.060> all<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.750> it

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
settle into my fine lines at all and it

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.539 
settle into my fine lines at all and it
also<00:02:46.080> had<00:02:46.440> pretty<00:02:46.860> good<00:02:46.950> staying<00:02:47.310> power

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
also had pretty good staying power

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.759 
also had pretty good staying power
considering<00:02:48.329> the<00:02:48.450> consistency<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.319> was<00:02:49.500> also

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
considering the consistency I was also

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.530 
considering the consistency I was also
happy<00:02:49.920> with<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.310> coverage<00:02:50.730> I'm<00:02:51.000> somebody<00:02:51.390> who

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
happy with the coverage I'm somebody who

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.270 
happy with the coverage I'm somebody who
likes<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.840> little<00:02:51.930> bit<00:02:52.079> more<00:02:52.500> coverage<00:02:52.799> on<00:02:53.160> an

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
likes a little bit more coverage on an

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.610 
likes a little bit more coverage on an
everyday<00:02:53.549> basis<00:02:54.150> but<00:02:54.390> for<00:02:54.810> this<00:02:54.900> being<00:02:55.140> medium

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
everyday basis but for this being medium

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.990 
everyday basis but for this being medium
coverage<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.130> thought<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.549> did<00:02:56.700> really

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
coverage I thought that it did really

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.729 
coverage I thought that it did really
really<00:02:57.120> well<00:02:57.390> it<00:02:57.840> did<00:02:58.079> cancel<00:02:58.530> out<00:02:58.620> the

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
really well it did cancel out the

companies try to do something new but
this<00:04:45.720> one<00:04:46.020> just<00:04:46.440> makes<00:04:46.790> absolutely<00:04:47.790> no<00:04:48.210> sense

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450

to<00:04:48.990> me<00:04:49.020> first<00:04:49.500> of<00:04:49.680> all<00:04:49.800> I<00:04:49.830> don't<00:04:50.070> like<00:04:50.340> that

it's<00:04:50.790> brow<00:04:51.060> and<00:04:51.420> liner<00:04:51.660> because<00:04:51.990> I<00:04:52.500> got<00:04:52.890> a<00:04:53.100> dark

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
it's brow and liner because I got a dark

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.210 
it's brow and liner because I got a dark
shade<00:04:53.990> because<00:04:54.990> I<00:04:55.020> didn't<00:04:55.560> think<00:04:55.590> you<00:04:55.830> know<00:04:56.070> if

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
shade because I didn't think you know if

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.950 
shade because I didn't think you know if
I<00:04:56.310> got<00:04:56.490> a<00:04:56.520> light<00:04:56.820> brown<00:04:57.150> how<00:04:57.450> the<00:04:57.510> heck<00:04:57.720> am<00:04:57.870> I

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
I got a light brown how the heck am I

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.780 
I got a light brown how the heck am I
gonna<00:04:58.140> use<00:04:58.350> that<00:04:58.560> as<00:04:58.710> an<00:04:58.890> eyeliner<00:04:59.250> so<00:04:59.520> I<00:04:59.580> went

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
gonna use that as an eyeliner so I went

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.130 
gonna use that as an eyeliner so I went
ahead<00:04:59.850> and<00:04:59.970> got<00:05:00.150> deep<00:05:00.420> brown<00:05:00.630> and<00:05:00.900> I<00:05:00.930> thought

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
ahead and got deep brown and I thought

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.810 
ahead and got deep brown and I thought
it<00:05:01.290> would<00:05:01.410> be<00:05:01.530> OK<00:05:01.830> for<00:05:01.890> my<00:05:02.160> brows<00:05:02.400> but<00:05:02.700> it

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
it would be OK for my brows but it

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.550 
it would be OK for my brows but it
actually<00:05:03.360> is<00:05:03.480> a<00:05:03.510> little<00:05:03.810> bit<00:05:03.960> darker<00:05:04.530> than

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
actually is a little bit darker than

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.690 
actually is a little bit darker than
even<00:05:04.980> I<00:05:05.130> prefer<00:05:05.610> but<00:05:06.390> I<00:05:06.660> think<00:05:07.080> the<00:05:07.320> whole

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
even I prefer but I think the whole

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.960 
even I prefer but I think the whole
downfall<00:05:08.700> of<00:05:08.970> this<00:05:09.150> comes<00:05:09.600> in<00:05:09.990> the<00:05:10.620> powder

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
downfall of this comes in the powder

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.300 
downfall of this comes in the powder
formula<00:05:11.970> this<00:05:12.390> stuff<00:05:12.900> gets<00:05:13.350> everywhere<00:05:14.130> and

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
formula this stuff gets everywhere and

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.770 
formula this stuff gets everywhere and
I'm<00:05:14.370> sure<00:05:14.550> in<00:05:14.700> the<00:05:14.730> demo<00:05:15.120> you<00:05:15.180> can<00:05:15.330> tell<00:05:15.630> it's

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
and this is definitely not going to do

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.680 
and this is definitely not going to do
it<00:06:11.070> for<00:06:11.250> you<00:06:11.370> as<00:06:11.580> far<00:06:11.880> as<00:06:11.970> wearing<00:06:12.240> it<00:06:12.360> in<00:06:12.479> my

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
it for you as far as wearing it in my

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.719 
it for you as far as wearing it in my
brows<00:06:12.930> I<00:06:13.229> liked<00:06:13.530> it<00:06:13.680> a<00:06:13.770> little<00:06:14.040> bit<00:06:14.340> better

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:14.729 
brows I liked it a little bit better

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:16.430 
brows I liked it a little bit better
like<00:06:15.120> I<00:06:15.300> said<00:06:15.510> it<00:06:15.600> was<00:06:15.690> a<00:06:15.720> little<00:06:16.050> bit<00:06:16.200> darker

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
like I said it was a little bit darker

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.070 
like I said it was a little bit darker
but<00:06:16.800> the<00:06:17.190> actual<00:06:17.490> powder<00:06:17.850> does<00:06:18.270> cling<00:06:18.690> to<00:06:18.870> your

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
but the actual powder does cling to your

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.230 
but the actual powder does cling to your
brow<00:06:19.320> hairs<00:06:19.710> really<00:06:19.890> nicely<00:06:20.280> and<00:06:20.669> it<00:06:21.000> combs

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
brow hairs really nicely and it combs

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.150 
brow hairs really nicely and it combs
through<00:06:21.540> them<00:06:21.810> really<00:06:22.110> well<00:06:22.440> it<00:06:22.650> leaves<00:06:22.919> them

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160 
through them really well it leaves them

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.159 
through them really well it leaves them
almost<00:06:23.400> feeling<00:06:23.820> a<00:06:24.060> little<00:06:24.390> bit<00:06:24.540> gritty<00:06:24.840> and<00:06:25.140> I

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 
almost feeling a little bit gritty and I

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.050 
almost feeling a little bit gritty and I
don't<00:06:25.229> mean<00:06:25.560> that<00:06:25.590> in<00:06:25.830> a<00:06:25.890> bad<00:06:25.919> way<00:06:26.370> because<00:06:26.790> it

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
don't mean that in a bad way because it

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.180 
don't mean that in a bad way because it
really<00:06:27.270> keeps<00:06:27.450> the<00:06:27.660> brow<00:06:27.870> hairs<00:06:28.200> in<00:06:28.410> place<00:06:28.440> I

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 
really keeps the brow hairs in place I

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.430 
really keeps the brow hairs in place I
just<00:06:29.430> don't<00:06:30.030> think<00:06:30.390> that<00:06:30.450> this<00:06:30.690> is<00:06:30.870> a<00:06:30.960> super

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
just don't think that this is a super

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.560 
just don't think that this is a super
precise<00:06:32.310> product<00:06:32.940> like<00:06:33.090> if<00:06:33.210> you're<00:06:33.330> one<00:06:33.479> of

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:33.570 
precise product like if you're one of

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.240 
precise product like if you're one of
those<00:06:33.630> people<00:06:33.870> who<00:06:34.140> really<00:06:34.169> like<00:06:34.979> to<00:06:35.099> have

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
those people who really like to have

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.339 
those people who really like to have
precise<00:06:35.729> brows<00:06:36.150> this<00:06:36.419> is<00:06:36.570> not<00:06:36.750> going<00:06:36.990> to<00:06:37.110> do<00:06:37.229> it

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:37.349 
precise brows this is not going to do it

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:38.330 
precise brows this is not going to do it
for<00:06:37.560> you<00:06:37.680> but

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
for you but

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.220 
for you but
fill<00:06:38.460> in<00:06:38.639> those<00:06:38.820> spire<00:06:39.180> spaces<00:06:39.720> here<00:06:40.050> and

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:40.230 
fill in those spire spaces here and

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.290 
fill in those spire spaces here and
there<00:06:40.410> it<00:06:40.590> was<00:06:40.740> okay<00:06:41.220> but<00:06:41.699> just<00:06:41.880> keep<00:06:42.090> in<00:06:42.270> mind

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
there it was okay but just keep in mind

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.840 
there it was okay but just keep in mind
the<00:06:42.720> powder<00:06:42.960> is<00:06:43.380> still<00:06:43.680> probably<00:06:44.340> going<00:06:44.760> to

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:44.850 
the powder is still probably going to

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.820 
the powder is still probably going to
get<00:06:44.970> in<00:06:45.180> places<00:06:45.630> that<00:06:45.660> you<00:06:45.900> don't<00:06:46.139> want<00:06:46.470> it<00:06:46.620> so

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
get in places that you don't want it so

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.350 
get in places that you don't want it so
that's<00:06:47.010> the<00:06:47.190> only<00:06:47.430> complaint<00:06:47.850> I<00:06:47.940> have<00:06:48.150> with

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
that's the only complaint I have with

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.930 
that's the only complaint I have with
this<00:06:48.570> as<00:06:48.810> far<00:06:49.290> as<00:06:49.380> my<00:06:49.590> brows<00:06:49.949> go<00:06:50.370> because<00:06:50.910> I

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:50.940 
this as far as my brows go because I

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.060 
this as far as my brows go because I
really<00:06:51.449> thought<00:06:51.750> that<00:06:51.810> it<00:06:52.199> worked<00:06:52.440> well<00:06:52.740> there

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.070 
really thought that it worked well there

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.490 
really thought that it worked well there
it<00:06:53.310> was<00:06:53.760> just<00:06:53.790> still<00:06:54.180> a<00:06:54.419> little<00:06:54.630> bit<00:06:54.870> messy<00:06:55.199> so

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 
it was just still a little bit messy so

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.770 
it was just still a little bit messy so
I<00:06:55.949> feel<00:06:56.190> like<00:06:56.400> I've<00:06:56.550> been<00:06:56.760> talking<00:06:56.970> as<00:06:57.330> so<00:06:57.540> much
