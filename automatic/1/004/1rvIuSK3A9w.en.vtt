hey<00:00:04.529> this<00:00:04.710> is<00:00:04.830> Jodi<00:00:05.069> from<00:00:05.310> food<00:00:05.550> storage<00:00:05.790> Made

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
hey this is Jodi from food storage Made

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.360 
hey this is Jodi from food storage Made
Easy<00:00:06.359> net<00:00:06.779> and<00:00:07.020> today<00:00:07.800> I<00:00:07.830> wanted<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.189> go<00:00:08.340> over

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
Easy net and today I wanted to go over

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.160 
Easy net and today I wanted to go over
some<00:00:08.640> of<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.059> common<00:00:09.540> questions<00:00:09.660> we<00:00:09.990> get

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
some of the common questions we get

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.540 
some of the common questions we get
about<00:00:10.230> pressure<00:00:10.710> cookers<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:11.280> pressure

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
about pressure cookers and pressure

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.790 
about pressure cookers and pressure
Kanner's<00:00:12.180> so<00:00:12.660> first<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.320> all<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.470> pressure

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:13.800 
Kanner's so first of all a pressure

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.240 
Kanner's so first of all a pressure
cooker<00:00:14.690> does<00:00:15.690> not<00:00:15.870> process<00:00:16.470> food<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.130> way

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
cooker does not process food the way

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.160 
cooker does not process food the way
that<00:00:17.519> canning<00:00:17.970> does<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.269> just<00:00:18.449> cooks<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.840> in<00:00:19.050> a

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
that canning does it just cooks it in a

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.650 
that canning does it just cooks it in a
faster<00:00:19.860> way<00:00:19.890> than<00:00:20.250> normal<00:00:20.280> methods<00:00:20.970> I'm<00:00:21.150> using

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
faster way than normal methods I'm using

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.660 
faster way than normal methods I'm using
steam<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.500> there's<00:00:22.710> two<00:00:22.980> different<00:00:23.130> kinds<00:00:23.550> of

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
steam and there's two different kinds of

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.390 
steam and there's two different kinds of
pressure<00:00:23.850> cookers<00:00:24.270> one<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.840> normal

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
pressure cookers one is a normal

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.870 
pressure cookers one is a normal
stovetop<00:00:26.400> cooker<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:28.130> so<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.220> have<00:00:29.520> to<00:00:29.640> set

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
stovetop cooker and so you have to set

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.089 
stovetop cooker and so you have to set
with<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.270> pressure<00:00:30.810> gauge<00:00:31.140> it'll<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:32.009> know

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
with the pressure gauge it'll you know

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.069 
with the pressure gauge it'll you know
as<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.340> heat<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.609> up<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.090> stove<00:00:33.300> then<00:00:33.899> it

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
as you heat it up on the stove then it

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.569 
as you heat it up on the stove then it
builds<00:00:34.260> pressure<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.920> that's<00:00:35.010> how<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.340> looks

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
builds pressure and that's how it looks

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.969 
builds pressure and that's how it looks
the<00:00:36.120> other<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.510> an<00:00:36.690> electric<00:00:37.229> pressure<00:00:37.469> cooker

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:37.979 
the other is an electric pressure cooker

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:41.540 
the other is an electric pressure cooker
and<00:00:39.109> this<00:00:40.109> one<00:00:40.319> you<00:00:40.859> just<00:00:41.039> said<00:00:41.219> it's<00:00:41.399> either

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
and this one you just said it's either

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.250 
and this one you just said it's either
high<00:00:41.819> pressure<00:00:42.120> or<00:00:42.329> low<00:00:42.510> pressure<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.109> then

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
high pressure or low pressure and then

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.079 
high pressure or low pressure and then
it<00:00:43.289> automatically<00:00:44.280> puts<00:00:44.639> it<00:00:44.729> to<00:00:44.819> the<00:00:44.940> right

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:45.089 
it automatically puts it to the right

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:45.680 
it automatically puts it to the right
pressure

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
pressure

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.680 
pressure
geppu<00:00:46.350> times<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.190> turns<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.579> off<00:00:47.699> so<00:00:48.569> this

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
geppu times it and turns it off so this

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.169 
geppu times it and turns it off so this
is<00:00:48.870> really<00:00:49.049> simple<00:00:49.440> if<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:50.159> can't<00:00:50.460> stay<00:00:50.819> right

00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:51.179 
is really simple if you can't stay right

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:52.819 
is really simple if you can't stay right
by<00:00:51.359> in<00:00:51.690> your<00:00:51.719> kitchen<00:00:52.019> the<00:00:52.260> whole<00:00:52.409> time<00:00:52.589> it'll

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
by in your kitchen the whole time it'll

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.289 
by in your kitchen the whole time it'll
beep<00:00:53.069> when<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.460> ready<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.819> then<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.089> can

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:54.299 
beep when it's ready and then you can

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:56.539 
beep when it's ready and then you can
release<00:00:54.479> the<00:00:54.719> pressure<00:00:55.190> this<00:00:56.190> one<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.519> really

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:56.549 
release the pressure this one you really

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:58.160 
release the pressure this one you really
need<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.030> be<00:00:57.179> in<00:00:57.359> the<00:00:57.449> kitchen<00:00:57.629> because<00:00:57.929> if<00:00:58.049> it

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
need to be in the kitchen because if it

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.889 
need to be in the kitchen because if it
builds<00:00:58.350> pressure<00:00:58.949> too<00:00:59.280> high<00:00:59.510> or<00:01:00.510> if<00:01:00.629> it's<00:01:00.719> not

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
builds pressure too high or if it's not

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.660 
builds pressure too high or if it's not
high<00:01:01.079> enough<00:01:01.109> then<00:01:01.559> your<00:01:01.679> food<00:01:01.829> won't<00:01:02.010> process

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
high enough then your food won't process

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.380 
high enough then your food won't process
properly<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.830> pressure<00:01:04.830> cooker<00:01:05.159> can<00:01:05.909> come<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.360> a

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
properly a pressure cooker can come in a

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.930 
properly a pressure cooker can come in a
smaller<00:01:06.690> size<00:01:06.840> than<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.980> 16<00:01:08.430> quarts

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
smaller size than this this is 16 quarts

smaller size than this this is 16 quarts
it<00:01:09.810> comes<00:01:10.050> down<00:01:10.260> like<00:01:10.290> 6<00:01:10.980> quarts<00:01:11.310> 8<00:01:11.460> quarts

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
it comes down like 6 quarts 8 quarts

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.610 
it comes down like 6 quarts 8 quarts
those<00:01:11.970> kind<00:01:12.240> for<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.660> stovetop<00:01:12.960> ones<00:01:13.410> this<00:01:13.560> is

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
those kind for the stovetop ones this is

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.280 
those kind for the stovetop ones this is
a<00:01:13.740> 6<00:01:14.070> quart<00:01:14.400> electric<00:01:15.060> pressure<00:01:15.510> cooker<00:01:15.990> this

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
is Cuisinart brand that's what I use in

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.390 
is Cuisinart brand that's what I use in
like<00:01:18.900> for<00:01:19.170> cooking<00:01:19.500> cooking<00:01:20.190> pressure

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
like for cooking cooking pressure

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.280 
like for cooking cooking pressure
cooking<00:01:20.820> my<00:01:21.120> foods<00:01:21.420> unless<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.110> something

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
cooking my foods unless it's something

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.800 
cooking my foods unless it's something
really<00:01:22.740> big<00:01:22.920> now<00:01:23.430> pressure<00:01:23.760> canner<00:01:24.210> these<00:01:24.690> are

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
really big now pressure canner these are

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.600 
really big now pressure canner these are
both<00:01:25.020> pressure<00:01:25.320> canners<00:01:25.890> they're<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.160> presto

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
both pressure canners they're a presto

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.110 
both pressure canners they're a presto
gram<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.690> 116<00:01:28.350> quart<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.010> 23<00:01:29.550> quart<00:01:29.850> the

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
gram this 116 quart this is 23 quart the

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.140 
gram this 116 quart this is 23 quart the
difference<00:01:30.930> between<00:01:31.350> them<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.950> they<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:33.000> both

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
difference between them is they can both

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.070 
difference between them is they can both
do<00:01:33.360> 7<00:01:33.900> quart<00:01:34.230> jars<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.250> can<00:01:35.490> do<00:01:35.780> 20<00:01:36.780> types

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
do 7 quart jars but this can do 20 types

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.980 
do 7 quart jars but this can do 20 types
so<00:01:37.440> it<00:01:37.500> does<00:01:37.680> two<00:01:38.010> layers<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.970> pipes<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.780> one

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
so it does two layers of pipes this one

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.830 
so it does two layers of pipes this one
can<00:01:40.170> only<00:01:40.320> do<00:01:40.530> 10<00:01:40.860> Heights<00:01:41.160> and<00:01:42.030> also<00:01:42.540> they<00:01:42.660> can

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
can only do 10 Heights and also they can

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.660 
can only do 10 Heights and also they can
both<00:01:42.990> be<00:01:43.020> used<00:01:43.200> as<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> water<00:01:43.770> bath<00:01:44.040> canner<00:01:44.340> too

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
both be used as a water bath canner too

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.060 
both be used as a water bath canner too
so<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.330> don't<00:01:45.480> have<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.750> store<00:01:46.050> too<00:01:46.680> big

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
so that you don't have to store too big

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.200 
so that you don't have to store too big
huge<00:01:47.690> banners<00:01:48.690> now<00:01:49.409> these<00:01:50.040> both<00:01:50.370> can<00:01:50.610> also<00:01:50.880> be

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
huge banners now these both can also be

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.840 
huge banners now these both can also be
used<00:01:51.330> as<00:01:51.510> pressure<00:01:51.750> cooker<00:01:52.260> so

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
used as pressure cooker so

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.399 
used as pressure cooker so
if<00:01:53.000> you<00:01:53.210> want<00:01:53.420> to<00:01:53.510> pressure-cook<00:01:53.840> something

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
if you want to pressure-cook something

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.260 
if you want to pressure-cook something
large<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:55.130> know<00:01:55.159> larger<00:01:55.580> than<00:01:55.729> three<00:01:55.940> or<00:01:56.060> four

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
pounds of meat then this is going to be

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.930

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
but I know that these ones specifically

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.670 
but I know that these ones specifically
say<00:02:28.580> it's<00:02:28.850> okay<00:02:29.209> and<00:02:29.480> I<00:02:29.930> have<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.200> glass<00:02:30.440> top

say it's okay and I have a glass top
stove<00:02:30.950> that<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.250> use<00:02:31.550> it<00:02:31.700> on<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:31.970> just<00:02:32.209> make<00:02:32.420> sure

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
stove that I use it on to just make sure

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.350 
stove that I use it on to just make sure
that<00:02:32.800> you're<00:02:33.800> very<00:02:33.950> careful<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:34.489> don't<00:02:34.580> drop

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
that you're very careful and don't drop

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.210 
that you're very careful and don't drop
it<00:02:35.420> full<00:02:35.810> of<00:02:35.840> food<00:02:36.170> it's<00:02:36.410> very<00:02:36.620> heavy<00:02:36.950> you

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
it full of food it's very heavy you

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.410 
it full of food it's very heavy you
don't<00:02:37.370> want<00:02:37.489> to<00:02:37.550> drop<00:02:37.700> that<00:02:37.910> on<00:02:37.970> your<00:02:38.239> glass

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
don't want to drop that on your glass

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.199 
don't want to drop that on your glass
top<00:02:38.600> stove<00:02:38.900> so<00:02:39.440> these<00:02:39.920> are<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.220> two<00:02:40.459> presto

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
top stove so these are the two presto

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.370 
top stove so these are the two presto
kinds<00:02:41.690> that<00:02:41.840> we<00:02:41.920> recommend<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:45.110> I<00:02:45.200> think

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
kinds that we recommend and I think

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.080 
kinds that we recommend and I think
presto<00:02:45.860> also<00:02:46.130> makes<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.459> smaller<00:02:46.730> pressure

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
presto also makes a smaller pressure

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.900 
presto also makes a smaller pressure
