00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.100
 batman arkham night is the last installment 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.320
 of this series developed by 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.519
 rocksteady games that brought the 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.019
 superheroes to the scene of the 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.300
 video games because as in the 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.000
 movies video games about 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.699
 superiors were considered as a 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.069
 little game that the truth was not going 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.359
 to be greater thing to entertain the 

00:00:20.069 --> 00:00:24.390
 just like in the world of movies 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.300
 this has changed and truly batman 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.449
 it has become a triple 'a' title and this 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.610
 it is an important delivery because in 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.980
 theory is the last installment of the series 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.830
 of the ark and they had to finish it 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.190
 most relevant way possible let's talk a 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.960
 little but just a little bit of history and 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.320
 everything starts when the scarecrow 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.910
 makes a gothic city ​​threat that 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.010
 has a chemical weapon that thinks 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.410
 detonate or that could end the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.329
 city ​​and therefore the commissioner 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.570
 gordon helps the evacuation of all the 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.420
 city now I do not want to go deeper into 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.989
 the part of the story because 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.320
 really the things that happen are 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:09.590
 eyepieces are literally surprising 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.450
 I was playing this and when that happened 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.330
 thing I just kept my mouth 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.190
 open honor so go I'm not going to 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.440
 ruin the story you discover 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.970
 and it's really so good that every time 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.390
 they will want to know more every time they go to 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.369
 want to guess that is a great element 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.899
 of this game now let's talk about the 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.880
 other elements that are also very 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.340
 good for example in the part of the 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.440
 graphics as you can see we are already 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.450
 in the new generation this is not what 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.729
 we could see in the past consoles not 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.330
 with this detail not with this lighting 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.979
 with this fluency of animation the truth 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.679
 is that the games that have lately 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.240
 taken out warner brothers game meet with 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.789
 the expectations of what one sees in the 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.590
 trailer here for example we see the part 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.840
 of exploration where you can plan to 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.880
 through city goti-k use your 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.340
 hook to get to more surfaces 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.649
 high the strategic surfaces that 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.209
 we will see below for example here 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.460
 begins the part of the fight that is 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:05.090
 wonderful in combat you feel more 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.490
 true 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.379
 batman you can end up with a lot 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.540
 of thugs with a few hits 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:15.040
 batman has all that repertoire of 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.040
 counterattack combos 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.819
 combats and credible do not stop feeling 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.160
 your superheroes and then you have these 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.530
 finishers and tires where we see how 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.680
 breaks some ribs of the enemies 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.500
 now remember that Batman has no more 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.549
 power is that his cunning and his strength 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.290
 physical 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.989
 however talking about the cunning there 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.790
 these furtive modalities where we see 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.950
 this through his sight of detective 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.620
 where but when there are armed enemies 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.450
 that can kill very easily then 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.760
 you have to take advantage of that hiding place 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.230
 to appear suddenly and finish with 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.510
 them one by one before they can 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.060
 shoot these start events 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.319
 spectacular are that kind of thing 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.180
 that you want someone to be in the 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.120
 fourth for me to see it with you because of 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.709
 they really look amazing now for 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.390
 give the game more variety as 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.209
 you have these little elements of rpg 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.870
 every time you finish a fight or a 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:11.000
 mission you receive these wayne credits that 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.700
 they help you to improve can be your desire 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.830
 can be your armor can be your 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.800
 combos and you have a great variety of 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.120
 options to improve then this you 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.780
 is always keeping the gameplay 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.610
 fresh getting new things or you 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.130
 same trying to get these points 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.050
 to improve the last part I want 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.110
 to mention that it is also spectacular is 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:36.170
 the detective mode where recreates certain 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.640
 crime scenes do not examine clues and 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.290
 for example this sequence that we are 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.620
 watching is very much like a pc game 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.950
 that came called in the disappearance of 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.720
 ethan cárter where it was also about 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.459
 reconstruct the basic facts and the 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.680
 time to rebuild the batman in voice 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.920
 high is repeating as your thoughts 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.320
 of maybe I should approach such a track 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.720
 that was left in such part of the stage what 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.940
 which makes you feel like batman well what 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.510
 is the best detective in the way 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:08.330
 finally I want to talk about the only mistake 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.320
 the only complaint I have about this game 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:14.690
 what are the batmobile missions um is 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.850
 incredible that something so father too 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.290
 designed with the mobile that has this 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.230
 so spectacular entrance 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:24.560
 become so monotonous so repetitive 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.600
 and so annoying the batmobile becomes 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.180
 part of your life since you take it 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.730
 for example that I'm trying to move 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.040
 a crane and put a ramp because 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.900
 some reason batman believes that it is a 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.090
 wonderful idea to put a car 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.550
 full of 600 million dollars 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.320
 a factory or use your car to 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.410
 break a simple pipe that he could 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.580
 break as the explanations that you 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.300
 give why are you using the batmobile 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:52.070
 They are very vague or very silly and it's like 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.640
 because I have to use the batmobile 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.370
 bacman 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.930
 I'm not the Batmobile, it's a shame because 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.610
 the combat parts are very good 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.040
 but I repeat them every five minutes 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.660
 There comes a time when you get fed up and not 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.870
 make me start with these stupid 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.940
 riddle races because they do not have 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.220
 no sense and it 's ten minutes more than 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.560
 use the batmobile the high of the highs 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.500
 when you use the bot and mobile to 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:19.040
 current spending is serious is serious 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.720
 is a vehicle roadside assistance is a 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.610
 great pity because everyone else 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.949
 Batman elements 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.259
 and they make it a great game a game that you do not 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:29.000
 you can lose is more could be the bad 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:32.360
 combat can be the graphics do not you 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.919
 they matter but the story is amazing and 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.259
 you have all these elements together 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:38.090
 ruined by the insistence of the 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:40.639
 developer to put these missions of 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.259
 real mobile phone in my case 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:44.810
 they seemed so frustrating so 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:47.659
 repetitive I wanted to leave control 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.520
 but with the story it was the story and 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:52.039
 the development of the characters what 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.590
 it made me move on then good 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:56.629
 it's a good game it's a game that looks 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.389
 very well that is played very well but that 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:02.820
 is plagued with these missions 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:04.800
 downright unexplainable but go 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.889
 let's give the opportunity to batman 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.660
 because he really deserves it and only 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:12.300
 for those little details of the batmobile 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:16.790
 What I still hate is what we're going to 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.790
 give a rating of 18
