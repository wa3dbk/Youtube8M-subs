00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:05.419
 I'll show you Heitkamp's very simple heritage very sophisticated cable pattern 

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:07.700
 looks the same on both sides 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.170
 who might have thrown it at our Cortez who got me on this 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.869
 Pattern brought 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:17.659
 I beat in the net shows Alberto krieg poor 2 Harand stitches 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.330
 in the case when there are 16 stitches No 2 edge stitches 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.569
 the hand marschner you always me stretch 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:31.509
 it just had to be a simple right-left pattern 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.489
 Butte, however, both the right and left stitches in and 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.650
 crossed out to be stretched 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.290
 either a band Mash he stretched a stitch right crossed right 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.250
 a stitch that blurs on the left 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.460
 while propping him in the back rides the march disposed of to the right 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.340
 entangled from the back a sting and left crossed from the back 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.820
 sting 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.640
 and that repeats itself already the whole thing had always been no scam 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.480
 on the right, no machines crossed over left 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.750
 and that too on the backsides it also in the resignations 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.470
 the stitches 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.100
 Entangled from stretch the rights Marscheck beating Commercial 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:22.030
 I use a very wonderful which microfiber Conti Romika Plus of 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.410

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.190
 Thielert banderole with needles five to five and a half knitted I will use 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.070
 I ethicist types namely Nadu number 6 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.400
 Which of Stacey LZ drops the braid the kids often emerge to get stuck 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.300
 and to strongly advocate them 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.740
 when it was crucial that we were not and cuddly 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.560
 and therefore for whom Dirk Dekker stated in Artern as 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.700
 In this simple life, life looks a little bit 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.329
 Rustemi to finally trampled Triple r tilts 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.329
 Streak Stone and ten rows 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.200
 As it turns out Lanxess is here again is her room in Munich 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.039
 whose journeys Tamar Schengen engraved always stab in Lindenthal approaches 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:17.500
 both at the right 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.500
 Marschner as well as the left stitches 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:23.049
 after ten races 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.909
 Streak Stuhr a care it is already here this clear 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.069
 dictate 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.719
 a hand machine 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:35.099
 the next four marschner kept Smart Licher Pils too short labels Art 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.069
 and I use for it 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.829
 at Sat 1 2 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:39.679
 3 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:42.879
 four stitches on the deepest eagles 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.919
 four machines patterns were as strict as before 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:49.919
 on the right, crossed left 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:54.139
 on the right, crossed left 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.690
 and then the stitches are knitted on the Hills needle 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.690
 that is, I have them behind therapy a little pinned so let with 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.690
 Do not run stitches 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:15.639
 and those are exactly said to knit a stitch right crossed one 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.719
 Mesh service crossed 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:21.349
 a stitch on the right crossed a stitch left crossed 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.420
 and now there are little meshes of the ten shots it will be the same weather there 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:28.419
 Victim 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:33.739
 that means to the service goblet the next four stitches again on the 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.739
 Helix nature 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.099
 behind therapeutic Dexia stuck 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:44.999
 with Strike Team next four machines 

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:57.659
 Attention now back namely the guessing you treasures the very last stitch 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.349
 I also plug in the auxiliary charge to integrated after the braid stitches 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.349
 stretched 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:08.149
 and strict aids 

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:12.349
 as I just as again in the pattern a stitch crossed right though 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.349
 limited 

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:19.499
 a right flank struggles 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.109
 a legal understanding 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:29.009
 some left-crossed 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:30.779
 and the Rangnick team 

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:33.020
 although the sea is 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.409
 The EC Dekker invitations are already important here 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:41.099
 Pellets otherwise the plucked mesh drawstrings strictly knit but learn too tightly 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:43.969
 become 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:46.979
 and then scented queuing 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.239
 in Bingen team had to be in folded cuffs 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.460
 I showed that Zoepffel also has a tan man-chef four stitches on the Main 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.460
 deepest suspected 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:05.979
 however, I do not fit well now 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.779
 on the remedies as strikes the next four stitches 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:12.779
 the sample 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:17.729
 and sheer enthusiasm 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.210
 I have now lost the mesh of militias 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.479
 This goal, it is not a big problem club Malia the mesh 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.870
 sit loosely on the atom 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.419
 II contract a smaller one 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.770
 Nadia would have size and the stitches would sit tight 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.759
 not me maybe 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:39.439
 more snow made a lot of stitches 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:42.439
 Zeid draws again he captured the four stitches 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:48.959
 and knit it again after the pattern Attention 4 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.610
 turns off knitting 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.430
 so entangled disputed 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.879
 one a nothing 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:59.599
 some left 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:02.689
 a just 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:05.689
 latched 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:11.810
 and right back some little stitches of the intermediate real 

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:12.900
 next 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.809
 four marshes offer the Helix nature 

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:17.689
 and 8 o'clock 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:21.959
 not before work to the always deepest so I have to go behind 

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:24.309
 So Terol places are not 

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:27.309
 before emigrating behind it 

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:31.469
 again four marshes pattern 

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:39.559
 now I'm a bit more careful with the arrests 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:45.190
 and the honor and marches I love you Snort and the sea route after that 

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:48.189
 Zoff stitches stretched 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:52.849
 well the meshes of the auxiliary charge are denied 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.520
 and the Randener did not seem to forget 

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:14.389
 so that's it's really a very simple had to start after that 

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:15.449
 Race in the p &amp; h 

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:16.399
 a pattern 

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:20.619
 and in the way and which you get for example a very nice one 

00:07:20.619 --> 00:07:22.009
 beautiful bowls 

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:25.009
 which looks the same on both sides 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.090
 then I thought it was time there is still a step up you could do that 

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.949
 also as a patent strictly and the whole to two more factory 

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:39.869
 and I will show you in another video 

00:07:39.869 --> 00:07:40.749
 have fun with it
