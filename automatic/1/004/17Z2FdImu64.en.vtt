00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
5:35 a.m. and then three minutes later

5:35 a.m. and then three minutes later
Michaela<00:02:37.970> was<00:02:38.180> born<00:02:38.540> at<00:02:38.810> 5:38<00:02:39.880> so<00:02:40.880> this<00:02:41.300> one

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
Michaela was born at 5:38 so this one

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.600 
Michaela was born at 5:38 so this one
right<00:02:41.690> here<00:02:41.959> is<00:02:42.200> older<00:02:42.650> just<00:02:43.010> by<00:02:43.130> three

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
right here is older just by three

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.150 
right here is older just by three
minutes<00:02:44.030> which<00:02:44.510> is<00:02:44.690> cool<00:02:44.900> so<00:02:45.170> my<00:02:45.740> sister

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
minutes which is cool so my sister

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.830 
minutes which is cool so my sister
Valerie<00:02:46.520> she's<00:02:46.850> older<00:02:47.150> than<00:02:47.300> me<00:02:47.450> by<00:02:47.600> five
