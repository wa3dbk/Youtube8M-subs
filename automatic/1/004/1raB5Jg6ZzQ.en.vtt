weather the sun's it down so I think I'm

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.810 
weather the sun's it down so I think I'm
gonna<00:00:19.140> do<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> slight<00:00:19.830> weathering<00:00:20.310> job<00:00:20.550> not

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
gonna do a slight weathering job not

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.609 
gonna do a slight weathering job not
quite<00:00:21.090> as<00:00:21.270> much<00:00:21.449> as<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.750> originally<00:00:21.960> planned<00:00:22.350> to

quite as much as I originally planned to
do<00:00:22.769> just<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.760> kind<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:23.970> give<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.869> that

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
do just to kind of give it that

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.509 
do just to kind of give it that
realistic<00:00:26.849> look<00:00:27.090> but<00:00:28.010> still<00:00:29.010> not<00:00:29.130> cover<00:00:29.429> up

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519

the<00:00:29.760> nice<00:00:29.939> painting<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.720> got<00:00:30.869> down<00:00:31.050> here<00:00:31.230> I

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
the nice painting that I got down here I

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.549 
the nice painting that I got down here I
used<00:00:32.340> three<00:00:32.610> coats<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:34.110> model<00:00:34.380> master

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
used three coats of the model master

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.690 
used three coats of the model master
dark<00:00:35.010> green<00:00:35.309> enamel<00:00:37.280> here<00:00:38.280> are<00:00:38.399> all<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> other

dark green enamel here are all the other
parts<00:00:39.149> basically<00:00:39.750> like<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.050> left<00:00:40.260> them<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.559> part

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
parts basically like I left them in part

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.889 
parts basically like I left them in part
one<00:00:41.040> except<00:00:41.640> for<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.910> finished<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.600> exhaust

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
one except for I finished the exhaust

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.869 
one except for I finished the exhaust
the<00:00:43.110> only<00:00:43.440> thing<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.710> need<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:44.040> do<00:00:44.190> still<00:00:44.579> is

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
the only thing I need to do still is

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.990 
the only thing I need to do still is
paint<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.420> little<00:00:45.570> bit<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.710> bracket<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.489> I

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
paint a little bit on this bracket and I

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.610 
paint a little bit on this bracket and I
needed<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.300> drill<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.660> tip<00:00:48.870> out<00:00:49.079> put<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> little

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
needed to drill the tip out put a little

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.990 
needed to drill the tip out put a little
bit<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.800> flat<00:00:50.010> black<00:00:50.250> inside<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.730> there<00:00:50.850> but

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
bit of flat black inside of there but

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.729 
bit of flat black inside of there but
other<00:00:51.149> than<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.629> exhaust<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.260> complete

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
other than that the exhaust is complete

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.889 
other than that the exhaust is complete
it<00:00:53.010> turned<00:00:53.219> out<00:00:53.370> pretty<00:00:53.579> good<00:00:53.910> could<00:00:54.809> have

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
it turned out pretty good could have

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.139 
it turned out pretty good could have
been<00:00:55.020> better<00:00:55.199> but<00:00:55.610> it's<00:00:56.610> good<00:00:56.730> enough<00:00:56.940> for

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
been better but it's good enough for

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.720 
been better but it's good enough for
this<00:00:57.270> build<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.680> radiator<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.309> complete

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
this build and the radiator is complete

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.220 
this build and the radiator is complete
it<00:00:59.910> just<00:01:00.059> needs<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.359> be<00:01:00.449> glued<00:01:01.079> together

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
it just needs to be glued together

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.170 
it just needs to be glued together
everything<00:01:02.010> else<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.340> good<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.609> go<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.760> do<00:01:02.910> need

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
everything else is good to go I do need

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.329 
everything else is good to go I do need
to<00:01:03.210> modify<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.899> little<00:01:03.989> bit<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.530> cut<00:01:05.220> off

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
to modify this a little bit and cut off

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.859 
to modify this a little bit and cut off
a<00:01:05.369> little<00:01:05.610> nub<00:01:05.790> there<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.210> used<00:01:06.540> for

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
a little nub there that I used for

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.899 
a little nub there that I used for
holding<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.500> when<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.650> painted<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.760> also

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
holding it when I painted it and I also

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.640 
holding it when I painted it and I also
need<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.299> paint<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.630> top<00:01:09.900> little<00:01:10.140> scoop<00:01:10.380> part

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
need to paint this top little scoop part

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.990 
need to paint this top little scoop part
here<00:01:11.420> probably<00:01:12.420> some<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> gloss<00:01:13.470> black<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:14.130> like

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
here probably some a gloss black I like

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.999 
here probably some a gloss black I like
to<00:01:15.119> add<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> little<00:01:15.450> bit<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.630> mesh<00:01:16.320> in<00:01:16.590> there<00:01:16.799> but

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
to add a little bit of mesh in there but

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.260 
to add a little bit of mesh in there but
I<00:01:17.070> don't<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.340> anything<00:01:17.549> small<00:01:17.939> enough<00:01:18.119> to

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
I don't have anything small enough to

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.399 
I don't have anything small enough to
fit<00:01:18.420> in<00:01:18.540> there<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:18.720> it'll<00:01:19.110> be<00:01:19.200> good<00:01:19.350> enough

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
fit in there so it'll be good enough

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.039 
fit in there so it'll be good enough
once<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.100> black<00:01:20.630> basically<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.900> the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
once it's black basically this is the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.230 
once it's black basically this is the
fuel<00:01:22.290> pump<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.210> crankcase<00:01:24.210> breather

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
fuel pump and crankcase breather

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.120 
fuel pump and crankcase breather
assembly<00:01:25.140> from<00:01:25.350> what<00:01:25.470> I've<00:01:25.560> read<00:01:25.740> online<00:01:25.920> I

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
assembly from what I've read online I

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.070 
assembly from what I've read online I
believe<00:01:26.310> that's<00:01:26.670> correct<00:01:26.850> part<00:01:27.750> here<00:01:27.900> on<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
believe that's correct part here on the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.660 
believe that's correct part here on the
right<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> fuel<00:01:28.829> pump<00:01:29.040> then<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.460> had<00:01:29.579> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
right is a fuel pump then you had the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.120 
right is a fuel pump then you had the
fuel<00:01:29.880> pump<00:01:30.119> stand<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:31.170> guess<00:01:31.860> there's<00:01:32.070> a

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
fuel pump stand and I guess there's a

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.920 
fuel pump stand and I guess there's a
shaft<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.640> runs<00:01:32.790> like<00:01:33.000> off<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.210> camshaft

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
shaft that runs like off the camshaft

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.050 
shaft that runs like off the camshaft
and<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.680> operates<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:35.280> mechanical<00:01:35.880> fuel

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
and it operates this mechanical fuel

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.399 
and it operates this mechanical fuel
pump<00:01:36.090> same<00:01:36.600> as<00:01:36.750> you'd<00:01:36.869> have<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.200> like<00:01:37.320> a

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
pump same as you'd have on like a

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.960 
pump same as you'd have on like a
small-block<00:01:37.799> Chevy<00:01:38.189> that'd<00:01:38.430> be<00:01:38.579> mounted<00:01:38.880> on

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
small-block Chevy that'd be mounted on

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.179 
small-block Chevy that'd be mounted on
the<00:01:39.000> front<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.450> engine<00:01:39.570> on<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.530> passenger

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
the front of the engine on the passenger

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.460 
the front of the engine on the passenger
side<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.430> believe<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.299> then<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.229> have<00:01:43.439> a

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
side I believe it is and then you have a

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.030 
side I believe it is and then you have a
the<00:01:43.799> breather<00:01:44.009> stand<00:01:44.369> here<00:01:45.200> which<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:46.409> most

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
the breather stand here which on most

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.620 
the breather stand here which on most
later<00:01:47.369> engines<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:47.970> believe<00:01:48.210> would<00:01:48.329> be<00:01:48.479> mounted

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
later engines I believe would be mounted

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.560 
later engines I believe would be mounted
in<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.990> front<00:01:49.229> as<00:01:49.350> well<00:01:49.850> so<00:01:50.850> there<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.540> I

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
in the front as well so there is that I

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.109 
in the front as well so there is that I
wasn't<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.200> big<00:01:52.409> fan<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.549> was<00:01:53.729> gonna<00:01:53.820> cut

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
wasn't a big fan of this I was gonna cut

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.850 
wasn't a big fan of this I was gonna cut
this<00:01:54.240> off<00:01:54.479> because<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.960> only<00:01:55.229> saw<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.530> couple

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
this off because I only saw a couple

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.319 
this off because I only saw a couple
engines<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.460> actually<00:01:56.790> used<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.119> breather

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
engines that actually used the breather

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.330 
engines that actually used the breather
like<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:57.840> but<00:01:58.110> at<00:01:58.799> this<00:01:58.920> point<00:01:59.159> I'm<00:01:59.310> just

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
like this but at this point I'm just

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.190 
like this but at this point I'm just
gonna<00:01:59.549> leave<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.000> do<00:02:00.060> I'm<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.869> final

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
gonna leave it I do I'm in the final

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.469 
gonna leave it I do I'm in the final
assembly<00:02:01.469> stage<00:02:01.890> now<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.490> everything<00:02:03.210> seems

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
assembly stage now and everything seems

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.209 
assembly stage now and everything seems
to<00:02:03.540> be<00:02:03.630> going<00:02:03.930> together<00:02:04.020> well<00:02:04.469> fitment<00:02:05.130> is

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
to be going together well fitment is

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.100 
to be going together well fitment is
nice<00:02:05.430> as<00:02:06.180> far<00:02:06.420> as<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.689> painting<00:02:06.990> and

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
nice as far as the painting and

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.169 
nice as far as the painting and
everything<00:02:07.170> goes<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.920> looks<00:02:08.039> like<00:02:08.280> it's<00:02:08.459> going

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
everything goes it looks like it's going

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.070 
everything goes it looks like it's going
to<00:02:09.239> be<00:02:09.330> good<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.539> go

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
to be good to go

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.949 
to be good to go
I've<00:02:10.760> you<00:02:11.760> know<00:02:11.790> sand<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.270> down<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.420> few<00:02:12.660> spots

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
I've you know sand it down a few spots

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.660 
I've you know sand it down a few spots
they're<00:02:13.170> going<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.349> be

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
they're going to be

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.720 
they're going to be
on<00:02:13.849> two<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:15.260> if<00:02:15.980> you're<00:02:16.220> wondering<00:02:16.520> about<00:02:16.550> the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
on two and if you're wondering about the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.610 
on two and if you're wondering about the
transmission<00:02:17.360> it<00:02:17.480> will<00:02:17.599> be<00:02:17.720> painted<00:02:18.020> that's

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
transmission it will be painted that's

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.280 
transmission it will be painted that's
gonna<00:02:18.770> be<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.010> last<00:02:19.190> thing<00:02:19.310> that<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:19.580> do<00:02:20.260> now<00:02:21.260> I

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
gonna be the last thing that I do now I

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.729 
gonna be the last thing that I do now I
have<00:02:21.530> an<00:02:21.650> issue<00:02:21.800> here<00:02:21.980> that<00:02:22.190> I've<00:02:22.459> come<00:02:23.590> that<00:02:24.590> I

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
have an issue here that I've come that I

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.410 
have an issue here that I've come that I
am<00:02:24.860> faced<00:02:25.130> with<00:02:26.319> now<00:02:27.319> I<00:02:27.349> assembled<00:02:27.920> this<00:02:28.420> on

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
am faced with now I assembled this on

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.850 
am faced with now I assembled this on
the<00:02:29.569> good<00:02:29.720> notion<00:02:29.959> that<00:02:30.319> this<00:02:30.470> was<00:02:30.530> going<00:02:30.800> to

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
the good notion that this was going to

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.220 
the good notion that this was going to
line<00:02:31.069> up<00:02:31.100> properly<00:02:31.720> because<00:02:32.720> I<00:02:32.930> figured

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
line up properly because I figured

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.449 
line up properly because I figured
something<00:02:33.530> as<00:02:33.620> little<00:02:33.709> as<00:02:33.890> this<00:02:34.100> there's<00:02:34.310> no

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
something as little as this there's no

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.400 
something as little as this there's no
way<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:34.940> it<00:02:35.270> wouldn't<00:02:35.480> line<00:02:35.690> up<00:02:35.720> right

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
way that it wouldn't line up right

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.920 
way that it wouldn't line up right
I<00:02:36.880> didn't<00:02:37.880> mock<00:02:38.030> it<00:02:38.180> up<00:02:38.300> I<00:02:38.450> guess<00:02:38.630> that<00:02:38.810> was<00:02:38.900> my

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
I didn't mock it up I guess that was my

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:39.580 
I didn't mock it up I guess that was my
fault

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
fault

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.040 
fault
but<00:02:40.250> it<00:02:40.519> appears<00:02:40.910> that<00:02:41.000> when<00:02:41.480> I<00:02:41.510> get<00:02:41.630> this<00:02:41.870> all

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
but it appears that when I get this all

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.330 
but it appears that when I get this all
together<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.590> I<00:02:42.650> had<00:02:42.769> to<00:02:42.860> open<00:02:42.980> up<00:02:43.220> these

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
together and I had to open up these

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.070 
together and I had to open up these
holes<00:02:43.580> for<00:02:43.849> the<00:02:43.910> water<00:02:44.120> pumps<00:02:44.510> quite<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:44.810> bit

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
holes for the water pumps quite a bit

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.410 
holes for the water pumps quite a bit
and<00:02:45.290> I<00:02:46.100> also<00:02:46.220> had<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.489> grind<00:02:46.790> down<00:02:46.940> this<00:02:47.150> top

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
and I also had to grind down this top

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.750 
and I also had to grind down this top
mount<00:02:47.750> because<00:02:48.680> this<00:02:48.800> was<00:02:48.980> so<00:02:49.160> tight<00:02:49.400> you<00:02:49.640> can

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
mount because this was so tight you can

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.789 
mount because this was so tight you can
see<00:02:50.380> there<00:02:51.380> is<00:02:51.709> quite<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:52.220> bit<00:02:52.400> of<00:02:52.519> a<00:02:52.580> gap<00:02:52.819> now

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
see there is quite a bit of a gap now

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.930 
see there is quite a bit of a gap now
there's<00:02:54.799> also<00:02:55.040> a<00:02:55.220> gap<00:02:55.400> here<00:02:55.580> on<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.760> bottom

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
there's also a gap here on the bottom

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.449 
there's also a gap here on the bottom
even<00:02:56.390> when<00:02:56.630> I<00:02:56.660> have<00:02:56.870> it<00:02:56.989> level<00:02:57.160> so<00:02:58.160> I<00:02:58.190> think

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
even when I have it level so I think

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:59.650 
even when I have it level so I think
what<00:02:58.670> I'm<00:02:58.730> gonna<00:02:58.819> have<00:02:58.970> to<00:02:59.030> do<00:02:59.150> is<00:02:59.239> just<00:02:59.390> sand

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
what I'm gonna have to do is just sand

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.190 
what I'm gonna have to do is just sand
down<00:02:59.840> the<00:02:59.989> water<00:03:00.200> pumps<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.620> bit<00:03:00.769> more<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.870> the

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
down the water pumps a bit more and the

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.289 
down the water pumps a bit more and the
good<00:03:03.350> thing<00:03:03.560> is<00:03:03.769> I<00:03:04.130> was<00:03:04.640> almost<00:03:04.850> thinking<00:03:05.090> I

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
good thing is I was almost thinking I

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:06.699 
good thing is I was almost thinking I
might<00:03:05.450> have<00:03:05.569> to<00:03:05.690> create<00:03:05.930> a<00:03:05.989> new<00:03:06.200> mount<00:03:06.440> for

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
might have to create a new mount for

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.820 
might have to create a new mount for
this<00:03:06.860> but<00:03:07.850> when<00:03:08.269> I<00:03:08.299> put<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:08.930> distributor<00:03:09.620> in

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
this but when I put the distributor in

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.830 
this but when I put the distributor in
which<00:03:10.670> I'm<00:03:10.819> not<00:03:10.940> gonna<00:03:11.120> be<00:03:11.269> able<00:03:11.360> to<00:03:11.480> do<00:03:11.660> this

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
which I'm not gonna be able to do this

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.979 
which I'm not gonna be able to do this
here<00:03:12.319> since<00:03:13.280> these<00:03:13.400> things<00:03:13.640> aren't<00:03:13.940> glued<00:03:14.720> in

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
here since these things aren't glued in

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.110 
here since these things aren't glued in
but<00:03:15.290> trigger<00:03:15.980> sits<00:03:16.340> here<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:16.700> it<00:03:16.760> appears

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
but trigger sits here and it appears

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.880 
but trigger sits here and it appears
that<00:03:17.209> this<00:03:17.480> top<00:03:17.750> part<00:03:18.019> here<00:03:18.230> is<00:03:18.380> actually<00:03:18.769> with

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
that this top part here is actually with

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.190 
that this top part here is actually with
the<00:03:19.010> bracket<00:03:19.400> runs<00:03:19.579> off<00:03:19.820> of<00:03:19.850> so<00:03:20.750> when<00:03:20.870> I<00:03:20.900> say<00:03:21.140> in

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
the bracket runs off of so when I say in

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.569 
the bracket runs off of so when I say in
all<00:03:21.320> it's<00:03:21.440> down<00:03:21.560> if<00:03:21.709> it<00:03:21.799> does<00:03:21.950> line<00:03:22.190> up<00:03:22.220> right

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
all it's down if it does line up right

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:23.650 
all it's down if it does line up right
I'm<00:03:22.700> just<00:03:22.850> gonna<00:03:22.940> go<00:03:23.150> with<00:03:23.239> that<00:03:23.420> because

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
I'm just gonna go with that because

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:24.880 
I'm just gonna go with that because
you're<00:03:23.900> not<00:03:24.049> really<00:03:24.200> going<00:03:24.440> to<00:03:24.500> see<00:03:24.680> it<00:03:24.799> all

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
you're not really going to see it all

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.370 
you're not really going to see it all
that<00:03:25.040> well<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:25.519> it'll<00:03:26.390> be<00:03:26.480> close<00:03:26.690> enough<00:03:26.870> but

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
that well and it'll be close enough but

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.930 
that well and it'll be close enough but
if<00:03:27.500> there<00:03:27.650> is<00:03:27.769> still<00:03:28.010> a<00:03:28.040> pretty<00:03:28.280> big<00:03:28.519> gap<00:03:28.730> I'm

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
if there is still a pretty big gap I'm

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.920 
if there is still a pretty big gap I'm
gonna<00:03:29.120> have<00:03:29.239> to<00:03:29.329> modify<00:03:29.600> the<00:03:29.780> bracket<00:03:30.290> I<00:03:31.930> got

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
gonna have to modify the bracket I got

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.259 
gonna have to modify the bracket I got
the<00:03:33.079> 37<00:03:33.739> Ford<00:03:34.040> flathead<00:03:34.340> mocked<00:03:34.820> up<00:03:35.060> in<00:03:35.180> the

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
the 37 Ford flathead mocked up in the

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.410 
the 37 Ford flathead mocked up in the
chassis<00:03:35.540> now<00:03:35.930> it's<00:03:36.140> just<00:03:36.470> about<00:03:36.739> complete

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.819 

it's<00:03:41.420> a<00:03:41.480> little<00:03:41.720> bit<00:03:41.870> of<00:03:41.959> tweaking<00:03:42.170> here<00:03:42.590> there

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
it's a little bit of tweaking here there

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.860 
it's a little bit of tweaking here there
need<00:03:43.070> to<00:03:43.130> put<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.400> exhaust<00:03:43.730> manifolds<00:03:44.359> on<00:03:44.510> and

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
need to put the exhaust manifolds on and

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.020 
need to put the exhaust manifolds on and
I<00:03:45.290> decided<00:03:45.709> I'm<00:03:45.920> probably<00:03:46.190> not<00:03:46.459> gonna<00:03:46.640> go<00:03:46.880> with

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
I decided I'm probably not gonna go with

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.300 
I decided I'm probably not gonna go with
the<00:03:47.120> factory<00:03:47.540> oil<00:03:47.810> bath<00:03:48.079> air<00:03:48.109> cleaner<00:03:48.410> I<00:03:49.010> think

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
the factory oil bath air cleaner I think

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.680 
the factory oil bath air cleaner I think
I'm<00:03:49.400> gonna<00:03:49.489> go<00:03:49.670> with<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:49.820> little<00:03:50.030> hot<00:03:50.299> rod<00:03:50.510> style

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
I'm gonna go with a little hot rod style

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.720 
I'm gonna go with a little hot rod style
scoop<00:03:51.200> and<00:03:51.500> I'll<00:03:52.070> create<00:03:52.340> that<00:03:52.489> out<00:03:52.640> of

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
scoop and I'll create that out of

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.640 
scoop and I'll create that out of
styrene<00:03:53.030> I'll<00:03:53.780> show<00:03:53.959> you<00:03:54.049> guys<00:03:54.200> that<00:03:54.470> probably

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
styrene I'll show you guys that probably

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.680 
styrene I'll show you guys that probably
in<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.040> next<00:03:55.190> clip<00:03:55.609> you<00:03:56.180> need<00:03:56.329> to<00:03:56.420> paint<00:03:56.569> the

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
in the next clip you need to paint the

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.150 
in the next clip you need to paint the
transmission<00:03:57.350> I'm<00:03:57.410> gonna<00:03:57.530> do<00:03:57.620> that<00:03:57.769> here<00:03:58.010> in<00:03:58.040> a

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
transmission I'm gonna do that here in a

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.099 
transmission I'm gonna do that here in a
second<00:03:58.609> because<00:03:59.150> I<00:03:59.329> decided<00:03:59.660> I<00:03:59.810> need<00:04:00.019> to

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
second because I decided I need to

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:01.690 
second because I decided I need to
weather<00:04:00.260> the<00:04:00.470> transmission<00:04:01.130> so<00:04:01.340> Mies<00:04:01.549> will

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
weather the transmission so Mies will

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.180 
weather the transmission so Mies will
paint<00:04:01.910> it<00:04:02.000> now<00:04:02.180> I<00:04:02.709> was<00:04:03.709> looking<00:04:03.799> up<00:04:03.980> some

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
paint it now I was looking up some

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.900 
paint it now I was looking up some
research<00:04:04.579> and<00:04:05.450> I<00:04:06.230> haven't<00:04:06.470> really<00:04:06.620> quite

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
research and I haven't really quite

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.770 
research and I haven't really quite
figured<00:04:07.910> out<00:04:08.000> what<00:04:08.060> color<00:04:08.569> these

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
figured out what color these

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.690 
figured out what color these
transmissions<00:04:09.560> were<00:04:09.709> so<00:04:09.980> I'm<00:04:10.069> probably<00:04:10.400> just

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
transmissions were so I'm probably just

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.599 
transmissions were so I'm probably just
gonna<00:04:10.970> paint<00:04:11.269> it<00:04:11.389> semi-gloss<00:04:12.079> black<00:04:12.139> I<00:04:12.859> think

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
gonna paint it semi-gloss black I think

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.190 
gonna paint it semi-gloss black I think
it'll<00:04:13.760> be<00:04:13.880> good<00:04:14.000> enough<00:04:14.269> but<00:04:14.569> the<00:04:14.690> engine<00:04:14.959> fits

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
it'll be good enough but the engine fits

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.430 
it'll be good enough but the engine fits
in<00:04:15.380> here<00:04:15.560> just<00:04:16.310> about<00:04:16.639> perfect<00:04:17.440> get

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
in here just about perfect get

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.379 
in here just about perfect get
everything<00:04:18.680> all<00:04:18.979> ready<00:04:19.760> to<00:04:19.910> go<00:04:20.030> there<00:04:20.209> I<00:04:20.269> guess

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
everything all ready to go there I guess

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:21.520 
everything all ready to go there I guess
I<00:04:20.419> could<00:04:20.600> probably<00:04:20.690> take<00:04:20.959> it<00:04:21.019> out<00:04:21.229> and<00:04:21.350> show

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
I could probably take it out and show

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.360 
I could probably take it out and show
you<00:04:22.120> close-up<00:04:23.120> look<00:04:23.240> at<00:04:23.390> the<00:04:23.479> engine

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:35.100 

really<00:04:27.370> coming<00:04:27.639> out<00:04:27.759> nice<00:04:28.000> I<00:04:28.240> think

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.320 

this<00:04:35.770> all<00:04:35.980> glued<00:04:36.220> up<00:04:36.400> last<00:04:36.640> and<00:04:36.760> I<00:04:36.850> need<00:04:37.090> to<00:04:37.180> put

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
this all glued up last and I need to put

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.420 
this all glued up last and I need to put
the<00:04:37.420> exhaust<00:04:37.630> manifolds<00:04:38.290> on<00:04:38.440> but<00:04:39.130> I<00:04:39.160> want<00:04:39.370> to

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
the exhaust manifolds on but I want to

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.680 
the exhaust manifolds on but I want to
give<00:04:39.550> it<00:04:39.640> to<00:04:39.730> look<00:04:39.880> like<00:04:40.060> they<00:04:40.210> redid<00:04:40.540> the

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
give it to look like they redid the

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.540 
give it to look like they redid the
exhaust<00:04:41.020> but<00:04:41.350> haven't<00:04:41.680> done<00:04:41.980> anything<00:04:42.220> to<00:04:42.430> the

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
exhaust but haven't done anything to the

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.770 
exhaust but haven't done anything to the
engine<00:04:42.880> yet<00:04:43.060> so<00:04:43.240> I'm<00:04:43.300> probably<00:04:43.510> going<00:04:43.720> to

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
engine yet so I'm probably going to

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.970 
engine yet so I'm probably going to
weather<00:04:43.990> it<00:04:44.140> a<00:04:44.230> bit<00:04:44.410> and<00:04:44.560> then<00:04:44.650> put<00:04:44.860> the

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
weather it a bit and then put the

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.290 
weather it a bit and then put the
exhaust<00:04:45.280> on<00:04:45.520> and<00:04:45.730> then<00:04:45.820> do<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.060> final

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
exhaust on and then do the final

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.560 
exhaust on and then do the final
weathering<00:04:47.220> so<00:04:48.220> that<00:04:48.370> is<00:04:48.790> the<00:04:49.090> engine<00:04:49.420> right

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
weathering so that is the engine right

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.220 
weathering so that is the engine right
there<00:04:49.840> and<00:04:50.110> I'm<00:04:50.260> going<00:04:50.350> to<00:04:50.410> do<00:04:50.620> the<00:04:50.830> custom<00:04:52.230> air

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
there and I'm going to do the custom air

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.290 
there and I'm going to do the custom air
scoop<00:04:53.620> here<00:04:53.860> on<00:04:53.980> the<00:04:54.070> front<00:04:54.400> instead<00:04:54.820> of<00:04:55.060> doing

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
scoop here on the front instead of doing

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.470 
scoop here on the front instead of doing
the<00:04:55.390> oil<00:04:55.540> bath<00:04:55.780> air<00:04:55.990> cleaner<00:04:57.090> so<00:04:58.090> there's<00:04:58.270> the

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
the oil bath air cleaner so there's the

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.500

will<00:05:15.460> be<00:05:15.670> used<00:05:16.420> in<00:05:16.570> a<00:05:16.660> diorama<00:05:17.080> so<00:05:17.320> I<00:05:17.530> did<00:05:17.740> not

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
will be used in a diorama so I did not

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.500 
will be used in a diorama so I did not
do<00:05:18.040> plug<00:05:18.310> wires<00:05:18.580> or<00:05:18.970> any<00:05:19.090> other<00:05:19.300> thing<00:05:19.480> like

that<00:05:19.660> but<00:05:20.620> I<00:05:20.650> did<00:05:20.950> want<00:05:21.160> to<00:05:21.220> make<00:05:21.340> it<00:05:21.460> look<00:05:21.610> as

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
that but I did want to make it look as

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.490 
that but I did want to make it look as
realistic<00:05:22.150> as<00:05:22.450> possible<00:05:22.930> using<00:05:23.140> the<00:05:23.320> kit

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
realistic as possible using the kit

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.380 
realistic as possible using the kit
supplied<00:05:23.860> parts<00:05:24.160> you<00:05:24.880> will<00:05:25.030> notice<00:05:25.360> that

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390 
supplied parts you will notice that

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.150 
supplied parts you will notice that
there<00:05:25.750> are<00:05:25.960> a<00:05:25.990> few<00:05:26.260> things<00:05:26.440> missing<00:05:26.950> in<00:05:27.010> these

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
there are a few things missing in these

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.730 
there are a few things missing in these
parts<00:05:27.490> will<00:05:27.670> be<00:05:27.700> added<00:05:28.180> upon<00:05:28.840> final<00:05:29.200> assembly

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
parts will be added upon final assembly

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.220 
parts will be added upon final assembly
of<00:05:29.920> the<00:05:30.070> chassis<00:05:30.310> but<00:05:31.300> this<00:05:31.750> is<00:05:31.930> the<00:05:32.080> main

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
of the chassis but this is the main

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.410 
of the chassis but this is the main
engine<00:05:32.530> itself<00:05:32.920> it<00:05:33.160> is<00:05:33.280> fully<00:05:33.550> complete<00:05:34.060> so<00:05:34.390> I

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.420 
engine itself it is fully complete so I

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.490 
engine itself it is fully complete so I
just<00:05:34.600> wanted<00:05:34.780> to<00:05:34.870> give<00:05:34.960> you<00:05:35.050> guys<00:05:35.170> a<00:05:35.200> close-up

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
just wanted to give you guys a close-up

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.250 
just wanted to give you guys a close-up
look<00:05:35.800> at<00:05:35.950> it<00:05:36.100> here<00:05:36.840> and<00:05:37.840> you<00:05:37.960> can<00:05:38.080> see

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
look at it here and you can see

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.640 
look at it here and you can see
basically<00:05:38.440> I<00:05:38.830> painted<00:05:39.280> in<00:05:39.400> the<00:05:39.490> dark<00:05:39.700> green

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
basically I painted in the dark green

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.710 
basically I painted in the dark green
and<00:05:41.650> it<00:05:41.800> just<00:05:41.980> did<00:05:42.610> a<00:05:42.640> few<00:05:42.850> washes<00:05:43.330> over<00:05:43.480> at

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
and it just did a few washes over at

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.330 
and it just did a few washes over at
this<00:05:43.870> side<00:05:44.080> came<00:05:44.350> out<00:05:44.500> quite<00:05:44.740> a<00:05:44.770> bit<00:05:44.860> darker

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
this side came out quite a bit darker

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.860 
this side came out quite a bit darker
than<00:05:45.490> the<00:05:45.580> other<00:05:45.700> side<00:05:45.970> but<00:05:46.210> I<00:05:46.300> wanted<00:05:46.630> to<00:05:46.720> do

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
than the other side but I wanted to do

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.410 
than the other side but I wanted to do
it<00:05:46.990> like<00:05:47.140> that<00:05:47.700> because<00:05:48.700> I<00:05:48.910> wanted<00:05:49.150> to<00:05:49.240> give<00:05:49.390> it

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:49.420 
it like that because I wanted to give it

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.680 
it like that because I wanted to give it
to<00:05:49.540> a<00:05:50.100> realistic<00:05:51.180> asymmetrical<00:05:52.180> look<00:05:52.300> because

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
to a realistic asymmetrical look because

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.660 
to a realistic asymmetrical look because
when<00:05:53.530> things<00:05:53.770> get<00:05:53.980> dirty<00:05:54.160> and<00:05:54.460> they<00:05:54.520> get

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.670 
when things get dirty and they get

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.890 
when things get dirty and they get
greasy<00:05:55.350> it's<00:05:56.350> never<00:05:56.590> the<00:05:56.740> same<00:05:56.800> in<00:05:57.130> any<00:05:57.250> part

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
greasy it's never the same in any part

didn't<00:06:09.370> quite<00:06:09.490> come<00:06:09.760> out<00:06:09.850> like<00:06:10.120> I<00:06:10.270> wanted<00:06:10.540> it

to<00:06:10.870> I<00:06:12.330> think<00:06:13.330> Dan<00:06:13.630> gen<00:06:13.930> overall<00:06:14.320> came<00:06:14.590> out<00:06:14.740> very

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980 
to I think Dan gen overall came out very

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.510 
to I think Dan gen overall came out very
nice<00:06:16.230> black<00:06:17.230> wash<00:06:17.530> certainly<00:06:18.010> helped<00:06:18.310> add<00:06:18.490> a

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
nice black wash certainly helped add a

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:26.720 
nice black wash certainly helped add a
lot<00:06:18.760> of<00:06:18.790> detail<00:06:19.180> to<00:06:19.210> it
