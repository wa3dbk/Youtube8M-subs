00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.760 

I've<00:00:06.390> been<00:00:06.600> teaching<00:00:06.839> people<00:00:07.200> to<00:00:07.379> make<00:00:07.529> coffee

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
I've been teaching people to make coffee

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.740 
I've been teaching people to make coffee
for<00:00:07.950> over<00:00:08.340> ten<00:00:08.580> years<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.059> if<00:00:09.360> I've<00:00:09.510> learnt

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
for over ten years and if I've learnt

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.690 
for over ten years and if I've learnt
one<00:00:09.990> thing<00:00:10.019> during<00:00:10.440> that<00:00:10.740> time<00:00:11.010> it's<00:00:11.519> not

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
one thing during that time it's not

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.220 
one thing during that time it's not
something<00:00:12.420> for<00:00:12.570> everybody

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
something for everybody

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.740 
something for everybody
one<00:00:13.679> thing<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:14.009> do<00:00:14.070> know<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.790> that<00:00:14.849> everybody

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
one thing I do know is that everybody

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.720 
one thing I do know is that everybody
loves<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.260> taste<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.650> great<00:00:16.859> coffee<00:00:17.100> but

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
loves the taste of great coffee but

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.400 
loves the taste of great coffee but
maybe<00:00:18.000> they<00:00:18.240> don't<00:00:18.390> want<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.779> complexity<00:00:19.380> of

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
maybe they don't want the complexity of

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.470 
maybe they don't want the complexity of
learning<00:00:19.619> how<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:19.920> be<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.189> barista<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:21.210> what

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
learning how to be a barista so what

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.630 
learning how to be a barista so what
we've<00:00:21.630> done<00:00:21.810> at<00:00:21.960> Sage<00:00:22.230> with<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.010> Oracle<00:00:23.279> we've

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
we've done at Sage with the Oracle we've

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.490 
we've done at Sage with the Oracle we've
automated<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.449> most<00:00:24.660> difficult<00:00:25.109> parts<00:00:25.410> of

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
automated the most difficult parts of

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.679 
automated the most difficult parts of
manual<00:00:25.859> espresso<00:00:26.369> we've<00:00:26.789> built<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.150> grinder

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
manual espresso we've built a grinder

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.109 
manual espresso we've built a grinder
right<00:00:28.260> into<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.619> machine<00:00:28.740> but<00:00:29.490> not<00:00:29.760> just<00:00:30.029> a

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
right into the machine but not just a

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.389 
right into the machine but not just a
grinder<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.929> also<00:00:31.140> doses<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.009> tamps

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
grinder it also doses and tamps

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.430 
grinder it also doses and tamps
perfectly<00:00:33.000> every<00:00:33.420> single<00:00:33.450> time<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.989> use<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
perfectly every single time you use the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.139 
perfectly every single time you use the
Machine<00:00:34.770> take<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.309> group<00:00:35.550> handle<00:00:35.880> out<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.090> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
Machine take the group handle out of the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.000 
Machine take the group handle out of the
group<00:00:36.360> head<00:00:36.570> insert<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.290> into<00:00:37.410> our<00:00:37.500> grinder

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
group head insert it into our grinder

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.560 
group head insert it into our grinder
cradle<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.460> just<00:00:38.700> bump<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.090> right<00:00:39.329> to

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
cradle and just bump to the right to

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.350 
cradle and just bump to the right to
start<00:00:42.110> let's<00:00:43.110> have<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.290> look<00:00:43.469> how<00:00:43.559> we've<00:00:43.739> done

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
start let's have a look how we've done

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.630 
start let's have a look how we've done
perfect<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.020> we've<00:00:46.200> controlled<00:00:46.620> two<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
perfect so we've controlled two of the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.880 
perfect so we've controlled two of the
three<00:00:47.940> critical<00:00:48.210> variables<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.590> flow<00:00:49.860> of

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
three critical variables so the flow of

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.529 
three critical variables so the flow of
extraction<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.520> not<00:00:50.640> quite<00:00:50.879> right<00:00:51.120> all<00:00:51.420> we

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
extraction is not quite right all we

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.420 
extraction is not quite right all we
need<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.020> do<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:52.590> grind<00:00:52.829> fineness

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
need to do is to just grind fineness

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.000 
need to do is to just grind fineness
until<00:00:54.090> we<00:00:54.180> get<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.449> right<00:00:54.629> rate<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.050> flow<00:00:55.260> just

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
until we get the right rate of flow just

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.490 
until we get the right rate of flow just
insert<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.520> into<00:00:56.640> our<00:00:56.730> group<00:00:57.090> head<00:00:57.300> and

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
insert it into our group head and

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.150 
insert it into our group head and
immediately<00:00:58.500> press<00:00:59.190> our<00:00:59.370> one<00:00:59.579> cut<00:00:59.850> button<00:01:00.090> and

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
immediately press our one cut button and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.709 
immediately press our one cut button and
we're<00:01:02.160> looking<00:01:02.430> for<00:01:02.609> our<00:01:02.640> spresso<00:01:03.059> extraction

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
we're looking for our spresso extraction

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.960 
we're looking for our spresso extraction
to<00:01:03.840> drop<00:01:04.080> from<00:01:04.199> our<00:01:04.409> spouts<00:01:04.769> at<00:01:05.040> around<00:01:05.489> eleven

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
to drop from our spouts at around eleven

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.910 
to drop from our spouts at around eleven
or<00:01:06.060> twelve<00:01:06.210> seconds<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.840> our<00:01:06.960> shot<00:01:07.200> clock<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
or twelve seconds on our shot clock the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.590 
or twelve seconds on our shot clock the
coffee<00:01:08.159> should<00:01:08.430> be<00:01:08.460> pouring<00:01:08.970> really<00:01:09.299> dark

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
coffee should be pouring really dark

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.140 
coffee should be pouring really dark
slow<00:01:10.140> with<00:01:10.560> consistency<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.310> warm<00:01:11.640> honey<00:01:11.850> and

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
slow with consistency of warm honey and

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.330 
slow with consistency of warm honey and
our<00:01:12.630> single<00:01:12.869> shot<00:01:13.229> has<00:01:13.350> stopped<00:01:13.619> at<00:01:13.770> around<00:01:13.920> 22

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
our single shot has stopped at around 22

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.890 
our single shot has stopped at around 22
seconds<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.119> now<00:01:15.360> we've<00:01:15.479> got<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.720> right

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
seconds so now we've got the right

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.590 
seconds so now we've got the right
volume<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.560> espresso<00:01:17.210> to<00:01:18.210> give<00:01:18.360> us<00:01:18.450> good

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
volume of espresso to give us good

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.929 
volume of espresso to give us good
flavor<00:01:18.900> balance<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.500> single<00:01:19.830> cup<00:01:20.040> all<00:01:20.759> we

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
flavor balance in a single cup all we

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.640 
flavor balance in a single cup all we
need<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.210> do<00:01:21.330> now<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.689> just<00:01:21.900> texture<00:01:22.259> some<00:01:22.470> milk

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
need to do now is just texture some milk

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.890 
need to do now is just texture some milk
so<00:01:22.830> let's<00:01:23.009> get<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.310> started<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.570> with<00:01:24.750> our

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
so let's get that started so with our

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.170 
so let's get that started so with our
Oracle<00:01:25.409> we<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:26.100> adjust<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.729> level<00:01:27.060> of

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
Oracle we can adjust the level of

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.719 
Oracle we can adjust the level of
texture<00:01:27.630> from<00:01:28.380> latte<00:01:28.890> all<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.340> way<00:01:29.430> up<00:01:29.579> to

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
texture from latte all the way up to

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.179 
texture from latte all the way up to
cappuccino<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.930> that's<00:01:31.110> lighter<00:01:31.439> texture<00:01:31.890> up

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
cappuccino so that's lighter texture up

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.609 
cappuccino so that's lighter texture up
to<00:01:32.520> heavier<00:01:32.820> texture<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:34.049> can<00:01:34.079> also<00:01:34.350> adjust

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
to heavier texture we can also adjust

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.710 
to heavier texture we can also adjust
the<00:01:34.979> final<00:01:35.340> temperature<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.759> our<00:01:35.939> milk<00:01:36.180> from

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
the final temperature of our milk from

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.830 
the final temperature of our milk from
50<00:01:37.110> degrees<00:01:37.439> up<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.740> 75<00:01:38.280> degrees<00:01:38.490> if<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.689> can

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
50 degrees up to 75 degrees if you can

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.359 
50 degrees up to 75 degrees if you can
grab<00:01:40.020> your<00:01:40.049> milk<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.590> your<00:01:40.680> pitcher<00:01:41.070> straight

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
grab your milk and your pitcher straight

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.100 
grab your milk and your pitcher straight
from<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> fridge<00:01:42.030> before<00:01:42.299> your<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.689> texture

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
from the fridge before your the texture

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.740 
from the fridge before your the texture
you'll<00:01:43.560> always<00:01:43.799> get<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.189> better<00:01:44.430> result<00:01:44.750> always

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
you'll always get a better result always

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.200 
you'll always get a better result always
purge<00:01:46.320> before<00:01:46.740> your<00:01:46.890> texture<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.549> just<00:01:47.939> tap
