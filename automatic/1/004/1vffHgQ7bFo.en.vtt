we<00:01:46.650> did<00:01:46.830> is<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:46.979> took<00:01:47.100> sort<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.580> the<00:01:47.640> best

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
we did is we took sort of the best

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.730 
we did is we took sort of the best
aspects<00:01:48.300> of<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.510> kart<00:01:48.720> racing<00:01:49.020> game<00:01:49.170> which<00:01:49.470> to

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
aspects of a kart racing game which to

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.800 
aspects of a kart racing game which to
us<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:50.040> accessibility<00:01:50.610> anyone<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.720> easily

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
us is accessibility anyone can easily

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.350 
us is accessibility anyone can easily
pick<00:01:52.200> up<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.530> play<00:01:52.830> it<00:01:53.340> gets<00:01:53.580> forgiving<00:01:54.120> that

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
pick up and play it gets forgiving that

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
pick up and play it gets forgiving that
you<00:01:54.450> know<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.600> may<00:01:54.780> make<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.050> stage

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
you know you may make the stage

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.929 
you know you may make the stage
and<00:01:55.619> one<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.040> corners<00:01:56.430> but<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.729> still

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
and one of the corners but you still

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.550 
and one of the corners but you still
have<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> chance<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.509> get<00:01:57.630> back<00:01:57.689> into<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.140> our

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
have a chance to get back into it our

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.810 
have a chance to get back into it our
motto<00:01:58.920> right<00:01:59.189> from<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.399> beginning<00:01:59.490> was

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
motto right from the beginning was

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.330 
motto right from the beginning was
anyone<00:02:00.509> can<00:02:00.689> win<00:02:00.869> now<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.530> course<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:02.159> more

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
anyone can win now of course the more

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.730 
anyone can win now of course the more
skill<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.909> have<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:04.229> better<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.500> learn<00:02:04.590> to

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
skill you have the better you learn to

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.440 
skill you have the better you learn to
use<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.009> weapons<00:02:05.369> then<00:02:05.909> you're<00:02:06.030> able<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.329> get

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
use the weapons then you're able to get

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.059 
use the weapons then you're able to get
back<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:07.079> will<00:02:07.229> win<00:02:07.409> more<00:02:07.649> races<00:02:08.039> than

back and you will win more races than
anyone<00:02:08.910> else<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.119> doesn't<00:02:09.239> just<00:02:09.360> be<00:02:09.539> like<00:02:09.720> a

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
anyone else it doesn't just be like a

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.380 
anyone else it doesn't just be like a
flip<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.380> the<00:02:10.440> coin<00:02:10.500> yeah<00:02:11.099> but<00:02:11.819> we<00:02:11.940> have<00:02:12.120> sort

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
flip of the coin yeah but we have sort

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.210 
flip of the coin yeah but we have sort
of<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.810> physicality<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:14.010> wouldn't

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
do the same thing with your carts and

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.759 
do the same thing with your carts and
change<00:02:48.360> all<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.870> different<00:02:49.140> aspects<00:02:49.530> the

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
change all the different aspects the

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.890 
change all the different aspects the
body<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.310> wheels<00:02:50.549> and<00:02:50.880> then<00:02:51.450> finally<00:02:51.780> the

body the wheels and then finally the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.479

track<00:02:52.140> which<00:02:52.440> is<00:02:52.470> obviously<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.250> most

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
track which is obviously the most

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.670 
track which is obviously the most
important<00:02:54.000> part<00:02:54.209> of<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.480> racing<00:02:54.780> game<00:02:54.810> is<00:02:55.110> the

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
important part of a racing game is the

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.460 
important part of a racing game is the
track<00:02:55.920> experience<00:02:56.660> so<00:02:57.660> we<00:02:57.780> build<00:02:57.989> our<00:02:58.110> editor

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
track experience so we build our editor

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.069 
track experience so we build our editor
right<00:02:59.040> from<00:02:59.310> beginning<00:02:59.480> with<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.600> premise<00:03:00.930> if

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
right from beginning with the premise if

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.420 
right from beginning with the premise if
it's<00:03:01.230> got<00:03:01.380> to<00:03:01.500> be<00:03:01.560> easy<00:03:01.769> it's<00:03:02.069> got<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.340> be

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
it's got to be easy it's got to be

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.880 
it's got to be easy it's got to be
accessible<00:03:02.730> we<00:03:03.269> didn't<00:03:03.510> want<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.900> be<00:03:04.079> when

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
accessible we didn't want it to be when

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.860 
accessible we didn't want it to be when
we<00:03:04.980> seen<00:03:05.190> some<00:03:05.340> really<00:03:05.519> interesting<00:03:06.120> editors

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
we seen some really interesting editors

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.690

just<00:03:12.420> get<00:03:12.540> through<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.109> what<00:03:13.950> we<00:03:14.069> wanted

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
just get through it and what we wanted

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.509 
just get through it and what we wanted
to<00:03:14.430> do<00:03:14.609> was<00:03:14.819> make<00:03:15.329> one<00:03:15.540> that<00:03:15.660> was<00:03:15.750> fun<00:03:16.019> and

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
to do was make one that was fun and
