 [Music] 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.400
 hi car friends f1latam my name 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.529
 es carlos rodrÃ­guez brand manager 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.630
 ford motors de colombia and we are today 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.470
 to present the launch of the 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:41.300
 new focus 2015 that arrives in Colombia 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:43.670
 [Music] 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.070
 we can observe the new focus account 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.260
 with a completely renovated design that will 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.360
 It gives more sportsmanship much more style to 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.579
 We can see this vehicle with some 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.410
 much more aggressive lines we started with 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.629
 the hood part has four 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.940
 tendons that increase the musculature of the 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.159
 vehicle we can see that it is much more 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.260
 robust also has a word 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.840
 and monkfish I'm dal with bars 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.540
 transverse in chrome that precisely 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.520
 is in line with the design language 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.759
 that force manages worldwide 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.130
 the famous kinetic design 2.0 likewise 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:19.490
 has some new front lights 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.990
 type blazer kot and some lights of march 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.520
 diurnal on led 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.890
 In the same way we can see that 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.470
 has some new explorers that 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.960
 together they make it look more harmonious 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.570
 much more sporty we keep under 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.670
 of this capo a duratec engine 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.580
 2 liter direct injection capable of 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.490
 produce 160 horsepower 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.740
 same shape has 146 pound foot of 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.630
 torque we can also find that 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.030
 this vehicle has a powershift box 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.020
 double clutch dry and one 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.840
 functionality 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.399
 exit that precisely allows us 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.659
 handle this vehicle in a way 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.030
 sports through changes 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.159
 sequential on the subject of 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.469
 performance we can observe that behind 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.479
 this trapezoidal grille the new focus 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:05.179
 has a grid system 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.280
 active that precisely improves in the 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.989
 aerodynamic coefficient of the vehicle 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.580
 when we are driving especially 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.680
 on a highway in the same way 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.260
 we retain the vector control of 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.890
 torque that precisely gives us a better 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.410
 connection to the road and likewise 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.900
 we have the advancetrac system that 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.180
 contains improved traction control 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.420
 and also a stability control 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.489
 transitional that together allow us or 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.650
 in any field keep a 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.860
 safe path and have control 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.230
 of the vehicle at all times the new 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.209
 focus has received important changes not 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.690
 level not only at the part level 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.160
 front of the vehicle but also 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.470
 looking at the side of it 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.260
 we can see a few more lines 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.090
 pronounced that precisely improve 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.220
 this sporty aspect of the vehicle 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.129
 we also have some wheels 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.480
 with a completely renovated design and 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.370
 from the point of view of the part 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.400
 back we can observe a new 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.489
 spoiler a new clip with lines 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.830
 much more sports that flow at what 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.629
 length of the back of the vehicle 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.030
 likewise we have some stops 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.830
 a little smaller precisely for 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.080
 give that look a little more aggressive to the 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.349
 vehicle and likewise in terms of 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.420
 performance the vehicle has a 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.160
 independent rear suspension that 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.829
 precisely allows us to be 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.090
 connected to the road in a better way 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.610
 It should also be noted that this vehicle 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.319
 has a reversing camera 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.880
 this is our line top but the 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.680
 Reverse camera is in all 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.049
 the versions of it we can 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.030
 find under the logo of the same the 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.549
 new focus is not only a matter of 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.250
 design but what matters of the 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.080
 vehicle really goes inside 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.030
 as we had mentioned it counts with 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.280
 a dual-clutch powershift box 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.010
 dry also has a 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.680
 Selectshift functionality precisely 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.240
 to make manual changes for those 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.940
 people who want to drive the vehicle 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.670
 in a sporty way 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.430
 In the same way we can see that the 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.700
 seats continue with engineering in 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.400
 leather the front seats come with 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.190
 heating and similarly comes now 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.030
 with 10 electrical positions to move 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.940
 the driver's position mainly 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.370
 we can see that it has 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.250
 all electrical commands including 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.380
 the lumbar part of the seats and the 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.390
 driver in general in relation to 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.040
 connectivity system 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.110
 entertainment and information in 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.270
 general this vehicle has the 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.740
 sync connectivity system that to 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.930
 through voice commands we can 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.880
 activate several functions that are 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.070
 present in the same way 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.560
 we have myford touch that 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.270
 it is precisely a touch screen of 8 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.160
 inches in which we can find 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.900
 all the information related to the 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.030
 phone that we have synchronized in 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.360
 this moment all the information of the 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.510
 music radio entertainment in general 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.370
 the information related to the gp is 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.550
 remembering that this vehicle already brings 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:09.070
 series a navigation system and by 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.830
 last we found the information of the 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.680
 dual automatic climate control that has 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.600
 this vehicle as we can see we see two 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.460
 precisely temperature levels 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.740
 because we can configure a 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.840
 temperature for the driver's side and 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.180
 another different temperature for the side 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.310
 of the passenger this vehicle has a 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.460
 premium sound system sound 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.410
 with 10 speakers and a subwoofer that 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.650
 found in the back of it 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.270
 to amplify the basses and deliver a 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.890
 much more sound experience 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.630
 pleasurable within others 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.360
 characteristics to highlight of the new 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:46.510
 focus is that it also continues with a 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.240
 electric roof song 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.610
 which we can activate to enjoy 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.280
 either from the light or from the external environment 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.890
 when we are driving the 20 then 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.680
 good f1latam car friends this is the 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.750
 new focus ford brand banner 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.240
 worldwide that has precisely 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.250
 The most sold auto title 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.050
 of the world for three consecutive years 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:11.910
 this vehicle is going to come in two 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:15.550
 versions a powershift version from 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:17.770
 55 million 990 thousand pesos and one version 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.570
 top of line or titanium that is in the 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.940
 that we are at this moment with 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:25.810
 a launch price of 64 million 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:27.850
 990 thousand pesos we hope that this video 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.250
 the vehicle has been to your liking 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:32.290
 they will be able to know directly in the 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.560
 strength rooms nationwide from 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.700
 the month of April may also 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.160
 experience it schedule a test of 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.810
 management so they know everything that 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.610
 has to offer the new focus not 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.160
 only in terms of design but 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:48.360
 also in terms of team performance 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.360
 and security in general 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.180
 love
