00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.910
 has questions yet this is 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.040
 not today but the psychologist I find 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.120
 this digging as stressful it's 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.519
 I'm going to have to go crazy anyway I 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.049
 put my chips on something not 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.080
 it's funny when he says that I 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.699
 saw instead in the opposite angle or 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.859
 is it liberating since 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.900
 it's very healthy created as well as this 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.880
 year is the third time you 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.880
 have a new year chronicle for 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.770
 his 60 shares on the couch do not house 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.340
 in psychoanalysis from one end to the other 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.270
 position can tell who I thought 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.290
 what can i do this year 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.510
 to propose something different 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.870
 straw in the famous resolution 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.730
 churches cafes 10 goal london 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.600
 I do not hear hockey ready I'm 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.200
 I'm told it's up to us to do some 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.910
 different thing 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.289
 yeah I want to propose what we 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.930
 call the all-in do you know 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.090
 the advice yes let go a little near the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.370
 poker the setting framework sites that put everything 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.890
 what you had date according to the larousse 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.930
 there the exact definition is if you 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.790
 put all of your chips at the same 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.560
 moment you are considered to be at 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.210
 lille welcomes what it means 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.460
 it is that they mobilize all 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.770
 resources all your energy all your tone 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.530
 cards and quarter but that's ahead on 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.450
 a so this year has the word this 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.110
 that I wanted to finally invite you 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.439
 at home 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.850
 it's more like having 23 resolutions 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.170
 gavriil residents that you will not decide 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.900
 because for most of the world 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.729
 lasts from one day to three weeks 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.280
 about the average 38 and resolutions 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.000
 everything to do on the stage it when 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.130
 it's beautiful all that choose a judge 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.229
 kay just one but who is holding you 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.970
 really at heart is that the most 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.090
 important but all our energy there 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.560
 tomorrow but the first thing that I 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.270
 often talk about the game get drunk with 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.159
 home alone but take time 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.850
 to slow down to think and what is 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.500
 really important 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.990
 rather than choosing three four five 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.049
 this resolution to the birds of love 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.119
 work his job this propaganda is 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.700
 so something that really speaks 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.899
 for me it's a bit like I heard 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.469
 this season there in the mass we go in 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.270
 laugh 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.679
 if success is a bit like 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.599
 take your and that of the coast on a 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.530
 stand it's success a lot of 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.240
 people who go up to 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.459
 opi realizes once they are up 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.200
 who have one side their ladder is not 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.910
 on the wall bench it must be said 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.740
 People who lack of this is 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.900
 calls the crisis of the thirties the 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.790
 quarantine do not wait until you reach 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.520
 this is the 2015 you did the 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.430
 part the end of 2014 take it a day 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.930
 half day relax and think about what 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.300
 is really important to see 2015 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.770
 what the priority far you want 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.480
 really do it yes maybe it's not 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.739
 something grandiose and as I 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.489
 spoke month in opening to be more 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.470
 present 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.200
 sometimes it may be fair to say ok 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.670
 this year or slow down system but 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.010
 concretely it must be something 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.510
 something that needs to be measurable and calibrated 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.880
 because otherwise this shoveling life 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.820
 of clouds if it's like you say I'm 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.769
 rich because the maritime universe 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.390
 what is the answer that there is for whom 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.769
 and Richard will erase the bank then 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.660
 others to have a million more 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.670
 still to his bills and that's the 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.900
 first finally the last one too which to 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.540
 my opinion is not yet it is to have a 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.790
 full do yourself a fill in the 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.560
 military philosophy that's what it 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.310
 means concretely is that you 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.200
 prepare and anticipate the best but 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.670
 prepares for the country at the site hopes that 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.459
 the mayor is going to get ready too 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.230
 for the country a plan b a plan c a plan 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.180
 some 3 face it's working post is 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.370
 in front of a confrontation also what 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.540
 you wanted to change or risk in the beginning 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.049
 of year it does not work as if 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.780
 planned 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.549
 ok I see the supra listens but for 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.709
 finish your chronicle the I mean 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.930
 there are some who will listen to your little one 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.610
 advice because between 4 if gilbert we 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.760
 wrote on facebook she wanted her 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.350
 eat raw up to 10c by the evening I 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.750
 thought it was cool because they do not see 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.310
 as in an extreme to choose it a 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.579
 crates room of the city ate 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:57.299
 raw low voltage that separates the evening this 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:58.620
 moderate decline same theme in China with 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.640
 sure I think the biggest risk 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.410
 in life 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.070
 this not take risk his crisis 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:09.380
 what is the beginning of 2015 all kittens 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.380
 will not be back thank you david bernard
