00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
first way we're just going to go and the

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.339 
first way we're just going to go and the
first<00:00:12.240> approach<00:00:12.570> we're<00:00:12.870> just<00:00:12.990> going<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.170> just

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
first approach we're just going to just

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.079 
first approach we're just going to just
use<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.710> traditional<00:00:13.940> programs<00:00:14.940> and

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089

the<00:00:16.560> second<00:00:16.800> approach<00:00:16.890> we're<00:00:17.250> going<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.430> use<00:00:17.550> a

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
the second approach we're going to use a

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.179 
the second approach we're going to use a
more<00:00:17.789> aggressive<00:00:18.289> means<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.529> removing<00:00:20.130> it

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
more aggressive means of removing it

all right so for the first removal we

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.859 
all right so for the first removal we

second<00:03:01.280> to<00:03:01.340> restart

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
second to restart

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.490 
second to restart
they'll<00:03:02.660> start<00:03:02.930> in<00:03:02.990> the<00:03:03.050> system<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:03.380> safe

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
they'll start in the system and safe

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.750 
they'll start in the system and safe
mode<00:03:03.710> is<00:03:03.860> simply<00:03:04.130> just<00:03:04.340> pressing<00:03:04.730> the

now all right okay then I'm just going
to<00:03:14.270> select<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:14.630> safe<00:03:14.870> mode<00:03:15.080> using<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.530> arrow

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
to select the safe mode using the arrow

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:23.630

and<00:03:24.270> we'll<00:03:24.480> give<00:03:24.630> this<00:03:24.750> just<00:03:25.230> a<00:03:25.590> minute<00:03:26.100> or<00:03:26.280> two

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
and we'll give this just a minute or two

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:46.870 
and we'll give this just a minute or two
to<00:03:26.730> start<00:03:26.790> up

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.600 

this<00:03:47.570> is<00:03:47.720> a<00:03:47.750> virtual<00:03:48.110> machine<00:03:48.140> so<00:03:49.070> it's

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
this is a virtual machine so it's

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.520 
this is a virtual machine so it's
actually<00:03:49.970> astonishingly<00:03:50.720> it's<00:03:51.080> moving<00:03:51.350> just

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
actually astonishingly it's moving just

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.320 
actually astonishingly it's moving just
a<00:03:51.650> little<00:03:51.680> bit<00:03:51.950> slower<00:03:52.220> than<00:03:52.430> a<00:03:52.520> physical

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
a little bit slower than a physical

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.390 
a little bit slower than a physical
machine<00:03:53.390> would<00:03:53.780> at<00:03:53.990> this<00:03:54.710> particular<00:03:54.950> time

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
machine would at this particular time

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.320 
machine would at this particular time
but<00:03:58.400> like<00:03:58.640> I<00:03:58.670> said<00:03:58.760> it<00:03:58.880> shouldn't<00:03:59.090> take<00:03:59.120> much

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
but like I said it shouldn't take much

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:10.390 
but like I said it shouldn't take much
longer<00:03:59.570> on<00:03:59.690> the<00:04:00.430> safe<00:04:01.430> mode<00:04:02.800> load<00:04:08.980> okay<00:04:10.010> make

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
longer on the safe mode load okay make

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.370 
longer on the safe mode load okay make
it<00:04:10.520> some<00:04:10.640> progress<00:04:13.420> okay<00:04:14.420> all<00:04:15.080> right<00:04:15.110> now<00:04:15.200> we

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
it some progress okay all right now we

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.620 
it some progress okay all right now we
have<00:04:15.560> our<00:04:15.680> little<00:04:15.860> itty-bitty<00:04:16.820> tiny<00:04:17.180> screen

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
have our little itty-bitty tiny screen

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.750 
have our little itty-bitty tiny screen
the<00:04:17.810> yours<00:04:18.020> instead<00:04:18.709> of<00:04:18.980> being<00:04:19.250> real<00:04:19.460> small

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
the yours instead of being real small

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.729 
the yours instead of being real small
yours<00:04:20.000> is<00:04:20.120> probably<00:04:20.210> gonna<00:04:20.450> be<00:04:20.510> large<00:04:20.870> and<00:04:21.380> the

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
yours is probably gonna be large and the

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.710 
yours is probably gonna be large and the
icons<00:04:22.160> are<00:04:22.250> gonna<00:04:22.790> be<00:04:22.910> real<00:04:23.090> large<00:04:23.390> all<00:04:23.630> right

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
icons are gonna be real large all right

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.970 
icons are gonna be real large all right
so<00:04:23.870> that's<00:04:23.990> that's<00:04:24.260> normal<00:04:24.530> in<00:04:24.650> sake<00:04:24.770> about

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
so that's that's normal in sake about

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.890 
so that's that's normal in sake about
right<00:04:25.160> so<00:04:25.190> we<00:04:26.090> go<00:04:26.300> to<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.450> upper<00:04:26.600> right<00:04:26.750> and
