00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
so most of today's laptop are pretty

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:30.859 
so most of today's laptop are pretty
easy<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.399> open<00:01:02.940> up<00:01:03.059> now<00:01:03.470> take<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.619> off<00:01:29.869> that's

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
easy to open up now take that off that's

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.550 
easy to open up now take that off that's
the<00:01:30.930> drive<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.350> there<00:01:31.560> without<00:01:32.189> them<00:01:32.579> and

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
the drive in there without them and

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.010 
the drive in there without them and
let's<00:01:34.560> clear<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.400> away<00:01:35.579> here

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
let's clear this away here

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:51.809 
let's clear this away here
take<00:01:38.680> this<00:01:38.799> laptop<00:01:43.170> we<00:01:44.170> shall<00:01:44.380> attach<00:01:44.710> this<00:01:50.819> to

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
take this laptop we shall attach this to

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:57.779 
take this laptop we shall attach this to
the<00:01:51.909> USB<00:01:52.360> port<00:01:54.929> during<00:01:55.929> our<00:01:56.110> tests<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:57.069> free

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
the USB port during our tests the free

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.480 
the USB port during our tests the free
avira<00:01:58.420> antivir<00:01:58.709> was<00:01:59.709> extremely<00:02:00.250> effective

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
avira antivir was extremely effective

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.940 
avira antivir was extremely effective
against<00:02:01.119> malware<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:02.469> that's<00:02:02.649> what<00:02:02.829> we're

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
against malware so that's what we're

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.499 
against malware so that's what we're
going<00:02:03.039> to<00:02:03.100> use<00:02:03.310> in<00:02:03.549> the<00:02:03.610> first<00:02:03.759> assault<00:02:04.149> on<00:02:04.390> the
