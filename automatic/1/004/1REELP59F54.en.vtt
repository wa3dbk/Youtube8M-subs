00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.050
 Speak beauty with you and neither bonetti 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.920
 in the area bringing another mp here to 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.350
 you 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.620
 so as to have three and is as follows 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.020
 we're getting there with the fadi the phase already 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.150
 is in the gold camouflage 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.820
 been a while until yesterday she no longer 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.850
 they make gold I'm judging a domain 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.909
 show on map suit in farewell rhythm 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.489
 of mw3 we need now all in 

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:43.579
 expectation for the block the two are missing 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.890
 in less than 10 days still 15 days - 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.780
 depending on location not depending on where 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.530
 Do you live your game can arrive before 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.390
 after 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.819
 I am in the expectation that I who I 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.559
 take it already very close to the date 

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:57.379
 I do not know if it will be possible but anyway 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.379
 we are all in expectation and we hope 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.739
 it is a great game and right to all 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.299
 we speak here criticize die three 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.060
 of some things I already believe 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.560
 that often only when the game 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.180
 have the good points we talk about 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.910
 also respect the positive points not 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.060
 is the same as the nepal scheme that map that 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:20.060
 the term elects it is a domain in this 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.730
 map that he is already so controversial 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.800
 from mode f2 because the scheme of the 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.890
 to respond is just like the same scheme 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.890
 You leave the enemy and then the 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.650
 it's all gone and doing it anyways 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.290
 person crossing the walls is you 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.790
 can see that in this gameplay or not 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.700
 I'm playing in Paris with a disability. 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.440
 draw is not good of the miner's organ a 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.660
 traditional six versus six than 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.690
 happened in some moments you can 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.580
 see that I invaded the flag that is by 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.980
 cause of this knowing that it would have to 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.470
 exchange your backing 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.480
 do not stay that scheme of being a 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.610
 thing that is too caught up in what I know 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.120
 You do not like me very much. 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.550
 Anyway, I tried as much as possible not 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.070
 make that point rep same in paris 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.520
 you form the tripod the term rep point 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.920
 it's kind of relevant at times 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.440
 they fit into the terms that you 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.480
 they do sometimes it 's not the sport it's a lot 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.790
 different from what you think you think 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.800
 who play only one demon before 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.990
 concrete but you can not do it 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.080
 explode in various game modes and 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.800
 most advisable are neither domination 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.390
 demolition until it reaches time 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.450
 as I do not know if this is possible 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.210
 but the rest always have some scheme and 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.680
 this map has always been controversial everyone 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.690
 You know their scheme, right? 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.120
 sometimes you go into a match the 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.570
 guys busting on the way through 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.880
 for there 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.740
 the wall in olinda bombarded the flag 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.700
 I did not use to say good that this but 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.220
 Calm is coming to the cup. 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.730
 two is the hope is that the main 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:02.030
 I am well know there are well balanced 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.190
 right does not have its way no to 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.440
 to claim at least that the game is 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.440
 developed on a platform where they 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.180
 can make changes to updates 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.030
 as much as some things are 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.850
 inside the game code itself is where 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.760
 they can make these updates 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.250
 by xbox live by psn or directly 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.160
 by pc you download an update zinha 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.380
 he changes a scheme he gave so I believe 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.500
 that they are about to do something 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.480
 this type understood something that is more 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.260
 vulnerable that is more vulnerable to 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.330
 not less vulnerable to failures and 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.830
 when there is some failure a scheme 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.490
 different in something that has to 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.530
 to change 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.990
 they can fix the fastest 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.680
 possible regardless of whether you this 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:51.350
 product code is on the CD and 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.480
 on your disc in your game or if you are 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:57.140
 in a cloud is a place the ninth place 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.490
 virtual is where you have the game code 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.440
 some things like that 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.459
 We hope so very much, we have many 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.130
 expectations 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.800
 I'm playing very little is moniz 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.390
 game no dominate chan a something 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.980
 more different and tries to bring something 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.770
 different for you, right? 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.560
 the Fluminense trained strong but is 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:18.140
 really is well paced even fired from 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.140
 module was to train maybe I continue 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.040
 with a rpg at least not to be without 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.180
 videos none 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.070
 at least another water and energy to 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.560
 You and I hope you are 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.170
 also enjoying RPG that you evaluate 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.050
 You too, let's say it. 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:35.720
 as soon as you let the attention of 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.950
 you in the videos in question to watch 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.290
 The whole video that I'm bringing to 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.810
 you longer longer videos like 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.580
 You ask but then this is it folks 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.350
 I think I'm going to say goodbye to you. 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.720
 So I hope you guys really have 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.570
 enjoying this dominant game player in 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.540
 The map ends and your 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:56.030
 evaluation its like on your favorite and me
