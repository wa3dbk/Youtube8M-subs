to<00:01:12.750> some<00:01:13.080> skin<00:01:13.260> was<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.500> star<00:01:13.710> Bigfoot<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.250> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
to some skin was to star Bigfoot and the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.580 
to some skin was to star Bigfoot and the
pace<00:01:14.700> yeah<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:15.689> just<00:01:15.930> kinda<00:01:16.259> better<00:01:16.409> than

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590
