00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.690
 cycling around the city is a 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.270
 challenge are missing bike paths and there 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.370
 disrespect on the part of drivers 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.830
 after being hit by a cyclist of 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.740
 victory decided to record the 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.289
 spends every day in traffic more than 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.029
 alerting the videos serve to educate 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.949
 drivers 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.050
 the video posted yesterday on the 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.570
 relationships has already had more 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.180
 of two thousand hits is a discussion 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.620
 between a rider and a driver who 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.620
 Send a bike to the sidewalk. 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.620
 the discussion happened here in this stretch 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.870
 of the saturnino avenue of brito on the beach 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.390
 of the corner and really in that 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.850
 Valentine's Square has no bike path 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.890
 in which case the traffic code says that 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.060
 the cyclist should not share space with 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.430
 the pedestrians 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.119
 he must move on the right track 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.130
 track 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.740
 it was this university who made the video 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.080
 a year ago rafael fell in love with 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.479
 cycling one day was hit by a 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.300
 car and decided to put a camera in the 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.670
 helmet to record all the grips 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.539
 passing through traffic he puts everything in the 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.580
 Internet 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:30.729
 cars do not usually stop for 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.490
 A cyclist and a lot of people get on thin 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.310
 well on the side of the bicycle is that most 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.440
 of drivers do not know what the 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.780
 traffic code the driver must 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.910
 keep a meter and a half away from 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.649
 to overtake a cyclist because what if the 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.840
 writing resources is vulnerable I do not have 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.640
 a steel box outside of it to cimpor 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.009
 back then if we find a 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.080
 hole something we have to have 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.179
 a space to be able to divert 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.399
 driver does not hit people like the 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.500
 drivers do not usually respect the law 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.080
 There are people who prefer to ride a bicycle. 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.819
 on the same sidewalk he brought there is no way 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.520
 we walk there in the middle I do not see 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.790
 many cyclists being coerced and 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.580
 so in a 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.770
 Do not pedal, not because you do not know the 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.930
 that the bicycle can walk on the street but 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.480
 Yes, because they tried once and the 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.250
 cars do not respect bus coach is the 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.440
 that gives more fear goes very close and 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.900
 Agent any imbalance goes away 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.120
 under the bus wheel and can 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.830
 die with the videos on the internet rafael 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.960
 intends to disclose traffic laws 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.940
 to improve the coexistence between 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.300
 cyclists and drivers 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.820
 the purpose of the videos is to raise 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.800
 people understood the leonardo who is also 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.500
 I think the solution to this 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.590
 between cyclists and drivers is the 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.620
 construction of bicycle paths are very few 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.390
 and they are fragmented ie she has a 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.000
 course suddenly changes for a 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.730
 sidewalk then confuses the rider and 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.130
 confuses the pds there was already a bike path and 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.090
 asked the pavement has no points 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.620
 passage 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.840
 unfortunately this is the reality of 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.739
 public mobility in victory 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.750
 that's it the car the victory has 29 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.850
 kilometers of bike path to the city hall 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.860
 hopes to create new clues in the 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.519
 years with the expansion of the main 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.519
 avenues of the municipality
