off<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.079> little<00:00:43.670> so<00:00:44.670> what<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:44.940> could<00:00:45.180> do<00:00:45.329> with<00:00:45.360> it

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
off a little so what I could do with it

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.410 
off a little so what I could do with it
as<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:46.680> see<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:46.920> have<00:00:47.100> my<00:00:47.219> g53<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.329> I've

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
as you can see I have my g53 that I've

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.389 
as you can see I have my g53 that I've
got<00:00:48.570> recently<00:00:48.840> but<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.530> bought<00:00:49.770> forever<00:00:50.129> as

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
got recently but I bought forever as

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.529 
got recently but I bought forever as
well<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:53.690> with<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:56.070> added<00:00:56.760> my<00:00:56.940> repetame

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
well and with that I I added my repetame

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.990 
well and with that I I added my repetame
red<00:00:57.750> dot<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.710> really<00:00:58.980> helped<00:00:59.309> varying<00:00:59.789> in

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
red dot so it really helped varying in

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.970 
red dot so it really helped varying in
this<00:01:00.149> case<00:01:00.359> at<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.050> beginning<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.530> used<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.859> bit

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
this case at the beginning I used a bit

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.160 
this case at the beginning I used a bit
of<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.160> bust<00:01:02.399> because<00:01:02.760> Everest<00:01:03.449> really<00:01:03.870> helps

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
of a bust because Everest really helps

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.980 
of a bust because Everest really helps
and<00:01:05.330> yeah<00:01:07.880> he<00:01:08.880> was<00:01:09.000> quite<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> few<00:01:09.479> things<00:01:09.720> and

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990

I do often what I do is I combine the my
RPG<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.869> do<00:01:22.710> most<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.369> damage<00:01:23.520> move<00:01:23.880> my

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.140 
RPG and then I finish him off whether
the<00:01:26.460> g53<00:01:27.119> which<00:01:27.299> usually<00:01:27.509> works<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.850> yeah<00:01:29.850> so

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
the g53 which usually works and yeah so

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.730 
the g53 which usually works and yeah so
it's<00:01:30.630> really<00:01:30.810> cool<00:01:31.049> because<00:01:31.110> nobody<00:01:31.619> can

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
it's really cool because nobody can

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.100 
it's really cool because nobody can
really<00:01:31.950> see<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.490> there<00:01:33.450> was<00:01:33.570> at<00:01:33.750> one<00:01:33.780> moment
