00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.289 
down those killstreaks pretty quickly so
I'm<00:01:49.560> not<00:01:49.680> too<00:01:49.740> worried<00:01:50.100> about<00:01:50.130> those<00:01:50.549> I'd

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
I'm not too worried about those I'd

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.050 
I'm not too worried about those I'd
rather<00:01:51.509> not<00:01:52.020> see<00:01:52.380> them<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:53.189> competitive

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
rather not see them in the competitive

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.910 
rather not see them in the competitive
rule<00:01:54.270> set<00:01:54.509> though<00:01:54.689> because<00:01:54.930> it's<00:01:55.409> not<00:01:55.560> really

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
rule set though because it's not really

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.130 
rule set though because it's not really
based<00:01:56.070> on<00:01:56.310> your<00:01:56.609> score<00:01:57.000> streaks<00:01:57.359> like<00:01:57.509> like<00:01:57.990> it

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
based on your score streaks like like it

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.529 
based on your score streaks like like it
is<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.320> black<00:01:58.409> ops<00:01:58.680> 2<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.880> only<00:02:00.149> based<00:02:00.359> on

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
is in black ops 2 it's only based on

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.499 
is in black ops 2 it's only based on
kills<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.229> without<00:02:01.920> having<00:02:02.369> an<00:02:02.520> incentive<00:02:03.479> to

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
kills so without having an incentive to

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.910 
kills so without having an incentive to
do<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.899> objective<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.530> don't<00:02:04.679> think

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
do the objective I don't think

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.529 
do the objective I don't think
killstreaks<00:02:05.429> should<00:02:05.640> really<00:02:05.909> be<00:02:06.090> in<00:02:06.179> the<00:02:06.299> game

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
killstreaks should really be in the game

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.890 
is in every other call of duty having it
in<00:03:14.189> a<00:03:14.280> different<00:03:14.519> area<00:03:14.849> just<00:03:15.329> doesn't<00:03:15.720> seem<00:03:15.810> to

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
in a different area just doesn't seem to

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.780 
in a different area just doesn't seem to

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
know very similar I don't see why that

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.089 
know very similar I don't see why that
was<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.760> necessary<00:03:21.299> change<00:03:21.690> so<00:03:21.930> if<00:03:22.049> we<00:03:22.290> take<00:03:22.530> our

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
was a necessary change so if we take our

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.539 
was a necessary change so if we take our
feedback<00:03:23.579> and<00:03:23.940> change<00:03:24.299> it<00:03:24.449> back<00:03:24.599> to<00:03:24.629> where<00:03:25.379> it

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
feedback and change it back to where it

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.539 
feedback and change it back to where it
originally<00:03:26.549> was<00:03:27.019> anyways<00:03:28.019> there's<00:03:28.650> also

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
originally was anyways there's also

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.250 
originally was anyways there's also
something<00:03:29.940> else<00:03:30.150> I'm<00:03:30.359> excited<00:03:30.870> about<00:03:31.049> they

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
something else I'm excited about they

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.689 
something else I'm excited about they
