00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.830
 and hello to all and there you have 3 and 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.470
 listen I find you for a 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.340
 new little video of tips in the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:24.750
 game raider fall so we're at 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.670
 mountain temple so who is the 3rd 4th 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.250
 campfire if I do not talk nonsense 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:35.460
 and we are going to do the little challenge 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.809
 arsonists so once again if I 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.040
 pass on that pyromaniac what I 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.120
 not understand is that I actually come 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.780
 to do a little tour of the area 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.309
 quickly to remember where were the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.410
 different things to collect and 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.789
 see I have one in five but what I 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.110
 understand not that I found 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.850
 5 on the map 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.559
 so good we'll see what happens 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.340
 but by and large I'll be able to 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.230
 give the 5 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.649
 so sometimes what is difficult in 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.239
 these challenges is knowing what is needed 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.250
 break because it's not embedded 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.589
 and it's for completely obvious so 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.710
 in this case there is that it is these 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.220
 species of lanterns so see there I 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.990
 have 2 of 5 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.760
 you have one so the fault room 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.080
 when it's the cabin that's right in 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.220
 below no problem on it 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.409
 you have one here so see this 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.320
 actually 3 there may be more 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.409
 that maybe more than it takes 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.820
 break so I do not really know why 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.500
 it's pretty strange where we will play all 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.100
 you show them like that there will not be 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.720
 no worries to make this challenge so 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.900
 you pass you have one there behind 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.159
 the cavalry is there so I have 4 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.899
 we have seen the bar 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.219
 fadi if I can not shoot him 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.460
 but we wanted to go around for you 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:51.460
 show where he is stupidly 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.289
 so there's still 2 so that's 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.659
 weird why I had one and that 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.369
 still has two to destroy it's a small 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.890
 little wonder is there any 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.990
 more than 5 is what it takes 5 to 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.759
 minimum 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.649
 I do not know this area well this is 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.479
 so small that they are still 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.789
 easy enough to find see you in 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:15.190
 have a haro so there normally 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:18.069
 should close would have the challenge but you 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.620
 have another one another another one 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:24.430
 order to the scion goes down there you have it 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.410
 also one there eventually they can 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.319
 set fire to your enemies 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.209
 so see it for once I had 6 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.849
 and I think in the area and bah they 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.950
 are all there quoirin quite stupid so 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.510
 the device finally bleeds a whole 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.840
 little video to show you where they 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.560
 are they are not complicated to find 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.430
 in this area 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.950
 it's just that here you have to know 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.829
 what to destroy simply 27 that's 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.139
 the more the complexity of this stuff 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.389
 is going to be that and nothing else 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:57.190
 and then I listened here is tiny 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:03:00.280
 2 minute video and wheelbarrows and 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.980
 low and that's great here I have you 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:07.299
 shown how to do the pyromaniac challenge and 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.730
 I'll go to the next video while 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:13.019
 just so if I redo I 'm going 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.019
 take a minute to make a point 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:17.139
 like that we'll see what's not 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.049
 toothache my game turn a lot of 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:21.730
 challenges that I did not have all the facts 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.010
 see here you are completely then 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.380
 that one poaching nets too 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.419
 well, of course I'm going to redo 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.829
 a turn on my side for good finally for 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:32.349
 try one more time to make 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.389
 fast videos and not go around in circles and 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.340
 I'm going to record this because I 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.169
 here it is it is it is complicated 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.150
 see I'm 0 out of 5 so I could 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:42.639
 everything I wanted to show at once what 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.220
 is I think rather a very good thing 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.810
 here we are hoping hoping we talk 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.269
 always like you like it 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.269
 I'll see you soon and hi
