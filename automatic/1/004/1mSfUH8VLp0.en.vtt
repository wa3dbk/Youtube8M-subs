00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
just get away and craft in a tree you

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.670 
just get away and craft in a tree you
can<00:00:35.329> easily<00:00:35.570> fly<00:00:35.720> into<00:00:35.960> a<00:00:35.989> tree<00:00:36.230> which<00:00:36.410> is<00:00:36.440> why

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
can easily fly into a tree which is why

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.170 
can easily fly into a tree which is why
you<00:00:36.739> should<00:00:36.829> stay<00:00:37.040> in<00:00:37.160> a<00:00:37.280> swamp<00:00:37.640> biome<00:00:37.970> or<00:00:38.149> a

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
trees this kid is really great for

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.599 
trees this kid is really great for
taking<00:00:42.289> down<00:00:42.320> people<00:00:42.710> who<00:00:42.859> are<00:00:42.980> camping<00:00:43.489> in

towers<00:00:44.000> like<00:00:44.120> this<00:00:44.180> guy<00:00:44.480> because<00:00:45.379> you<00:00:45.859> can

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
towers like this guy because you can

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.259 
towers like this guy because you can
just<00:00:46.010> fly<00:00:46.309> up<00:00:46.340> to<00:00:46.489> them<00:00:46.730> using<00:00:46.940> your<00:00:47.059> feather

00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:47.269

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
now it's not like fly hacks it's not

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:50.680 
now it's not like fly hacks it's not
very<00:00:49.219> fast<00:00:49.550> and<00:00:49.850> it<00:00:49.969> is<00:00:50.090> a<00:00:50.120> bit<00:00:50.329> difficult<00:00:50.510> to

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
very fast and it is a bit difficult to

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.840 
very fast and it is a bit difficult to
get<00:00:50.870> going<00:00:51.050> but<00:00:51.320> once<00:00:51.500> you<00:00:51.649> are<00:00:51.800> it's<00:00:52.429> pretty

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
get going but once you are it's pretty

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.819 
get going but once you are it's pretty
easy<00:00:53.030> it<00:00:53.539> doesn't<00:00:54.289> seem<00:00:54.379> like<00:00:54.440> a<00:00:54.589> long<00:00:54.769> time

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
easy it doesn't seem like a long time

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.049 
easy it doesn't seem like a long time
and<00:00:55.219> you<00:00:55.280> seem<00:00:55.460> like<00:00:55.550> you're<00:00:55.699> going<00:00:55.789> to<00:00:55.850> fall

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
and you seem like you're going to fall

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.520 
and you seem like you're going to fall
in<00:00:56.300> that<00:00:56.329> period<00:00:56.660> of<00:00:56.780> time<00:00:57.019> but<00:00:57.230> it's<00:00:57.379> actually

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
in that period of time but it's actually

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.930 
in that period of time but it's actually
longer<00:00:57.800> than<00:00:57.980> you'd<00:00:58.190> expect<00:00:58.579> it<00:00:58.730> to<00:00:58.820> be

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
longer than you'd expect it to be

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.459 
longer than you'd expect it to be
whenever<00:00:59.179> you're<00:00:59.420> flying<00:00:59.660> through<00:01:00.320> running

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
whenever you're flying through running

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:01.959

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
away from a team you can fly into a tree

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:03.849 
away from a team you can fly into a tree
but<00:01:02.629> there<00:01:02.870> is<00:01:02.989> a<00:01:03.019> kit<00:01:03.260> that<00:01:03.289> counters<00:01:03.710> this

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859 
but there is a kit that counters this

good kid and a lot of fun to use it's
not<00:05:52.650> extremely<00:05:53.039> good<00:05:53.250> because<00:05:53.490> whenever

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
not extremely good because whenever

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.610 
not extremely good because whenever
you're<00:05:53.939> going<00:05:54.210> to<00:05:54.330> hit<00:05:54.419> the<00:05:54.479> ground<00:05:54.750> you<00:05:55.469> can

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
you're going to hit the ground you can

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.350 
you're going to hit the ground you can
still<00:05:55.830> die<00:05:56.219> by<00:05:56.520> barely<00:05:56.939> hitting<00:05:57.120> the<00:05:57.240> ground

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
still die by barely hitting the ground

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.879 
still die by barely hitting the ground
two<00:05:57.569> blocks<00:05:57.810> which<00:05:58.020> is<00:05:58.139> really<00:05:58.349> annoying<00:05:58.590> it

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
two blocks which is really annoying it

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:00.320 
two blocks which is really annoying it
makes<00:05:59.039> it<00:05:59.159> hard<00:05:59.310> to<00:05:59.400> take<00:05:59.580> down<00:05:59.699> tower<00:06:00.000> teams

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
makes it hard to take down tower teams

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.050 
makes it hard to take down tower teams
and<00:06:00.599> the<00:06:01.259> 60<00:06:01.800> second<00:06:02.129> cooldown<00:06:02.310> is<00:06:02.460> how<00:06:02.909> much

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
and the 60 second cooldown is how much

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.029 
and the 60 second cooldown is how much
you<00:06:03.240> need<00:06:03.419> but<00:06:04.020> it<00:06:04.080> really<00:06:04.229> makes<00:06:04.469> it<00:06:04.680> hard<00:06:04.919> to

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 
you need but it really makes it hard to
