00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.560
 Hello everyone! Today I want to talk about the car engine. 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.350
 I think for most people 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.800
 This is just reviewing knowledge but I hope this video can help 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.840
 People who are interested in car first understand the basic principles of car operation 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.690
 So I want to start with the car engine and his working principle. 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.420
 First I will outline 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.789
 These parts in the engine then talk about how they work together 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.850
 The top is the fuel injector that sprays fuel to the intake pipe. 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.410
 This is the camshaft 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.820
 Intake and exhaust valves for controlling cylinders 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.040
 This rocker arm is connected to the camshaft valve 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.250
 The switches of these valves control the ingress and egress of gases 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.920
 The two sides of the valve control the intake and exhaust respectively. This is the cylinder. 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.090
 Usually speaking v6 v8 means 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.430
 There are 6 or 8 such cylinders in the engine. 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.219
 This is the movement of the piston in the up and down direction. 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.829
 This up and down movement is transformed into the horizontal movement of the car. 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.950
 This is the connecting rod connecting the piston and the crankshaft 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.259
 We already have a connecting crankshaft to 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.469
 In the engine, the crankshaft is connected to a plurality of such pistons to provide torque 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:20.729
 This is a spark plug used to ignite the injected oil and gas mixture. 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.429
 In this video 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:26.920
 I will be the most common in the United States. 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.249
 Four-stroke cylinder as an example 

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:33.479
 Explain how it works 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.539
 Four strokes 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.639
 I will explain the first one by one. 

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:43.029
 Is the suction stroke at this time, this outlet valve 

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:48.029
 The closed camshaft will rotate to this side 

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:53.989
 Compress the spring and open the intake valve 

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:58.139
 When the intake valve is opened, the piston is at the top and ready 

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:05.139
 Downward movement, when moving down, will draw the oil and gas mixture into the cylinder 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.780
 Oil and gas mixture comes from injector and intake manifold 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.689
 This is the first step to mix the oil and gas into the cylinder. 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.870
 At this point the piston reaches the bottom 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.349
 The next step is that the intake air outlet valve will close when the compression stroke is compressed. 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.260
 The camshaft will go to the position where the valve is not open on either side 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.319
 This bulge rotates along the cam axis only when the camshaft is turned 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.989
 The valve will open when pointing to the position of these valves so two valves at this time 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.989
 Both closed pistons are compressed at the bottom 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.560
 The piston will move upwards to compress the cylinder block 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.560
 The next step in the oil and gas mixture is the power stroke 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:06.859
 When the piston reaches the top, the spark plug ignites a small explosion 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:13.799
 Push the piston back to the bottom 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.859
 Now this part is exhaust gas oxygen is exhausted 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:24.359
 If the combustion effect is good, there is no oxygen present here. 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:29.760
 This part of the gas camshaft turns to this side 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.670
 Squeeze the rocker arm to open the exhaust valve when the piston moves up 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:41.670
 Exhaust gas is discharged from the exhaust pipe. This is the last step. 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.319
 Fast over the intake stroke, the piston moves downwards to draw in the oil and gas mixture 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.310
 Compression stroke piston compression oil and gas mixture 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.279
 Power strokes to ignite oil and gas mixtures in a small space 

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:02.510
 Push the piston down to provide torque to the crankshaft 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.239
 Finally, the piston moves upward to exhaust the exhaust gas. 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:14.150
 This process is repeated 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.489
 Look at this picture two cylinders connected to the crankshaft 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.960
 After the torque on the crankshaft? 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.060
 Torque will drive the flywheel connected to the crankshaft 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.150
 The rotational momentum of the flywheel keeps the engine running smoothly if it is a manual transmission flywheel and clutch connection 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.759
 If it is an automatic transmission flywheel and a torque converter connection 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:46.310
 Then the torque is transmitted to the manual or automatic transmission 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.889
 Gears in the gearbox for shifting torque and finally through the drive shaft 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:58.080
 Passed to the differential torque through the differential 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.120
 Being divided into left and right wheels may be 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.050
 The front wheel may also be the rear wheel. In this picture, I put him in the rear wheel. 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.960
 Is the rear wheel drive torque finally transmitted to the wheel 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.910
 Driving the wheel to drive the car forward is the basic principle of the car engine 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:23.210
 Every part I just mentioned has a topic to explain in depth. 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.849
 To help you better understand but in general 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:32.460
 It’s very helpful to understand how these components work. 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.789
 You can learn more about the clutch torque converter gearbox. 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:42.940
 Flywheel engine suspension system, etc. 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.419
 This is the first lesson if you understand these 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:53.599
 Then I suggest you take a look. 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:59.129
