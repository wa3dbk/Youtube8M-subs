00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
use quick-release personally I prefer a

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.729 
use quick-release personally I prefer a
slow<00:01:02.489> release<00:01:02.699> fertilizer<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:04.379> let's<00:01:04.589> say

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
slow release fertilizer so let's say

slow release fertilizer so let's say
your<00:01:04.920> peonies<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.519> blooming<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.390> late<00:01:06.600> spring

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
your peonies is blooming in late spring

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.690 
your peonies is blooming in late spring
something<00:01:07.470> along<00:01:07.770> those<00:01:07.950> lines<00:01:08.130> then<00:01:08.549> you

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
something along those lines then you

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.490 
something along those lines then you
would<00:01:08.850> have<00:01:08.909> fertilized<00:01:09.540> with<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:10.200> slow

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
would have fertilized with a slow

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.980 
would have fertilized with a slow
release<00:01:10.680> fertilizer<00:01:11.400> at<00:01:11.610> least<00:01:11.820> 2025<00:01:12.659> days

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
release fertilizer at least 2025 days

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.109 
release fertilizer at least 2025 days
before<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:14.189> way<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.490> fertilizer<00:01:14.970> is

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
before that that way the fertilizer is

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.969 
before that that way the fertilizer is
in<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.390> ground<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.259> plant<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.650> pulling

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
in the ground and the plant is pulling

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.030 
in the ground and the plant is pulling
it<00:01:17.070> up<00:01:17.509> very<00:01:18.509> easy<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.140> apply<00:01:21.680> around<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> drip

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
it up very easy to apply around the drip

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.249 
it up very easy to apply around the drip
line<00:01:23.070> which<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.970> as<00:01:24.119> far<00:01:24.360> as<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.689> leaves<00:01:24.900> come

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
line which is as far as the leaves come

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.410 
line which is as far as the leaves come
from<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.650> edge<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.070> plant<00:01:28.729> each<00:01:29.729> bag<00:01:30.240> of

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
from the edge of the plant each bag of

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.690 
from the edge of the plant each bag of
fertilizer<00:01:30.600> will<00:01:31.259> have<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> prescribed<00:01:32.159> dose

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
fertilizer will have a prescribed dose

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.660 
fertilizer will have a prescribed dose
on<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.509> how<00:01:33.780> big<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.140> plant<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.680> alias<00:01:35.460> how

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
on it so how big the plant is alias how

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.359 
on it so how big the plant is alias how
many<00:01:35.869> teaspoonfuls<00:01:36.869> or<00:01:37.170> tablespoonfuls<00:01:38.100> are

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
many teaspoonfuls or tablespoonfuls are

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.280 
many teaspoonfuls or tablespoonfuls are
fertilizing<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.329> put<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.990> can<00:01:40.140> also

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
fertilizing you put on it you can also

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.100 
fertilizing you put on it you can also
use<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.920> much<00:01:41.430> faster<00:01:41.729> acting<00:01:42.090> fertilizer<00:01:42.840> that

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
use a much faster acting fertilizer that

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.990 
use a much faster acting fertilizer that
would<00:01:43.229> be<00:01:43.350> water<00:01:43.560> soluble<00:01:44.159> which<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.820> put

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
would be water soluble which you put

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.639 
would be water soluble which you put
straight<00:01:45.329> into<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.689> ground<00:01:45.899> using<00:01:46.439> a

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
straight into the ground using a

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.620 
straight into the ground using a
watering<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.159> it's<00:01:47.640> very<00:01:47.909> simple<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.570> you

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
watering can it's very simple and you

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.420 
watering can it's very simple and you
could<00:01:48.930> be<00:01:49.020> rewarded<00:01:49.560> with<00:01:49.590> great<00:01:49.890> plants

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
could be rewarded with great plants

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.870 
could be rewarded with great plants
okay<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.840> trimming<00:01:52.380> your<00:01:53.100> plants<00:01:53.579> are<00:01:53.670> growing

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
okay so trimming your plants are growing

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.670 
okay so trimming your plants are growing
beautifully<00:01:54.479> but<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:54.990> just<00:01:55.259> need<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.560> do<00:01:55.649> a

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
beautifully but you just need to do a

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.410 
beautifully but you just need to do a
little<00:01:55.920> trimming<00:01:56.250> getting<00:01:56.909> off<00:01:57.000> some<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.360> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
little trimming getting off some of the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.350 
little trimming getting off some of the
deadheads<00:01:57.630> it's<00:01:58.140> easily<00:01:58.560> done<00:01:59.060> first<00:02:00.060> thing

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360
