00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.200 
hour sessions or if it didn't if it
didn't<00:00:54.899> then<00:00:55.559> we're<00:00:55.770> all<00:00:55.920> set<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.489> we

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
didn't then we're all set and we

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.290 
didn't then we're all set and we

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
probably want the evening otherwise we

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.750 
probably want the evening otherwise we
could<00:01:00.510> drop<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.960> like<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.649> don't<00:01:02.039> know<00:01:02.129> twelve

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
could drop I like I don't know twelve

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.120 
could drop I like I don't know twelve
percent<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.750> ten<00:01:04.110> percent<00:01:06.439> and<00:01:07.439> then

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
percent of ten percent and then

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.560 
percent of ten percent and then
woodcutting<00:01:08.750> we<00:01:09.750> got<00:01:09.990> 3rd<00:01:10.409> or<00:01:10.590> 4th<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.570> that

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
woodcutting we got 3rd or 4th and that

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.090 
woodcutting we got 3rd or 4th and that
depends<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.110> how<00:01:13.500> our<00:01:13.530> max<00:01:14.040> did<00:01:15.770> we<00:01:16.770> could<00:01:16.979> have

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
depends on how our max did we could have

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.679 
depends on how our max did we could have
gotten<00:01:17.310> higher<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.180> if<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:18.840> had<00:01:19.229> all<00:01:19.680> 3

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
gotten higher on that if we had all 3

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.600 
gotten higher on that if we had all 3
M&amp;R<00:01:21.689> three<00:01:21.900> we<00:01:22.770> had<00:01:22.920> all<00:01:23.130> ten<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.430> our

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
M&amp;R three we had all ten of our

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.880 
M&amp;R three we had all ten of our
participants<00:01:23.759> with<00:01:24.540> primal<00:01:24.990> hatchets<00:01:25.409> only

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
participants with primal hatchets only

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.440 
participants with primal hatchets only
two<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.189> them<00:01:26.340> actually<00:01:26.520> had<00:01:26.729> finals<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
two of them actually had finals the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.730 
two of them actually had finals the
other<00:01:27.600> he<00:01:27.900> had<00:01:28.170> for<00:01:28.500> me<00:01:28.650> fumes<00:01:30.350> so<00:01:31.350> like<00:01:31.500> a

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
other he had for me fumes so like a

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.850 
other he had for me fumes so like a
grateful<00:01:32.220> woodcutting<00:01:32.700> was<00:01:33.560> it<00:01:34.560> was<00:01:34.710> like

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
grateful woodcutting was it was like

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.780 
grateful woodcutting was it was like
estimated<00:01:35.850> 18<00:01:36.390> 1k<00:01:36.930> per<00:01:37.290> hour<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.189> then<00:01:38.400> I

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
estimated 18 1k per hour and then I

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.200 
estimated 18 1k per hour and then I
ready<00:01:39.090> for<00:01:39.299> agility<00:01:39.600> was<00:01:39.990> anywhere<00:01:40.770> between

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
ready for agility was anywhere between

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.700 
ready for agility was anywhere between
basically<00:01:42.210> anyone<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.950> deadly<00:01:44.420> 1300<00:01:45.420> and

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
basically anyone this deadly 1300 and

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:53.960 
basically anyone this deadly 1300 and
then<00:01:47.990> thieving<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.290> should<00:01:49.560> be<00:01:50.600> 280<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:52.939> yeah<00:01:53.939> I

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
then thieving it should be 280 to yeah I

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.510 
then thieving it should be 280 to yeah I
think<00:01:54.270> it's<00:01:54.450> 280<00:01:54.890> 2.2<00:01:55.890> k<00:01:56.990> now<00:01:57.990> 283<00:01:58.439> yeah<00:01:59.100> 280

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
think it's 280 2.2 k now 283 yeah 280

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.749 
think it's 280 2.2 k now 283 yeah 280
3.2<00:02:00.030> k<00:02:00.240> actually<00:02:00.840> per<00:02:00.990> hour<00:02:01.140> assuming<00:02:01.890> we

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
3.2 k actually per hour assuming we

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.700 
3.2 k actually per hour assuming we
don't<00:02:02.880> drop<00:02:03.149> by<00:02:03.299> like<00:02:03.420> ten<00:02:03.659> percent

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
don't drop by like ten percent

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.650 
don't drop by like ten percent
and<00:02:05.750> all<00:02:06.750> together<00:02:07.080> we<00:02:07.970> have<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.119> closed<00:02:09.360> like

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
and all together we have it closed like

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.610 
and all together we have it closed like
180<00:02:10.380> k<00:02:10.770> per<00:02:11.069> hour<00:02:11.900> and<00:02:12.900> then<00:02:13.110> that's<00:02:13.290> the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
180 k per hour and then that's the

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.770 
180 k per hour and then that's the
number<00:02:13.890> they<00:02:14.010> will<00:02:14.190> use<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.790> determine<00:02:15.270> which

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
number they will use to determine which

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.040 
number they will use to determine which
clan<00:02:16.170> is<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:17.000> number<00:02:18.000> one<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.330> stuff<00:02:18.569> for<00:02:18.990> a

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
clan is a number one and stuff for a

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.030 
clan is a number one and stuff for a
number<00:02:19.230> two<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.709> whatever<00:02:19.890> number<00:02:20.400> three<00:02:20.580> so

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
number two of whatever number three so

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.610 
number two of whatever number three so
178<00:02:23.040> 179<00:02:23.730> 180k<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.480> spot<00:02:25.050> where<00:02:25.290> we'll<00:02:25.500> be

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
178 179 180k a spot where we'll be

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.800 
178 179 180k a spot where we'll be
around<00:02:27.680> and<00:02:28.680> we'll<00:02:29.010> see<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:30.120> top

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
around and we'll see a the top

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.199 
around and we'll see a the top
competition<00:02:31.200> are<00:02:32.330> divination<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.720> fabrice

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
competition are divination and a fabrice

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.540 
competition are divination and a fabrice
and<00:02:36.209> then<00:02:36.810> possibly<00:02:37.140> max<00:02:37.709> I<00:02:38.040> have<00:02:38.130> no<00:02:38.250> idea<00:02:38.370> how

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
and then possibly max I have no idea how

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.390 
and then possibly max I have no idea how
I<00:02:38.670> max<00:02:39.120> is<00:02:39.360> doing<00:02:39.540> because<00:02:39.810> they<00:02:40.260> just<00:02:40.470> did<00:02:41.280> not

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
I max is doing because they just did not

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.000 
I max is doing because they just did not
telling<00:02:41.730> us<00:02:41.850> I'm<00:02:42.150> not<00:02:42.239> telling<00:02:42.540> anybody<00:02:43.010> but
