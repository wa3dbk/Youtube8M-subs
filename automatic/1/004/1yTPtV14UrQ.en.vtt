00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.959
 unusually then we will look at the calendar 

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:08.980
 increase the capacity of the target which is in the factory 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.790
 pawa companies we have several 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.699
 samples often they also see 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:17.480
 so we have here because it is 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.419
 Japanese are being treated and design 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:22.909
 since we asked these standards to replace 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:26.359
 1400 UAH 5 hours increased and has 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.220
 now is 5 hours 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.669
 and so sorry 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.160
 it is before our eyes of tourists 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.399
 in samsung galaxy s and galaxy y 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.960
 respectively, and the standard me 3500 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.399
 meter hours rights increased also 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:40.229
 a thousand 

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:41.979
 hours of course the most important question 

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:42.550
 which the 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.410
 I want to ask her here and how 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.640
 things are going on 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.270
 how effective such meetings are 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.330
 are needed 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.190
 and just say that 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.050
 while working on a single charge 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.940
 increases but with active 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.469
 using let's say for an hour maybe 3 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.090
 after 3 4 3 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.580
 from usually calm use he 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.090
 maybe even for a longer period 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.440
 increase the life 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.649
 and your phone with this new 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:08.680
 batteries 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.210
 but there is also an interesting thing 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.580
 which we want to show is such 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.420
 super batteries 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.899
 here she goes along with the cover 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:18.430
 This is a battery for 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.960
 and chelsea ashley cole means 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.680
 as well as such a very vacationer 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.770
 more than twice as thick as standard and 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.859
 her family is also more than twice 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:31.029
 exceeds standard fare three 

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:32.640
 thousands of years guests 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.880
 we change 5 hours which is generally very decent 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.000
 let's try to become 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.680
 let's see it all together be highlighted 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.780
 exhibited quite ordinary and 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.510
 deadlock is closed only as you see here 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.930
 some free remains 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.920
 space that you can remember 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.880
 you can do anything on your own 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.650
 make the road but still it is 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.540
 solution for lovers to talk a for those 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.510
 who wants to kill moles 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.360
 way and i percent why not care about 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.350
 that is why the date might lose a 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.680
 to discharge 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.790
 the plot is quietly big enough 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.349
 accurate powerful 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.950
 and surround but i must say iphone bridges 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.639
 overall so increased in 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:14.969
 end up 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.479
 but it is quite possible then but as for 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:20.419
 laugh postal is very passive 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:21.799
 that is, accordingly the penalty 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.109
 their speaker holes 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:27.900
 have to work calm 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.780
 batteries of increased capacity 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.220
 from the company Henkel scores there is so 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.639
 can't 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:36.769
 standard 1600 meters what is it all the same 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.319
 very small 3200 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.860
 safron registration 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.180
 mobile phone in the project which 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.680
