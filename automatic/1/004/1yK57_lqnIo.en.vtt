00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
do I mean I thought that they would

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.880 
do I mean I thought that they would
probably<00:01:41.640> dominate<00:01:42.450> NC<00:01:42.869> State<00:01:43.170> but<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.470> was<00:01:43.619> an

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
probably dominate NC State but it was an

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.030 
probably dominate NC State but it was an
NC<00:01:44.220> State<00:01:44.549> up<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.630> but<00:01:46.049> it's<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.500> tough<00:01:46.740> when

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
NC State up and but it's it's tough when

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.380 
NC State up and but it's it's tough when
you<00:01:47.159> play<00:01:47.340> one<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.579> those<00:01:47.790> schools<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.210> you

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
you play one of those schools that you

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.780 
you play one of those schools that you
play<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.659> lot<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.170> it's<00:01:49.680> like<00:01:49.770> when<00:01:50.100> Duke<00:01:50.430> goes

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
play a lot it's it's like when Duke goes

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.700 
play a lot it's it's like when Duke goes
and<00:01:51.060> loses<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.600> like<00:01:51.750> wake<00:01:51.990> forest<00:01:52.439> or

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
and loses to like wake forest or

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.139 
and loses to like wake forest or
something<00:01:53.100> they<00:01:53.220> lay<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.490> basketball<00:01:54.000> you

something they lay in basketball you
just<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.960> don't<00:01:55.079> expect<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.619> but<00:01:55.740> do<00:01:55.950> when<00:01:56.130> you

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250
