 the prisoners with the growth of cities, the decentralization of activities 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.669

 vehicles for our lives 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.370
 all this dynamism brings with it 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.560
 a new challenge for power 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.329

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.649
 life in cities 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:44.600
 this is 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.710
 check out urban mobility 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.139
 constant congestion caused a loss of time 

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:55.379
 discomfort social tensions suggest that these three diaries 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.169
 decrease in productivity at work in the 

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:03.639
 not to mention environmental pollution in traffic accidents 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.310
 the era of major road projects focused only on the circulation of 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.760
 cars has passed 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.350

 intends to carry out a broad modernization of public transport 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.810
 metropolitan region, the system 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.770
 known as brt the silver throw distance 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.000
 more than an exclusive exclusive corridor 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.790
 bnp is a high capacity passenger transport system 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.030
 operating with modern vehicles and delivering high quality services 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.380
 fast with quality 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.420
 and operational efficiency 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.970
 is an intelligent system that aggregates the punctuality of the books to the 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.390
 possibility of savings of traditional bus systems the bnp proposed for 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.429
 the great victory will have the following characteristics 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.089
 buses operating in exclusive lanes next to the central bed another passage 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:18.450

 program and strict control of the communication operation with the 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.540
 bus users at stations and terminals 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:42.040
 control of the brt system operation 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.600
 will be done by a central office where using technologies that limit 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.690
 online information will be able to interact with drivers to 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.770
 ensure punctuality on arrival at each station or at the terminals so 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.829

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.380
 in addition to various information about the system the user 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.590
 will have electronic panels where the timetables will be recorded 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.679
