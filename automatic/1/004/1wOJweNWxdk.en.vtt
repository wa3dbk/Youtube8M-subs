00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
flat and you won't round the bubble just

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.600 
flat and you won't round the bubble just
use<00:01:23.670> light<00:01:23.910> to<00:01:24.060> moderate<00:01:24.330> pressure<00:01:27.140> and<00:01:28.610> when

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
use light to moderate pressure and when

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.070 
use light to moderate pressure and when
you<00:01:29.700> finish<00:01:29.970> up<00:01:30.150> use<00:01:30.390> lighter<00:01:30.690> and<00:01:30.870> lighter

you finish up use lighter and lighter

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.570 
you finish up use lighter and lighter
pressure<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.920> get<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.600> finer<00:01:33.600> finish<00:01:34.340> let's<00:01:35.340> see

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
pressure to get a finer finish let's see

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.090 
pressure to get a finer finish let's see
if<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.730> can<00:01:35.880> see<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.440> and<00:01:37.440> then<00:01:37.920> we'll

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
if you can see that and then we'll

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.420 
if you can see that and then we'll
finish<00:01:38.970> up<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.690> 8,000<00:01:40.619> grit<00:01:40.710> 3<00:01:41.040> micron

to get the polish and if you if you roll
up<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.910> wire<00:01:48.090> edge<00:01:48.360> at<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.630> point<00:01:48.960> I'll<00:01:49.410> show

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
up a wire edge at this point I'll show

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.050 
up a wire edge at this point I'll show
you<00:01:49.770> how<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:49.979> take<00:01:50.250> care<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.759> just<00:01:50.790> a

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
we'll go to the paste but first let's

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.090 
we'll go to the paste but first let's
take<00:02:15.350> off<00:02:15.560> that<00:02:15.740> wire<00:02:15.980> edge<00:02:16.810> we<00:02:17.810> have<00:02:17.840> it<00:02:18.100> just

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
take off that wire edge we have it just

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.620 
take off that wire edge we have it just
lightly<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:21.220> couple<00:02:22.220> of<00:02:22.310> strokes<00:02:22.550> and<00:02:23.480> I'll

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
lightly a couple of strokes and I'll

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.090 
lightly a couple of strokes and I'll
take<00:02:23.870> it<00:02:23.990> off<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:24.410> it<00:02:24.620> won't<00:02:24.710> ruin<00:02:24.980> your

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
take it off and it won't ruin your

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:33.240 
take it off and it won't ruin your
polish<00:02:25.490> either<00:02:26.440> now<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.500> 1<00:02:27.740> micron<00:02:27.920> paste

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.030 

and<00:02:33.850> you<00:02:34.810> can<00:02:34.990> obviously<00:02:35.200> see<00:02:35.470> how<00:02:35.590> quickly<00:02:35.890> it

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
and you can obviously see how quickly it

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.080 
and you can obviously see how quickly it
is<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.520> move<00:02:36.670> from<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.500> course<00:02:38.880> diamond<00:02:39.880> stone

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
is to move from the course diamond stone
