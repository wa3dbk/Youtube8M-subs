this<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.320> one<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.830> very<00:00:11.309> unique<00:00:11.759> circumstance

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
this is one a very unique circumstance

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.360 
this is one a very unique circumstance
but<00:00:12.870> really<00:00:13.650> something<00:00:14.070> that<00:00:14.160> will<00:00:14.280> be

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
but really something that will be

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.609 
but really something that will be
applied<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.089> entire<00:00:15.179> game<00:00:15.660> at<00:00:16.440> least

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
applied to the entire game at least

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.260 
applied to the entire game at least
slowed<00:00:16.800> down<00:00:16.980> just<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.250> little<00:00:17.430> bit<00:00:17.550> okay<00:00:18.119> here

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
slowed down just a little bit okay here

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.529 
slowed down just a little bit okay here
we<00:00:18.359> go<00:00:18.390> now<00:00:19.369> what<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.490> Terran<00:00:20.789> player<00:00:20.910> did<00:00:21.300> is

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
we go now what the Terran player did is

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.660 
we go now what the Terran player did is
the<00:00:21.779> Terran<00:00:22.050> player<00:00:22.199> tacked<00:00:22.769> on<00:00:23.039> tacit<00:00:23.519> I'm

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
the Terran player tacked on tacit I'm

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.570 
the Terran player tacked on tacit I'm
came<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.600> here<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.109> builds<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.859> bunker<00:00:26.369> back

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
came in here and builds a bunker back

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.820 
came in here and builds a bunker back
here<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.970> proxy<00:00:27.599> bunker<00:00:27.960> behind<00:00:28.109> my<00:00:28.380> base<00:00:28.590> I

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
here a proxy bunker behind my base I

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.240 
here a proxy bunker behind my base I
didn't<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.730> just<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.359> didn't<00:00:31.199> realize<00:00:31.529> what<00:00:32.189> he

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.040 
do some I'll show you what happens here
let<00:00:39.809> me<00:00:39.899> steal<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.140> up<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:41.149> if<00:00:42.149> your<00:00:42.510> Protoss<00:00:42.870> I

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
let me steal it up I if your Protoss I

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.170 
let me steal it up I if your Protoss I
pretty<00:00:43.290> much<00:00:43.379> always<00:00:43.649> do<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> four<00:00:44.460> gauge<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.149> I

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
pretty much always do a four gauge so I

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.940 
pretty much always do a four gauge so I
put<00:00:45.360> up<00:00:45.450> my<00:00:45.539> simulator<00:00:45.930> there<00:00:46.410> goes<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.649> racks

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
put up my simulator there goes the racks

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.560 
put up my simulator there goes the racks
so<00:00:47.250> what<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.399> did<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.820> brought<00:00:48.030> my<00:00:48.149> probe<00:00:48.420> out

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
so what I did is I brought my probe out

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.299 
so what I did is I brought my probe out
to<00:00:48.719> kill<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.050> thing<00:00:49.110> whether<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.070> probe

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
to kill this thing whether the probe

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.860 
to kill this thing whether the probe
automatically<00:00:50.879> gets<00:00:51.059> sets<00:00:51.300> on<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.449> bunker

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
automatically gets sets on the bunker

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.900 
automatically gets sets on the bunker
and<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.559> didn't<00:00:53.010> realize<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.489> was<00:00:53.730> not

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
and I didn't realize that it was not

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.729 
and I didn't realize that it was not
killing<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.449> SUV<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.140> tried<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.469> kill<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
killing the SUV so I tried to kill the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.610 
killing the SUV so I tried to kill the
SUV<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.309> almost<00:00:56.969> killed<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.750> then<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.469> was

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
SUV I almost killed it and then that was

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.040 
SUV I almost killed it and then that was
that<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.039> now<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.190> realized<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> marine<00:01:00.719> is

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
that and now I realized that a marine is

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.450 
that and now I realized that a marine is
going<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.379> be<00:01:01.469> coming<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.949> getting<00:01:02.070> into<00:01:02.309> that

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
going to be coming and getting into that

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.299 
going to be coming and getting into that
bunker<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.270> all<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.570> my<00:01:03.899> probes<00:01:04.769> are<00:01:04.949> we<00:01:05.100> coming

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
bunker so all of my probes are we coming

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.710 
bunker so all of my probes are we coming
here<00:01:05.519> trying<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.970> get<00:01:06.090> us<00:01:06.180> around<00:01:06.420> on<00:01:06.630> that

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
here trying to get us around on that

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.620 
here trying to get us around on that
marine<00:01:07.049> but<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.590> misclicked<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.880> they<00:01:09.119> all<00:01:09.330> ran

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
marine but I misclicked and they all ran

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.060 
marine but I misclicked and they all ran
past<00:01:09.990> him<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> marine<00:01:10.680> got<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
past him and the marine got in the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.039 
past him and the marine got in the
bunker<00:01:11.400> right<00:01:11.939> now<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.180> realize<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.689> only

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
bunker right now I realize the only

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.870 
bunker right now I realize the only
thing<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.320> can<00:01:13.380> do<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.590> charge<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.520> try<00:01:14.820> and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
thing I can do is charge so I try and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.700 
thing I can do is charge so I try and
get<00:01:15.030> us<00:01:15.119> around<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.750> bunker<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.200> then

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
get us around on the bunker and then

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.270 
get us around on the bunker and then
attack<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.990> but<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.200> see<00:01:19.470> what<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.650> deadly

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
attack it but you see what a deadly

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.670 
attack it but you see what a deadly
position<00:01:20.880> I'm<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.119> now<00:01:21.270> I'm<00:01:21.750> not<00:01:22.080> harvesting

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
position I'm in now I'm not harvesting

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.539 
position I'm in now I'm not harvesting
down<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.460> 14<00:01:23.850> harvesters<00:01:24.920> soon<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.040> be<00:01:26.130> 13

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
down to 14 harvesters soon to be 13

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.830 
down to 14 harvesters soon to be 13
harvesters<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.570> killed<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.320> SUV<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.659> so<00:01:30.659> right

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
harvesters I killed the SUV and so right

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.960 
harvesters I killed the SUV and so right
now<00:01:30.869> I'm<00:01:31.110> pretty<00:01:31.320> frustrated<00:01:31.700> you<00:01:32.700> know<00:01:32.729> I've

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
now I'm pretty frustrated you know I've

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.749 
now I'm pretty frustrated you know I've
lost<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.570> fair<00:01:34.439> bit<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.710> suvs<00:01:35.189> there<00:01:35.579> goes

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
lost a fair bit of suvs there goes

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.740 
lost a fair bit of suvs there goes
another<00:01:35.939> one<00:01:36.180> up

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
another one up

I'm now doing bad damage to his economy

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.949 
I'm now doing bad damage to his economy
he's<00:03:23.370> still<00:03:23.640> ahead<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:23.940> me<00:03:24.150> but<00:03:24.299> here<00:03:24.480> comes<00:03:24.720> to

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
he's still ahead of me but here comes to

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.580 
he's still ahead of me but here comes to
more<00:03:25.110> zealots<00:03:25.610> coming<00:03:26.610> into<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.000> map<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.590> I

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
more zealots coming into the map and I

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.350 
more zealots coming into the map and I
don't<00:03:29.280> remember<00:03:29.489> if<00:03:29.820> they<00:03:29.940> take<00:03:30.120> out<00:03:30.269> the

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
don't remember if they take out the

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.380 
don't remember if they take out the
reactor<00:03:30.720> or<00:03:30.989> what<00:03:31.560> go<00:03:32.549> straight<00:03:32.850> yeah<00:03:33.120> kill

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
reactor or what go straight yeah kill

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.390 
reactor or what go straight yeah kill
that<00:03:33.510> marine<00:03:33.810> that<00:03:34.530> marine<00:03:34.829> is<00:03:34.980> about<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.280> get

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
that marine that marine is about to get

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.960 
that marine that marine is about to get
on

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
on

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.760 
on
he<00:03:36.030> speaks<00:03:36.270> up<00:03:36.450> faster<00:03:36.840> there<00:03:37.290> we<00:03:37.380> go<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:37.740> now

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
he speaks up faster there we go and now

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.350 
he speaks up faster there we go and now
I<00:03:37.920> have<00:03:38.130> two<00:03:38.370> more<00:03:38.550> zealots<00:03:38.880> in<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.210> mineral

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
I have two more zealots in the mineral

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.570 
I have two more zealots in the mineral
line<00:03:42.440> and<00:03:43.440> that's<00:03:43.620> what<00:03:43.740> he<00:03:43.830> says<00:03:44.010> haha<00:03:44.160> messed

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
line and that's what he says haha messed

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.960 
line and that's what he says haha messed
up<00:03:44.870> he<00:03:45.870> really<00:03:46.200> needed<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.560> evolve<00:03:46.980> in<00:03:47.280> here<00:03:47.580> he

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
up he really needed to evolve in here he

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.690 
up he really needed to evolve in here he
was<00:03:48.150> too<00:03:48.420> comfortable<00:03:48.990> and<00:03:49.200> so<00:03:49.860> he<00:03:49.980> calls<00:03:50.250> GG

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
was too comfortable and so he calls GG

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.030 
was too comfortable and so he calls GG
and<00:03:50.910> leads<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.420> game<00:03:51.630> and<00:03:52.410> you<00:03:52.440> see<00:03:52.770> that<00:03:52.890> that

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
and leads the game and you see that that

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.220 
and leads the game and you see that that
was<00:03:53.190> really<00:03:53.490> a<00:03:53.520> mistake<00:03:53.880> on<00:03:54.060> his<00:03:54.270> part<00:03:54.330> and<00:03:54.750> a

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
was really a mistake on his part and a

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.290 
was really a mistake on his part and a
mistake<00:03:55.620> on<00:03:55.770> mind<00:03:56.070> not<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.490> attack<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.940> bunker

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
mistake on mind not to attack the bunker

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.600 
mistake on mind not to attack the bunker
as<00:03:57.420> soon<00:03:57.600> as<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:57.810> saw<00:03:58.020> him<00:03:58.140> going<00:03:58.290> up<00:03:58.560> but<00:03:59.190> when<00:03:59.550> I

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
as soon as I saw him going up but when I

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.700 
as soon as I saw him going up but when I
saw<00:03:59.970> that<00:04:00.000> I<00:04:00.240> was<00:04:00.420> down<00:04:00.660> and<00:04:00.930> i<00:04:01.080> was<00:04:01.110> losing<00:04:01.440> I

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
saw that I was down and i was losing I

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.740 
saw that I was down and i was losing I
just<00:04:02.100> pushed<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:02.700> charged<00:04:03.240> it's<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.720> only

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
just pushed and charged it's the only

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.570 
just pushed and charged it's the only
thing<00:04:04.290> you<00:04:04.440> can<00:04:04.590> do<00:04:04.770> and<00:04:05.010> is<00:04:05.100> really<00:04:05.250> what<00:04:05.460> you

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
thing you can do and is really what you

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.970 
thing you can do and is really what you
should<00:04:05.610> do<00:04:05.940> and<00:04:06.120> just<00:04:06.600> in<00:04:06.720> case<00:04:06.960> this<00:04:07.350> failed<00:04:07.740> I

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
should do and just in case this failed I

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.040 
should do and just in case this failed I
was<00:04:08.220> putting<00:04:08.490> down<00:04:08.610> a<00:04:08.640> proxy<00:04:09.180> pylon<00:04:09.360> over<00:04:09.810> here

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
was putting down a proxy pylon over here

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.320 
was putting down a proxy pylon over here
so<00:04:10.530> I<00:04:10.560> could<00:04:10.650> transition<00:04:11.220> into<00:04:11.610> warp<00:04:11.940> gates<00:04:12.150> I

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
so I could transition into warp gates I

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.150 
so I could transition into warp gates I
already<00:04:12.450> had<00:04:12.660> my<00:04:12.690> cybernetics<00:04:13.440> core<00:04:13.590> down<00:04:13.890> and

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
already had my cybernetics core down and

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.759 
already had my cybernetics core down and
would<00:04:15.150> soon<00:04:15.330> be<00:04:15.480> harvesting<00:04:15.930> best<00:04:16.530> being

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
would soon be harvesting best being

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.620 
would soon be harvesting best being
guess<00:04:16.920> to<00:04:17.070> transition<00:04:17.549> into<00:04:17.700> warp<00:04:18.000> gates<00:04:18.209> with

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
guess to transition into warp gates with

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.360 
guess to transition into warp gates with
him<00:04:18.810> down<00:04:19.019> in<00:04:19.140> his<00:04:19.170> economy<00:04:19.560> even<00:04:19.950> if<00:04:20.100> he<00:04:20.160> could

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
him down in his economy even if he could

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.800 
him down in his economy even if he could
have<00:04:20.459> destroyed<00:04:20.850> these<00:04:21.030> guys<00:04:21.269> I<00:04:21.450> would<00:04:21.690> have

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
have destroyed these guys I would have

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.840 
have destroyed these guys I would have
been<00:04:21.930> able<00:04:21.989> to<00:04:22.170> pull<00:04:22.410> back<00:04:22.530> hopefully<00:04:23.250> so

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
been able to pull back hopefully so

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.400 
been able to pull back hopefully so
