is take a bobber stopper Morris it's a
weight<00:00:51.030> peg<00:00:51.680> and<00:00:52.680> when<00:00:52.859> I'll<00:00:52.980> do<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.280> run<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
weight peg and when I'll do it run the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.819 
weight peg and when I'll do it run the
line<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:54.239> there<00:00:54.510> pretty<00:00:54.719> simple<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.410> run<00:00:55.620> on

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
line on there pretty simple to run on

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.950 
line on there pretty simple to run on
just<00:00:56.160> run<00:00:56.969> your<00:00:57.090> line<00:00:57.300> through<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.750> little

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
just run your line through the little

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.669 
just run your line through the little
loop<00:00:58.199> on<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.590> bed<00:00:59.660> and<00:01:00.660> just<00:01:00.809> pull<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.350> through

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
loop on the bed and just pull it through

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:06.760 
loop on the bed and just pull it through
and<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:03.289> when<00:01:04.289> your<00:01:04.440> line<00:01:04.619> just<00:01:04.949> like<00:01:05.039> that

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
and this when your line just like that

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.620 
and this when your line just like that
then<00:01:07.770> I'll<00:01:07.920> take<00:01:08.160> the<00:01:08.220> one<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.759> the<00:01:08.880> stealth

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
then I'll take the one of the stealth

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.240 
then I'll take the one of the stealth
weights<00:01:11.270> from<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.570> line<00:01:12.780> through

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.510 

the<00:01:17.240> peg<00:01:17.540> will<00:01:17.780> hold<00:01:18.020> your<00:01:18.290> weight<00:01:18.520> I'm

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
twist run a line through and then I'll

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.320 
twist run a line through and then I'll
start<00:01:37.479> twisting<00:01:38.479> it<00:01:39.700> now<00:01:40.700> run<00:01:40.970> it<00:01:41.119> back

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
start twisting it now run it back

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.450 
start twisting it now run it back
through<00:01:41.360> my<00:01:41.930> little<00:01:42.350> loop<00:01:42.560> it<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:42.890> hit<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.430> I

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
through my little loop it to hit the I

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.749 
through my little loop it to hit the I
the<00:01:43.610> hook<00:01:45.640> then<00:01:46.640> I'll<00:01:46.850> come<00:01:47.090> back<00:01:47.150> through<00:01:48.759> the

the hook then I'll come back through the

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.190 
the hook then I'll come back through the
big<00:01:50.030> loop<00:01:50.800> then<00:01:51.800> I'll<00:01:51.979> pull<00:01:52.250> it<00:01:52.720> just<00:01:53.720> let<00:01:53.990> it<00:01:54.170> a

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
big loop then I'll pull it just let it a

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.139 
big loop then I'll pull it just let it a

I'll just pinch the worm down a little

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.600 
I'll just pinch the worm down a little
bit<00:02:29.170> run<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.320> up<00:02:30.470> through<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.799> back<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:32.480> just

slide the tip of the hook in so it'll be

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.890 
slide the tip of the hook in so it'll be
wheeless<00:02:37.510> then<00:02:38.510> I'll<00:02:38.690> pull<00:02:38.989> my<00:02:40.450> peg<00:02:41.450> and
