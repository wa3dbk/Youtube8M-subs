 that I think it 's time to start with 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.579
 the top we are going to give him cane 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.040

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.960
 sent by david fernÃ¡ndez and good vais 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.330
 to see that this is one of the faults more 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.090
 difficult to fit because it is very 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.400
 far has barrier which is no 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.559
 book is very accurate also have 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.320
 luck but there are you see that lack of 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.920
 Lent that nails her and how she eats it 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.920
 the goalkeeper 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.680

 of goal that sends us fifa skills with that 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.479
 piece of chase click from super far 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.369
 it's a very difficult goal to put 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.470
 you have to be very lucky so 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.470

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.420
 by originality of this goal is a 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.550
 golazo but you will see that the top number 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.710
