many<00:00:05.730> BOTS<00:00:06.210> in<00:00:06.480> here<00:00:06.720> and<00:00:06.990> I<00:00:07.560> wonder<00:00:07.859> how<00:00:07.890> much

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
many BOTS in here and I wonder how much

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.280 
many BOTS in here and I wonder how much
money<00:00:08.429> do<00:00:08.670> they<00:00:08.700> make<00:00:08.849> an<00:00:09.150> hour<00:00:09.330> because<00:00:09.690> they

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
money do they make an hour because they

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.709 
money do they make an hour because they
can't<00:00:10.620> make<00:00:10.889> more<00:00:11.219> than<00:00:11.429> 50k<00:00:11.880> an<00:00:12.179> hour<00:00:12.389> because

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
can't make more than 50k an hour because

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.189 
can't make more than 50k an hour because
it's<00:00:13.710> just<00:00:13.889> so<00:00:14.130> over<00:00:14.460> packed<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:15.179> have<00:00:15.719> no<00:00:15.929> idea

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
it's just so over packed I have no idea

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.790 
it's just so over packed I have no idea
why<00:00:16.350> people<00:00:16.379> still<00:00:16.949> bought<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.600> just<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:19.320> not

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
why people still bought this just so not

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.769 
why people still bought this just so not
worth<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.340> I'm<00:00:20.550> pretty<00:00:20.880> sure<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.359> picking

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
worth it I'm pretty sure that picking

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.349 
worth it I'm pretty sure that picking
Flags<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.289> more<00:00:22.470> money<00:00:22.740> than<00:00:23.070> this<00:00:23.220> one<00:00:23.490> but

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
Flags is more money than this one but

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.820 
Flags is more money than this one but

these are my two favorite spots these
are<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.719> two<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.170> used<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.860> that's<00:00:37.980> it

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
are the two that I used and that's it

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.720 
are the two that I used and that's it
they<00:00:38.850> have<00:00:39.270> now<00:00:39.480> been<00:00:39.920> botted<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.219> it's<00:00:41.460> just

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
they have now been botted and it's just

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.670 
they have now been botted and it's just
so<00:00:42.000> sad<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.300> see<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.629> mithril<00:00:43.200> drains<00:00:43.440> are

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
so sad to see that mithril drains are

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.459 
so sad to see that mithril drains are
actually<00:00:44.100> such<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.940> high<00:00:45.239> level<00:00:45.510> creatures<00:00:46.079> and

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
actually such a high level creatures and

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.100 
actually such a high level creatures and
they<00:00:46.649> should<00:00:47.010> be<00:00:47.129> very<00:00:47.430> strong<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.210> they<00:00:49.020> are

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
they should be very strong and they are

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.850 
they should be very strong and they are
now<00:00:49.289> botted<00:00:49.829> by<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:51.059> know<00:00:51.180> by<00:00:51.360> bots<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.899> there

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
now botted by you know by bots and there

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.860 
now botted by you know by bots and there
are<00:00:52.980> still<00:00:53.280> some<00:00:53.579> worlds<00:00:54.030> where<00:00:54.239> they<00:00:54.270> don't

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
are still some worlds where they don't

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.020 
are still some worlds where they don't
bought<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.559> German<00:00:56.129> Portuguese<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.469> level

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
bought like German Portuguese and level

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.240 
bought like German Portuguese and level
1500<00:01:00.030> skill<00:01:00.329> levels<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:01.440> these<00:01:01.649> bots<00:01:01.890> are<00:01:02.070> not

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
1500 skill levels so these bots are not

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.219 
1500 skill levels so these bots are not
bought<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.670> but<00:01:02.910> they<00:01:03.120> are<00:01:03.180> usually<00:01:03.390> full<00:01:03.899> with

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
bought in but they are usually full with

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.649 
bought in but they are usually full with
the<00:01:04.379> legit<00:01:04.830> players<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:06.150> very<00:01:06.270> hard<00:01:06.600> for

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
the legit players so it's very hard for

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.469 
the legit players so it's very hard for
me<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.990> get<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.380> kills<00:01:07.619> right<00:01:07.830> now<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.479> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
me to get the kills right now and the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.929 
me to get the kills right now and the
problem<00:01:09.810> with<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> metal<00:01:10.710> drains<00:01:10.950> are<00:01:11.369> that

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
problem with the metal drains are that

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.140 
problem with the metal drains are that
if<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:13.290> bot<00:01:13.500> attacks<00:01:13.890> at<00:01:14.070> first<00:01:14.460> that's<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:15.000> it

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
if a bot attacks at first that's it it

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.249 
if a bot attacks at first that's it it
will<00:01:15.509> be<00:01:15.689> not<00:01:15.900> your<00:01:16.140> load<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.890> it's<00:01:17.070> very<00:01:18.259> just

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
will be not your load so it's very just

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.899 
will be not your load so it's very just
impossible<00:01:19.619> pretty<00:01:20.189> much<00:01:20.310> because<00:01:20.640> they<00:01:20.820> are

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
impossible pretty much because they are

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.060 
impossible pretty much because they are
very<00:01:21.119> fast<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.020> guess<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.350> could<00:01:22.560> kill<00:01:22.860> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
very fast and I guess it could kill the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.550 
very fast and I guess it could kill the
mithril<00:01:23.430> dragons<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.970> there<00:01:24.180> but<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.810> would

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
mithril dragons in there but I would

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.649 
mithril dragons in there but I would
just<00:01:25.710> take<00:01:25.890> too<00:01:25.950> much<00:01:26.310> damage<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.479> was

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
just take too much damage and this was

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.990 
just take too much damage and this was
just<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.110> perfect<00:01:28.350> spot<00:01:28.979> like<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.670> learned

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
just the perfect spot like I learned

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.140 
just the perfect spot like I learned
everything<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:31.490> this<00:01:32.490> was<00:01:32.729> really<00:01:33.119> really

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
everything and this was really really

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
everything and this was really really
good<00:01:33.659> spot<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.460> think<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:36.090> I'm<00:01:36.720> gonna<00:01:36.930> go

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
good spot so I think that I'm gonna go

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.609 
good spot so I think that I'm gonna go
and<00:01:37.350> show<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.590> what<00:01:37.950> my<00:01:38.400> progress<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:39.119> to

hundred<00:02:09.420> mithril<00:02:10.379> dyin<00:02:10.709> kills<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:11.760> that's<00:02:11.940> how

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
hundred mithril dyin kills so that's how

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.240 
hundred mithril dyin kills so that's how
long<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.480> took<00:02:12.660> me<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.870> get

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
can read them if you want and you need

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.430 
can read them if you want and you need
them<00:02:22.430> for<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.850> completion<00:02:23.300> escape<00:02:23.810> no

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440
