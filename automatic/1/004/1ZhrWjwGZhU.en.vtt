00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:03.120
 Farmer 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.800
 none of them but they are not a country Bludesch chat 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.079
 from that no 

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:09.469
 you want to get yourself 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.009
 it seems the conciliation meeting 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.419
 to join in and I think it was more likely the others who took away 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.390
 but you are my feeling of the left a Wegbereiterin for 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.689
 next life 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.909
 Do not wait with satirical ones here 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:26.699
 nothing with Marion Bartoli 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.069
 Update led honest life 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:31.949
 survived only because necessary 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.690
 like my dad in front of the media when she's not the door 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.320
 bombed and sunk here 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.070
 the remaining thirds 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.050
 true love 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.339
 to prevent his son from giving them a lot of money 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:44.460
 the harbor 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.170
 you barely know my life's work 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.260
 you really are not the right ones 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
 they have their best times behind them 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.620
 They want the optic nerve intact and make a nasty headline too dirty 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.750
 the area around monastery in Tibet ICT centuries ago is fresh to us 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.960
 stolen by vagrants 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.800
 since then we have not got a key to the best shots 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.050
 Policies us only on our prayers to tame him 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.329
 then it is good too Â»is a pity b 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:13.520
 Background is the St 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.100
 terrible consequences 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.230
 such or the faith breathed life again 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.700
 which can be stopped by so many persecution and not 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.650
 and now it's stopped again 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.700
 Marko 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.850
 fallen off the television 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.770
 his mind is violent 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.160
 but he does not yet have the power to satisfy poetry 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.590
 So we had to kick Kick again who they were 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.430
 Exorcism 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.430
 where do you want to bring you to 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.060
 to have 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.180
 on
