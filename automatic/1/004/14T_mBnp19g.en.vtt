spitting<00:00:06.019> is<00:00:06.169> a<00:00:06.200> beautiful<00:00:06.709> move<00:00:06.919> as<00:00:07.100> well<00:00:07.309> and

00:00:07.659 --> 00:00:07.669 
spitting is a beautiful move as well and

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:11.770 
spitting is a beautiful move as well and
it<00:00:08.420> takes<00:00:08.780> going<00:00:09.530> really<00:00:09.950> slow<00:00:10.460> I<00:00:10.730> I'd<00:00:11.330> say

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:11.780 
it takes going really slow I I'd say

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.400 
it takes going really slow I I'd say
instead<00:00:12.650> of<00:00:12.770> going<00:00:12.920> really<00:00:13.220> fast<00:00:13.550> I<00:00:14.320> kind<00:00:15.320> of

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
instead of going really fast I kind of

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.560 
instead of going really fast I kind of
learned<00:00:15.590> it<00:00:15.800> wrong<00:00:16.070> in<00:00:16.340> the<00:00:16.430> beginning<00:00:16.880> I<00:00:17.090> was

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
learned it wrong in the beginning I was

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.470 
learned it wrong in the beginning I was
going<00:00:17.810> really<00:00:18.080> fast<00:00:18.440> it<00:00:18.920> was<00:00:19.070> really<00:00:19.970> messy

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
going really fast it was really messy

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.390 
going really fast it was really messy
and<00:00:20.840> I<00:00:21.170> thought<00:00:21.470> that<00:00:21.710> I<00:00:21.740> would<00:00:21.920> be<00:00:22.100> able<00:00:22.280> to

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
and I thought that I would be able to

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.100 
and I thought that I would be able to
get<00:00:22.580> it<00:00:22.730> just<00:00:22.880> by<00:00:23.119> doing<00:00:23.180> it<00:00:23.449> this<00:00:23.630> way<00:00:23.690> and

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
get it just by doing it this way and

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.160 
get it just by doing it this way and
that<00:00:24.220> tilting<00:00:25.220> my<00:00:25.400> hand<00:00:25.730> would<00:00:26.539> create<00:00:26.930> the

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
that tilting my hand would create the

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.359 
that tilting my hand would create the
best<00:00:27.350> mousse<00:00:27.789> big<00:00:28.960> no-no<00:00:29.960> I<00:00:30.289> learned<00:00:31.010> how<00:00:31.340> to

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
best mousse big no-no I learned how to

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.740 
best mousse big no-no I learned how to
control<00:00:32.239> my<00:00:32.899> hand<00:00:33.700> after<00:00:34.700> good<00:00:35.000> feedback<00:00:35.480> from

was able to start memorizing these

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.260 
was able to start memorizing these
points<00:02:01.780> then<00:02:02.780> as<00:02:03.049> you<00:02:03.200> get<00:02:03.490> faster<00:02:04.490> and

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
points then as you get faster and

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.520 
points then as you get faster and
at<00:02:05.509> each<00:02:05.719> point<00:02:07.660> you<00:02:08.660> can<00:02:08.869> connect<00:02:09.349> the

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
so with palm spinning to get the

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.289 
so with palm spinning to get the
illusion<00:02:26.930> of<00:02:27.170> it<00:02:27.640> staying<00:02:28.640> in<00:02:28.790> one<00:02:28.940> spot

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
illusion of it staying in one spot

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.449 
illusion of it staying in one spot
we're<00:02:29.900> going<00:02:30.019> to<00:02:30.080> isolate<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.739> ball<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.220> this

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
we're going to isolate the ball and this

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.250 
we're going to isolate the ball and this
time<00:02:31.670> our<00:02:31.879> palm<00:02:32.209> is<00:02:32.480> going<00:02:32.510> to<00:02:32.690> move<00:02:32.840> all<00:02:33.110> the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
time our palm is going to move all the

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.309 
time our palm is going to move all the
way<00:02:33.379> around<00:02:33.709> it<00:02:33.980> so<00:02:34.489> again<00:02:34.879> point<00:02:35.510> it's<00:02:36.260> a

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
way around it so again point it's a

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.199 
way around it so again point it's a
point<00:02:36.769> I'm<00:02:37.160> just<00:02:37.250> going<00:02:37.489> to<00:02:37.549> put<00:02:37.730> my<00:02:37.849> finger

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
point I'm just going to put my finger

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.870 
point I'm just going to put my finger
here<00:02:38.360> actually<00:02:38.599> just<00:02:39.110> so<00:02:39.560> you<00:02:39.680> know<00:02:39.709> keep<00:02:40.700> that

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
here actually just so you know keep that

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.580 
here actually just so you know keep that
there<00:02:41.980> my<00:02:42.980> hand<00:02:43.340> will<00:02:43.640> be<00:02:43.819> moving<00:02:44.150> around<00:02:44.900> the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
there my hand will be moving around the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:54.430 
there my hand will be moving around the
ball<00:02:50.799> to<00:02:51.799> create<00:02:52.010> that<00:02:52.400> isolation<00:02:53.230> so<00:02:54.230> now<00:02:54.410> I

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
ball to create that isolation so now I

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.479 
ball to create that isolation so now I
speed<00:02:54.890> it<00:02:55.040> up<00:02:55.160> a<00:02:55.280> little<00:02:57.069> once<00:02:58.069> you<00:02:58.190> get<00:02:58.370> the

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
speed it up a little once you get the

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:06.640 
speed it up a little once you get the
hang<00:02:58.519> of<00:02:58.849> it<00:03:00.400> move<00:03:01.400> your<00:03:01.610> hand<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:05.260> you<00:03:06.260> got<00:03:06.470> an

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
hang of it move your hand and you got an

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.900 
hang of it move your hand and you got an
isolated<00:03:07.370> called<00:03:07.640> spinning<00:03:09.519> now<00:03:10.519> it's<00:03:10.730> really

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
isolated called spinning now it's really

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.970 
isolated called spinning now it's really
beautiful<00:03:11.660> not<00:03:11.959> so<00:03:12.200> much<00:03:12.350> with<00:03:12.530> these<00:03:12.680> stage

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
beautiful not so much with these stage

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.960 
beautiful not so much with these stage
balls<00:03:13.329> but<00:03:14.329> with<00:03:14.540> crystals<00:03:15.670> I'm<00:03:16.670> going<00:03:16.819> to<00:03:16.880> use

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
balls but with crystals I'm going to use

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.420 
balls but with crystals I'm going to use
a<00:03:17.000> small<00:03:17.480> one<00:03:17.780> just<00:03:18.530> so<00:03:18.650> that<00:03:18.769> you<00:03:18.859> can<00:03:19.040> see<00:03:19.310> it

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
a small one just so that you can see it

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.930 
a small one just so that you can see it
move<00:03:19.670> better<00:03:22.359> there<00:03:23.359> you<00:03:23.480> go<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:24.670> learn<00:03:25.670> the

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
move better there you go and learn the

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.030 
move better there you go and learn the
reverse

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.490 

so<00:03:30.040> I<00:03:30.370> do<00:03:30.519> have<00:03:30.819> crooked<00:03:31.030> fingers<00:03:31.540> it's<00:03:32.170> really

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
so I do have crooked fingers it's really

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.509 
so I do have crooked fingers it's really
good<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:32.859> have<00:03:33.010> a<00:03:33.069> flat<00:03:33.400> palm<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:34.030> reach<00:03:35.159> for<00:03:36.159> a

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
good to have a flat palm and reach for a

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.720 
good to have a flat palm and reach for a
flat<00:03:37.000> palm<00:03:37.450> as<00:03:37.750> much<00:03:37.959> as<00:03:38.140> you<00:03:38.260> can<00:03:38.500> and<00:03:39.310> the

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
flat palm as much as you can and the

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.000 
flat palm as much as you can and the
reason<00:03:40.120> why<00:03:40.329> we<00:03:40.629> have<00:03:40.810> them<00:03:40.959> as<00:03:41.170> far<00:03:41.590> to<00:03:41.920> the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
reason why we have them as far to the

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.339 
reason why we have them as far to the
edge<00:03:42.159> of<00:03:42.489> your<00:03:42.579> fingertips<00:03:43.090> as<00:03:43.239> possible<00:03:43.840> is

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
edge of your fingertips as possible is

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.399 
edge of your fingertips as possible is
that<00:03:44.590> so<00:03:44.769> you<00:03:44.859> can<00:03:45.099> create<00:03:45.370> this<00:03:46.359> palm<00:03:46.750> spin

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:49.409 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:51.690 

some<00:03:50.409> people<00:03:50.650> create<00:03:50.980> a<00:03:51.010> space<00:03:51.459> in<00:03:51.670> between

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
some people create a space in between

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.460 
some people create a space in between
the<00:03:52.180> palms<00:03:52.799> I'm<00:03:53.799> sorry<00:03:54.040> in<00:03:54.189> between<00:03:54.549> the<00:03:54.670> balls

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
the palms I'm sorry in between the balls

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.250 
the palms I'm sorry in between the balls
some<00:03:56.470> people<00:03:56.739> touch<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.129> balls<00:03:57.310> together

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
some people touch the balls together

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.839 
some people touch the balls together
okay<00:03:59.260> you<00:03:59.769> can<00:03:59.950> work<00:04:00.159> them<00:04:00.340> out<00:04:00.459> in<00:04:00.639> many

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
okay you can work them out in many

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:01.759 
okay you can work them out in many
different<00:04:01.090> ways

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
different ways

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.890 
different ways
this<00:04:02.769> palm<00:04:03.069> spin<00:04:03.489> can<00:04:03.760> turn<00:04:04.060> into<00:04:04.629> a<00:04:04.659> figure

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
this palm spin can turn into a figure

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.770 
this palm spin can turn into a figure
eight<00:04:05.370> oops<00:04:06.370> so<00:04:06.970> you're<00:04:07.090> going<00:04:07.209> to<00:04:07.269> go<00:04:07.419> figure

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
eight oops so you're going to go figure

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:15.659 
eight oops so you're going to go figure
eight<00:04:12.720> okay<00:04:13.720> or<00:04:14.019> you<00:04:14.379> can<00:04:14.560> go<00:04:14.709> all<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.040> way

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:15.669 
eight okay or you can go all the way

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:20.360 
eight okay or you can go all the way
around<00:04:16.090> so<00:04:16.419> adding<00:04:17.410> two<00:04:17.620> hands<00:04:17.859> together<00:04:18.630> and

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
around so adding two hands together and

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.589 
around so adding two hands together and
reversing<00:04:23.340> so<00:04:24.340> notice<00:04:24.729> I'm<00:04:24.880> not<00:04:25.030> tipping<00:04:25.449> my

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599 
reversing so notice I'm not tipping my

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:29.850 
reversing so notice I'm not tipping my
hands<00:04:26.050> my<00:04:26.229> hands<00:04:26.470> are<00:04:26.680> nice<00:04:26.860> and<00:04:27.130> flat<00:04:27.449> and<00:04:28.860> you

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
hands my hands are nice and flat and you

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:36.409 
hands my hands are nice and flat and you
can<00:04:30.009> do<00:04:30.099> an<00:04:30.220> isolation<00:04:33.150> beautiful<00:04:34.150> enough<00:04:34.860> and

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
can do an isolation beautiful enough and

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.930 
can do an isolation beautiful enough and
you'll<00:04:37.419> see<00:04:37.659> a<00:04:37.690> lot<00:04:38.050> of<00:04:38.080> multi<00:04:38.530> ball<00:04:38.940> jugglers

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
you'll see a lot of multi ball jugglers

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.140 
you'll see a lot of multi ball jugglers
use<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:40.960> crystals<00:04:41.470> to<00:04:41.740> do<00:04:41.860> palm<00:04:42.130> spinning<00:04:42.669> so

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
use the crystals to do palm spinning so

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.000 
use the crystals to do palm spinning so
like<00:04:43.300> I<00:04:43.419> said<00:04:43.479> in<00:04:43.780> Lesson<00:04:44.110> one<00:04:44.169> that<00:04:44.770> they're

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
like I said in Lesson one that they're

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.439 
like I said in Lesson one that they're
much<00:04:45.220> easier<00:04:45.550> to<00:04:47.430> slide<00:04:48.430> against<00:04:49.000> each<00:04:49.120> other

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
much easier to slide against each other

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.110 
much easier to slide against each other
to<00:04:49.810> do<00:04:49.960> this<00:04:50.229> move<00:04:50.500> so<00:04:51.490> there<00:04:51.639> you<00:04:51.729> have<00:04:51.789> it

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
to do this move so there you have it

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.450 
to do this move so there you have it
that's<00:04:52.300> palm<00:04:52.690> spinning<00:04:53.260> just<00:04:53.800> a<00:04:53.889> little<00:04:54.099> intro

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
that's palm spinning just a little intro

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.279 
that's palm spinning just a little intro
to<00:04:54.669> that<00:04:54.699> and<00:04:55.090> of<00:04:55.210> course<00:04:55.479> there's<00:04:55.720> a<00:04:55.780> lot<00:04:56.020> of

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:56.289 
to that and of course there's a lot of

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:58.010 
to that and of course there's a lot of
different<00:04:56.620> things<00:04:56.770> you<00:04:56.860> can<00:04:56.919> do<00:04:57.220> with<00:04:57.370> it<00:04:57.550> and

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
different things you can do with it and

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.600 
different things you can do with it and
experiment<00:04:59.020> with<00:04:59.169> it<00:04:59.229> so<00:04:59.889> have<00:05:00.130> a<00:05:00.190> good<00:05:00.340> time

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
experiment with it so have a good time
