00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
wind chill warning now that doesn't mean

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.759 
wind chill warning now that doesn't mean
that<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.900> winds<00:00:28.230> are<00:00:28.289> going<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.619> be<00:00:28.740> very

that the winds are going to be very
strong<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.670> just<00:00:30.119> means<00:00:30.269> it's<00:00:30.510> cold<00:00:30.779> enough

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
strong it just means it's cold enough

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.229 
strong it just means it's cold enough
where<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.500> makes<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.830> feel<00:00:32.130> below<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.850> minus

40<00:00:33.600> mark<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.500> means<00:00:34.739> frostbite<00:00:35.250> can

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
40 mark and that means frostbite can

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.540 
40 mark and that means frostbite can
occur<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:36.420> less<00:00:36.750> than<00:00:36.960> five<00:00:37.230> minutes<00:00:37.370> this<00:00:38.370> is

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
five to ten minutes before frostbite can

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.650 
five to ten minutes before frostbite can
set<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.340> exposed<00:00:47.850> skin<00:00:48.030> if<00:00:48.539> you

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
set in that is on exposed skin if you

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.540 
set in that is on exposed skin if you
remain<00:00:48.960> out<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> cold<00:00:49.530> anything<00:00:50.399> that

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
remain out in the cold anything that

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.700 
remain out in the cold anything that
gets<00:00:50.670> closer<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.360> minus<00:00:51.600> 50<00:00:52.230> we're

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
gets closer to the minus 50 we're

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.220 
gets closer to the minus 50 we're
looking<00:00:53.039> at<00:00:53.190> two<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.969> five<00:00:54.210> minutes<00:00:54.660> before

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
looking at two to five minutes before

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.560 
looking at two to five minutes before
frostbite<00:00:55.620> can<00:00:56.100> set<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.360> something

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
frostbite can set in so it's something

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.810 
frostbite can set in so it's something
we<00:00:57.870> definitely<00:00:58.079> need<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.680> look<00:00:59.010> at<00:00:59.190> now<00:00:59.520> it

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
we definitely need to look at now it

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.849 
we definitely need to look at now it
would<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.239> believe<00:01:00.359> we<00:01:00.750> didn't<00:01:01.079> even<00:01:01.260> break<00:01:01.620> a

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
would you believe we didn't even break a

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.560 
would you believe we didn't even break a
record<00:01:02.070> low<00:01:02.399> temperature<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.030> record<00:01:03.359> low
