00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
take it on the track well genius because

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.960 
take it on the track well genius because
there's<00:02:36.840> human<00:02:37.230> error<00:02:37.500> in<00:02:37.980> tracks<00:02:38.490> if<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:38.790> go

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
there's human error in tracks if I go

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.000 
there's human error in tracks if I go
this<00:02:39.209> way<00:02:39.420> I'm<00:02:39.810> not<00:02:40.020> gonna<00:02:40.140> hold<00:02:40.380> that<00:02:40.590> exact

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
this way I'm not gonna hold that exact

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.440 
this way I'm not gonna hold that exact
line<00:02:41.280> when<00:02:41.489> I<00:02:41.520> go<00:02:41.700> around<00:02:41.820> with<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.120> other<00:02:42.239> one

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
line when I go around with the other one

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.090 
line when I go around with the other one
so<00:02:42.660> there's<00:02:42.840> gonna<00:02:42.959> be<00:02:43.080> variances<00:02:43.650> this<00:02:43.920> is

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
so there's gonna be variances this is

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.310 
so there's gonna be variances this is
one<00:02:44.310> two<00:02:44.489> three<00:02:44.760> straight<00:02:45.090> go<00:02:45.270> there<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:45.959> no

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
one two three straight go there is no

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.370 
one two three straight go there is no
room<00:02:46.680> for<00:02:46.739> human<00:02:47.190> error<00:02:47.370> ever<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.690> goes<00:02:49.110> one

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
room for human error ever it goes one

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.050 
room for human error ever it goes one
two<00:02:49.410> three<00:02:49.770> go<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.220> mean<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.400> little<00:02:50.760> maybe<00:02:50.970> I

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
two three go I mean a little maybe I

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.550 
two three go I mean a little maybe I
guess<00:02:51.300> there<00:02:51.420> could<00:02:51.510> be<00:02:51.570> like<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.810> millisecond

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
guess there could be like a millisecond

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.080 
guess there could be like a millisecond
off<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.190> that's<00:02:53.850> from<00:02:54.209> me<00:02:54.480> doing<00:02:55.200> um<00:02:55.530> like<00:02:56.459> not

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
off and that's from me doing um like not

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.660 
off and that's from me doing um like not
starting<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.900> timer<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.590> not<00:02:59.100> lining<00:02:59.430> up

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
starting the timer and not lining up

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.400 
starting the timer and not lining up
exactly<00:03:00.150> at<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.420> front<00:03:00.660> I<00:03:00.780> guess<00:03:01.020> that<00:03:01.230> could

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
exactly at the front I guess that could

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.440 
exactly at the front I guess that could
be<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.680> but<00:03:02.430> radar<00:03:02.940> if<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.150> would<00:03:03.270> kindly
