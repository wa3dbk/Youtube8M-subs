00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:07.080
 in this video I will share how to make 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.590
 eternal bookmark very good leaven 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.740
 Here it is in our working form very 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.379
 delicious smells very delicious very 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:22.140
 nice bread on not suitable for 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:26.670
 a couple of hours here it is prepared so it is taken 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.109
 100 grams of water 100 grams of flour is measured 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.019
 I will not show the whole process now 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.120
 that is because it is preparing an order . 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.730
 steamed throughout 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.440
 three to five days I have already finished 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.620
 starter I'll just tell in this video 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.059
 that as we go to sleep and all the days we 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.250
 we take 100 grams of water 100 grams of flour 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.590
 mix and put it all in warm 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.430
 we cover the place I cover that all 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.309
 cool did not dry cloth with rubber 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.899
 on the jar then she is not choking and breathing 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.230
 transitional and does not dry out 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.120
 then we were the next day again in 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.809
 we add the same leaven capacity 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.460
 again 100 grams address tom grams of flour 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:08.360
 again we cover our mix 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.670
 we cover again for the day we put the glass and 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.940
 warm then 20 to 25 degrees not to 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.410
 overheat and 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.160
 so that she quickly prepared 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.930
 still not 15 not at ten and again 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.880
 doing the same procedure on the third day 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.300
 again there add 100 grams and 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.850
 100 grams of flour mix it all here 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.150
 and also put in a warm place this 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.150
 depending on the water from the flour a lot a lot 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.480
 factors it all affects 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:40.000
 this procedure can be repeated 57 times 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.800
 but it is possible not to increase the volume 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.710
 no huge amounts of it all 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.050
 was done the third day when she stood 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.460
 the leaven that we cook we 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.680
 we pour out almost all 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.440
 and we are going differently with differently 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.480
 the script further force one two 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.530
 tablespoons sourdough add there 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:03.790
 50 grams of water and flour to make it like 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:06.160
 thick sour cream and here we are so popliteal 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.320
 leaven as much time as 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.929
 fans to fight so she rose 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.730
 Foaming delicious smelled that is whether I lived 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.490
 again your water condition depends 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.970
 flour show very much it froths 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:23.170
 pretty such sourdough becomes 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:25.540
 that's all individually because there is 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.090
 poor quality flour which capture to 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.860
 generally not done people are divided therefore 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.810
 if you do not go out to do this 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.780
 just change the sourdough flour 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.670
 try changing the water try you 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.560
 I will definitely be able to say right away 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.570
 what have we been doing for a very long time 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.030
 yeast did not work we upset 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.830
 watched other people's videos and thought but 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.390
 that's why we can't do it 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.850
 all it turns out that we all the same we 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.530
 came to this leaven we long and and 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.190
 will show for her to gain strength 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.310
 and now 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.960
 very good very strong sourdough in 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.880
 some kind of commercials i'm in at some of 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.850
 rollers one of the rollers I will show how 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.680
 dry leaven good luck do your 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.820
 use yeast for health 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.820
 let you succeed
