00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.900
 on the other hand but still a new 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.939
 video with the same clothes and the 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.439
 same hairstyle and the same makeup and 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.040
 the east and the same peak 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.140
 it's amazing good I confess my 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.150
 secret I actually record several 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.669
 in the afternoon like that I can him 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.669
 put on the back of his accounts 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.230
 so for this new video 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.899
 it's time for me to calm down 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.460
 time that I calm down for this 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.059
 new video i will make you the 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.239
 comparison of my two loves and two 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.559
 men but May 2 lipstick 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:51.829
 finally if I can call it reds to 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.750
 lips 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.760
 short two products that serve the 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.440
 same thing in fact that they are 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.530
 similar but not the same 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.230
 price so I just wanted 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.660
 make you compare finally compare in 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.920
 to tell you which one to buy 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.560
 yes and no because it's like you 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.650
 want in the end but at least for you 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.830
 say what I think so it's gone 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:20.450
 let's start with the superhero 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.430
 super steve 24 hours so what and so 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.130
 I bought the shade me it feels violated 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.230
 in fact it's raspberry raspberry 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.720
 endless 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.060
 I started by buying this one I ' 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.650
 bought abroad at the price of 11 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.030
 euros but I imagine that in France it 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.340
 must be a little bit more expensive I do not 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.470
 do not know anyway I 've got it 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.210
 tried I find it well I have a 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.200
 problem by cons with this kind of 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:48.380
 lipstick is that my lips are 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.840
 dry and so bassa flakes then 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.940
 it's supposed to stay 24 hours that's right 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.520
 but not everywhere that is to say that me 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.770
 often I have the right turn 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.980
 saivet this beautiful ride that I did on the 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.670
 video all you need to do in 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.670
 makeup here it is no I'm kidding 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.080
 of course it's a very good product 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.429
 it's a lipstick that you put 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.080
 which is not at all cream that is very 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.340
 very dull that you put on the student 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.349
 you wait for it to dry 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.090
 by the way on this video there I you 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.250
 watch i put it on if you want to go 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.950
 see the girls they made saran and 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.959
 what color is it I put you 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.489
 link just below and then you 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:31.720
 go through it is a balm by a boom 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.769
 which softens in quotes the mat in 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.790
 makes lipstick since it makes 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.470
 very dry students 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.230
 I do not recommend of course to just put 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.170
 that you go I do not know it's hyper 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.209
 unpleasant so in itself it's a good 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.500
 product it holds well but the problem 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.250
 is that you still have to do 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.080
 some retouching 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.030
 regarding plots does 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.040
 no trace that's good you smoke 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.840
 you drink you eat there is no 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.489
 trace of lipstick it stays on 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.420
 you and they do not they do not move 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.610
 on the other hand I tell you as and when 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.829
 measuring the time the lipstick is 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.540
 goes especially at the level of the middle of students 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.640
 since that's where it's more and tells me 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.230
 proud and he stays all the way around and that's 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.940
 not very glamorous anyway so you have to 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.680
 still look I will say at least 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.690
 every two hours see where it is 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.400
 to do a little editing what 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.750
 then this kind of lipstick is 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.430
 supposed not to retouch in the 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.380
 day but anyway we are 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.230
 always obliged to do a retouch 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.410
 in the day ok 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.750
 better we pass to his companion the 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.459
 red cross of make up for ever wii 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:35.560
 waterproof liquid lipstick 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.380
 listen I bought the hue number 11 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.090
 that's a color that's 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.359
 magnificent 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:47.260
 its burgundy color dark burgundy coffee 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:50.139
 vampire books a little at the level of 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.389
 the outfit for me is similar to the game 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:54.489
 but maybelline 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:55.989
 so what's changing in this in this 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.940
 lipstick in quotation marks it's 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.450
 just that side if it's not a 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.470
 boom it's a gloss singles to these 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.970
 liquids while the other is 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.609
 really a beautiful but as the abbot says 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.430
 water in fact that's what you say between 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:11.410
 both then now to choose 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.670
 between the two of course I will take the 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.040
 game but why because he is 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.280
 almost half the price I can 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.290
 next 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.320
 so between the two if I had 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.780
 choose will never never ever of course 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.310
 yes it's better 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:29.000
 so between the two of course if I 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.650
 had to choose I will see made a donation 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.750
 that I beline why not two 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.540
 times cheaper as I said it is 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.919
 twice cheaper yes bravo at the level 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.100
 colors is quite similar so 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.530
 really in the end what I you 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.419
 advise to take this is the game but 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.760
 to go to the store 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.490
 because it's exactly the same thing 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.710
 is exactly the same outfit and I 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.930
 would even say that the game but it's a 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.130
 little bit better about me on my lips 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.900
 luscious than the make up for ever 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.520
 so go ahead do not hesitate go ahead if 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.850
 you're a little lazy to want 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.450
 make touch-ups and toulouse go for it 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.460
 girls it was here the magazine for 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.190
 at least you have the difference between 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.790
 the two between the way and the make up 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.840
 well soon girls always 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.840
 for a new video
