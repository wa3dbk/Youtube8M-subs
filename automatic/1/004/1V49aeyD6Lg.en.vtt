though<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.469> doubt<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.849> I'd<00:00:15.000> ever<00:00:15.210> get<00:00:15.420> the

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
though I doubt that I'd ever get the

though I doubt that I'd ever get the
dragon<00:00:15.929> axe<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.320> don't<00:00:16.500> know<00:00:16.619> if<00:00:16.710> I'd<00:00:16.830> ever<00:00:16.859> a

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
dragon axe I don't know if I'd ever a

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.460 
dragon axe I don't know if I'd ever a
chance<00:00:17.279> that<00:00:17.460> or<00:00:17.699> not<00:00:18.050> Dagon<00:00:19.050> also<00:00:19.289> pretty

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
chance that or not Dagon also pretty

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.250 
chance that or not Dagon also pretty
easy<00:00:19.619> it's<00:00:19.890> just<00:00:20.180> that's<00:00:21.180> risk<00:00:21.570> I'd<00:00:21.779> rather

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
easy it's just that's risk I'd rather

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.210 
easy it's just that's risk I'd rather
not<00:00:22.529> take<00:00:22.800> got<00:00:23.640> 73<00:00:24.300> all<00:00:24.600> combat<00:00:25.170> again<00:00:25.529> they

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
not take got 73 all combat again they

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.820 
not take got 73 all combat again they
are<00:00:26.369> slightly<00:00:26.789> off<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.390> usually<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.349> defense

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
are slightly off so usually the defense

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.999 
are slightly off so usually the defense
comes<00:00:29.070> first<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.760> then<00:00:30.410> or<00:00:31.410> yeah<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.590> think<00:00:31.740> it

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
comes first and then or yeah I think it

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.760 
comes first and then or yeah I think it
is<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.340> defense<00:00:32.790> strength<00:00:33.180> then<00:00:33.770> attack

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
is the defense strength then attack

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.880 
is the defense strength then attack
comes<00:00:35.100> or<00:00:35.510> strength<00:00:36.510> defense<00:00:37.079> on<00:00:37.290> attack<00:00:37.590> I

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
comes or strength defense on attack I

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.830 
comes or strength defense on attack I
ended<00:00:38.670> up<00:00:38.790> getting<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.480> then<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.690> going

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
ended up getting that and then it going

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.299 
ended up getting that and then it going
took<00:00:40.140> 99<00:00:41.010> XP<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:42.360> get<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:43.079> attack<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.890> catch<00:00:44.100> up

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
took 99 XP to get the attack to catch up

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.779 
took 99 XP to get the attack to catch up
with<00:00:44.340> defense<00:00:44.989> slightly<00:00:45.989> off<00:00:46.370> still<00:00:47.370> no<00:00:47.550> luck

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
with defense slightly off still no luck
