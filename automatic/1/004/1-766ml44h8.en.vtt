00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
they're shaped and then you can suck it

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.590 
they're shaped and then you can suck it
in<00:02:38.989> even<00:02:39.200> more<00:02:39.410> with<00:02:39.920> these<00:02:40.069> little<00:02:40.220> tabs<00:02:40.600> tabs

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
one position where they kind of move

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.770 
one position where they kind of move
around<00:02:45.140> a<00:02:45.440> little<00:02:45.560> or<00:02:46.190> you<00:02:46.430> can<00:02:46.610> move<00:02:47.510> it<00:02:47.660> into

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
around a little or you can move it into

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.270 
around a little or you can move it into
the<00:02:47.900> next<00:02:48.050> position<00:02:48.349> which<00:02:48.530> honestly<00:02:49.010> I've

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
the next position which honestly I've

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.020 
the next position which honestly I've
rarely<00:02:49.459> had<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.760> do<00:02:51.130> okay<00:02:52.130> maybe<00:02:52.880> you<00:02:52.970> can

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
rarely had to do okay maybe you can

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.550 
rarely had to do okay maybe you can
there<00:02:53.390> you<00:02:53.480> go<00:02:53.600> you<00:02:53.989> move<00:02:54.140> it<00:02:54.230> in<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.380> next

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
there you go you move it in the next

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.750 
there you go you move it in the next
position<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.010> then<00:02:55.100> it<00:02:55.190> won't<00:02:55.370> really<00:02:55.489> move

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
position and then it won't really move

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.979 
position and then it won't really move
very<00:02:55.940> much

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
very much

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.140 
very much
it's<00:02:57.680> not<00:02:57.860> very<00:02:57.890> tricky<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:58.580> can<00:02:58.700> get<00:02:58.850> in<00:02:59.000> and

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
it's not very tricky you can get in and

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.580 
it's not very tricky you can get in and
out<00:02:59.239> even<00:02:59.660> when<00:02:59.780> you're<00:02:59.900> in<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.080> bag<00:03:00.260> you<00:03:00.440> can

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
used it with that just because it gets a

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.450
