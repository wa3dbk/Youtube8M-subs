mere I've done a mere board in the past
this<00:00:15.509> meer<00:00:15.929> board<00:00:16.170> or<00:00:16.379> make<00:00:16.560> your<00:00:16.710> ideas<00:00:17.130> real

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
this meer board or make your ideas real

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.560 
this meer board or make your ideas real
it's<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.150> cortex<00:00:18.720> a9<00:00:19.070> dual-core<00:00:20.390> but<00:00:21.390> is

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
it's the cortex a9 dual-core but is

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.990 
it's the cortex a9 dual-core but is
what's<00:00:21.900> unique<00:00:22.199> about<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:23.369> board<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.820> some

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
what's unique about this board and some

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.450 
what's unique about this board and some
of<00:00:24.119> its<00:00:24.269> characteristics<00:00:25.050> are<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.560> FPGA

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
of its characteristics are the FPGA

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.970 
of its characteristics are the FPGA
subsystem<00:00:27.330> embedded<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.140> ARM<00:00:28.320> processor

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
subsystem embedded in the ARM processor

subsystem embedded in the ARM processor
so<00:00:29.730> if<00:00:30.090> you're<00:00:30.240> unfamiliar<00:00:30.810> with<00:00:30.929> FPGA<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:32.489> link

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
so if you're unfamiliar with FPGA a link

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.880 
so if you're unfamiliar with FPGA a link
will<00:00:33.300> be<00:00:33.390> down<00:00:33.420> inside<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.140> description<00:00:34.710> that

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
will be down inside the description that

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.420 
will be down inside the description that
describes<00:00:35.340> FPGA<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.690> has<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.430> 28,000

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
describes FPGA this has the 28,000

describes FPGA this has the 28,000
logical<00:00:38.850> sales<00:00:39.290> I'll<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.530> describe<00:00:41.010> some<00:00:41.460> of

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
logical sales I'll just describe some of

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.280 
logical sales I'll just describe some of
the<00:00:41.579> components<00:00:42.120> just<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.020> get<00:00:43.170> an

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
the components just so that you get an

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.049 
the components just so that you get an
idea<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.829> what<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.070> board<00:00:44.280> features<00:00:44.760> so

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
idea of what the board features so

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.770 
idea of what the board features so

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
is their 70 10 processor line at this

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.340 
is their 70 10 processor line at this
board<00:01:21.600> 7000<00:01:22.590> series<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.939> also<00:01:24.150> has<00:01:24.540> one

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
board 7000 series and it also has one

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.640 
board 7000 series and it also has one
gigabyte<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:26.040> ddr3<00:01:26.759> or<00:01:27.180> two<00:01:27.390> modules<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.990> 512

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
gigabyte of ddr3 or two modules of 512

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.780 
gigabyte of ddr3 or two modules of 512
on<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.790> bottom<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.540> has<00:01:30.860> GPIO<00:01:31.860> pin<00:01:32.310> out

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
on the bottom it has GPIO pin out

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.120 
on the bottom it has GPIO pin out
so<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.210> has<00:01:33.360> system<00:01:34.049> expansion<00:01:34.590> slots<00:01:34.829> here

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
so it has system expansion slots here

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.039 
so it has system expansion slots here
and<00:01:35.310> then<00:01:35.850> here's<00:01:36.299> where<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.570> NAND<00:01:36.900> flash

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
and then here's where the NAND flash

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.600 
and then here's where the NAND flash
would<00:01:37.380> be<00:01:37.500> if<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.799> choose<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.159> order<00:01:38.340> that

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
would be if you choose to order that

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.630 
would be if you choose to order that
board<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.119> would<00:01:39.479> NAND<00:01:39.900> flash<00:01:40.430> right<00:01:41.430> now<00:01:41.610> I

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
board I would NAND flash right now I

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.380 
board I would NAND flash right now I
have<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:43.170> boot<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.520> microSD<00:01:45.149> card

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
have you you boot to on the microSD card

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.740 
have you you boot to on the microSD card
slot<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.670> runs<00:01:47.990> flawlessly<00:01:49.070> really<00:01:50.070> fast

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
slot and it runs flawlessly really fast

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.660 
slot and it runs flawlessly really fast
so<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:52.229> come<00:01:52.500> right<00:01:52.710> out<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.009> box<00:01:53.189> with<00:01:53.460> you

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
so it come right out of the box with you

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.499 
so it come right out of the box with you
as<00:01:53.759> with<00:01:54.240> Ubuntu<00:01:54.720> on<00:01:54.899> there<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.700> yeah<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.210> if

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
as with Ubuntu on there so yeah so if

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.969 
as with Ubuntu on there so yeah so if
you<00:01:57.630> have<00:01:57.689> any<00:01:57.899> questions<00:01:58.290> or<00:01:58.439> comments<00:01:58.649> about
