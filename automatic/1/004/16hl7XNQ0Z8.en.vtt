00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:08.120
 Yes Well thing 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.120
 Today is the gt 500 series 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:15.690
 I told you to check the tires, so let me eat some videos 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.690
 It has earned 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:24.670
 It seems that most of the compounds were decided 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.560
 We currently in the check of the final stage 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.710
 I think I will try 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.210
 It is already quite cold outside this 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.170
 Yes the sound is 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.480
 Not put on 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.739
 The correct grip is 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.739
 This has been applied 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.870
 Rean's Ann and the sense of stability also seem very good 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.180
 I am saying that the grip is enough 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.510
 Together the course of this sleeve Star 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.970
 I have decided on the compound 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:20.300
 It is a genuine tire and Well night eyes 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.150
 At least up to the third pack 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.580
 somehow 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.840
 It says use at the base 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:33.159
 I'm supposed to 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:35.909
 Since when is a case of a new tire of this rush is the fact that almost no decrease 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.909
 vice versa 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:48.040
 It seems that the surface of the tire comes to this course and every pack 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.040
 Say the lap time is up 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.680
 Because it seems to be such a tire 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:01.990
 If you actually use it like this 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.990
 It is also very useful economically 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:20.360
 If you guys this is a poor gt 500 race 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:24.200
 Purchase some sets of new tires on the day 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.600
 That's why I challenge the race 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.010
 With this new tire coming out 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.010
 Well in one pack 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:41.829
 Race It is said that you can challenge the race with that fuck from the stage of the practice run the day before 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.159
 Because it will be 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.159
 otto 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.140
 Very this 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.580
 Grip name and 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.580
 Cost performance 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.910
 Very helpful here 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:16.519
 It is released from now on and is newly released gt 500 of tire 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:24.270
 Continues energetic artists
