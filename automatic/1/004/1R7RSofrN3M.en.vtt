00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.390 
about entry firing for this video I'll
mostly<00:00:09.059> be<00:00:09.120> going<00:00:09.510> over<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:10.080> AK<00:00:10.620> but<00:00:10.889> i<00:00:11.040> will

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
mention when you should entry fragment

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.500 
mention when you should entry fragment
and<00:00:13.170> up<00:00:13.340> so<00:00:15.560> for<00:00:16.560> for<00:00:17.460> entry<00:00:17.850> fragging<00:00:18.359> the

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
and up so for for entry fragging the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.540 
and up so for for entry fragging the
most<00:00:18.750> important<00:00:19.380> thing<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.830> basically<00:00:20.520> just

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
most important thing is basically just

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.929 
most important thing is basically just
how<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.270> pre<00:00:21.689> aim<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.199> how<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.410> peek<00:00:22.920> now<00:00:23.880> you

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
how you pre aim and how you peek now you

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.820 
how you pre aim and how you peek now you
want<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.330> be<00:00:24.449> explosive<00:00:25.199> on<00:00:25.350> your<00:00:25.500> entry

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
want to be explosive on your entry

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.560 
want to be explosive on your entry
fragging<00:00:26.279> but<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.670> don't<00:00:26.880> want<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.180> be<00:00:27.300> too

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
fragging but you don't want to be too

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.870 
fragging but you don't want to be too
reckless<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.560> mean<00:00:28.980> running<00:00:29.279> up<00:00:29.400> full<00:00:29.640> speed

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
reckless so I mean running up full speed

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.550 
reckless so I mean running up full speed
here<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.210> fine<00:00:30.510> where<00:00:30.810> your<00:00:30.929> explosives

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
here is fine where your explosives

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.010 
here is fine where your explosives
exposed<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.489> single<00:00:32.880> angles<00:00:33.270> for<00:00:33.630> example

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
exposed to single angles for example

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.510 
exposed to single angles for example
here<00:00:34.200> you're<00:00:34.350> exposed<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.649> sandwich<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.489> then

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
here you're exposed to sandwich and then

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.180 
here you're exposed to sandwich and then
you<00:00:35.880> expose<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.360> closer<00:00:36.960> corner<00:00:37.500> but<00:00:38.070> you

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
you expose to the closer corner but you

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.830 
you expose to the closer corner but you
don't<00:00:38.370> want<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.579> run<00:00:38.730> up<00:00:38.760> full<00:00:39.180> speed<00:00:39.480> here

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
don't want to run up full speed here

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.229 
don't want to run up full speed here
where<00:00:40.379> half<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.370> second<00:00:41.700> ago<00:00:41.910> you're<00:00:42.090> not

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
where half a second ago you're not

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.850 
where half a second ago you're not
supposed<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.629> anything<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.260> little<00:00:43.680> leave

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
supposed to anything and little leave

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.619 
supposed to anything and little leave
within<00:00:44.040> half<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.489> second<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.149> exposed<00:00:45.450> to

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
within half a second you exposed to

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.930 
within half a second you exposed to
doing<00:00:45.899> angles<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.469> it's<00:00:46.590> very<00:00:46.800> hard<00:00:47.160> for<00:00:47.399> you

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
doing angles and it's very hard for you

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.110 
doing angles and it's very hard for you
to<00:00:48.180> react<00:00:48.690> quickly<00:00:49.680> enough<00:00:49.920> before<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.789> CT

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
to react quickly enough before the CT

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.479 
to react quickly enough before the CT
can<00:00:51.329> kill<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:52.020> mean<00:00:52.500> unless<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.800> CC<00:00:53.129> misses

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
can kill you I mean unless the CC misses

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.720 
can kill you I mean unless the CC misses
their<00:00:53.670> shot<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.829> yeah<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:55.890> you're<00:00:56.340> trying<00:00:56.640> to

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
their shot but yeah you you're trying to

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.029 
their shot but yeah you you're trying to
give<00:00:57.000> yourself<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.780> mean<00:00:58.410> you're<00:00:58.770> being

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
give yourself the I mean you're being

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.650 
give yourself the I mean you're being
really<00:00:59.219> reckless<00:00:59.550> here<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.359> want<00:01:00.570> to

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
really reckless here and you want to

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.150 
really reckless here and you want to
give<00:01:00.809> yourself<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.320> best<00:01:01.350> chance<00:01:01.649> at<00:01:02.010> an

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
give yourself the best chance at an

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.260 
give yourself the best chance at an
entry<00:01:02.430> frag<00:01:02.730> while<00:01:04.369> being<00:01:05.369> at<00:01:05.640> least<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.090> bit

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
entry frag while being at least a bit

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.330 
entry frag while being at least a bit
safe<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.930> also<00:01:07.409> don't<00:01:07.560> want<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.860> be<00:01:07.979> jiggle

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
safe so you also don't want to be jiggle

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.039 
safe so you also don't want to be jiggle
peaking<00:01:08.640> like<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:09.000> because<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.630> slow

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
peaking like that because it's so slow

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.590 
peaking like that because it's so slow
and<00:01:10.320> passive<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.030> by<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.090> time<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.450> done

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
and passive and by the time you done

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.940 
and passive and by the time you done
with<00:01:12.720> all<00:01:12.780> your<00:01:12.930> peaks<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.320> smokes<00:01:13.590> are<00:01:13.740> gone

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
with all your peaks of smokes are gone

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.850 
with all your peaks of smokes are gone
so<00:01:14.570> yeah<00:01:15.570> we're<00:01:15.780> assuming<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.590> smoked

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
so yeah we're assuming that you smoked

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.800 
so yeah we're assuming that you smoked
OCT<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.520> smoked<00:01:17.820> off<00:01:17.939> conductor<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.479> jungle

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
OCT you smoked off conductor and jungle

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.140 
OCT you smoked off conductor and jungle
and<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:18.960> smelled<00:01:19.229> our<00:01:19.350> top<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.799> stairs<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.880> all

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
and you smelled our top of stairs so all

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.730 
and you smelled our top of stairs so all
right<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.420> how<00:01:21.720> do<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.110> want<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.380> peek<00:01:22.590> into

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
right so how do you want to peek into

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.210 
right so how do you want to peek into
these<00:01:22.950> multi-angle<00:01:24.530> multi-angle<00:01:25.530> positions

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
these multi-angle multi-angle positions

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.640 
these multi-angle multi-angle positions
so<00:01:26.549> what<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.240> want<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.659> here<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.530> don't

want to just stop and have a perfect
peak<00:01:30.630> on<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:30.960> guy<00:01:31.200> because<00:01:31.439> if<00:01:31.829> every<00:01:32.100> time

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250

so<00:01:55.140> you're<00:01:55.290> only<00:01:55.409> exposed<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.920> one<00:01:56.100> guy<00:01:56.340> but

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
so you're only exposed to one guy but

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.850 
so you're only exposed to one guy but
you're<00:01:57.000> picking<00:01:57.329> out<00:01:57.420> kind<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.659> why<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.140> you

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
you're picking out kind of why so you

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.740 
you're picking out kind of why so you
can<00:01:59.040> bait<00:01:59.310> out<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> shot<00:01:59.880> from<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.270> guy<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:00.659> you

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
can bait out a shot from this guy so you

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.870 
can bait out a shot from this guy so you
can<00:02:00.869> get<00:02:00.990> some<00:02:01.140> information<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.950> then<00:02:02.700> you're

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
can get some information and then you're

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.889 
can get some information and then you're
the<00:02:03.090> whole<00:02:03.270> time<00:02:03.420> you're<00:02:03.540> keeping<00:02:03.840> yourself

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
the whole time you're keeping yourself

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.250 
the whole time you're keeping yourself
moving<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:04.740> it's<00:02:04.860> kind<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.100> hard

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
moving so it's kind of hard

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.380 
moving so it's kind of hard
and<00:02:06.380> since<00:02:07.250> you're<00:02:07.430> not<00:02:07.580> shooting<00:02:07.760> right<00:02:08.119> away

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
and since you're not shooting right away

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.660 
and since you're not shooting right away
at<00:02:08.540> the<00:02:08.660> triple<00:02:09.020> box<00:02:09.229> guy<00:02:09.619> you're<00:02:10.369> giving

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
at the triple box guy you're giving

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.130 
at the triple box guy you're giving
yourself<00:02:10.760> more<00:02:11.090> time<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.600> line<00:02:11.780> up<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.020> shot

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
yourself more time to line up the shot

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.440 
yourself more time to line up the shot
so<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.680> can<00:02:12.950> be<00:02:13.430> sure<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:15.650> fraggin<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:17.000> and

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
so you can be sure to to fraggin so and

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.450 
so you can be sure to to fraggin so and
if<00:02:17.870> you<00:02:18.020> have<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.320> frag<00:02:18.560> them<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:19.010> you<00:02:19.130> notice

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
if you have you frag them and you notice

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.680 
if you have you frag them and you notice
someone<00:02:19.640> was<00:02:19.850> shooting<00:02:20.000> you<00:02:20.240> here<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:20.570> can

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
someone was shooting you here you can

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.200 
someone was shooting you here you can
quickly<00:02:20.960> Priam<00:02:21.680> here<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.100> pre<00:02:22.280> fire<00:02:22.520> so<00:02:23.150> to

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
quickly Priam here and pre fire so to

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.130 
quickly Priam here and pre fire so to
give<00:02:23.690> you<00:02:23.840> two<00:02:24.260> quick<00:02:24.290> frags<00:02:24.830> so<00:02:26.020> that's<00:02:27.020> the

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
give you two quick frags so that's the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.980 
give you two quick frags so that's the
way<00:02:27.320> you<00:02:27.380> want<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.800> approach<00:02:28.160> these

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
way you want to approach these

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.910 
way you want to approach these
multi-angle<00:02:30.160> situations<00:02:31.510> so<00:02:32.560> if<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:33.800> are

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
multi-angle situations so if you are

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.100 
multi-angle situations so if you are
like<00:02:34.130> trying<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:35.530> entry<00:02:36.530> frag<00:02:36.740> into<00:02:37.040> a<00:02:37.070> site<00:02:38.110> so

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
like trying to entry frag into a site so

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.900 
like trying to entry frag into a site so
I<00:02:39.140> we're<00:02:39.710> going<00:02:39.830> to<00:02:39.890> assume<00:02:40.220> that<00:02:40.280> no<00:02:40.640> one<00:02:40.790> is

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
I we're going to assume that no one is

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.520 
I we're going to assume that no one is
playing<00:02:41.060> up<00:02:41.270> close<00:02:41.480> in<00:02:41.630> this<00:02:41.720> corner<00:02:42.110> someone

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
playing up close in this corner someone

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.200 
playing up close in this corner someone
is<00:02:42.650> playing<00:02:42.830> by<00:02:43.040> trivial<00:02:43.400> box<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:43.790> someone<00:02:44.090> is

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
is playing by trivial box and someone is

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.870 
is playing by trivial box and someone is
playing<00:02:44.390> by<00:02:44.600> brick<00:02:44.870> so<00:02:45.250> you'll<00:02:46.250> see<00:02:46.520> that<00:02:46.700> even

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
playing by brick so you'll see that even

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.550 
playing by brick so you'll see that even
though<00:02:47.120> we're<00:02:47.300> stopping<00:02:47.780> for<00:02:47.810> a<00:02:47.990> bit<00:02:48.170> is<00:02:48.320> still

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
though we're stopping for a bit is still

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.320 
though we're stopping for a bit is still
going<00:02:48.710> to<00:02:48.800> be<00:02:48.860> nice<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.340> explosive<00:02:49.940> so<00:02:50.180> we're

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
going to be nice and explosive so we're

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.450 
going to be nice and explosive so we're
going<00:02:50.420> to<00:02:50.510> run<00:02:50.660> out<00:02:50.720> check<00:02:51.350> sandwich<00:02:51.830> check

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
going to run out check sandwich check

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.880 
going to run out check sandwich check
close<00:02:52.670> up<00:02:52.880> corner<00:02:53.330> and<00:02:53.360> we're<00:02:54.110> going<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:54.290> come

close up corner and we're going to come
out<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:56.180> then<00:02:56.690> we're<00:02:56.780> going<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:56.930> be<00:02:57.140> far<00:02:57.350> this

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
out and then we're going to be far this

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.820 
out and then we're going to be far this
corner<00:02:57.890> even<00:02:58.160> if<00:02:58.280> no<00:02:58.400> one<00:02:58.550> is<00:02:58.580> there<00:02:58.700> so<00:02:59.360> say<00:02:59.570> we

cleared<00:03:17.690> these<00:03:17.840> two<00:03:18.080> spots<00:03:18.410> I<00:03:18.620> don't<00:03:19.130> have<00:03:19.220> to

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
cleared these two spots I don't have to

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.520 
cleared these two spots I don't have to
worry<00:03:19.520> about<00:03:19.670> being<00:03:19.970> exposed<00:03:20.390> so<00:03:21.080> I<00:03:21.110> just<00:03:21.320> pre

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
worry about being exposed so I just pre

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.150 
worry about being exposed so I just pre
fired<00:03:21.769> this<00:03:21.920> close<00:03:22.160> angle<00:03:22.580> to<00:03:22.820> be<00:03:22.970> safe<00:03:23.239> so

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
fired this close angle to be safe so

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.500 
fired this close angle to be safe so
like<00:03:25.160> that's<00:03:25.370> really<00:03:25.610> how<00:03:25.880> you<00:03:25.910> want<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.330> enter

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.060 
like that's really how you want to enter
your<00:03:26.900> site<00:03:27.170> and<00:03:27.440> then<00:03:27.560> you<00:03:27.620> want<00:03:27.769> to<00:03:27.800> clear<00:03:27.980> out

your site and then you want to clear out
the<00:03:28.190> other<00:03:28.310> angles<00:03:28.760> you<00:03:29.330> want<00:03:29.570> to<00:03:29.750> you<00:03:30.560> want<00:03:30.590> to

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
want to learn how to pick them and then

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.460 
want to learn how to pick them and then
practice<00:03:41.510> it<00:03:42.019> so<00:03:42.709> the<00:03:42.950> best<00:03:43.100> way<00:03:43.280> to<00:03:43.340> practice
