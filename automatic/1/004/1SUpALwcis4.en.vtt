00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.930
 Javier Pastore and Ezequiel Lavezzi his 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.540
 presence here has influenced your 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.460

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.650
 about mind 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.720
 I thought of them if by the fact 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.080
 that I have had the experience of being able to 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.960
 have been part of 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.480
 of previous clubs with them and good 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.790
 and I thought and I knew what 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.310
 by the kind of people that they are could 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.570
 have a very factual support 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.710
 cute 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.860
 and good but beyond that one 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.510
 sincerely believes in the project believes in 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.580
 the ambitions that you have is in this 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.050
 club and is and this society the 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.340
 president and all the people who 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.890
 they work for Paris 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.009
 and well that's what what has given me 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.920
 the beyond knowledge with these 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.649
 colleagues what has given me the 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.160
 possibility let's say and the firmness to 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.160
 come to this club 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.900
 how do you explain that Uruguay with less 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.970
 of four million inhabitants be a 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.980
 so great scoring school 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.670
 If that is a particularity that 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.410
 has in our country the fact of taking 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.750
 many players many forwards 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.270
 as well 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.880
 one wonders many times how he does 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.910
 Uruguay to make a selection 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.960
 globally competitive and have 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.900
 won what he has won in history 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.840
 of soccer 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.989
 but one that lives in that country one that 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.640
 part of that country is what 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.799
 can say is that our culture is 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.470
 a very football culture is a culture 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:03:00.100
 very good 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.620
 of sports ambitions and that for 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.239
 we 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.540
 it's a very important thing at the moment 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.459
 of the good of facing our childhood 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.590
 because it takes you a lot to sport 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.150
 It takes a lot of good 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.569
 to make many sacrifices to be able 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.719
 arrive because surely 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:20.540
 the economic reserves are not they are not 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:22.010
 the largest and most good and sometimes 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.049
 needs also lead you to grow 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.049
 and mature a lot like a human being 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:34.519
 often it is presented to you as a 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.709
 serial scorer a series scorer 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.610
 what would its characteristics be like 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.430
 player as forward 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.460

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.080
 with lots of fruit play a lot with the 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.430
 freedom of movement to be able to move 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.750
 quietly in the center of the attack 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.450
 and a forward who always has many 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.040
 eager to win and to help his 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.750
