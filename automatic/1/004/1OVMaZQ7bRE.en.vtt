00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.990
 I am human being the president of the company 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.329
 of musical instruments bus song has 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.009
 that being the best in the world I want that 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:26.500
 the richest man in the world can dream 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.720
 having it is done in the finest way 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:33.119
 of the world and each of its parts is the 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.119
 most perfect and most expensive in the world 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.340
 I 've been seeing your wife for six months 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.469
 I bought an apartment and a new car 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.890
 You never cared if I cheated on you 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.040
 Someone true you are amazing to see you 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.790
 600 even to fight with you and win 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.680
 that continues to make you suffer 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.500
 the companion of the university does not 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.500
 it worked now it's my turn to take revenge 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.840
 made this will three years ago not 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.299
 I knew that the divine part was so 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.700
 big even if it's a boy is his only 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:15.649
 son so maybe 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.649
 let's start with a new testament 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.770
 behaved and wrong in school is not 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.750
 so I can not let him direct my 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.430
 company thinking about the future if not 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.690
 You can control your temperament how 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.690
 will be able to handle bigger things 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:43.289
 I had a woman before I got married but I did not 

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:45.600
 I knew I had had a son of mine 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.859
 his relative raised the boy when 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.859
 she died and she called me 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.960
 I 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.960
 I seem to be your father 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.780
 from now on it's come my 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:12.110
 firstborn and nothing can change that 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.120
 so if you do not have a brother without honey 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.819
 is the biggest you are scared stupid 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.370
 Storm your big brother so idiot 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.710
 this older brother calls me 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.730
 I do not care if I'm an idiot 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.730
 tell me this 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.409
 my soldiers 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.409
 of sun yes 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.410
 and I 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.430
 and one of them 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:46.420
 it sounded like I was not a fan or just seemed 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.120
 between the two but I do not know 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.659
 what's happening here 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.480
 perhaps my son has absolute hearing and 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:57.670
 wins all the piano competitions and I 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.879
 you say he said he's better studied piano 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.920
 since he was 3 years old but he was born with 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.920
 that made him a test of absolute hearing 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.110
 we are researching we believe that the 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.690
 cake with candles fell on the carpet 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.020
 and caused the fire 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.030
 my mother-in-law suffers from Alzheimer's because she believes 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.450
 that her husband could not leave the 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:32.050
 library had to fall asleep then 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.920
 of having a drink did not fade away 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.430
 A blow to the head 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.710
 we examine the body you are the 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.240
 son of mazinho and good he 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.700
 he asked me to give you these 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:48.160
 instruments buttons yours protects the 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.160
 company never trust to take 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.640
 leaves you approximately 80 percent 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:59.250
 of his actions the son his eldest son 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.410
 but I know that you have a good 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.040
 relationship with the directors so he 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.670
 I ask for my name, president 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.439
 beyond your fortune 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.049
 the tremendous amount of money that 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:15.010
 you left is in my hands 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:17.820
 now everything belongs to him 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:21.489
 your new testament serves 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:24.970
 I broke it into a thousand pieces 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.880
 the last survivor wins now is my 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.639
 turn to avenge an accident took 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:34.560
 my husband is here to fulfill his 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.560
 dream and follow his legacy 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.340

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.560

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.290
 of piano in a concert hall for 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.510
 his inauguration the concert was a 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.120
 piano duel between the president and his 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.680
 younger brother vinaio is expected to see what 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.419
 will happen in the relationship of the brothers 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.410
 joe that were disputing the 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.410
 company address 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:04.259
 if I had not married with more them my 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:06.449
 life would not be hell you came to 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:08.620
 be the president thanks to me you can 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:11.169
 turn on that line 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.600
 but there was a child between you two you 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:16.840
 You dared to talk to him about my son 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:20.580
 dead and yes 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.580

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.420
 what will he be doing now 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.300
 because you want to know about him 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.940
 you were close friends 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.509
 because he was the first one who taught me to 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.509
 play the piano 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.980

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.889

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.400
 the trap 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.400

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.289

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.369
