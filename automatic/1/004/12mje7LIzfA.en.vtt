00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.720
 gearbox of your car 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.950
 transfers engine power to the wheels 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.840
 sets u transfer which is more 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.120
 suitable for a given speed 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.370
 with automatic transmission to the driver 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.809
 no need to switch speeds manually with 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.340
 using sensors computer machines 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.500
 determines when to switch 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.750
 speed and sends an electronic signal 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.140
 on and off 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.160
 related gear 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.990
 transmission gears and the system 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.090
 levers that transmits power to 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.439
 driving wheels of the car allows 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.390
 engine run in the most 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.430
 effective power range and and 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.719
 collected in aluminum casings which 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.460
 called gearbox housing 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.920
 transmission center three sets of gears 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.289
 planetary gearing it means that 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.280
 smaller gears rotate around greater 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.800
 central gear and the first set 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.539
 gears called the main gear he 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.539
 matches the speed of the motors to the speed 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.160
 hand over it is connected to the differential node 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.049
 which allows the wheels to move with 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.860
 different speeds so the machine can 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.030
 turning steel parts put and 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.640
 are connected by a shift lever 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.260
 speeds so the car can drive 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.820
 forward back up and or 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.610
 stop first 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.710
 manual installation arm then support coupling 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:26.430
 forward movement part which stands 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:28.500
 out of it is called stop blocker 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.509
 drive connects growl blocker with 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.430
 focus blocker which includes 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:38.189
 transfer stopping machines now 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:44.880
 turn 5 clutch coupling and either allow 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:46.829
 gear rotate either locks them this 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.810
 the clutch is called the forward clutch 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.850
 she lets the car move forward 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.079
 when you turn on the front speed with 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.270
 using leave two sets 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.100
 planetary gears called input 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.100
 gearbox and reverse gearbox 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.530
 This is followed by 2 clutches and which 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.450
 simultaneously installs a coupling on the cat 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.340
 controls input and return gearboxes 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.649
 letting the car coasting on 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.360
 low gear and gradually brake on 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.900
 higher gear when you shoot 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.310
 foot with accelerator 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.980
 the second is called the straight coupling and 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.040
 blocks both gears so the reduction 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.690
 speed doesn't happen now 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.819
 reversing clutch when reversing on 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.970
 move the reverse gears allowing 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.620
 drive back 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.209
 the clutch is made of layers of metal and 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.720
 friction material for example 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.209
 resin-impregnated paper last for 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.040
 the transmission is called 2 clutches it 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.200
 uses input gearboxes reverse 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.790
 gearbox to shift the transmission 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.620
 on the third third and fourth gear 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.019
 now all gears and clutches are installed 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.860
 workers can connect the transmission 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:03:02.310
 crippled tronic car for this serves 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:05.040
 electrical wiring now comes the turn 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.440
 drive chain of two sprockets 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.680
 connection is the most important part of communication 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.659
 transmission gears and 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.190
 torque converter torque converter 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:16.170
 this is a device that transmits power 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.450
 from the engine to the transmission 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.069
 an asterisk main gear turn 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.260
 engine speed from appropriate 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.220
 gear 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.720
 car computer order 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.980
 hydraulic control system 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.079
 shift gears as 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.640
 necessitating a computer forces 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.230
 electrons switch called 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.459
 solenoid open the desired 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.930
 control valve 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.609
 hydraulic pressure leads 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.480
 coupling action corresponding 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:41.129
 system's planetary gears resets 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.450
 hydraulic pressure to shut off 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.450
 clutch and block gears 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.720
 and the last connection of the mechanism 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.310
 switching distributor with manual 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.920
 control connects to the lever 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.080
 Locking lever 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.430
 moves the lever blockers which 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.230
 force the valve to direct 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.570
 hydraulic pressure appropriate 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.610
 way this steel rod called 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.380
 output shaft conveys powerful countries 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.780
 blend from final drive on one end 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:14.360
 front wheel driver side on 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:16.550
 the other end is then set 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.080
 executor springs mechanisms 

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.000
 hydraulic control system 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:26.690
 which helps to smoothly turn on and 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:29.300
 turn off well now you turn the system 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.370
 other control valves 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.450
 direct hydraulic fluid over 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.450
 this large to different 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:43.229
 now the torque converter rotates 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:46.520
 rod that turns an asterisk 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:49.020
 drive chain which we have already seen 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.069
 remained the same called the short shaft 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.020
 this is the last link 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:53.699
 power transmission from 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.149
 main gear and differential on 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:58.949
 front passenger side 

00:04:56.149 --> 00:05:01.580
 you learned it all and say it 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.580
 automatically
