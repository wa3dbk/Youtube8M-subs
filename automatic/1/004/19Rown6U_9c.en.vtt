00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
you've got to figure out spacing these

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.840 
you've got to figure out spacing these
things<00:01:40.130> drop<00:01:40.310> very<00:01:40.550> fast

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
they'll go really fast they'll go really

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.140 
they'll go really fast they'll go really
slow<00:01:48.799> then<00:01:49.220> I'd<00:01:49.310> be<00:01:49.430> going<00:01:49.640> left<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:50.000> they're

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
shot that they're looking for we have to

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.260 
shot that they're looking for we have to
be<00:02:00.470> very<00:02:00.799> precise<00:02:01.310> on<00:02:01.520> our<00:02:01.640> headings<00:02:02.000> and<00:02:02.149> our

be very precise on our headings and our

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.680 
be very precise on our headings and our
altitudes<00:02:03.759> we<00:02:04.759> have<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:04.970> calculate<00:02:05.180> a

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
altitudes we have to calculate a

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.080 
altitudes we have to calculate a
specific<00:02:06.380> drop<00:02:06.649> point<00:02:06.920> so<00:02:07.070> that<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.399> vehicles

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
specific drop point so that the vehicles

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.490 
specific drop point so that the vehicles
are<00:02:08.270> not<00:02:08.420> hitting<00:02:08.720> people<00:02:09.170> on<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.380> ground
