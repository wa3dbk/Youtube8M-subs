trap of what you watched except it is
not<00:00:27.720> activated<00:00:28.230> right<00:00:28.859> now<00:00:29.570> it's<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.869> safety

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
not activated right now it's in safety

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.250 
not activated right now it's in safety
mode<00:00:31.830> I'd<00:00:32.040> like<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.399> say<00:00:32.610> because<00:00:33.510> we<00:00:33.989> have<00:00:34.110> not

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
mode I'd like to say because we have not

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.819 
mode I'd like to say because we have not
put<00:00:34.469> any<00:00:34.590> larva<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> dispensers<00:00:35.850> now<00:00:36.829> you

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
put any larva in the dispensers now you

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.069 
put any larva in the dispensers now you
need<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.399> snapshot<00:00:39.000> 13<00:00:39.829> wo5<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.160> do<00:00:41.460> this

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
need the snapshot 13 wo5 a to do this

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.220 
need the snapshot 13 wo5 a to do this
the<00:00:43.079> reason<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.559> need<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.219> because<00:00:45.230> now

in<00:00:46.559> 13<00:00:47.160> wo<00:00:47.489> FIV<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.420> can<00:00:48.570> craft<00:00:48.870> snow<00:00:49.350> blocks

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
in 13 wo FIV you can craft snow blocks

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.209 
in 13 wo FIV you can craft snow blocks
that<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.640> done<00:00:50.940> very<00:00:51.239> simply<00:00:51.629> or<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:53.160> you

that is done very simply or you so you

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.160 
that is done very simply or you so you
can<00:00:53.460> craft<00:00:53.699> these<00:00:53.820> scenario<00:00:54.570> placing<00:00:54.960> things

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
can craft these scenario placing things

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.010 
can craft these scenario placing things
it's<00:00:55.949> very<00:00:56.190> simply<00:00:56.579> done<00:00:56.850> all<00:00:57.510> we<00:00:57.690> need<00:00:57.840> is

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
it's very simply done all we need is

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.900 
it's very simply done all we need is
snow<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.280> no<00:00:59.430> spell<00:00:59.789> snow<00:01:01.399> in<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.489> crafting

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
snow that is no spell snow in a crafting

table

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.789 
table
I<00:01:05.720> believe<00:01:06.720> all<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.960> need<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.229> three<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.560> them

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
I believe all you need is three of them

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.510 
I believe all you need is three of them
and<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.850> can<00:01:09.000> go<00:01:09.150> like<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:10.010> and<00:01:11.010> that's<00:01:11.400> how

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
and you can go like this and that's how

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.390 
and you can go like this and that's how
you<00:01:11.610> craft<00:01:11.850> snow<00:01:12.140> now<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:13.920> place<00:01:14.159> these

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
you craft snow now you can place these

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.520 
you craft snow now you can place these
snow<00:01:14.700> things<00:01:16.640> in<00:01:17.640> implement<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.390> an<00:01:19.080> eighth<00:01:19.290> of

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
snow things in implement of an eighth of

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.130 
snow things in implement of an eighth of
a<00:01:19.650> block<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:22.320> now<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:23.360> can<00:01:24.360> make<00:01:24.570> staircases

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
a block so now I can make staircases

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.530 
a block so now I can make staircases
that<00:01:25.320> go<00:01:25.530> one<00:01:25.799> two<00:01:26.009> three<00:01:26.040> four<00:01:26.670> one<00:01:27.180> two<00:01:27.509> three

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
that go one two three four one two three

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.530 
that go one two three four one two three
one<00:01:28.320> two<00:01:28.350> one<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.729> can<00:01:29.909> go<00:01:30.060> up<00:01:30.090> stairs<00:01:30.420> like

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
one two one so you can go up stairs like

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.319 
one two one so you can go up stairs like
this<00:01:30.600> anyway<00:01:31.530> that's<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.340> isn't<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.729> snapshot

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
this anyway that's this isn't a snapshot

this anyway that's this isn't a snapshot
video<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.369> really<00:01:35.369> cool<00:01:35.610> video<00:01:36.000> on<00:01:36.390> how

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
video this is a really cool video on how

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.660 
video this is a really cool video on how
to<00:01:36.630> make<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.930> trap<00:01:37.229> now<00:01:37.950> shift<00:01:38.250> clicking<00:01:38.460> on

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
to make a trap now shift clicking on

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.460 
to make a trap now shift clicking on
these<00:01:38.790> dispensers<00:01:39.570> which<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:40.049> one<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.409> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
these dispensers which in one of the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.010 
these dispensers which in one of the
latest<00:01:40.650> snapshots<00:01:41.310> now<00:01:42.119> can<00:01:42.360> face<00:01:42.540> upwards

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
latest snapshots now can face upwards

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.870 
latest snapshots now can face upwards
and<00:01:43.140> downwards<00:01:43.220> or<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.340> got<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.520> do<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.759> just

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
and downwards or you got to do is just

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.090 
and downwards or you got to do is just
place<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> dispenser<00:01:45.360> like<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.320> just

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
place a dispenser like that and just

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.710 
place a dispenser like that and just
cover<00:01:47.280> them<00:01:47.490> with<00:01:47.579> snow<00:01:47.880> fill<00:01:48.240> them<00:01:48.390> with<00:01:48.420> lava

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
cover them with snow fill them with lava

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.639 
cover them with snow fill them with lava
those<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.259> will<00:01:49.409> fill<00:01:49.590> these<00:01:49.799> with<00:01:49.979> lava

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
those so will fill these with lava

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.350 
those so will fill these with lava
actually<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.710> will<00:01:52.770> fill<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.070> one<00:01:53.250> too<00:01:53.610> with

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
actually you will fill this one too with

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.569 
actually you will fill this one too with
lava<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.810> then<00:01:55.680> all<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.009> need<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.250> do<00:01:56.369> is

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
lava and then all you need to do is

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.179 
lava and then all you need to do is
simply<00:01:56.939> cover<00:01:57.509> them<00:01:57.689> up<00:01:57.780> with<00:01:57.840> snow<00:01:58.259> etc<00:01:58.560> and

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
simply cover them up with snow etc and

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.740 
simply cover them up with snow etc and
then<00:02:00.149> it's<00:02:00.810> undetectable<00:02:01.200> by<00:02:01.560> players<00:02:01.829> and

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
then it's undetectable by players and

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.389 
then it's undetectable by players and
all<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:04.259> got<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.409> do<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.740> at<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.920> back<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.340> is

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
all you got to do is at the back this is

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.760 
all you got to do is at the back this is
just<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.790> wiring<00:02:06.409> these<00:02:07.409> are<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.619> things

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
just the wiring these are the things

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.249 
just the wiring these are the things

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
to craft these so I cannot inform you on

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.379 
to craft these so I cannot inform you on
how<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.590> do<00:02:19.769> that<00:02:19.889> right<00:02:20.159> now<00:02:20.239> but<00:02:21.239> basically

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:21.389 
how to do that right now but basically

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.830 
how to do that right now but basically
they<00:02:22.040> they<00:02:23.040> output<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:23.519> redstone<00:02:23.909> signal<00:02:24.329> when

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
they they output a redstone signal when

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.699 
they they output a redstone signal when
they<00:02:25.230> are<00:02:25.920> opened<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:27.180> as<00:02:27.569> you<00:02:28.260> know<00:02:28.409> it<00:02:28.469> was

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
they are opened so as you know it was

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.240 
they are opened so as you know it was
when<00:02:29.129> I<00:02:29.219> do<00:02:29.280> this<00:02:30.409> that<00:02:31.409> redstone<00:02:31.620> was<00:02:32.010> sent

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
when I do this that redstone was sent

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.619 
when I do this that redstone was sent
out<00:02:32.450> which<00:02:33.450> in<00:02:33.810> turn<00:02:34.700> would<00:02:35.700> have<00:02:35.879> shot<00:02:36.450> that

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
out which in turn would have shot that

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.530 
out which in turn would have shot that
lava<00:02:36.810> route<00:02:37.109> if<00:02:37.379> this<00:02:38.069> had<00:02:38.280> been<00:02:38.310> reset<00:02:38.909> this

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
lava route if this had been reset this

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.190 
lava route if this had been reset this
is<00:02:39.780> going<00:02:40.290> simply<00:02:40.799> straight<00:02:41.459> into<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.730> repeater

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
is going simply straight into a repeater

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.839 
is going simply straight into a repeater
because<00:02:43.200> they<00:02:43.349> only<00:02:43.500> emit<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.010> very<00:02:44.159> sorry

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
because they only emit a very sorry

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.429 
because they only emit a very sorry
apartment<00:02:45.209> microphone<00:02:45.599> they<00:02:46.019> made<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.260> very

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:46.439 
apartment microphone they made a very

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:48.649 
apartment microphone they made a very
weak<00:02:46.739> signal<00:02:47.010> so<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.400> just<00:02:47.669> shot<00:02:47.909> it<00:02:48.030> into<00:02:48.359> the

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
weak signal so I just shot it into the

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.259 
weak signal so I just shot it into the
RS<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.590> or<00:02:49.799> latch<00:02:49.949> that<00:02:49.980> we<00:02:50.250> have<00:02:50.430> here<00:02:50.669> this

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
RS and or latch that we have here this

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.149 
RS and or latch that we have here this
block<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.780> just<00:02:52.019> so<00:02:52.139> these<00:02:52.290> two<00:02:52.560> don't<00:02:52.769> link<00:02:52.949> up

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
block is just so these two don't link up

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.119 
block is just so these two don't link up
so<00:02:54.000> let's<00:02:54.269> put<00:02:54.449> that<00:02:54.569> black<00:02:54.780> back<00:02:55.680> let's<00:02:55.980> use

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
so let's put that black back let's use

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.429 
so let's put that black back let's use
grass<00:02:56.389> so<00:02:57.389> that's<00:02:57.810> what<00:02:57.930> happens<00:02:58.169> when<00:02:58.349> they

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439 
grass so that's what happens when they

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.659 
grass so that's what happens when they
did<00:02:58.680> do<00:02:58.980> dispensed<00:03:00.199> so<00:03:01.219> when<00:03:02.219> that<00:03:02.430> signal

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:02.669 
did do dispensed so when that signal

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:05.869 
did do dispensed so when that signal
goes<00:03:02.969> out<00:03:03.180> this<00:03:04.019> turn<00:03:04.620> this<00:03:05.040> turns<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.609> torch

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
goes out this turn this turns the torch

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.689 
goes out this turn this turns the torch
off<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.569> that<00:03:07.409> turns<00:03:07.709> that<00:03:07.980> taut<00:03:08.280> which

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:08.699 
off and that turns that taut which

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:10.729 
off and that turns that taut which
removes<00:03:09.510> power<00:03:09.780> from<00:03:09.959> this<00:03:10.049> box<00:03:10.260> turning<00:03:10.620> that

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
removes power from this box turning that

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.490 
removes power from this box turning that
torch<00:03:11.010> on<00:03:11.219> when<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:11.819> torch<00:03:12.180> turns<00:03:12.449> on<00:03:12.750> the

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
torch on when that torch turns on the

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.929 
torch on when that torch turns on the
signal<00:03:13.949> goes<00:03:14.099> all<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.280> way<00:03:14.340> down<00:03:14.430> here

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:14.939 
signal goes all the way down here

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:17.839 
signal goes all the way down here
activating<00:03:15.840> all<00:03:16.019> of<00:03:16.169> these<00:03:16.349> and<00:03:16.849> going

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
activating all of these and going

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.699 
activating all of these and going
underneath<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.479> chest<00:03:18.780> there<00:03:18.870> just<00:03:19.500> there

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
underneath that chest there just there

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.289 
underneath that chest there just there
and<00:03:20.060> activating<00:03:21.060> all<00:03:21.269> of<00:03:21.449> these<00:03:21.799> so<00:03:23.299> basically

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
and activating all of these so basically

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.689 
and activating all of these so basically
all<00:03:24.599> of<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.109> live<00:03:25.259> orders<00:03:25.560> shot<00:03:25.739> out<00:03:25.889> and<00:03:26.129> the

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:26.699 
all of the live orders shot out and the

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:29.300 
all of the live orders shot out and the
only<00:03:26.849> reason<00:03:27.120> why<00:03:27.419> I<00:03:27.449> didn't<00:03:28.049> include<00:03:28.470> it<00:03:28.709> like

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
only reason why I didn't include it like

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.039 
only reason why I didn't include it like
just<00:03:29.459> then<00:03:29.699> I<00:03:30.409> included<00:03:31.409> it<00:03:31.560> in<00:03:32.479> two<00:03:33.479> of<00:03:33.720> the

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
just then I included it in two of the

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.929 
just then I included it in two of the
dispensers<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:35.159> reason<00:03:35.489> why<00:03:35.609> we<00:03:35.759> have<00:03:35.909> more

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:35.939 
dispensers the reason why we have more

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:38.509 
dispensers the reason why we have more
than<00:03:36.299> two<00:03:36.540> is<00:03:36.989> because<00:03:37.349> some<00:03:37.769> players<00:03:38.129> might

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
than two is because some players might

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.039 
than two is because some players might
see<00:03:39.259> the<00:03:40.259> lava<00:03:40.859> in<00:03:41.400> time<00:03:41.759> to<00:03:42.239> just<00:03:42.540> run<00:03:42.750> out<00:03:42.930> the

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
see the lava in time to just run out the

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.379 
see the lava in time to just run out the
side<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:43.650> don't<00:03:43.709> know<00:03:43.949> but<00:03:44.759> anyway<00:03:44.849> that<00:03:45.209> is<00:03:45.359> a

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
side I don't know but anyway that is a

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.509 
side I don't know but anyway that is a
cool<00:03:45.750> trap<00:03:46.079> tutorial<00:03:46.709> I<00:03:46.859> thought<00:03:47.099> I'd<00:03:47.280> show

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
cool trap tutorial I thought I'd show

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.099 
cool trap tutorial I thought I'd show
you<00:03:47.549> guys<00:03:48.470> yeah<00:03:49.470> I<00:03:49.680> will<00:03:49.979> link<00:03:50.220> a<00:03:51.109> snapshot

what's a snapshots of if you want to
know<00:03:59.639> more<00:04:00.090> about<00:04:00.150> this<00:04:01.099> their<00:04:02.099> account

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
know more about this their account

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.780 
know more about this their account
there's<00:04:03.000> been<00:04:03.359> all<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.930> snapshots<00:04:04.169> that<00:04:05.040> 13<00:04:05.459> W

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
there's been all the snapshots that 13 W

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.619 
there's been all the snapshots that 13 W
o<00:04:05.909> 1<00:04:06.269> o<00:04:06.569> 2<00:04:06.719> 3<00:04:07.409> 4<00:04:07.949> and<00:04:08.189> now<00:04:08.669> 5<00:04:09.000> so<00:04:09.269> you<00:04:09.329> might<00:04:09.539> have

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
o 1 o 2 3 4 and now 5 so you might have

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:10.729 
o 1 o 2 3 4 and now 5 so you might have
a<00:04:09.719> bit<00:04:09.840> of<00:04:09.870> catching<00:04:10.139> up<00:04:10.319> to<00:04:10.469> do<00:04:10.560> if<00:04:10.650> you

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
a bit of catching up to do if you

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.330 
a bit of catching up to do if you
haven't<00:04:11.039> heard<00:04:11.189> about<00:04:11.340> these<00:04:11.609> but<00:04:12.509> otherwise

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
haven't heard about these but otherwise

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.319 
haven't heard about these but otherwise
really<00:04:14.340> all<00:04:14.489> they<00:04:14.579> implemented<00:04:15.209> this

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
really all they implemented this

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.229 
really all they implemented this
snapshot<00:04:15.629> was<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:17.190> only<00:04:17.310> block<00:04:17.579> implemented

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
snapshot was the only block implemented

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.930 
snapshot was the only block implemented
as<00:04:18.359> that<00:04:18.750> I<00:04:18.780> can<00:04:18.989> remember<00:04:19.229> is<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:20.039> snow<00:04:20.340> which

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
as that I can remember is the snow which

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.490 
as that I can remember is the snow which
is<00:04:20.969> really<00:04:21.389> cool<00:04:21.599> because<00:04:21.719> now<00:04:21.989> you<00:04:22.049> can<00:04:22.320> make
