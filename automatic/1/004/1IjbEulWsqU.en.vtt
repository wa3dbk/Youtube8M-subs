00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:20.110

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.020

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:26.050

 dill and 1 clove of garlic 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.600
 it is optional I will take care first 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.600
 eggplants 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:01:03.160
 show you need to wash and cut 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:08.030
 brush no need to cut it right 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:14.360
 thin plates which petals 3 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:17.900
 millimeter thick now I will fold 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:22.540
 eggplant on a plate and each piece 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:26.270
 Salt will be folded up straight 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:32.119
 15 minutes leave eggplant and'll do 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:37.510
 stuffed greens obama varnish dried cucumber 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:43.220
 cleaned the garlic, too, put in a bowl 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:44.180
 Lorak oil should be room oil 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:57.740
 temperatures 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:02:00.800
 nuts here less often celery cucumber if 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.570
 you don't want to mess around at all 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:08.350
 can buy philadelphia cheese 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:11.570
 this method add nuts there 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:15.190
 garlic if the condition is green and you 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.190
 you get almost the same result 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.070
 grind hand blender hydrogen 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.070
 oils 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:28.390
 we get a lot of stuffing ready 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:31.870
 if you are an opponent of fatty can instead 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.519
 butter add a little low-fat sour cream 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.079
 just look to not filling 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:40.450
 It turned out very liquid filling is ready 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:41.909
 back to eggplant so I was 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.510
 easier with them 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:47.609
 i put on a paper towel and lightly 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:53.200
 I will press 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:55.950
 covering the top with another put the pan 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.950
 on gas 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:05.290
 I warm up very thinly the words zovu fat 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:09.129
 Eggplants are very fond of fat and I do not want 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.750
 so that our dish turned bold 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.590
 eggplant victims from two sides to 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.200
 readiness 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:18.519
 on top also a thin layer of you by 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.189
 lubricate need a little cool and after 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:27.099
 this can be minimized 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:31.919
 rolls put on a thick edge stuffing 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.919
 and neatly turn off 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:42.150
 like this if somewhere you have eggplant 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.910
 broke through nothing when you 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:50.610
 will roll it closes you 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:53.700
 a whole part and dachshund as you can see all 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.150
 petals with some panties can be a little 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.000
 and in another way you can if you have a whole 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.220
 eggplant petals 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:08.400
 norman live their stuffing and after that 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:10.410
 roll as roll do you like more 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.060
 like or think you like 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.060
 faster and more convenient
