 good these guys is and pk 1 2 3 one two 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.689
 three in which what we will find 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.759
 it will be a minecraft or an abandoned mine 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.230
 and well I know that many will tell me not 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.300
 Well, it's not that hard, but I think 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.009
 that is fine you can find it fast 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.239
 for the basics we will not start 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.950
 generate around here you can see that 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.440
 we will give the infinite world of course 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.030
 create world and well the mine does not 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.469
 is nothing away game guys is over here 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.629
 you can see we're waiting for this 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.550
 load wait I hope this does not 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.530
 class because it's normal by now they can 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.870
 see guys that we appear in this 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.309
 world and well then they decide if it is not 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.129
 so ugly can you see that for here 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.079
 we have a biome of well plains and not 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.820
 I'm bad the plains can see that 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.309
 on this part we have the people 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.170
 of what would be a swamp or a biome of 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.699
 swamp here we have mountains so 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.409
 Well, I do not know why he's loading 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.690
 all the tricks but hey ok they can 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.640
 see that in this part we have a forest 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.590
 robust or a forest that have 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.330
 giant conscious together trees and 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.920
 everything so so nothing here can see 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.090
 that is not such an ugly being to start 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.520
 so then 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.170
 guys is that in the part of space 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.670
 you can see that here what we will do 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.640
 it will be mine ok 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.530
 we will download a capture we do not want 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.020
 we want to go down here you can see that 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.520
 we will go down we will just go down and go down 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.130
 we will go down and well then in this part 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.600
 we have coal that they do not see us either 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.429
 We would be bitter here we go down 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.560
 guys can see that we go down here 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.359
 we go down and down and we will come across 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.329
 nothing more and nothing less than a coma that 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:41.280
 here we go down and it goes down and good 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.829
 because here we hope and can see that 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.630
 we would run into this coca then 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.250
 this part I think we had a bit of 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.289
 iron that is not so bad either 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.780
 you can see that that's very nice a 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.520
 little of dior milestone here but good I 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.709
 we want now guys was to go towards 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.750
 forward here we walk and we 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:59.869
 we will find a hole in which 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.879
 we have what would be the abandoned mine 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.530
 there were guys ok it was a matter of seconds 

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:06.659
 so they can see what can 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.750
 see here we have it and well then 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.910
 remember that the mines are a 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.860
 little big so I think that 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.780
 this would be all I hope that you have 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.190
 liked you know that you can leave your 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.390
 light as between favorite and then 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.160
 remember to share 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.990
 with all your friends so they know with 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.940
 regarding this channel and that every day 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.470

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.510
 you want to see kaymer guys we're already 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.370
 in this abandoned mine that is in 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.920
 actually I think they are not so small in 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.600
 reality because I do not know what size they are 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.000
 the mines these but if I'm not bad 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.280
 we also have what would be a spa 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.320
 where spyder xosÃ© to the spiders that 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.790
 over here I think I can look for you guys 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.620

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.140

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.440
 put the torches that was that is the 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.440
