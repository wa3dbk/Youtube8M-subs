subscribers yet we're currently on 470
but<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.170> decided<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.980> really<00:00:26.010> want<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.460> make<00:00:26.580> a

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.880 
but I decided I really want to make a
new<00:00:26.789> video<00:00:27.090> with<00:00:27.269> my<00:00:27.359> new<00:00:27.510> camera<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.170> I

new video with my new camera and I

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.689 
new video with my new camera and I
thought<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.189> would<00:00:29.369> be<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.490> perfect

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
thought this would be the perfect

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.749 
thought this would be the perfect
candidate<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.599> also<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:32.160> may<00:00:32.430> as<00:00:32.489> well<00:00:32.610> do

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
candidate and also that I may as well do

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.310 
candidate and also that I may as well do
it<00:00:32.880> now<00:00:32.910> because<00:00:33.390> I'm<00:00:33.540> also<00:00:33.719> gonna<00:00:33.930> be<00:00:34.110> making
