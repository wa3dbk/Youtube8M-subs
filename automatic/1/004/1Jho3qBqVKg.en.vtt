so what are the solutions let's talk
about<00:03:02.060> a<00:03:02.209> few<00:03:02.419> of<00:03:02.480> them<00:03:02.719> one<00:03:03.230> of<00:03:03.260> them<00:03:03.500> is<00:03:03.680> a

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
about a few of them one of them is a

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.659 
about a few of them one of them is a
change<00:03:04.099> in<00:03:04.250> our<00:03:04.400> cultural<00:03:05.349> aging

households<00:03:09.319> are<00:03:09.439> something<00:03:09.829> that<00:03:09.859> have

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
households are something that have

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.640 
households are something that have
started<00:03:10.909> to<00:03:11.180> become<00:03:11.329> more<00:03:11.719> commonplace<00:03:12.169> and<00:03:12.560> I

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
started to become more commonplace and I

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.530 
started to become more commonplace and I
think<00:03:12.859> will<00:03:12.980> become<00:03:13.280> even<00:03:13.430> more<00:03:13.579> so<00:03:14.000> over<00:03:14.299> time

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
think will become even more so over time

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.649 
think will become even more so over time

the second is that we as a country have
