00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
for quite a while now which we

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.580 
for quite a while now which we

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
definitely needed it's been we had

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.980 
definitely needed it's been we had
obviously<00:01:04.070> had<00:01:04.159> a<00:01:04.309> super<00:01:04.759> hot<00:01:04.970> and<00:01:05.000> super<00:01:05.269> dry

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
obviously had a super hot and super dry

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.530 
obviously had a super hot and super dry
summer<00:01:06.520> practically<00:01:07.520> hold<00:01:07.759> state<00:01:08.000> of<00:01:08.149> Texas

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
summer practically hold state of Texas

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.890 
summer practically hold state of Texas
wasn't<00:01:08.899> in<00:01:09.290> an<00:01:09.409> extreme<00:01:09.860> drought<00:01:10.250> um<00:01:12.610> but<00:01:13.610> uh

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
wasn't in an extreme drought um but uh

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.990 
wasn't in an extreme drought um but uh
we've<00:01:14.900> been<00:01:14.930> getting<00:01:15.170> a<00:01:15.409> lot<00:01:15.590> of<00:01:15.650> rain<00:01:16.040> and<00:01:16.550> so

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
we've been getting a lot of rain and so

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.380 
we've been getting a lot of rain and so
I<00:01:17.360> think<00:01:17.840> if<00:01:17.990> you<00:01:18.080> look<00:01:18.260> at<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:19.390> drought

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
I think if you look at the drought

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.880 
I think if you look at the drought
levels<00:01:20.810> across<00:01:21.050> the<00:01:21.170> state<00:01:21.650> they're<00:01:22.010> actually

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
levels across the state they're actually

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.740 
levels across the state they're actually
most<00:01:24.890> of<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.130> state<00:01:25.400> is<00:01:25.549> only<00:01:25.760> an<00:01:26.000> ass<00:01:26.390> like

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
most of the state is only an ass like

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.490 
most of the state is only an ass like
stage<00:01:27.110> one<00:01:27.470> drew<00:01:27.770> out<00:01:27.860> now<00:01:28.100> to<00:01:28.880> arias<00:01:29.299> and<00:01:29.500> like

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
stage one drew out now to arias and like

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.430 
stage one drew out now to arias and like
I<00:01:30.710> guess<00:01:30.950> it's<00:01:31.190> ona<00:01:31.479> goes<00:01:32.479> up<00:01:32.659> to<00:01:32.810> stage<00:01:33.080> four

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
I guess it's ona goes up to stage four

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.370 
I guess it's ona goes up to stage four
or<00:01:33.620> something<00:01:34.390> but<00:01:36.400> anyways<00:01:37.930> not<00:01:38.930> so<00:01:39.170> dry

thing<00:04:56.270> I<00:04:56.390> saw<00:04:56.600> this<00:04:56.780> morning<00:04:57.050> was<00:04:57.440> about<00:04:57.790> the

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
thing I saw this morning was about the

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.600 
thing I saw this morning was about the
Miami<00:04:59.180> Heat<00:04:59.450> and<00:04:59.690> so<00:05:00.500> they<00:05:00.620> Miami<00:05:01.190> Heat<00:05:01.430> have

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
Miami Heat and so they Miami Heat have

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.070 
Miami Heat and so they Miami Heat have
the<00:05:01.700> best<00:05:01.910> record<00:05:02.090> in<00:05:02.300> NBA<00:05:02.420> right<00:05:02.780> now<00:05:02.810> I<00:05:02.930> think

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
the best record in NBA right now I think

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.350 
the best record in NBA right now I think
they're<00:05:03.350> tied<00:05:03.590> with<00:05:03.830> the<00:05:03.860> Oklahoma<00:05:04.820> City<00:05:07.360> with

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
they're tied with the Oklahoma City with

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.360 
they're tied with the Oklahoma City with
the<00:05:08.660> I<00:05:08.810> think<00:05:09.020> its<00:05:09.140> twenty<00:05:09.530> six<00:05:09.800> and<00:05:10.010> seven<00:05:12.370> but

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
the I think its twenty six and seven but

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:21.660 
the I think its twenty six and seven but
I<00:05:16.720> said<00:05:17.720> they've<00:05:18.490> led<00:05:19.490> by<00:05:19.520> double<00:05:20.240> digits<00:05:20.270> in

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
I said they've led by double digits in

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:29.620 
I said they've led by double digits in
28<00:05:22.670> out<00:05:22.880> of<00:05:23.230> there<00:05:24.230> 33<00:05:24.710> games<00:05:25.300> and<00:05:27.910> have<00:05:28.910> been

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.659 
dominant they've been in their games I
the<00:05:41.300> only<00:05:41.330> team<00:05:41.810> with<00:05:41.960> more<00:05:42.380> more<00:05:43.190> games<00:05:43.460> that

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
the only team with more more games that

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.909 
the only team with more more games that
they've<00:05:43.790> loved<00:05:44.030> by<00:05:44.120> 20<00:05:44.419> points<00:05:44.450> was<00:05:45.550> the<00:05:46.840> Bulls

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
they've loved by 20 points was the Bulls

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.380 
they've loved by 20 points was the Bulls
think<00:05:48.919> they're<00:05:49.070> bulls<00:05:49.310> are<00:05:49.610> have<00:05:49.880> the<00:05:50.000> second

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.390 
think they're bulls are have the second

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.950 
think they're bulls are have the second
best<00:05:50.540> record<00:05:50.720> in<00:05:51.020> the<00:05:51.080> NBA<00:05:51.940> well<00:05:52.960> technically

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
best record in the NBA well technically

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:02.460 
best record in the NBA well technically
third<00:05:55.900> but<00:05:56.900> I<00:05:58.270> think<00:05:59.270> they<00:05:59.360> have<00:05:59.510> eight<00:06:00.260> losses

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
third but I think they have eight losses

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.710 
third but I think they have eight losses
but<00:06:03.470> yeah<00:06:03.770> just<00:06:04.120> basically<00:06:05.120> just<00:06:05.419> going

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
but yeah just basically just going

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.409 
but yeah just basically just going
through<00:06:05.930> and<00:06:06.700> showing<00:06:07.700> how<00:06:07.850> dominant<00:06:08.240> they've

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
through and showing how dominant they've

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:09.730 
through and showing how dominant they've
been<00:06:08.570> out<00:06:08.750> I<00:06:08.780> don't<00:06:09.110> really<00:06:09.200> care<00:06:09.500> about<00:06:09.560> the

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
been out I don't really care about the

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.770 
been out I don't really care about the
heat<00:06:10.010> think<00:06:10.580> I<00:06:10.669> only<00:06:10.700> know<00:06:11.000> one<00:06:11.240> person<00:06:11.270> who's

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
heat think I only know one person who's

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.650 
heat think I only know one person who's
actually<00:06:11.930> heat<00:06:12.380> fan<00:06:13.390> I<00:06:15.520> don't<00:06:16.520> know<00:06:16.660> the

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:17.660 
actually heat fan I don't know the

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.570 
actually heat fan I don't know the
Lakers<00:06:18.050> aren't<00:06:18.320> really<00:06:18.560> the<00:06:18.710> the<00:06:18.740> team<00:06:19.310> to

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
Lakers aren't really the the team to

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.440 
Lakers aren't really the the team to
hate<00:06:19.790> anymore<00:06:20.270> it's<00:06:20.450> the<00:06:20.630> heat<00:06:20.950> no<00:06:21.950> one<00:06:22.070> really

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:22.450 
hate anymore it's the heat no one really

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:27.130 
hate anymore it's the heat no one really
cares<00:06:23.450> I<00:06:23.840> think<00:06:24.500> I<00:06:25.210> probably<00:06:26.210> the<00:06:26.930> biggest

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:27.140 
cares I think I probably the biggest

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.560 
cares I think I probably the biggest
thing<00:06:27.320> there<00:06:27.680> is<00:06:27.830> LeBron<00:06:28.330> because<00:06:29.330> either

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:29.570 
thing there is LeBron because either

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.460 
thing there is LeBron because either
either<00:06:30.229> love<00:06:30.560> them<00:06:30.590> or<00:06:30.800> hate<00:06:30.860> them<00:06:31.010> so<00:06:31.729> I<00:06:32.470> don't

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
either love them or hate them so I don't

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.050 
either love them or hate them so I don't
