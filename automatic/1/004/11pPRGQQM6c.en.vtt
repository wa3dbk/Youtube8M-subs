the vehicle multibody which is used in

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.390 
the vehicle multibody which is used in
rollovers<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.230> it<00:00:10.230> also<00:00:10.530> allows<00:00:11.099> you<00:00:11.280> to

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
rollovers and it also allows you to

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.430 
rollovers and it also allows you to
enable<00:00:11.610> contacts<00:00:12.330> between<00:00:12.480> multibody

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
objects and the multi body shapes

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.210 
objects and the multi body shapes
comprising<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.350> rollover<00:00:16.650> model<00:00:16.949> for<00:00:17.160> the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
comprising the rollover model for the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.620 
comprising the rollover model for the
vehicle<00:00:17.869> so<00:00:18.869> what<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.289> see<00:00:19.439> here<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.740> a

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
vehicle so what you see here is a

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.200 
vehicle so what you see here is a
multi-party<00:00:21.630> vehicle<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.260> built<00:00:22.830> and

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
multi-party vehicle that I built and

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.279 
multi-party vehicle that I built and
brought<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.449> at<00:00:25.970> to<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.000> vehicle<00:00:27.269> I'll<00:00:28.019> show<00:00:28.199> you

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
brought in at to a vehicle I'll show you

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.679 
brought in at to a vehicle I'll show you
how<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.439> can<00:00:28.529> do<00:00:28.769> this<00:00:29.330> I'm<00:00:30.330> just<00:00:30.449> going<00:00:30.630> to

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
how you can do this I'm just going to

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.400 
how you can do this I'm just going to
close<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:30.900> one<00:00:33.920> alright<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.130> your<00:00:35.430> typical

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
close this one alright so your typical

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.430 
close this one alright so your typical
multi<00:00:37.410> body<00:00:37.590> shape<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> one<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.510> you

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
multi body shape this is a one that you

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.900 
multi body shape this is a one that you
know<00:00:40.500> I've<00:00:40.649> tuned<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.100> kind<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.489> try<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.730> match

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
know I've tuned to kind of try and match

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.840 
know I've tuned to kind of try and match
the<00:00:42.180> shape<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.660> vehicle<00:00:43.670> but<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.730> can

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
the shape of this vehicle but you can

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.700 
the shape of this vehicle but you can
see<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.629> can't<00:00:45.870> do<00:00:46.170> things<00:00:46.350> like<00:00:46.500> match

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
see that you can't do things like match

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.340 
see that you can't do things like match
hood<00:00:47.160> profiles<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.969> windshields<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.809> this

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
hood profiles and windshields and this

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.500 
hood profiles and windshields and this
sort<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.559> thing<00:00:49.940> so<00:00:50.940> it'll<00:00:51.030> be<00:00:51.090> nice<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.300> be

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
sort of thing so it'll be nice to be

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.490 
sort of thing so it'll be nice to be
able<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.750> import<00:00:52.230> your<00:00:52.350> own<00:00:52.649> shape<00:00:54.140> so<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.170> can

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
able to import your own shape so you can

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.299 
able to import your own shape so you can
do<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.829> now<00:00:57.260> editing<00:00:58.260> multi<00:00:58.559> bodies<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.070> not

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
do that now editing multi bodies is not

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.080 
do that now editing multi bodies is not
the<00:00:59.579> most<00:00:59.940> simple<00:01:00.840> thing<00:01:01.109> but<00:01:01.820> what<00:01:02.820> I've<00:01:02.940> done

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
the most simple thing but what I've done

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.550 
the most simple thing but what I've done
is<00:01:03.420> brought<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.559> 3d<00:01:05.810> dxf<00:01:06.810> shape<00:01:07.200> one<00:01:07.500> of

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
is brought in a 3d dxf shape one of

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.590 
is brought in a 3d dxf shape one of
those<00:01:07.650> shrink-wrap<00:01:08.010> ones<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:09.270> match<00:01:09.540> my

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
those shrink-wrap ones to match my

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.890 
those shrink-wrap ones to match my
vehicle<00:01:10.080> shape<00:01:10.229> minute<00:01:10.500> transparent<00:01:11.100> and

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
vehicle shape minute transparent and

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.300 
vehicle shape minute transparent and
made<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.930> whole<00:01:13.080> bunch<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.350> multi<00:01:13.680> bodies<00:01:13.979> to

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
made a whole bunch of multi bodies to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.490 
made a whole bunch of multi bodies to
try<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.670> match<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.270> shape<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.080> vehicle

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
try and match the shape of the vehicle

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.340 
try and match the shape of the vehicle
so<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.130> see<00:01:17.310> there's<00:01:17.549> lots<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:18.350> detail

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
so you can see there's lots of detail

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.980 
so you can see there's lots of detail
there<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.450> these<00:01:21.450> are<00:01:21.570> just<00:01:21.600> shapes<00:01:21.900> that

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
there and these are just shapes that

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.160 
there and these are just shapes that
I've<00:01:22.140> chosen<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:23.310> made<00:01:24.180> some<00:01:24.210> different<00:01:24.780> system

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
I've chosen I made some different system

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.450 
I've chosen I made some different system
color<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.650> can<00:01:25.799> move<00:01:25.890> these<00:01:26.040> things<00:01:26.250> around

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
color so I can move these things around

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.910 
color so I can move these things around
but<00:01:27.270> each<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.750> these<00:01:27.840> shapes<00:01:28.170> has<00:01:28.439> its<00:01:28.770> own

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
but each of these shapes has its own

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.730 
but each of these shapes has its own
editable<00:01:29.490> properties<00:01:29.939> for<00:01:30.390> stiffness<00:01:31.350> and

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
editable properties for stiffness and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.920 
editable properties for stiffness and
the<00:01:31.799> restitution<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.210> contact<00:01:33.780> friction<00:01:35.930> so

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
the restitution and contact friction so

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.899 
the restitution and contact friction so
I<00:01:37.229> just<00:01:37.650> all<00:01:37.799> did<00:01:38.130> all<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.369> with<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.610> multi

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
I just all did all this with a multi

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:46.760 
I just all did all this with a multi
body<00:01:39.090> editor<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:41.460> see<00:01:42.560> all<00:01:44.360> be<00:01:45.360> changed<00:01:45.390> as<00:01:46.290> I

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
body editor and see all be changed as I

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.690 
body editor and see all be changed as I
like<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.280> set<00:01:48.180> each<00:01:48.329> bodies<00:01:48.840> properties

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
like and set each bodies properties

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.550 
like and set each bodies properties
however<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.729> want<00:01:50.909> it

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.260 

and<00:01:54.799> then<00:01:55.759> I<00:01:55.909> just<00:01:56.149> exported<00:01:56.869> this<00:01:58.090> multi<00:01:59.090> body

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
and then I just exported this multi body

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.460 
and then I just exported this multi body
shape<00:01:59.710> using<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:01.479> custom<00:02:02.479> vehicle<00:02:02.930> export<00:02:03.350> I

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
shape using the custom vehicle export I

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.609 
shape using the custom vehicle export I
just<00:02:04.390> give<00:02:05.390> it<00:02:05.509> one<00:02:05.539> of<00:02:05.750> our<00:02:05.840> name<00:02:05.960> I<00:02:06.140> want<00:02:06.289> with

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
just give it one of our name I want with

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.610 
just give it one of our name I want with
the<00:02:06.799> mb<00:02:07.280> def<00:02:08.619> extension<00:02:09.619> and<00:02:11.260> then<00:02:12.260> that

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
the mb def extension and then that

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.089 
the mb def extension and then that
creates<00:02:14.019> this<00:02:15.019> file<00:02:16.000> over<00:02:17.000> here<00:02:17.830> i've<00:02:18.830> got

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
creates this file over here i've got

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.089 
creates this file over here i've got
i've<00:02:20.000> created<00:02:20.269> one<00:02:20.510> called<00:02:20.750> generic<00:02:21.170> SUV<00:02:21.860> full

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
i've created one called generic SUV full

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.500 
i've created one called generic SUV full
and<00:02:22.840> if<00:02:23.840> we<00:02:23.959> just<00:02:24.170> bring<00:02:24.980> back<00:02:25.430> our<00:02:25.910> pc<00:02:26.239> crash

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
and if we just bring back our pc crash

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.229 
and if we just bring back our pc crash
run<00:02:27.819> and<00:02:28.959> then<00:02:29.959> it's<00:02:30.110> just<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.290> drag-and-drop

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
run and then it's just a drag-and-drop

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.630 
run and then it's just a drag-and-drop
you<00:02:32.239> can<00:02:32.360> see<00:02:32.480> how<00:02:32.569> i<00:02:32.630> got<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.900> little<00:02:33.640> cursor

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
you can see how i got the little cursor

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:45.360 
you can see how i got the little cursor
there<00:02:39.549> and<00:02:40.549> now<00:02:40.819> when<00:02:41.030> i<00:02:41.060> run<00:02:41.330> my<00:02:41.360> simulation<00:02:42.049> I

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.490 

get<00:02:46.370> that<00:02:47.560> complex<00:02:48.560> multi<00:02:48.920> body<00:02:49.099> shape<00:02:50.500> you

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
get that complex multi body shape you

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.259 
get that complex multi body shape you
can<00:02:51.620> see<00:02:51.769> I've<00:02:51.890> probably<00:02:52.400> put<00:02:52.670> this<00:02:52.790> thing<00:02:53.000> a

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
can see I've probably put this thing a

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.020 
can see I've probably put this thing a
little<00:02:53.540> it's<00:02:54.019> not<00:02:54.200> quite<00:02:54.470> registered<00:02:55.030> right

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
little it's not quite registered right

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.430 
little it's not quite registered right
on<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.299> vehicle<00:02:56.630> here<00:02:56.780> which<00:02:56.989> probably<00:02:57.200> shift

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
on the vehicle here which probably shift

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.150 
on the vehicle here which probably shift
that<00:02:57.590> shape<00:02:57.769> back<00:02:58.010> for<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.340> CG<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:58.670> little<00:02:58.880> bit

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.400 

but<00:03:04.160> now<00:03:04.280> this<00:03:04.489> is<00:03:04.640> that<00:03:04.820> the<00:03:05.359> contact<00:03:06.140> shape

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
but now this is that the contact shape

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.990 
but now this is that the contact shape
that's<00:03:06.829> going<00:03:06.950> to<00:03:07.040> be<00:03:07.070> used<00:03:07.310> for<00:03:07.970> the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.849 
that's going to be used for the
rollovers<00:03:10.930> so<00:03:11.930> I<00:03:11.959> no<00:03:12.260> longer<00:03:12.470> have<00:03:12.739> the

to move it and I want to bring in a

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.340 
to move it and I want to bring in a
multi-party<00:03:48.500> pedestrian<00:03:49.870> so<00:03:50.870> I'm<00:03:51.049> just<00:03:51.200> going

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
multi-party pedestrian so I'm just going

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.160 
multi-party pedestrian so I'm just going
to<00:03:51.410> go<00:03:51.500> down<00:03:51.680> to<00:03:51.709> pedestrians<00:03:52.310> here<00:03:53.049> bring<00:03:54.049> in

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
to go down to pedestrians here bring in

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.099 
to go down to pedestrians here bring in
the<00:03:54.230> pedestrian<00:03:55.000> right<00:03:56.000> there<00:03:58.900> there<00:03:59.900> he<00:04:00.079> is

the pedestrian right there there he is

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.880 
the pedestrian right there there he is
so<00:04:01.100> I<00:04:01.160> want<00:04:01.250> to<00:04:01.370> move<00:04:01.489> them<00:04:01.639> a<00:04:01.670> little<00:04:01.700> closer

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
so I want to move them a little closer

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:10.930 
so I want to move them a little closer
i<00:04:05.440> tow<00:04:06.440> truck<00:04:09.459> then<00:04:10.459> if<00:04:10.550> I<00:04:10.640> go<00:04:10.760> to<00:04:10.819> my

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
i tow truck then if I go to my

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.650 
i tow truck then if I go to my
multi-party<00:04:11.360> system<00:04:11.390> properties<00:04:13.660> my

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660

settings tab is a new vehicle ellipsoid
contact<00:04:19.130> option<00:04:21.910> and<00:04:22.910> that<00:04:24.310> lets<00:04:25.310> me<00:04:26.740> step

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
contact option and that lets me step

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.500

down<00:04:27.919> my<00:04:28.070> time<00:04:28.220> step<00:04:28.580> here<00:04:28.790> a<00:04:28.820> little<00:04:29.030> bit<00:04:29.210> just

down my time step here a little bit just
in<00:04:29.630> case

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.050 

and<00:04:44.570> you<00:04:45.570> can<00:04:45.690> see<00:04:45.930> that<00:04:46.490> the<00:04:47.490> contacts<00:04:47.910> are

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
compliance of the entire system so it

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.360 
compliance of the entire system so it
used<00:05:08.670> to<00:05:08.760> be<00:05:09.090> that<00:05:09.270> a<00:05:09.410> ir<00:05:10.410> it<00:05:10.680> is<00:05:10.800> still<00:05:11.160> with<00:05:11.340> a

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
dxf vehicle that you would have stiff or

dxf vehicle that you would have stiff or
rigid<00:05:14.850> windshield<00:05:15.600> and<00:05:15.840> so<00:05:16.140> the<00:05:16.290> head<00:05:16.440> would

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
rigid windshield and so the head would

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.510 
rigid windshield and so the head would
have<00:05:16.620> to<00:05:17.090> be<00:05:18.090> softened<00:05:18.840> to<00:05:19.340> compensate<00:05:20.340> for

have to be softened to compensate for

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.310 
have to be softened to compensate for
that<00:05:20.550> that<00:05:21.090> stiffness<00:05:21.300> now<00:05:21.930> you<00:05:21.990> can<00:05:22.170> have<00:05:22.290> a

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
that that stiffness now you can have a

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.380 
that that stiffness now you can have a
softer<00:05:22.740> windshield<00:05:23.040> element<00:05:23.400> like<00:05:24.090> I<00:05:24.210> have

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
softer windshield element like I have

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.720 
softer windshield element like I have
here<00:05:24.720> so<00:05:25.410> the<00:05:25.530> head<00:05:25.680> to<00:05:25.830> penetrate<00:05:26.610> the

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730
