out now this is all information but I'm
still<00:02:57.280> think<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.490> holds<00:02:57.640> up<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.120> here's<00:02:58.660> why

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
still think it holds up and here's why

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.080 
still think it holds up and here's why
if<00:02:59.230> you<00:03:00.160> hang<00:03:00.340> around<00:03:00.490> the<00:03:00.670> Crypt<00:03:00.910> art

if you hang around the Crypt art
eventually<00:03:01.959> he<00:03:02.350> will<00:03:02.530> say<00:03:02.830> or<00:03:03.130> extend<00:03:03.790> king

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030
