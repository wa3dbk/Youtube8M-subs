00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
isn't that family so I didn't do a lot

isn't that family so I didn't do a lot
of<00:03:27.519> that<00:03:27.699> stuff<00:03:27.910> fortunately<00:03:28.419> I<00:03:28.599> learned<00:03:29.139> a

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
of that stuff fortunately I learned a

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.140 
of that stuff fortunately I learned a
lot<00:03:29.769> about<00:03:29.889> it<00:03:30.160> because<00:03:30.400> of<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.639> but<00:03:30.849> at<00:03:31.060> the

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
lot about it because of that but at the

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:33.669 
same time I'm still kind of just making

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:35.640 
same time I'm still kind of just making

turtle or a surfer or whatever but at
the<00:03:40.299> same<00:03:40.449> time<00:03:40.569> I'm<00:03:40.690> making<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.349> stuff

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
the same time I'm making the stuff

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.369 
the same time I'm making the stuff
around<00:03:41.709> it<00:03:42.099> up<00:03:42.220> just<00:03:42.669> because<00:03:42.879> the<00:03:43.660> geometric

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
around it up just because the geometric
