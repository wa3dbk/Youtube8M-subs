00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.710 

okay<00:00:02.610> we're<00:00:02.879> going<00:00:03.030> to<00:00:03.149> show<00:00:03.300> you<00:00:03.360> how<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.629> use

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
okay we're going to show you how to use

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.309 
okay we're going to show you how to use
Claire<00:00:04.230> to<00:00:04.529> correct<00:00:04.890> images<00:00:05.720> this<00:00:06.720> example<00:00:07.049> is

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
Claire to correct images this example is

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.540 
Claire to correct images this example is
going<00:00:07.470> to<00:00:07.529> work<00:00:07.620> with<00:00:07.770> two<00:00:07.919> different<00:00:08.099> images

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
going to work with two different images

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.780 
going to work with two different images
although<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:10.139> images<00:00:10.530> both<00:00:10.679> have<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.370> color

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
although the images both have a color

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.759 
although the images both have a color
target<00:00:12.300> in<00:00:12.450> them<00:00:12.719> which<00:00:13.110> you<00:00:13.259> can<00:00:13.410> see<00:00:13.559> over

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
target in them which you can see over

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.799 
target in them which you can see over
here<00:00:13.799> we're<00:00:14.759> going<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:14.940> use<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.179> color<00:00:15.360> target

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
here we're going to use the color target

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.920 
here we're going to use the color target
in<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.109> first<00:00:16.320> image<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:17.460> correct<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.539> second

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
in the first image to correct the second

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.460 
in the first image to correct the second
image<00:00:19.580> so<00:00:20.580> here's<00:00:21.449> our<00:00:21.689> example<00:00:21.810> it's<00:00:22.410> a

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
image so here's our example it's a

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.519 
image so here's our example it's a
picture<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:23.369> piece<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.580> artwork<00:00:24.080> and<00:00:25.080> here's

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
picture of a piece of artwork and here's

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.810 
picture of a piece of artwork and here's
a<00:00:25.619> color<00:00:25.800> target<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.400> can<00:00:26.460> see<00:00:26.640> by<00:00:26.760> the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
a color target you can see by the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.089 
a color target you can see by the
lighting<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:27.449> was<00:00:27.630> really<00:00:28.439> badly<00:00:28.769> lit

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
lighting that this was really badly lit

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.810 
lighting that this was really badly lit
it's<00:00:29.849> all<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.179> by<00:00:30.300> fluorescent<00:00:30.980> so<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
it's all that by fluorescent so the

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.520 
it's all that by fluorescent so the
first<00:00:33.059> thing<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.300> do<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.510> we<00:00:33.840> need<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.200> isolate

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
first thing to do is we need to isolate

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.760 
first thing to do is we need to isolate
the<00:00:35.010> color<00:00:35.219> target<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:37.190> because<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.520> is

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
the color target and because this is is

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.869 
the color target and because this is is
vertically<00:00:40.770> oriented<00:00:41.160> we<00:00:41.460> need<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.700> rotate

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
vertically oriented we need to rotate

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.139 
vertically oriented we need to rotate
the<00:00:42.360> rotate<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.170> image<00:00:44.120> and<00:00:45.500> then<00:00:47.149> Claire

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
the rotate the image and then Claire

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.330 
the rotate the image and then Claire
uses<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.750> crop<00:00:48.960> window<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.800> define<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
uses the crop window to define the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.270 
uses the crop window to define the
target<00:00:50.700> area<00:00:50.899> so<00:00:51.899> i'll<00:00:52.260> take<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> crop<00:00:52.860> window

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
target area so i'll take the crop window

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.700 
target area so i'll take the crop window
and<00:00:53.520> drag<00:00:53.789> over<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.360> target<00:00:54.570> like<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.230> and

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
and drag over the target like this and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.729 
and drag over the target like this and
i'll<00:00:56.309> go<00:00:56.460> ahead<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.670> zoom<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> bit<00:00:57.559> so<00:00:58.559> it's

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
i'll go ahead and zoom in a bit so it's

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.779 
i'll go ahead and zoom in a bit so it's
easier<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.160> see<00:00:59.690> there<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.399> and<00:01:02.399> now<00:01:02.520> over

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
easier to see there it is and now over

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.759 
easier to see there it is and now over
here<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.180> claire<00:01:03.719> here's<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.170> clear<00:01:04.379> window

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
here and claire here's the clear window

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.000 
here and claire here's the clear window
to<00:01:05.430> pick<00:01:05.610> our<00:01:05.760> target<00:01:06.210> which<00:01:07.170> will<00:01:07.409> be<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> 30

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
to pick our target which will be a 30

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.289 
to pick our target which will be a 30
patch<00:01:08.369> QP<00:01:09.299> card<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.080> we<00:01:10.830> click<00:01:11.070> rescan<00:01:11.970> and

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
patch QP card and we click rescan and

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.510 
patch QP card and we click rescan and
you<00:01:13.200> see<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> target<00:01:13.979> patches<00:01:14.369> have

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
you see that the target patches have

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.370 
you see that the target patches have
appeared<00:01:14.850> over<00:01:15.119> if<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> crop<00:01:15.509> window<00:01:15.900> but

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
appeared over if the crop window but

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.840 
appeared over if the crop window but
they're<00:01:16.500> not<00:01:16.590> properly<00:01:17.040> aligned<00:01:17.430> on<00:01:17.610> this

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
they're not properly aligned on this

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.760 
they're not properly aligned on this
side<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.659> crop<00:01:18.840> windows<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.170> bit<00:01:19.380> too<00:01:19.530> large

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
side so the crop windows a bit too large

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.190 
side so the crop windows a bit too large
so<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.970> drag<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.330> crop<00:01:21.540> window<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.869> little<00:01:21.930> bit

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
so we drag the crop window a little bit

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.260 
so we drag the crop window a little bit
smaller<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:23.070> click<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.340> rescan<00:01:23.850> button<00:01:24.150> and

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
smaller and click the rescan button and

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.410 
smaller and click the rescan button and
claire<00:01:24.509> again<00:01:25.369> stills<00:01:26.369> got<00:01:26.759> some<00:01:27.000> overlap

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
claire again stills got some overlap

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.569 
claire again stills got some overlap
problems<00:01:27.990> here<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.530> we'll<00:01:29.100> make<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.369> crop

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
problems here so we'll make the crop

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.100 
problems here so we'll make the crop
window<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.119> little<00:01:30.420> bit<00:01:30.540> smaller<00:01:30.750> once

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
window just a little bit smaller once

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.999 
window just a little bit smaller once
more<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:32.250> click<00:01:32.640> rescan<00:01:33.090> again<00:01:33.860> okay<00:01:34.860> that

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
more and click rescan again okay that

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.069 
more and click rescan again okay that
looks<00:01:35.159> pretty<00:01:35.400> good<00:01:35.640> now<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.360> next<00:01:36.570> important

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
looks pretty good now the next important

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.890 
looks pretty good now the next important
thing<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.290> do<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.770> match<00:01:38.250> exposure<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.659> what

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
thing to do is to match exposure to what

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.899 
thing to do is to match exposure to what
the<00:01:40.380> card<00:01:40.650> expect<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.460> I'm<00:01:41.610> going<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.790> click

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
the card expect so I'm going to click

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.120 
the card expect so I'm going to click
the<00:01:42.210> exposure<00:01:43.079> checker<00:01:43.470> button<00:01:43.890> here<00:01:44.100> which

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
the exposure checker button here which

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.370 
the exposure checker button here which
is<00:01:44.340> next<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.670> analyze<00:01:45.030> checkbox<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.930> now

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
is next to the analyze checkbox and now

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.580 
is next to the analyze checkbox and now
claire<00:01:46.950> has<00:01:47.130> changed<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.850> window<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.240> show

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
claire has changed the window to show

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.410 
claire has changed the window to show
correct<00:01:49.590> exposure<00:01:50.100> as<00:01:50.460> compared<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.030> card

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
correct exposure as compared to the card

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.719 
correct exposure as compared to the card
while<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.439> blue<00:01:52.619> here<00:01:52.920> shows<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.490> card

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
while the blue here shows that the card

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.660 
while the blue here shows that the card
is<00:01:53.880> very<00:01:54.180> underexposed<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:56.040> i'm<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.490> use

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
is very underexposed so i'm going to use

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.030 
is very underexposed so i'm going to use
bibbles<00:01:57.090> built<00:01:57.299> an<00:01:57.450> exposure<00:01:57.810> slider<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.590> to

ramp<00:01:59.310> up<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.670> exposure<00:02:00.320> you<00:02:01.320> can<00:02:01.469> see<00:02:01.649> how<00:02:01.829> as

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
ramp up the exposure you can see how as

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.319 
ramp up the exposure you can see how as
things<00:02:03.329> change<00:02:04.399> we<00:02:05.399> got<00:02:05.579> some<00:02:05.820> red<00:02:06.030> patches

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
things change we got some red patches

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.930 
things change we got some red patches
and<00:02:06.840> some<00:02:07.049> blue<00:02:07.320> patches<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.950> some<00:02:08.129> gray<00:02:08.340> red

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
and some blue patches and some gray red

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.880 
and some blue patches and some gray red
means<00:02:09.209> overexposed<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:10.289> right<00:02:10.500> now<00:02:10.530> this

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
means overexposed so right now this

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.050 
means overexposed so right now this
shows<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.430> target<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:11.819> slightly

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
shows that the target is slightly

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.320 
shows that the target is slightly
overexposed<00:02:12.660> at

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
overexposed at

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.650 
overexposed at
explosion<00:02:13.720> 1.2<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:15.370> we<00:02:15.550> turn<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:15.820> down<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.060> 1.1

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
explosion 1.2 so we turn it down to 1.1

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.680 
explosion 1.2 so we turn it down to 1.1
now<00:02:17.470> we<00:02:17.530> got<00:02:17.770> mostly<00:02:18.160> gray<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.850> a<00:02:19.120> few<00:02:19.300> Reds<00:02:19.540> in

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
now we got mostly gray and a few Reds in

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.260 
now we got mostly gray and a few Reds in
a<00:02:19.750> few<00:02:19.930> blues<00:02:20.170> so<00:02:20.410> that's<00:02:20.590> about<00:02:20.890> perfect<00:02:21.270> now

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
a few blues so that's about perfect now

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.870 
a few blues so that's about perfect now
at<00:02:22.570> this<00:02:23.260> time<00:02:23.430> claire<00:02:24.430> has<00:02:24.640> already

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
at this time claire has already

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.480 
at this time claire has already
calculated<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.840> color<00:02:26.050> settings<00:02:26.530> so<00:02:27.280> all<00:02:27.460> you

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
calculated the color settings so all you

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.050 
calculated the color settings so all you
need<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.820> do<00:02:28.060> is<00:02:28.650> go<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.710> any<00:02:29.980> image<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:30.940> you

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
need to do is go to any image that you

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.780 
need to do is go to any image that you
want<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.420> correct<00:02:31.900> for<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.980> lighting<00:02:33.340> at<00:02:33.610> this

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
want to correct for the lighting at this

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.920 
want to correct for the lighting at this
situation<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.600> click<00:02:35.410> apply<00:02:36.720> I'll<00:02:37.720> say<00:02:37.900> that

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
situation and click apply I'll say that

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.950 
situation and click apply I'll say that

now<00:03:09.430> claire<00:03:09.790> has<00:03:09.970> got<00:03:10.120> some<00:03:10.300> other<00:03:10.450> settings

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
now claire has got some other settings

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.770 
now claire has got some other settings
at<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.680> bottom<00:03:11.800> for<00:03:12.220> color<00:03:12.430> correction<00:03:12.780> so

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
at the bottom for color correction so

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.110 
at the bottom for color correction so
here<00:03:14.230> in<00:03:14.320> the<00:03:14.470> color<00:03:14.830> correction<00:03:15.310> group<00:03:15.520> you

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
here in the color correction group you

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
here in the color correction group you
can<00:03:16.240> see<00:03:16.360> the<00:03:16.480> name<00:03:16.660> of<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:16.900> file<00:03:17.110> the

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
can see the name of the file the

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.110 
can see the name of the file the
correction<00:03:17.650> came<00:03:17.860> from<00:03:18.130> so<00:03:18.760> you<00:03:18.850> can<00:03:19.000> always

correction came from so you can always

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.990 
correction came from so you can always
go<00:03:19.330> back<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.570> it<00:03:19.950> is<00:03:20.950> turn<00:03:21.160> enable<00:03:21.550> off<00:03:21.700> you'll

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
go back to it is turn enable off you'll

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.500 
go back to it is turn enable off you'll
see<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.239> original<00:03:22.390> color<00:03:24.269> turned<00:03:25.269> white

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
see the original color turned white

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.290 
see the original color turned white
balance<00:03:25.930> on<00:03:26.190> that<00:03:27.190> just<00:03:27.760> uses<00:03:27.940> a<00:03:28.120> white

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
balance on that just uses a white

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.460 
balance on that just uses a white
balance<00:03:28.690> it<00:03:28.780> doesn't<00:03:29.019> correct<00:03:29.230> color

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
balance it doesn't correct color

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.800 
balance it doesn't correct color
saturation<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:30.760> what<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.090> exposure<00:03:31.450> button

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
saturation and what the exposure button

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.090 
saturation and what the exposure button
does<00:03:32.050> is<00:03:32.620> it<00:03:32.800> actually<00:03:32.830> alters<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:35.100> gamma

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
does is it actually alters the gamma

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.060 
does is it actually alters the gamma
curve<00:03:36.519> of<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:36.910> image<00:03:37.330> to<00:03:38.260> match<00:03:38.500> the<00:03:38.860> gamma

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
curve of the target it's really

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.850 
curve of the target it's really
important<00:03:41.650> to<00:03:41.709> not<00:03:41.950> use<00:03:42.400> exposure<00:03:43.090> unless<00:03:43.860> the
