00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
that was important for Ubisoft I think

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.100 
that was important for Ubisoft I think
to<00:00:38.250> re-establish<00:00:39.090> themselves<00:00:39.239> as<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> big<00:00:39.809> pc

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
pc player and also for us because it

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.910 
pc player and also for us because it
allowed<00:00:42.719> us<00:00:42.750> building<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.440> new<00:00:43.559> engine<00:00:43.739> new

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
stuff the next thing was that it had to

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.010 
stuff the next thing was that it had to
be<00:00:53.039> exotic<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.850> when<00:00:54.180> we<00:00:54.300> talk<00:00:54.480> about<00:00:54.510> exotic

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
guys out and really aggressive in kind

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.140 
guys out and really aggressive in kind
of<00:03:08.620> disturbing<00:03:09.040> ways<00:03:09.220> but<00:03:09.730> once<00:03:09.910> you<00:03:10.030> get

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
of disturbing ways but once you get

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.490 
of disturbing ways but once you get
trapped<00:03:10.360> in<00:03:10.600> that<00:03:10.630> it<00:03:10.870> becomes<00:03:11.140> kind<00:03:11.290> of<00:03:11.410> a

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
trapped in that it becomes kind of a

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.500 
trapped in that it becomes kind of a
cycle<00:03:11.920> where<00:03:12.160> where<00:03:12.610> it<00:03:12.760> spirals<00:03:13.330> out<00:03:13.450> of

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
cycle where where it spirals out of

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.910 
cycle where where it spirals out of
control<00:03:13.600> and<00:03:13.930> so<00:03:14.170> you<00:03:14.260> always<00:03:14.500> need<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.709> be<00:03:14.739> on

than have a main character and try and

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.910 
than have a main character and try and
say<00:04:00.100> you<00:04:00.160> know<00:04:00.370> you<00:04:00.430> are<00:04:00.880> you<00:04:01.420> know<00:04:01.540> John<00:04:02.019> Creed

these 12 13 really awesome characters

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.539 
these 12 13 really awesome characters
why<00:04:11.140> not<00:04:11.320> since<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:11.829> story<00:04:12.070> is<00:04:12.250> sort<00:04:12.519> of

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
why not since the story is sort of

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.930 
why not since the story is sort of
dynamically<00:04:13.480> assembled<00:04:14.760> reacting<00:04:15.760> to<00:04:15.850> the

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
dynamically assembled reacting to the

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.180 
dynamically assembled reacting to the
players<00:04:16.180> decisions<00:04:16.930> and<00:04:17.079> what<00:04:17.229> he<00:04:17.289> does<00:04:17.470> why

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
players decisions and what he does why

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.620 
players decisions and what he does why
not<00:04:18.370> let<00:04:18.609> the<00:04:18.729> players<00:04:18.940> be<00:04:19.239> one<00:04:19.450> of<00:04:19.539> these

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
not let the players be one of these

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.570 
not let the players be one of these
characters<00:04:19.930> and<00:04:20.380> so<00:04:20.500> for<00:04:20.680> every<00:04:20.950> every<00:04:21.280> person

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
characters and so for every every person

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.040 
characters and so for every every person
who<00:04:21.669> plays<00:04:21.789> the<00:04:22.000> game<00:04:22.150> is<00:04:22.330> going<00:04:22.419> to<00:04:22.510> play<00:04:22.900> one

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
who plays the game is going to play one

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.080 
who plays the game is going to play one
of<00:04:23.200> the<00:04:23.320> buddies<00:04:23.680> essentially<00:04:24.280> that<00:04:24.700> removes

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
of the buddies essentially that removes

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.040 
of the buddies essentially that removes
that<00:04:25.210> character<00:04:25.750> from

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
that character from

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.779 
that character from
from<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.560> story<00:04:26.800> you<00:04:27.039> won't<00:04:27.370> meet<00:04:27.610> him

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789 
from the story you won't meet him

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:30.119 
from the story you won't meet him
because<00:04:27.879> you'll<00:04:28.150> be<00:04:28.180> him<00:04:28.509> it<00:04:28.900> was<00:04:29.129> fundamental

00:04:30.119 --> 00:04:30.129 
because you'll be him it was fundamental

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:31.559 
because you'll be him it was fundamental
that<00:04:30.250> we<00:04:30.370> build<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.699> engine<00:04:30.789> from<00:04:31.030> scratch<00:04:31.389> in

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:31.569 
that we build the engine from scratch in

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:32.879 
that we build the engine from scratch in
order<00:04:31.870> to<00:04:31.990> do<00:04:32.139> it<00:04:32.259> because<00:04:32.379> I<00:04:32.560> think<00:04:32.620> that's

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
order to do it because I think that's

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.860 
order to do it because I think that's
really<00:04:33.310> what<00:04:33.520> next-gen<00:04:33.970> is<00:04:34.240> about<00:04:34.509> it's<00:04:34.720> not

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
really what next-gen is about it's not

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.689 
really what next-gen is about it's not
about<00:04:34.930> bigger<00:04:35.440> data<00:04:35.710> formats<00:04:36.159> is<00:04:36.310> not<00:04:36.490> about

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
about bigger data formats is not about

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.790 
about bigger data formats is not about
more<00:04:36.940> RAM<00:04:37.180> it's<00:04:37.389> not<00:04:37.509> about<00:04:37.690> hard<00:04:37.960> drives<00:04:38.050> it's

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.619 
and rebuilt it to work with our new
technology<00:05:24.129> but<00:05:24.340> but<00:05:25.060> it<00:05:25.180> was<00:05:25.300> kind<00:05:25.509> of<00:05:25.539> a

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:25.629 
technology but but it was kind of a

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:27.029 
technology but but it was kind of a
best-of-breed<00:05:25.930> level<00:05:26.319> editor<00:05:26.590> when<00:05:26.770> it<00:05:26.860> came

out on xbox the first time and we I

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.050 
out on xbox the first time and we I
think<00:05:29.590> we've<00:05:29.770> really<00:05:29.949> taken<00:05:30.069> it<00:05:30.310> to<00:05:30.460> a<00:05:30.490> to

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
think we've really taken it to a to
