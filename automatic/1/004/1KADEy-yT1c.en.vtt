00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
you don't know literally like you are

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.090 
you don't know literally like you are
not<00:05:02.400> sure<00:05:02.700> of<00:05:03.450> yourself<00:05:03.680> or<00:05:04.680> you're<00:05:04.950> not<00:05:05.040> sure

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
not sure of yourself or you're not sure

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.950 
not sure of yourself or you're not sure
of<00:05:05.370> everything<00:05:05.790> because<00:05:06.450> you<00:05:06.660> don't<00:05:06.840> know

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
of everything because you don't know

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.780 
of everything because you don't know
everything<00:05:07.160> basically<00:05:08.160> is<00:05:08.370> what<00:05:08.400> he<00:05:08.669> was

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
everything basically is what he was

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.940 
everything basically is what he was
saying<00:05:09.090> and<00:05:09.270> he<00:05:09.630> was<00:05:09.780> obviously<00:05:10.290> relating

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
saying and he was obviously relating

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.680 
saying and he was obviously relating
that<00:05:11.040> to<00:05:11.100> graphic<00:05:11.550> arts<00:05:11.850> saying<00:05:12.150> you<00:05:12.510> don't

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
that to graphic arts saying you don't

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.600 
that to graphic arts saying you don't
know<00:05:12.840> this<00:05:13.139> about<00:05:13.200> photoshop<00:05:14.010> so<00:05:14.250> you<00:05:14.310> can't

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
know this about photoshop so you can't

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.820 
know this about photoshop so you can't
assume<00:05:14.880> that<00:05:14.940> you<00:05:15.120> would<00:05:15.330> know<00:05:15.479> this<00:05:15.830> but

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
assume that you would know this but

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.000 
assume that you would know this but
basically<00:05:17.760> I<00:05:18.180> took<00:05:18.780> that<00:05:19.110> and<00:05:19.440> I<00:05:19.500> applied<00:05:19.830> that

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
basically I took that and I applied that

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.370 
basically I took that and I applied that
to<00:05:20.250> my<00:05:20.370> life<00:05:20.580> if<00:05:20.820> you<00:05:21.419> don't<00:05:22.200> know<00:05:22.289> something

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
to my life if you don't know something

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.980 
to my life if you don't know something
then<00:05:23.130> you<00:05:23.250> don't<00:05:23.550> know<00:05:23.729> it<00:05:23.880> until<00:05:24.060> you've

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
then you don't know it until you've

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.379 
then you don't know it until you've
learned<00:05:25.320> it<00:05:25.560> so<00:05:25.710> you<00:05:26.039> can't<00:05:26.430> necessarily<00:05:26.669> say

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
learned it so you can't necessarily say

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:28.670 
learned it so you can't necessarily say
that<00:05:27.600> you<00:05:27.720> know<00:05:27.750> everything<00:05:28.289> because<00:05:28.470> I

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
that you know everything because I

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.670 
that you know everything because I
guarantee<00:05:29.370> it<00:05:29.490> you<00:05:30.330> must<00:05:31.050> you<00:05:31.169> guys<00:05:31.320> are<00:05:31.500> under

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
guarantee it you must you guys are under

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.879 
guarantee it you must you guys are under
18<00:05:31.800> right<00:05:32.310> so<00:05:32.610> say<00:05:32.820> you<00:05:32.880> like<00:05:33.120> 17<00:05:33.570> now<00:05:33.889> you'd

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889
