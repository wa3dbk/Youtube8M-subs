welcome to GTV today I will be showing
you<00:00:09.330> how<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.570> check<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:09.960> fuse<00:00:10.349> by<00:00:10.980> testing<00:00:11.580> it

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
you how to check a fuse by testing it

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.419 
you how to check a fuse by testing it
with<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.179> multimeter<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.110> first<00:00:14.070> thing<00:00:14.280> to

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
with a multimeter the first thing to

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.939 
with a multimeter the first thing to
note<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:14.969> that<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.450> accurately<00:00:15.990> test<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.650> fuse

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
note is that to accurately test a fuse

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.250 
note is that to accurately test a fuse
the<00:00:17.520> fuse<00:00:17.789> must<00:00:18.029> be<00:00:18.180> removed<00:00:18.600> from<00:00:19.050> the

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
the fuse must be removed from the

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.950 
the fuse must be removed from the
machine<00:00:19.590> itself<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.460> away<00:00:21.060> from<00:00:21.119> any<00:00:21.480> sort<00:00:21.810> of
