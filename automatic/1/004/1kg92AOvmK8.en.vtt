00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.779
 one of the elements that was very 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:10.150
 important in the search for 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:14.829
 loudness of the music for the stylist 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:18.789
 it was the violin for me it was very important 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:21.430
 can find a sonority with the 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.910
 real shovel we could connect 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.980
 with the spirit of gabriel and this 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.470
 character who is who really is 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.180
 always carrying in some way the 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.180
 thread of all the 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.770
 violin wanted to work with a great 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.280
 my friend who is a fantastic 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.150
 interpreter his name is daniel diaz he 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.800
 is the director of 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.260
 no sauce that is called the network of 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.060
 Charanga and one of the things that most 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.460
 loved to work with daniel in this 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:56.030
 project is that just given a little 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.490
 let's say the Latin spirit that leads 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.720
 always printed printed of course in 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.720
 all the work he does 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.530
 I can show it in a 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.610
 aesthetics completely different from the 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.610
 what he does in his hand because naturally 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.920
 but if you need a big 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.170
 sensitivity very much sensitivity and 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.920
 much lyricism the sonority of the viola 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.619
 it was a resource that was quite useful 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.319
 for me when it comes to incorporating it inside 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.030
 of the score, reason why the 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:35.540
 Viola and the violin also have the 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.480
 position 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.030
 very constant throughout the entire 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.980
 music of the stylist and he is always in 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.650
 these scenes where one 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.540
 finds much desolation and where there 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.240
 a great sadness that really 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.810
 if you do a little inside of 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.850
 all these characters the raped that 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.420
 It was also interpreted by my friend 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.880
 daniel 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.970
 It has very sound qualities 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.750
 particular thanks to that sonority 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.100
 nasal and very intimate that like the 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.940
 fiddle 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:17.020
 and he manages to take us a little more 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:20.070
 deep to the bowels of what these 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.070
 characters are living
