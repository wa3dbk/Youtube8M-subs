00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.470 

the<00:00:01.280> next<00:00:01.609> step<00:00:01.849> is<00:00:02.120> that<00:00:02.720> I<00:00:02.919> take<00:00:03.919> a<00:00:04.480> variety

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:05.480 
the next step is that I take a variety

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.740 
the next step is that I take a variety
of<00:00:05.839> tools<00:00:06.589> and<00:00:06.950> I<00:00:07.220> round<00:00:07.549> and<00:00:07.939> shape<00:00:08.240> the<00:00:08.540> neck

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:08.750 
of tools and I round and shape the neck

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.220 
of tools and I round and shape the neck
to<00:00:09.680> the<00:00:10.210> eventual<00:00:11.210> profile<00:00:11.750> that<00:00:11.960> it<00:00:12.080> will

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
to the eventual profile that it will

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.430 
to the eventual profile that it will
have<00:00:12.440> and<00:00:12.770> I<00:00:13.760> use<00:00:13.970> a<00:00:14.000> number<00:00:14.480> of<00:00:14.570> processes<00:00:15.260> for

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
have and I use a number of processes for

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.400 
have and I use a number of processes for
this<00:00:15.590> I'll<00:00:15.830> show<00:00:15.860> those<00:00:16.280> in<00:00:16.490> a<00:00:16.850> bit<00:00:17.410> that's

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
this I'll show those in a bit that's

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.580 
this I'll show those in a bit that's
that's<00:00:18.920> the<00:00:19.100> rounding<00:00:19.490> process<00:00:20.000> I<00:00:20.320> work<00:00:21.320> on

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
that's the rounding process I work on

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.680 
that's the rounding process I work on
the<00:00:21.890> neck<00:00:22.100> and<00:00:22.370> I<00:00:22.430> work<00:00:22.580> on<00:00:22.760> the<00:00:22.880> body<00:00:23.060> wings<00:00:23.420> as

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:23.690 
the neck and I work on the body wings as

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.260 
the neck and I work on the body wings as
far<00:00:23.990> as<00:00:24.140> I<00:00:24.289> can<00:00:24.670> when<00:00:25.670> they're<00:00:25.850> by<00:00:26.060> themselves

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
far as I can when they're by themselves

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.570 
far as I can when they're by themselves
because<00:00:27.050> I<00:00:27.260> can<00:00:27.530> clearly<00:00:27.920> it's<00:00:28.039> so<00:00:28.190> easy<00:00:28.400> to

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
because I can clearly it's so easy to

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.300 
because I can clearly it's so easy to
put<00:00:28.760> this<00:00:28.910> in<00:00:29.090> a<00:00:29.180> vise<00:00:29.420> and<00:00:29.750> work<00:00:30.140> on<00:00:30.380> it<00:00:30.410> when

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
put this in a vise and work on it when

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.700 
put this in a vise and work on it when
it's<00:00:31.490> by<00:00:31.670> itself<00:00:32.090> without<00:00:32.390> having<00:00:32.900> to<00:00:33.500> work

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
it's by itself without having to work

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.580 
it's by itself without having to work
around<00:00:33.920> the<00:00:34.340> body<00:00:34.520> wings<00:00:34.880> so<00:00:35.690> that's<00:00:35.900> why<00:00:36.110> I<00:00:36.140> do

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
around the body wings so that's why I do

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.760 
around the body wings so that's why I do
all<00:00:36.739> this<00:00:37.010> shaping<00:00:38.020> I've<00:00:39.020> drilled<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:39.560> holes

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
all this shaping I've drilled the holes

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.970 
all this shaping I've drilled the holes
for<00:00:40.100> the<00:00:40.160> tuning<00:00:40.550> pegs<00:00:41.350> here's<00:00:42.350> where<00:00:42.649> that

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
for the tuning pegs here's where that

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.549 
for the tuning pegs here's where that
wrench<00:00:43.280> goes<00:00:43.610> in<00:00:43.880> for<00:00:44.149> the<00:00:44.239> truss<00:00:44.570> rod<00:00:44.690> it's

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
wrench goes in for the truss rod it's

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.569 
wrench goes in for the truss rod it's
all<00:00:45.800> it's<00:00:45.980> all<00:00:46.130> a<00:00:46.190> unit<00:00:46.670> ready<00:00:47.090> to<00:00:47.300> go<00:00:48.160> so<00:00:49.160> here

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
all it's all a unit ready to go so here

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.549 
all it's all a unit ready to go so here
I'm<00:00:49.760> ready<00:00:50.149> to<00:00:50.390> do<00:00:50.540> some<00:00:50.809> rounding<00:00:51.350> with<00:00:51.500> the

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
I'm ready to do some rounding with the

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.540 
I'm ready to do some rounding with the
rasp<00:00:52.690> I'm<00:00:53.739> normally<00:00:54.739> I'd<00:00:54.980> be<00:00:55.160> wearing<00:00:55.370> this

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
rasp I'm normally I'd be wearing this

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.119 
rasp I'm normally I'd be wearing this
paper<00:00:56.450> mask<00:00:56.780> obviously<00:00:57.380> I<00:00:57.410> can't<00:00:57.680> talk<00:00:57.890> with

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
paper mask obviously I can't talk with

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.000 
paper mask obviously I can't talk with
it<00:00:58.250> on<00:00:58.399> but<00:00:58.610> I<00:00:58.640> wear<00:00:58.879> this<00:00:59.030> all<00:00:59.329> the<00:00:59.510> time<00:00:59.750> and<00:01:00.050> I

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
it on but I wear this all the time and I

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.250 
it on but I wear this all the time and I
keep<00:01:01.489> air<00:01:01.850> circulating<00:01:02.719> all<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:03.020> time

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
keep air circulating all the time

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.379 
keep air circulating all the time
through<00:01:03.980> filters<00:01:04.429> when<00:01:04.699> I'm<00:01:04.819> doing<00:01:05.059> this<00:01:05.179> sort

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:05.389 
through filters when I'm doing this sort

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:08.620 
through filters when I'm doing this sort
of<00:01:05.449> thing<00:01:05.509> so<00:01:06.350> I<00:01:06.409> don't<00:01:06.439> breathe<00:01:06.799> it<00:01:07.389> these<00:01:08.389> are

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
of thing so I don't breathe it these are

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.679 
of thing so I don't breathe it these are
great<00:01:08.959> gloves<00:01:09.530> the<00:01:10.459> they're<00:01:11.450> pretty

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:11.689 
great gloves the they're pretty

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.379 
great gloves the they're pretty
lightweight<00:01:11.959> but<00:01:12.649> they're<00:01:12.859> strong<00:01:13.819> rubber<00:01:14.119> on

00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:14.389 
lightweight but they're strong rubber on

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:15.870 
lightweight but they're strong rubber on
the<00:01:14.509> face<00:01:14.749> and<00:01:15.020> when<00:01:15.109> I<00:01:15.139> use<00:01:15.350> something<00:01:15.770> like

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
the face and when I use something like

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.910 
the face and when I use something like
really<00:01:16.880> coarse<00:01:17.209> sandpaper<00:01:17.630> or<00:01:17.959> a<00:01:18.139> rasp<00:01:18.560> like

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
really coarse sandpaper or a rasp like

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.649 
really coarse sandpaper or a rasp like
this<00:01:19.219> it<00:01:19.429> really<00:01:19.579> keeps<00:01:19.909> from<00:01:20.119> chewing<00:01:20.420> up

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
this it really keeps from chewing up

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.949 
this it really keeps from chewing up
your<00:01:20.689> hands<00:01:21.229> so<00:01:22.069> what<00:01:22.789> I've<00:01:22.909> got<00:01:22.939> here<00:01:23.149> I<00:01:23.569> have

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:23.959 
your hands so what I've got here I have

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:27.249 
your hands so what I've got here I have
just<00:01:24.200> banned<00:01:24.859> sod<00:01:25.249> some<00:01:25.909> rough<00:01:26.209> angles<00:01:26.959> and

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
just banned sod some rough angles and

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.260 
just banned sod some rough angles and
now<00:01:28.039> I'm<00:01:28.130> going<00:01:28.279> to<00:01:28.340> come<00:01:28.549> in<00:01:28.729> and<00:01:28.939> start

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
now I'm going to come in and start

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:36.340 
now I'm going to come in and start
rounding

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.890 

now<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:38.460> bandsaw<00:01:39.030> cut<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.690> made

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
now the the bandsaw cut that I made

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.290 
now the the bandsaw cut that I made
along<00:01:40.229> here<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:41.010> pretty<00:01:41.370> accurate<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.240> took

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
along here is pretty accurate and I took

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.050 
along here is pretty accurate and I took
time<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.229> make<00:01:43.260> it<00:01:43.590> pretty<00:01:44.010> much<00:01:44.760> the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
time to make it pretty much the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.120 
time to make it pretty much the
thickness<00:01:45.510> that<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.869> want<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.320> neck<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.710> be<00:01:46.890> and

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
thickness that I want the neck to be and

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.090 
thickness that I want the neck to be and
very<00:01:47.790> much<00:01:48.000> straight<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:48.900> I'm<00:01:49.470> going<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.740> avoid

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
very much straight so I'm going to avoid

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.450 
very much straight so I'm going to avoid
I<00:01:50.460> can<00:01:51.119> tell<00:01:51.390> because<00:01:51.690> of<00:01:51.900> the<00:01:52.080> saw<00:01:52.650> marks<00:01:53.040> you

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
I can tell because of the saw marks you

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.780 
I can tell because of the saw marks you
know<00:01:53.580> when<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.880> get<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.600> -<00:01:55.460> rasping<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.640> this

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
know when I get to - rasping in this

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.290 
know when I get to - rasping in this
area

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
area

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.300 
area
I'm<00:01:57.840> not<00:01:58.050> going<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.320> rasp<00:01:58.530> I'm<00:01:58.860> going<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.100> rasp

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
I'm not going to rasp I'm going to rasp

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.359 
I'm not going to rasp I'm going to rasp
right<00:01:59.729> up<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.240> centerline<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.200> not<00:02:01.710> not

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
right up to this centerline and not not

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:41.809 
right up to this centerline and not not
take<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.940> down<00:02:03.420> any<00:02:03.690> farther<00:02:03.990> than<00:02:04.140> that

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.550 

even<00:02:42.819> though<00:02:42.939> it<00:02:43.150> may<00:02:43.599> seem<00:02:43.659> like<00:02:44.110> gee<00:02:44.349> that's

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
even though it may seem like gee that's

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.110 
even though it may seem like gee that's
taken<00:02:44.950> that's<00:02:45.040> going<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.340> take<00:02:45.519> a<00:02:45.549> while<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.819> do

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
taken that's going to take a while to do

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.539 
taken that's going to take a while to do
that<00:02:46.150> it<00:02:46.480> actually<00:02:46.510> goes<00:02:47.049> pretty<00:02:47.409> fast<00:02:47.739> this

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
that it actually goes pretty fast this

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.240 
that it actually goes pretty fast this
takes<00:02:48.819> off<00:02:49.030> material<00:02:49.659> pretty<00:02:49.870> quickly<00:02:50.170> but<00:02:51.129> it

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
takes off material pretty quickly but it

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.089 
takes off material pretty quickly but it
also<00:02:51.400> gives<00:02:51.760> me<00:02:51.849> time<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.180> think

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
also gives me time to think

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.059 
also gives me time to think
something<00:02:54.099> about<00:02:54.310> rasping<00:02:55.230> I'm<00:02:56.230> thinking

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
something about rasping I'm thinking

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.470 
something about rasping I'm thinking
about<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.430> next<00:02:57.730> steps<00:02:58.000> that<00:02:58.120> I'm<00:02:58.299> going<00:02:58.450> to

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
about the next steps that I'm going to

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.960 
about the next steps that I'm going to
do<00:02:58.629> on<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.780> bass<00:02:59.019> guitar<00:02:59.470> so<00:02:59.799> the<00:03:00.549> fact<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:00.879> I

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
do on a bass guitar so the fact that I

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.910 
do on a bass guitar so the fact that I
don't<00:03:01.090> have<00:03:01.299> a<00:03:01.420> computer<00:03:01.840> operated<00:03:02.530> machine

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
don't have a computer operated machine

don't have a computer operated machine
carving<00:03:03.430> this<00:03:03.579> out<00:03:03.819> it<00:03:04.299> doesn't<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:05.620> me

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
carving this out it doesn't to me

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.390 
carving this out it doesn't to me

up on edge and one of the things I took

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
me a while to learn this but the the

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
the shaping that you're going to do for

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.899 
the shaping that you're going to do for
a<00:03:56.139> while<00:03:56.260> I<00:03:56.290> round<00:03:56.799> it<00:03:56.980> up<00:03:57.129> and<00:03:57.400> then<00:03:57.519> I<00:03:57.639> left

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
a while I round it up and then I left

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.780 
a while I round it up and then I left
the<00:03:58.060> fretboard<00:03:58.449> squared<00:03:59.230> off<00:03:59.470> no<00:04:00.280> it<00:04:00.579> should

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
the fretboard squared off no it should

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.750 
the fretboard squared off no it should
be<00:04:01.000> all<00:04:01.389> be<00:04:01.599> part<00:04:01.870> of<00:04:01.989> the<00:04:02.139> same<00:04:02.379> arc<00:04:02.769> so<00:04:03.639> I'm

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
be all be part of the same arc so I'm

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.599 
be all be part of the same arc so I'm
going<00:04:03.909> to<00:04:03.940> I'll<00:04:04.919> come<00:04:05.919> into<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.370> fretboard

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
going to I'll come into the fretboard

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.110 
going to I'll come into the fretboard
ways<00:04:07.150> as<00:04:07.510> I'm<00:04:07.989> shaping<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:08.799> when<00:04:09.609> it's<00:04:09.760> up<00:04:09.909> on

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
ways as I'm shaping and when it's up on

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.159 
ways as I'm shaping and when it's up on
this<00:04:10.299> angle<00:04:10.750> I<00:04:10.840> can<00:04:10.900> see<00:04:11.319> much<00:04:11.949> more<00:04:12.159> clearly

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.169 
this angle I can see much more clearly

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:39.730 
this angle I can see much more clearly
I'm<00:04:14.169> doing

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.130 

and<00:04:41.000> as<00:04:42.000> I<00:04:42.180> shape<00:04:43.370> there<00:04:44.370> are<00:04:44.610> different

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
and as I shape there are different

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.380 
and as I shape there are different
profiles<00:04:46.140> that<00:04:47.040> people<00:04:47.430> like<00:04:47.640> in<00:04:47.850> a<00:04:47.940> fret<00:04:48.210> in

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
profiles that people like in a fret in

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.620 
profiles that people like in a fret in
the<00:04:48.690> neck<00:04:49.370> sometimes<00:04:50.370> people<00:04:50.970> like<00:04:51.150> a<00:04:51.180> large

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
the neck sometimes people like a large

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.740 
the neck sometimes people like a large
flat<00:04:52.140> area<00:04:52.620> across<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:52.950> back<00:04:53.340> so<00:04:54.270> you<00:04:54.300> kind<00:04:54.630> of

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
flat area across the back so you kind of

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.770 
flat area across the back so you kind of
round<00:04:55.170> flat<00:04:56.160> and<00:04:56.490> round<00:04:57.060> to<00:04:57.420> the<00:04:57.480> other<00:04:57.570> side

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
round flat and round to the other side

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.880 
round flat and round to the other side
other<00:04:58.560> people<00:04:59.010> like<00:04:59.220> a<00:04:59.250> continuous<00:05:00.110> oval<00:05:01.110> so<00:05:01.830> I

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
other people like a continuous oval so I

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.980 
other people like a continuous oval so I
would<00:05:02.400> take<00:05:02.640> more<00:05:02.910> material<00:05:03.510> out<00:05:03.690> of<00:05:03.840> this

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
would take more material out of this

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.400 
would take more material out of this
edge<00:05:04.230> so<00:05:04.530> that<00:05:05.190> I<00:05:05.280> can<00:05:05.520> do<00:05:05.760> the<00:05:06.510> full<00:05:06.750> rounding

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
edge so that I can do the full rounding

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.290 
edge so that I can do the full rounding
and<00:05:08.240> at<00:05:09.240> some<00:05:09.480> point<00:05:09.810> I'm<00:05:10.910> I'm<00:05:11.910> not<00:05:12.120> even

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
and at some point I'm I'm not even

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.880 
and at some point I'm I'm not even
looking<00:05:12.600> at<00:05:12.690> it<00:05:12.840> anymore<00:05:13.050> I'm<00:05:13.290> just<00:05:13.470> feeling

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
looking at it anymore I'm just feeling

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.340 
looking at it anymore I'm just feeling
it<00:05:14.040> I<00:05:14.220> just<00:05:14.520> go<00:05:14.790> back<00:05:14.970> and<00:05:15.150> forth<00:05:15.390> and<00:05:16.170> it

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
it I just go back and forth and it

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.800 
it I just go back and forth and it
becomes<00:05:16.680> more<00:05:17.130> and<00:05:17.190> more<00:05:17.340> clear<00:05:17.790> to<00:05:17.820> me<00:05:18.030> when

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
becomes more and more clear to me when

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.260 
becomes more and more clear to me when
it's<00:05:18.960> right<00:05:19.290> and<00:05:20.040> I'll<00:05:20.670> go<00:05:20.850> over<00:05:20.970> it<00:05:21.120> and<00:05:21.240> over

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
it's right and I'll go over it and over

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.000 
it's right and I'll go over it and over
it<00:05:21.450> and<00:05:21.510> over<00:05:21.630> it<00:05:21.810> until<00:05:22.970> working<00:05:23.970> gradually

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
it and over it until working gradually

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.300 
it and over it until working gradually
with<00:05:26.010> a<00:05:26.540> it's<00:05:27.540> pretty<00:05:27.660> surprising<00:05:28.310> how

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
with a it's pretty surprising how

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.220 
with a it's pretty surprising how
squared<00:05:29.790> off<00:05:30.000> that<00:05:30.240> site<00:05:30.540> is<00:05:30.780> and<00:05:31.080> how

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
squared off that site is and how

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.460 
squared off that site is and how
completely<00:05:32.190> rounded<00:05:32.580> this<00:05:32.790> is<00:05:33.260> after<00:05:34.260> what<00:05:34.440> a

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
completely rounded this is after what a

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.740 
completely rounded this is after what a
minute<00:05:34.740> and<00:05:34.980> a<00:05:35.010> half<00:05:35.160> of<00:05:35.430> shaping<00:05:36.000> it<00:05:36.570> goes

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
minute and a half of shaping it goes

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:43.240 
minute and a half of shaping it goes
really<00:05:36.990> quickly<00:05:39.140> then

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.430 

in<00:05:44.250> the<00:05:44.490> interest<00:05:44.880> of<00:05:45.030> time<00:05:45.330> I'll<00:05:45.930> just<00:05:46.140> jump

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
in the interest of time I'll just jump

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.500 
in the interest of time I'll just jump
ahead<00:05:46.620> I<00:05:47.070> would<00:05:48.000> end<00:05:48.180> up<00:05:48.330> using<00:05:48.630> a<00:05:49.080> finer<00:05:49.680> rasp

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
ahead I would end up using a finer rasp

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.200 
ahead I would end up using a finer rasp
so<00:05:51.510> I'm<00:05:51.740> not<00:05:52.740> changing<00:05:53.130> the<00:05:53.460> shape<00:05:53.700> that<00:05:54.000> much

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
so I'm not changing the shape that much

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:02.060 
so I'm not changing the shape that much
at<00:05:54.450> this<00:05:54.630> point<00:05:55.550> I'm<00:05:56.550> just<00:05:56.610> smoothing<00:06:01.070> getting

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
at this point I'm just smoothing getting

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.790 
at this point I'm just smoothing getting
rid<00:06:02.220> of<00:06:02.250> the<00:06:02.460> deep<00:06:02.700> gouge<00:06:03.060> marks<00:06:03.650> finally<00:06:04.650> when

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
rid of the deep gouge marks finally when

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.210 
rid of the deep gouge marks finally when
I<00:06:04.830> get<00:06:05.040> to<00:06:05.220> my<00:06:05.430> my<00:06:06.000> finest<00:06:06.480> sandpaper<00:06:07.020> I'll<00:06:07.860> do

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
I get to my my finest sandpaper I'll do

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.830 
I get to my my finest sandpaper I'll do
some<00:06:09.090> hand<00:06:09.600> sanding<00:06:09.990> to<00:06:10.950> really<00:06:11.310> make<00:06:11.730> it<00:06:11.840> just

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
some hand sanding to really make it just

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.690 
some hand sanding to really make it just
to<00:06:13.110> make<00:06:13.710> sure<00:06:14.130> that<00:06:14.280> I've<00:06:14.460> got<00:06:14.490> everything

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
to make sure that I've got everything

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.970 
to make sure that I've got everything
it's<00:06:15.360> all<00:06:15.570> feel<00:06:16.290> at<00:06:16.560> that<00:06:16.590> point<00:06:17.130> and<00:06:18.290> and<00:06:19.290> I<00:06:19.920> do

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 
it's all feel at that point and and I do

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.820 
it's all feel at that point and and I do
it<00:06:20.220> until<00:06:20.520> the<00:06:20.700> the<00:06:21.030> arc<00:06:21.720> is<00:06:21.960> all<00:06:22.200> complete<00:06:22.650> and

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
it until the the arc is all complete and

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.250 
it until the the arc is all complete and
it's<00:06:23.100> all<00:06:23.280> as<00:06:23.640> smooth<00:06:23.970> as<00:06:24.180> I<00:06:24.360> think<00:06:24.720> I<00:06:24.900> can<00:06:25.080> get

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:25.260 
it's all as smooth as I think I can get

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260 
it's all as smooth as I think I can get
at<00:06:25.410> that<00:06:25.560> point<00:06:25.890> and<00:06:26.100> then<00:06:26.250> it's<00:06:26.400> time<00:06:26.640> to<00:06:26.700> glue

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270 
at that point and then it's time to glue

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.370 
at that point and then it's time to glue
this<00:06:27.600> to<00:06:28.590> the<00:06:28.740> buck<00:06:28.920> to<00:06:29.190> the<00:06:29.310> body<00:06:29.520> wings<00:06:29.820> and

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.380 
this to the buck to the body wings and

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.640 
this to the buck to the body wings and
and<00:06:31.380> then<00:06:32.250> I<00:06:32.280> can<00:06:32.640> do<00:06:32.820> the<00:06:33.000> final<00:06:33.500> shaping<00:06:34.500> of

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
and then I can do the final shaping of

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.440 
and then I can do the final shaping of
the<00:06:34.770> contour<00:06:35.280> where<00:06:35.490> the<00:06:35.610> neck<00:06:35.790> goes<00:06:36.030> into<00:06:36.360> the

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.450 
the contour where the neck goes into the

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.660 
the contour where the neck goes into the
body
