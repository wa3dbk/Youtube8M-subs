00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:15.420
 hi to all I am worthy of waiting e 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.160
 you stayed channels right up to the end 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.529
 then harry potter and the prisoner of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.210
 azkaban from the first scene we understand 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.400
 immediately and that the director has changed 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.099
 in fact columbus who directed the first ones 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.910
 the two has left space don alfonso 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.070
 cuaron that directs only this 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.110
 from what we see that has actually changed 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.170
 from small precautions that however in the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.059
 general picture they head that has everything 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.860
 another film from practically those who 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.329
 made columbus 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.010
 we have small movements of 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.690
 machine that immediately at least a 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.060
 they hit me so much because they serve 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.860
 to give dynamism and rhythm has one 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.170
 plot already well rhythmic of his 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.090
 then we have the field of darkness that 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.579
 had only been mentioned in the first two 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.850
 which is now much more pronounced is 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:03.000
 much more explored in some sense 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.129
 it is in fact the first to put in the films 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.990
 elections quidditch spells 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.509
 they were almost to give a sop to 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.259
 viewer as to introduce it to the world 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.149
 by harry potter 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:17.189
 now these are more i 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:20.969
 these escamotage we say so serve 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.439
 to accentuate degree of darkness 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:24.539
 that already envelops the whole castle 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.959
 in fact we have in the first lesson 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.909
 flight vigor of those 18 no 

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:32.819
 in the first lesson, not in the first 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.459
 quidditch game we have harry that 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:37.799
 falls from the broom to the house of troublemakers 

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:39.359
 so the game is a tool for 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.569
 introduce them once again inside 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:45.619
 of the film the figure of the dementors then 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:48.270
 we have an example also the first 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.770
 care lesson of magic measures 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.029
 where we see but sheet attached 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.520
 from the hippogriff and from this scene then 

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:58.919
 we have all the development of the plot 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.169
 even in reality it is very simple there is the 

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:05.579
 contrast between the mal out and a 

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:07.939
 cry then harry silente hagrid awards 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.939
 I have to say 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:15.300
 and this opposition and then in 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.849
 extremis flows into the sentence a 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.069
 death of the old hay next to it 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.020
 the theme of the opposition we have the 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.420
 strong theme of friendship is among the three 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:28.349
 protagonists and between two new characters 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.030
 we have ramos wolves and sirius black yes we are 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.510
 the friendship between them and that anyway 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:38.670
 after all those years it remained strong and 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:41.280
 indissoluble is the friendship in the 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.680
 comparisons of the father dr who then yes 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.900
 also harry transmits itself indeed is 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.650
 he sees them as figures almost 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.200
 paternal and very close friends 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:57.690
 three family friends who can 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:00.510
 help him and these two characters albeit 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.940
 not as good in films as it is 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.769
 in the books, however, it is understood anyway 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.310
 very well their character for example 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:11.459
 sirius black is in the movie you see something 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.769
 like twenty minutes even and we understand 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.350
 everything and his character from one 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:19.320
 beaten in my opinion when I got ours 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.019
 require and credit there or if you what 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.579
 you would have done and he replies you'll be dead 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.540
 he will be dead not to betray my own 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.160
 friends 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.840
 here this is the summary of the 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.620
 personality of sirius black that to mine 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:37.380
 opinion is something fantastic 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:40.680
 then we have a story already a change 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.410
 in fact in the cast richard harris 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.519
 unfortunately he is dead and there is a replacement 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.650
 michael gambon that despite everything is 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.600
 was an excellent silent and from one 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.209
 incredible continuity to the films is indeed 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.859
 an average spectator who nevertheless did not 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:01.980
 is fond of harry potter or gods 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:06.420
 film I do n't know does n't know how to recognize i 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.940
 characters in short one does a little so not 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.170
 note not known or very little note 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.860
 difference between the two indeed 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.560
 interaction 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.989
 there is more in silent gestures 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.140
 so much continuity therefore michael gambon is 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:23.440
 was really very good anyway 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.450
 fact that is between the second and the third 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.340
 yes with me the biggest jump because 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.400
 we have both a directing break that is 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.540
 net and very strong right away if one 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.850
 detachment with regard to i 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.950
 protagonists because we see them immediately 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.710
 grown a lot from previous years 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:41.650
 because the first two have a continuity 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.169
 incredible and really looks past 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.550
 a few months from the first to the second while 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:52.870
 here we see 3 harry ron and hermione 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:55.330
 really really grown up and together with 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.300
 a director who becomes more mature too 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:01.270
 in short, they mature now I would have finished 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.660
 commented me and below but that you 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.160
 help your opinion what what 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.560
 it seems to me also what you ate a 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.110
 dinner we are all interested in quiet 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.190
 and see you at the next video 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.190
 hello review
