guess<00:01:22.180> we<00:01:22.330> were<00:01:22.420> typical<00:01:22.780> fans<00:01:22.990> where<00:01:23.200> we

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
guess we were typical fans where we

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.160 
guess we were typical fans where we
watched<00:01:24.010> races<00:01:24.280> a<00:01:24.460> lot<00:01:24.700> and<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.930> at<00:01:26.049> the<00:01:26.140> time

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
watched races a lot and but at the time

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.080 
watched races a lot and but at the time
I<00:01:26.380> had<00:01:26.500> no<00:01:26.770> aspirations<00:01:27.310> of<00:01:27.400> being<00:01:27.580> and<00:01:27.760> racing

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.640 
I had no aspirations of being and racing
although<00:01:28.750> it's<00:01:28.900> funny<00:01:29.110> watching<00:01:29.290> that

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
although it's funny watching that

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.649 
although it's funny watching that
watching<00:01:29.950> that<00:01:30.159> race<00:01:30.460> brings<00:01:31.299> me<00:01:31.510> back

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
watching that race brings me back

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.469 
watching that race brings me back
reminds<00:01:32.170> me<00:01:32.170> of<00:01:33.000> I've<00:01:34.000> always<00:01:34.210> you<00:01:34.450> always

it's it's I don't look at it too much

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.360 
it's it's I don't look at it too much
differently<00:04:19.750> from<00:04:20.320> a<00:04:20.470> mental<00:04:20.650> aspect<00:04:20.799> I<00:04:21.190> guess

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
differently from a mental aspect I guess

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.920 
differently from a mental aspect I guess
there<00:04:21.610> I<00:04:21.820> have<00:04:22.180> a<00:04:22.210> different<00:04:22.420> role<00:04:22.720> in<00:04:22.870> the

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
there I have a different role in the

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.220 
there I have a different role in the
team<00:04:23.140> so

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
team so

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.600 
team so
certainly<00:04:24.710> responsible<00:04:24.980> for<00:04:25.370> different

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
certainly responsible for different

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.710 
certainly responsible for different
things<00:04:25.640> and<00:04:25.940> I<00:04:26.030> guess<00:04:26.210> ultimately<00:04:26.630> I'm

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
things and I guess ultimately I'm

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.380 
things and I guess ultimately I'm
responsible<00:04:26.750> for<00:04:27.850> for<00:04:28.850> everything<00:04:29.240> that

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
responsible for for everything that

worked<00:05:33.830> out<00:05:33.950> so<00:05:34.250> we<00:05:34.670> won't<00:05:34.820> have<00:05:34.850> a<00:05:34.970> chance<00:05:35.120> to

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
worked out so we won't have a chance to

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.940 
worked out so we won't have a chance to
do<00:05:35.390> that<00:05:35.510> but<00:05:35.690> we<00:05:35.780> have<00:05:36.140> tested<00:05:36.500> some<00:05:36.680> here<00:05:36.890> in

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
do that but we have tested some here in

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.830 
do that but we have tested some here in
the<00:05:37.010> off<00:05:37.130> season<00:05:37.340> and<00:05:37.670> we've<00:05:38.420> kind<00:05:38.630> of<00:05:38.690> got

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
the off season and we've kind of got

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.320 
the off season and we've kind of got
some<00:05:39.020> of<00:05:39.110> that<00:05:39.140> out<00:05:39.230> of<00:05:39.410> the<00:05:39.470> way<00:05:39.500> and<00:05:40.240> but<00:05:41.240> as

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
some of that out of the way and but as

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.360 
some of that out of the way and but as
far<00:05:41.510> as<00:05:41.570> I<00:05:41.810> don't<00:05:42.200> think<00:05:42.380> there's<00:05:42.590> any<00:05:42.770> added

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
far as I don't think there's any added

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.190 
far as I don't think there's any added
pressure<00:05:43.400> I<00:05:44.030> mean<00:05:44.510> certainly<00:05:44.660> as<00:05:44.900> a<00:05:44.930> leader

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
pressure I mean certainly as a leader

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.260 
pressure I mean certainly as a leader
you<00:05:45.320> know<00:05:45.770> ultimately<00:05:46.220> we<00:05:46.850> want<00:05:46.940> to<00:05:47.090> win<00:05:47.180> the

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
you know ultimately we want to win the

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.080 
you know ultimately we want to win the
race<00:05:47.420> and<00:05:47.450> I<00:05:47.600> want<00:05:47.750> to<00:05:47.780> do<00:05:47.870> my<00:05:47.990> best<00:05:48.200> so<00:05:49.090> there's

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
race and I want to do my best so there's

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.250 
race and I want to do my best so there's
always<00:05:50.330> I<00:05:50.480> guess<00:05:50.720> there's<00:05:50.930> always<00:05:50.990> pressure

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
always I guess there's always pressure

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.470 
always I guess there's always pressure
there<00:05:51.560> to<00:05:51.650> perform<00:05:51.850> but<00:05:52.850> but<00:05:53.000> I've<00:05:53.120> always<00:05:53.270> had

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.480 
there to perform but but I've always had

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.020 
there to perform but but I've always had
that<00:05:53.600> pressure<00:05:53.870> even<00:05:54.200> as<00:05:54.320> an<00:05:54.410> engineer<00:05:54.940> as<00:05:55.940> a

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
that pressure even as an engineer as a

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.390 
that pressure even as an engineer as a
shock<00:05:56.360> specialist<00:05:56.930> or<00:05:57.140> whatever<00:05:57.890> asked<00:05:58.160> you
