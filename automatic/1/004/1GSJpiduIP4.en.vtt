make much sense yeah how have you
handled<00:05:29.180> the<00:05:29.540> sketch<00:05:29.750> I<00:05:29.870> guess<00:05:30.050> it's<00:05:30.440> such<00:05:30.650> a

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
handled the sketch I guess it's such a

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.130 
handled the sketch I guess it's such a
sort<00:05:31.280> of<00:05:31.310> transition<00:05:31.880> because<00:05:32.480> you<00:05:32.840> used<00:05:33.050> to

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
sort of transition because you used to

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.420 
sort of transition because you used to
be<00:05:33.200> on<00:05:33.320> the<00:05:33.410> road<00:05:33.560> so<00:05:33.770> much<00:05:33.920> and<00:05:34.100> then<00:05:34.190> you<00:05:34.310> were

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
be on the road so much and then you were

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.890 
be on the road so much and then you were
off<00:05:34.610> the<00:05:34.850> road<00:05:35.030> and<00:05:35.270> now<00:05:35.390> I<00:05:35.420> know<00:05:35.540> you<00:05:35.690> do<00:05:35.870> a

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
off the road and now I know you do a

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.540 
off the road and now I know you do a
couple<00:05:36.170> of<00:05:36.260> appearances<00:05:36.500> and<00:05:36.950> then<00:05:37.370> you<00:05:37.460> were
