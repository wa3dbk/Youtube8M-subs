00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
in the ice shelf and I talked back to

october<00:01:07.939> these<00:01:08.939> things<00:01:09.119> happened<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:09.810> a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
october these things happened on a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.170 
october these things happened on a
semi-regular<00:01:10.470> basis<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.159> both<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.580> Arctic<00:01:12.090> in

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
semi-regular basis in both the Arctic in

semi-regular basis in both the Arctic in
the<00:01:12.240> Antarctic<00:01:12.750> but<00:01:12.869> it's<00:01:12.990> still<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.170> fairly

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
the Antarctic but it's still a fairly

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.010 
the Antarctic but it's still a fairly
large<00:01:13.590> event<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:15.479> we<00:01:15.600> want<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.840> make<00:01:15.990> sure

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
large event so so we want to make sure

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.050 
large event so so we want to make sure
we<00:01:16.259> capture<00:01:16.650> as<00:01:16.950> much<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.310> process<00:01:17.610> as<00:01:17.939> we

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
we capture as much of that process as we

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.359 
we capture as much of that process as we
could<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.930> today<00:01:19.470> was<00:01:19.650> our<00:01:19.770> first<00:01:20.009> trip<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.280> be

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
could so today was our first trip to be

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.039 
could so today was our first trip to be
back<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.850> area<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.390> what<00:01:21.540> we<00:01:21.659> do<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.810> we

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
back in the area and what we do is we

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.840 
back in the area and what we do is we
modify<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.560> existing<00:01:22.770> flight<00:01:23.280> plan<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.729> add

from<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.409> Pine<00:01:49.799> Island<00:01:49.829> glacier<00:01:50.630> now<00:01:51.630> if

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
from the Pine Island glacier now if

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.510 
from the Pine Island glacier now if
we're<00:01:51.899> lucky<00:01:52.079> we<00:01:52.590> may<00:01:52.770> get<00:01:52.890> another<00:01:53.159> chance<00:01:53.369> to

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
we're lucky we may get another chance to

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.039 
we're lucky we may get another chance to
come<00:01:53.700> back<00:01:53.729> in<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.090> area<00:01:54.240> later<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.810> weather

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
come back in this area later of weather

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:55.899 
come back in this area later of weather
and<00:01:55.170> timing<00:01:55.530> from<00:01:55.680> it

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
and timing from it

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.239 
and timing from it
to<00:01:56.509> basically<00:01:57.289> repeat<00:01:57.679> what<00:01:57.859> we<00:01:57.890> just<00:01:58.009> did

00:01:58.239 --> 00:01:58.249 
to basically repeat what we just did

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:00.279 
to basically repeat what we just did
today<00:01:58.579> to<00:01:58.880> see<00:01:59.060> how<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.210> how<00:01:59.749> the<00:01:59.780> rips<00:02:00.140> has

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
today to see how the how the rips has

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.209 
today to see how the how the rips has
further<00:02:00.560> develop<00:02:01.039> this<00:02:01.159> time<00:02:01.340> goes<00:02:01.549> on<00:02:01.700> a<00:02:03.219> lot

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
further develop this time goes on a lot

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:05.950 
further develop this time goes on a lot
of<00:02:04.280> times<00:02:04.549> when<00:02:04.729> you're<00:02:04.880> in<00:02:04.969> science<00:02:05.359> you<00:02:05.420> you

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
of times when you're in science you you

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.300 
of times when you're in science you you
don't<00:02:06.140> get<00:02:06.289> a<00:02:06.350> chance<00:02:06.560> to<00:02:06.710> catch<00:02:06.920> the<00:02:07.159> big

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
don't get a chance to catch the big

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.279 
don't get a chance to catch the big
stories<00:02:07.670> as<00:02:07.700> they<00:02:07.909> happen<00:02:08.450> because<00:02:08.629> you're

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
stories as they happen because you're

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.330 
stories as they happen because you're
not<00:02:09.410> there<00:02:09.619> at<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:09.799> right<00:02:09.950> place<00:02:10.160> at<00:02:10.310> the

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
not there at the right place at the

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.920 
not there at the right place at the
right<00:02:10.399> time<00:02:10.519> but<00:02:11.030> this<00:02:11.150> time<00:02:11.209> we<00:02:11.480> were<00:02:11.660> and

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
right time but this time we were and

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.180 
right time but this time we were and
these<00:02:11.989> are<00:02:12.049> discrete<00:02:12.470> events<00:02:12.739> of<00:02:12.799> time<00:02:12.950> they

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
these are discrete events of time they

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.039 
these are discrete events of time they
process<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.060> take<00:02:14.180> place<00:02:14.239> over<00:02:14.660> here<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.930> just

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
process to take place over here to just

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.320 
process to take place over here to just
a<00:02:15.170> few<00:02:15.349> weeks<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.830> we<00:02:16.730> just<00:02:16.940> happen<00:02:17.209> to<00:02:17.239> be

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
a few weeks and we just happen to be

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.830 
a few weeks and we just happen to be
here<00:02:17.540> at<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.720> right<00:02:17.870> window<00:02:18.140> in<00:02:18.230> time<00:02:18.260> captain
