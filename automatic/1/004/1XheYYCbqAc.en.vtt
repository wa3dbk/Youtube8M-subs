and some of the internet things say for

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.480 
and some of the internet things say for
hours<00:00:26.150> and<00:00:27.679> let<00:00:28.679> me<00:00:28.769> just<00:00:28.949> tell<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.160> it's

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
hours and let me just tell you it's

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.050 
hours and let me just tell you it's
heavy

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
heavy

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.580 
heavy
very<00:00:31.019> heavy<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:32.780> the<00:00:33.780> casters<00:00:34.230> are<00:00:34.380> easy

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
very heavy so the casters are easy

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.920 
very heavy so the casters are easy
putting<00:00:35.579> these<00:00:35.700> little<00:00:35.820> caps<00:00:36.180> on<00:00:36.510> or<00:00:36.720> easy

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
putting these little caps on or easy

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.840 
putting these little caps on or easy
these<00:00:37.140> little<00:00:37.410> hat<00:00:37.530> caps<00:00:37.860> just<00:00:38.220> tap<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.760> on

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
these little hat caps just tap it on

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.080 
these little hat caps just tap it on
with<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.000> hammer<00:00:39.210> these<00:00:39.540> little<00:00:39.780> plastic<00:00:39.990> ends

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
with a hammer these little plastic ends

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.130 
with a hammer these little plastic ends
just<00:00:42.090> set<00:00:42.210> them<00:00:42.330> on<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> ground<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.990> push

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
just set them on the ground and push

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.850 
just set them on the ground and push
this<00:00:43.410> down<00:00:43.650> and<00:00:44.540> then<00:00:45.680> one<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.830> first

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
this down and then one of the first

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.670 
this down and then one of the first
tricky<00:00:47.280> parts<00:00:47.580> is<00:00:47.730> lining<00:00:48.120> these<00:00:48.240> up<00:00:48.680> because

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
tricky parts is lining these up because

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.610 
tricky parts is lining these up because
they're<00:00:50.010> just<00:00:50.700> slightly<00:00:51.090> longer<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.380> way

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
they're just slightly longer this way

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.560 
they're just slightly longer this way
the<00:00:53.520> center<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.880> this<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.180> slightly<00:00:54.240> longer

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
the center of this is slightly longer

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.150 
the center of this is slightly longer
from<00:00:55.050> here<00:00:55.290> and<00:00:55.380> then<00:00:55.470> this<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.920> that's

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
from here and then this is that's

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.610 
from here and then this is that's
shorter<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.450> if<00:00:57.540> you<00:00:57.660> get<00:00:57.810> it<00:00:57.900> wrong<00:00:58.080> you<00:00:58.470> can

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
shorter and if you get it wrong you can

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.920 
shorter and if you get it wrong you can
see<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.700> be<00:00:59.820> sure<00:00:59.880> you<00:01:00.120> line<00:01:00.330> it<00:01:00.510> up<00:01:00.660> correctly

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
see so be sure you line it up correctly

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.549 
see so be sure you line it up correctly
you<00:01:01.560> can<00:01:01.650> see<00:01:01.830> how<00:01:01.950> it's<00:01:02.160> off<00:01:02.340> there<00:01:03.409> so<00:01:04.409> then

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
you can see how it's off there so then

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.320 
you can see how it's off there so then
that's<00:01:04.799> kind<00:01:05.189> of<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.400> first<00:01:05.549> stumbling<00:01:06.119> block

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
that's kind of the first stumbling block

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:22.330 
that's kind of the first stumbling block
but<00:01:06.750> anyway<00:01:07.259> well<00:01:08.159> catch<00:01:08.430> up<00:01:08.460> later

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.370 

and<00:01:23.340> step<00:01:24.060> two<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.510> done<00:01:24.750> put<00:01:25.650> on<00:01:25.830> those<00:01:27.380> plates

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
and step two is done put on those plates

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.950 
and step two is done put on those plates
and<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.280> spacers<00:01:30.140> hopefully<00:01:31.140> correctly<00:01:32.960> step

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
and the spacers hopefully correctly step

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.570 
and the spacers hopefully correctly step
three<00:01:34.230> putting<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.650> support<00:01:35.040> board<00:01:35.190> in<00:01:35.370> make

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
three putting the support board in make

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.940 
three putting the support board in make
sure<00:01:35.690> you've<00:01:36.690> put<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.170> board<00:01:37.440> in<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:37.830> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
sure you've put the board in so the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.219 
sure you've put the board in so the
Stiga<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.580> outside<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:40.080> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
Stiga is on the outside and that the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.210 
Stiga is on the outside and that the
plates<00:01:40.500> are<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:41.010> the<00:01:41.190> inside<00:01:42.020> okay<00:01:43.020> step<00:01:43.710> three

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
plates are on the inside okay step three

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.250 
plates are on the inside okay step three
is<00:01:44.370> done<00:01:46.250> using<00:01:47.250> these<00:01:47.550> wing<00:01:47.880> nuts<00:01:48.120> and<00:01:48.540> they

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
is done using these wing nuts and they

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.860 
is done using these wing nuts and they
say<00:01:49.470> attach<00:01:49.800> it<00:01:49.979> securely<00:01:50.180> as<00:01:51.180> opposed<00:01:51.660> to

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
say attach it securely as opposed to

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.370 
say attach it securely as opposed to
these<00:01:53.270> which<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.390> did<00:01:54.570> not<00:01:54.750> attach<00:01:55.080> securely

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
these which I did not attach securely

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.499 
these which I did not attach securely
yet<00:01:55.920> they're<00:01:56.190> still<00:01:56.310> room<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.940> they<00:01:57.030> must<00:01:57.270> be<00:01:57.360> a

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
yet they're still room so they must be a

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.850 
yet they're still room so they must be a
little<00:01:57.660> bit<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.900> place<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.440> we<00:01:58.560> left<00:01:58.740> those

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
little bit of place so we left those

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.550 
little bit of place so we left those
pretty<00:01:59.130> loose<00:01:59.810> step<00:02:00.810> three<00:02:01.080> and<00:02:01.229> step<00:02:01.320> four

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
pretty loose step three and step four

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.820 
pretty loose step three and step four
this<00:02:02.520> looks<00:02:02.790> crazy<00:02:03.030> here<00:02:03.630> got<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.259> supports

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
this looks crazy here got the supports

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.540 
this looks crazy here got the supports
and<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.130> linkage<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.910> all<00:02:06.000> that<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:07.340> so<00:02:08.340> here

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
and the linkage and all that and so here

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.580 
and the linkage and all that and so here
we've<00:02:08.700> got<00:02:08.850> all<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.090> parts<00:02:09.300> lined<00:02:09.720> up<00:02:10.020> and

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
we've got all the parts lined up and

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.120 
we've got all the parts lined up and
let's<00:02:11.220> see<00:02:11.459> how<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:11.790> goes<00:02:12.090> here<00:02:12.570> one<00:02:13.010> thing<00:02:14.010> I

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
let's see how this goes here one thing I

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.400 
let's see how this goes here one thing I
was<00:02:14.250> curious<00:02:14.459> about<00:02:14.820> is<00:02:15.030> they<00:02:15.900> all<00:02:16.080> have<00:02:16.260> this

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
was curious about is they all have this

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.120 
was curious about is they all have this
kind<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.709> indentation<00:02:17.489> on<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.950> but<00:02:19.950> they're

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
kind of indentation on it but they're

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.100 
kind of indentation on it but they're
all<00:02:20.280> faced<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.820> same<00:02:20.970> direction<00:02:21.270> so<00:02:21.840> I'm

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
all faced the same direction so I'm

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.710 
all faced the same direction so I'm
guessing<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.040> doesn't<00:02:23.310> matter<00:02:23.489> let<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.600> know

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
guessing it doesn't matter let you know

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.780 
guessing it doesn't matter let you know
so<00:02:25.590> this<00:02:25.799> is<00:02:25.860> why<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:26.160> need<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.459> keep<00:02:26.610> these

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
so this is why you need to keep these

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.030 
so this is why you need to keep these
loose<00:02:27.150> is<00:02:27.510> because<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:27.989> suggests<00:02:28.470> loosening

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
loose is because it suggests loosening

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.460 
loose is because it suggests loosening
them<00:02:29.239> so<00:02:30.239> you<00:02:30.330> can<00:02:30.450> fit<00:02:30.660> this<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:30.870> between<00:02:31.320> here

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
them so you can fit this in between here

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.509 
them so you can fit this in between here
but<00:02:31.620> might<00:02:31.769> have<00:02:31.830> left<00:02:32.070> it<00:02:32.160> loose<00:02:32.310> enough

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
but might have left it loose enough

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:33.949 
but might have left it loose enough
where<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.700> could<00:02:32.850> do<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.090> but<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.540> can<00:02:33.780> see

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
where you could do that but I can see

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.449 
where you could do that but I can see
why<00:02:34.110> if<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.350> tightened<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.709> much<00:02:34.950> more<00:02:35.220> than<00:02:35.280> I

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
why if you tightened it much more than I

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.740 
why if you tightened it much more than I
did<00:02:35.519> you'd<00:02:35.820> have<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.030> loosen<00:02:36.269> them<00:02:36.330> up<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.660> you

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
did you'd have to loosen them up and you

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.520 
did you'd have to loosen them up and you
don't<00:02:36.900> want<00:02:37.019> to<00:02:37.080> do<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.350> so<00:02:37.650> keep<00:02:38.400> them<00:02:38.519> loose

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
don't want to do that so keep them loose

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.630 
don't want to do that so keep them loose
okay<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:40.590> we<00:02:41.459> put<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.820> bolt<00:02:42.090> through<00:02:42.570> here

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
okay so we put the bolt through here

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.720 
okay so we put the bolt through here
plastic<00:02:44.640> need<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.269> focus<00:02:46.190> plastic<00:02:47.190> washer<00:02:47.610> in

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
plastic need to focus plastic washer in

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.080 
plastic need to focus plastic washer in
there<00:02:47.970> plastic<00:02:48.810> washer<00:02:49.380> in<00:02:49.500> there<00:02:50.090> spacer

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
there plastic washer in there spacer

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.990 
there plastic washer in there spacer
here<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.690> then<00:02:51.930> my<00:02:52.519> ten-year-old<00:02:53.519> pointed

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
here and then my ten-year-old pointed

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.360 
here and then my ten-year-old pointed
out<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.269> me<00:02:54.450> hold<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.110> there<00:02:55.290> but<00:02:55.830> still<00:02:56.070> we're

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
out to me hold it there but still we're

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.390 
out to me hold it there but still we're
kind<00:02:56.549> of<00:02:56.610> shaken<00:02:57.000> I'm<00:02:57.239> shaking<00:02:57.799> so<00:02:58.799> see<00:02:59.190> this

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
kind of shaken I'm shaking so see this

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.030 
kind of shaken I'm shaking so see this
these<00:03:00.170> have<00:03:01.170> one<00:03:01.470> size<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:02.190> then<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:04.040> smaller

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
these have one size and then a smaller

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.729 
these have one size and then a smaller
size<00:03:05.400> so<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.330> does<00:03:06.540> matter<00:03:06.810> because<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.590> won't

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
size so it does matter because it won't

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.000 
size so it does matter because it won't
fit<00:03:07.830> on<00:03:08.160> there<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:08.690> it's<00:03:09.690> pretty<00:03:10.080> much<00:03:10.200> idiot

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
fit on there so it's pretty much idiot

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.699 
fit on there so it's pretty much idiot
proof<00:03:11.250> but<00:03:11.640> just<00:03:12.450> something<00:03:12.630> to<00:03:12.720> note<00:03:12.930> I'll<00:03:13.590> go

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
proof but just something to note I'll go

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.350 
proof but just something to note I'll go
like<00:03:13.860> that<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.220> we'll<00:03:14.370> put<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.610> bolt<00:03:14.790> on<00:03:14.970> so

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
like that and we'll put the bolt on so

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
like that and we'll put the bolt on so
that's<00:03:15.660> that<00:03:16.940> okay<00:03:17.940> still<00:03:18.180> on<00:03:18.329> step<00:03:18.600> four<00:03:19.019> it

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
that's that okay still on step four it

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.039 
that's that okay still on step four it
said<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:20.010> tighten<00:03:20.430> all<00:03:20.670> these<00:03:20.910> bolts<00:03:21.360> securely

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
said to tighten all these bolts securely

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.460 
said to tighten all these bolts securely
and<00:03:22.440> then<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.860> says<00:03:23.130> note<00:03:23.640> tighten<00:03:24.299> so<00:03:25.230> this

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
and then it says note tighten so this

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.430 
and then it says note tighten so this
bolt<00:03:25.860> and<00:03:26.160> this<00:03:26.430> nut<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:27.060> it's<00:03:27.690> as<00:03:27.870> tighten<00:03:28.260> nut

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
bolt and this nut so it's as tighten nut

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.120 
bolt and this nut so it's as tighten nut
so<00:03:28.770> that<00:03:28.920> end<00:03:29.099> of<00:03:29.220> bolt<00:03:29.459> 27<00:03:30.150> is<00:03:30.300> even<00:03:30.980> with<00:03:31.980> the

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
so that end of bolt 27 is even with the

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.400 
so that end of bolt 27 is even with the
edge<00:03:32.250> of<00:03:32.489> nut<00:03:32.700> which<00:03:33.180> I<00:03:33.300> assumed<00:03:33.599> to<00:03:33.690> be<00:03:33.720> this

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
edge of nut which I assumed to be this

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.930 
edge of nut which I assumed to be this
which<00:03:34.860> is<00:03:34.980> like<00:03:35.100> that<00:03:35.310> because<00:03:35.670> you<00:03:35.880> don't

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
which is like that because you don't

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.070 
which is like that because you don't
want<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.210> tighten<00:03:36.330> this<00:03:36.510> too<00:03:36.660> much<00:03:36.780> because<00:03:36.900> I

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
want to tighten this too much because I

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.650 
want to tighten this too much because I
figured<00:03:37.590> this<00:03:37.710> has<00:03:37.860> to<00:03:38.010> move<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.610> adjust<00:03:39.600> the

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
figured this has to move to adjust the

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.600 
figured this has to move to adjust the
table<00:03:39.840> but<00:03:40.740> we'll<00:03:40.890> kind<00:03:41.100> of<00:03:41.130> check<00:03:41.340> on<00:03:41.460> that

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
table but we'll kind of check on that

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.300 
table but we'll kind of check on that
later<00:03:41.790> but<00:03:41.960> kind<00:03:42.960> of<00:03:43.050> contr<00:03:43.380> one<00:03:43.950> thing<00:03:44.130> says

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
later but kind of contr one thing says

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.650 
later but kind of contr one thing says
tighten<00:03:44.580> it<00:03:44.640> securely<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.240> says<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.570> the

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
tighten it securely and it says to the

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.700 
tighten it securely and it says to the
edge<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:45.930> nut<00:03:46.110> because<00:03:46.380> you<00:03:46.470> do<00:03:46.590> want

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
edge and nut because you do want

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.250 
edge and nut because you do want
movement<00:03:47.420> if<00:03:48.420> you<00:03:48.540> tighten<00:03:48.690> it<00:03:48.810> too<00:03:48.930> tight<00:03:49.110> it

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
movement if you tighten it too tight it

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.900 
movement if you tighten it too tight it
doesn't<00:03:49.440> really<00:03:49.560> move<00:03:49.770> so<00:03:50.100> we'll<00:03:50.490> get<00:03:50.610> back<00:03:50.670> to

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
doesn't really move so we'll get back to

00:03:50.910 --> 00:04:00.170 
doesn't really move so we'll get back to
that<00:03:54.620> step<00:03:55.620> four<00:03:55.980> is<00:03:56.220> complete<00:03:58.610> my<00:03:59.610> second

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
that step four is complete my second

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.090 
that step four is complete my second
helper<00:04:00.420> my<00:04:00.540> ten-year-old<00:04:00.900> reminded<00:04:01.710> me<00:04:01.860> as

all right so here's the back of the
table<00:04:27.390> will<00:04:27.750> you're<00:04:27.990> you<00:04:28.530> know<00:04:28.620> where<00:04:28.770> you'll

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
table will you're you know where you'll

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.830 
table will you're you know where you'll
be<00:04:28.950> playing<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.580> hitting<00:04:29.850> and<00:04:29.970> then<00:04:30.390> up<00:04:30.510> here

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.200 
be playing and hitting and then up here
is<00:04:31.020> where<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:31.710> net<00:04:31.920> goes<00:04:32.190> and<00:04:32.580> it's<00:04:32.790> important

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
edge without the pilot holes so the

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.630 
edge without the pilot holes so the
stripe<00:05:19.110> is<00:05:19.410> down<00:05:19.920> that<00:05:20.190> side<00:05:20.460> and<00:05:22.010> got<00:05:23.010> lined

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
stripe is down that side and got lined

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.700 
stripe is down that side and got lined

in step 11 through 13 putting on the end
rails<00:06:07.070> so<00:06:08.070> got<00:06:08.610> steps<00:06:09.240> 11<00:06:09.810> through<00:06:09.960> 13<00:06:09.990> done

step 14 15 the legs are done I just
built<00:06:28.170> both<00:06:28.410> legs<00:06:28.740> for<00:06:29.580> both<00:06:29.730> sides<00:06:30.290> and<00:06:31.290> then

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
built both legs for both sides and then

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.960 
built both legs for both sides and then
they<00:06:31.530> went<00:06:31.650> together<00:06:31.830> easy<00:06:32.160> not<00:06:32.460> much<00:06:32.640> to<00:06:32.820> talk
