00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.910
 today we are going to talk again about a 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.570
 unknown invention the invention that touches 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.520
 today it is a surfboard 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.480
 motorized a surfboard that 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:43.019
 appeared in the year 1948 and that according to his 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.550
 own creator one could climb 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:48.699
 quietly stand up and smoke 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.850
 a cigarette without staggering without 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:55.330
 move let's say this surfboard 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.480
 It was designed to have a stability 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.790
 perfect so it will not spin and so 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.670
 did not fall on you mind today 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.619
 there are motorized surfboards 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.170
 can add engines in the tables 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:12.130
 surf but at the time it came out 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:15.340
 It was the first motorized surfboard 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.520
 and at that time it was also a 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.830
 invention that went unnoticed today in 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.240
 day the truth is that there are many people who 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.700
 is dedicated to surfing 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.530
 much more than before before it 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.380
 considered as a very sport 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.200
 dangerous and little usable 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.869
 and well the truth is that yes today in 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.479
 this man would have invented for 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.659
 first time the motorized surfboard 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.030
 in our time it would have been 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.280
 award-winning in thousands of ways without 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.460
 But at the time when he invented 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.170
 this motorized surfboard like ya 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.200
 I say it went unnoticed 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.090
 practically nobody bought it another 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.390
 invention that will not fall into oblivion 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.090
 while this channel exists for 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.610
 remember it a place where you can 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.149
 find the rarest inventions that 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:10.750
 have never existed the table table of 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:13.420
 motorized surfing as a curiosity I can 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.099
 teach good you have already seen the photo 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.830
 of the uncle that is mounted on the table 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:21.240
 surfing who is smoking a cigarette with 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:24.090
 his suit calmly 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.970
 an invention that does not revolutionize its time 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:31.430
 but that if it had come out in our 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.430
 epoch for the first time if I had not done
