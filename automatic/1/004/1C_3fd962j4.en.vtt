00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:09.070 

oh<00:00:01.550> yeah<00:00:02.909> so<00:00:03.300> after<00:00:03.899> um<00:00:05.720> three<00:00:06.720> or<00:00:06.839> four<00:00:07.649> months

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 
oh yeah so after um three or four months

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:16.279 
oh yeah so after um three or four months
however<00:00:10.080> long<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.860> started<00:00:11.490> on<00:00:11.610> this<00:00:12.860> I<00:00:15.049> think<00:00:16.049> I

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
however long I started on this I think I

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.510 
however long I started on this I think I
can<00:00:16.320> actually<00:00:16.710> get<00:00:16.830> this<00:00:16.920> project<00:00:17.190> finished

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
can actually get this project finished

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:26.660 
can actually get this project finished
now<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:22.939> finally<00:00:23.939> ordered<00:00:25.130> the<00:00:26.130> harmonic

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
now I finally ordered the harmonic

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:34.940 
now I finally ordered the harmonic
balancer<00:00:31.250> once<00:00:32.250> again<00:00:32.550> here's<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.710> new<00:00:34.710> boat

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
balancer once again here's the new boat

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.530 
balancer once again here's the new boat
that<00:00:36.890> replaces<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.040> uh<00:00:39.829> okay

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
that replaces it uh okay

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.110 
that replaces it uh okay
but<00:00:42.540> yeah<00:00:42.719> that's<00:00:43.110> been<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> lot<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.340> work<00:00:44.670> in

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
but yeah that's been a lot of work in

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.990 
but yeah that's been a lot of work in
the<00:00:45.629> making

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
the making

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.670 
the making
okay<00:00:48.079> and<00:00:49.079> over<00:00:49.500> here<00:00:50.510> I've<00:00:51.510> got<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:52.020> new

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
okay and over here I've got the new

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:10.920 
okay and over here I've got the new
balancer

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.840 

so<00:01:11.930> what<00:01:12.140> you<00:01:12.409> love<00:01:12.680> it's<00:01:12.920> back<00:01:13.189> here<00:01:13.490> there<00:01:13.759> we

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
so what you love it's back here there we

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.469 
so what you love it's back here there we
go<00:01:14.350> and<00:01:15.350> this<00:01:15.740> is<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.780> new<00:01:17.780> balancer<00:01:18.759> I<00:01:19.759> bought

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
go and this is the new balancer I bought

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.030 
go and this is the new balancer I bought
the<00:01:20.720> this<00:01:21.140> came<00:01:21.380> from<00:01:21.590> O'Reilly<00:01:22.840> Auto<00:01:23.840> Parts

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
the this came from O'Reilly Auto Parts

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.710 
the this came from O'Reilly Auto Parts
and<00:01:25.040> I<00:01:25.640> ordered<00:01:26.090> it<00:01:26.320> a<00:01:27.320> Thursday<00:01:28.009> night<00:01:28.539> and<00:01:29.539> it

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
and I ordered it a Thursday night and it

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.139 
and I ordered it a Thursday night and it
was<00:01:29.840> here<00:01:30.020> Friday<00:01:30.289> morning<00:01:30.850> and<00:01:31.850> of<00:01:31.940> course

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
was here Friday morning and of course

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.430 
was here Friday morning and of course
I've<00:01:32.330> also<00:01:32.479> got<00:01:32.899> new<00:01:33.530> Woodruff<00:01:34.430> keys<00:01:35.170> to<00:01:36.170> go<00:01:36.289> in

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
I've also got new Woodruff keys to go in

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.440 
I've also got new Woodruff keys to go in
here<00:01:36.649> about<00:01:37.310> three<00:01:37.820> of<00:01:38.000> them<00:01:38.090> they're<00:01:38.240> like<00:01:38.420> a

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
here about three of them they're like a

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.219 
here about three of them they're like a
dollar<00:01:38.750> some<00:01:39.740> apiece<00:01:40.720> yeah<00:01:41.720> we'll<00:01:41.929> just<00:01:41.960> go

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
dollar some apiece yeah we'll just go

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:43.690 
dollar some apiece yeah we'll just go
ahead<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:42.649> make<00:01:42.800> sure<00:01:42.860> that<00:01:43.250> this<00:01:43.429> fits

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
ahead and make sure that this fits

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:51.240 
ahead and make sure that this fits
correctly<00:01:47.890> that's<00:01:48.890> like<00:01:49.100> it's<00:01:49.280> supposed<00:01:49.610> to

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
correctly that's like it's supposed to

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.609 
correctly that's like it's supposed to
all<00:01:52.250> right<00:01:52.550> and<00:01:53.179> now<00:01:53.569> the<00:01:53.630> next<00:01:54.020> thing<00:01:54.200> we<00:01:54.500> will

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
all right and now the next thing we will

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.960 
all right and now the next thing we will
do<00:01:56.740> I'll<00:01:57.740> go<00:01:57.979> ahead<00:01:58.069> and<00:01:58.369> try<00:01:58.550> to<00:01:58.610> find<00:01:58.819> my

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
do I'll go ahead and try to find my

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.639 
do I'll go ahead and try to find my
caliper<00:01:59.569> and<00:02:00.440> I've<00:02:00.590> got<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:01.159> compare<00:02:02.649> the

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
caliper and I've got to compare the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:10.920 
caliper and I've got to compare the
diameters<00:02:08.350> from<00:02:09.350> this<00:02:09.560> one<00:02:09.799> to<00:02:10.009> this<00:02:10.220> one

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
diameters from this one to this one

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.759 
diameters from this one to this one
especially<00:02:11.930> that<00:02:12.200> inside<00:02:12.920> diameter<00:02:14.019> yeah<00:02:15.019> but

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
especially that inside diameter yeah but

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.190 
especially that inside diameter yeah but
you're<00:02:15.950> wondering<00:02:16.370> why<00:02:17.030> I've<00:02:17.420> got<00:02:17.660> it<00:02:17.810> all

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
you're wondering why I've got it all

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.430 
you're wondering why I've got it all
stripped<00:02:18.650> down<00:02:18.829> now

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
stripped down now

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.160 
stripped down now
well<00:02:21.730> what<00:02:22.730> happened<00:02:23.739> now<00:02:24.739> you<00:02:24.950> see<00:02:25.190> this

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
well what happened now you see this

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.150 
well what happened now you see this
piece<00:02:27.170> right<00:02:27.410> here<00:02:27.470> that<00:02:28.239> is<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:30.160> existing

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
piece right here that is the existing

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.750 
piece right here that is the existing
Woodruff<00:02:31.790> key<00:02:32.980> okay<00:02:33.980> now<00:02:34.160> what's<00:02:34.340> got<00:02:34.579> to

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
Woodruff key okay now what's got to

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.250 
Woodruff key okay now what's got to
happen<00:02:35.260> in<00:02:36.260> order<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.829> replace<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.810> I've<00:02:38.810> got

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
happen in order to replace it I've got

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.009 
happen in order to replace it I've got
to<00:02:39.590> probably<00:02:40.310> remove<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:41.030> timing<00:02:41.420> sprockets

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
to probably remove the timing sprockets

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.750 
to probably remove the timing sprockets
uh<00:02:42.519> no<00:02:44.680> I'm<00:02:45.680> not<00:02:45.709> going<00:02:46.100> to<00:02:46.190> replace<00:02:46.459> the

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
uh no I'm not going to replace the

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.170 
uh no I'm not going to replace the
timing<00:02:47.180> set<00:02:47.450> on<00:02:47.660> it<00:02:48.549> because<00:02:49.549> it<00:02:49.700> probably<00:02:50.060> has

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
timing set on it because it probably has

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.360 
timing set on it because it probably has
less<00:02:53.180> than<00:02:54.489> 6,000<00:02:55.489> miles<00:02:55.790> on<00:02:56.000> it

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
less than 6,000 miles on it

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.300 
less than 6,000 miles on it
2008<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:59.329> same<00:02:59.540> thing<00:02:59.780> happened<00:03:00.260> in<00:03:01.160> our

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
2008 the same thing happened in our

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.920 
2008 the same thing happened in our
place<00:03:01.670> timing<00:03:02.299> sat<00:03:03.049> and<00:03:03.500> oil<00:03:03.950> pump<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:05.000> I'll

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
place timing sat and oil pump and I'll

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.599 
place timing sat and oil pump and I'll
put<00:03:06.109> all<00:03:06.200> gaskets<00:03:06.799> on<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.069> engine<00:03:07.489> and

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
put all gaskets on the engine and

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.940 
put all gaskets on the engine and
everything<00:03:07.970> else<00:03:08.150> well<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:09.319> harmonic

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
everything else well the harmonic

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.640 
everything else well the harmonic
balancer<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.489> replaced<00:03:10.940> with<00:03:11.299> it<00:03:11.480> that<00:03:12.350> I<00:03:12.380> put

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
balancer I replaced with it that I put

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.000 
balancer I replaced with it that I put
on<00:03:12.680> didn't<00:03:13.069> it<00:03:13.310> fit<00:03:13.579> just<00:03:13.609> a<00:03:13.940> little<00:03:14.299> bit<00:03:14.420> loose

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
on didn't it fit just a little bit loose

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.590 
on didn't it fit just a little bit loose
and<00:03:16.010> I<00:03:16.100> think<00:03:16.370> that<00:03:16.549> is<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.760> cause<00:03:17.359> of<00:03:17.389> the

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
and I think that is the cause of the

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.670 
and I think that is the cause of the
problem<00:03:17.989> I<00:03:18.049> think<00:03:18.229> it<00:03:18.350> was<00:03:18.470> just<00:03:18.650> my<00:03:19.750> cheapness

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
problem I think it was just my cheapness

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.970 
problem I think it was just my cheapness
-<00:03:22.310> or<00:03:22.610> rather<00:03:22.819> than<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.269> order<00:03:23.659> a<00:03:23.690> new<00:03:24.080> harmonic

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
- or rather than to order a new harmonic

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.649 
- or rather than to order a new harmonic
balancer<00:03:25.370> then<00:03:25.519> I<00:03:25.549> put<00:03:25.790> a<00:03:25.819> used<00:03:26.060> one<00:03:26.299> on<00:03:26.330> it

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:26.659 
balancer then I put a used one on it

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.539 
balancer then I put a used one on it
this<00:03:27.530> is<00:03:27.709> what<00:03:27.860> it<00:03:27.890> got<00:03:28.069> me

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
this is what it got me

but the new Woodruff Keys in and I had a

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:22.060 
but the new Woodruff Keys in and I had a
bit<00:06:19.310> of<00:06:19.340> a<00:06:19.550> hassle<00:06:19.820> getting<00:06:20.300> the<00:06:21.070> timing

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
bit of a hassle getting the timing

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.840 
bit of a hassle getting the timing
sprockets<00:06:22.790> out<00:06:23.919> but<00:06:24.919> I<00:06:25.070> got<00:06:25.250> them<00:06:25.430> out<00:06:25.550> in<00:06:25.669> one

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
sprockets out but I got them out in one

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.270 
sprockets out but I got them out in one
piece<00:06:26.380> so<00:06:27.380> that's<00:06:27.530> a<00:06:27.620> big<00:06:27.740> plus

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 
piece so that's a big plus

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.100 
piece so that's a big plus
and<00:06:28.370> of<00:06:28.880> course<00:06:29.060> I've<00:06:29.210> already<00:06:29.510> got<00:06:30.020> it

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
and of course I've already got it

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.950 
and of course I've already got it
installed<00:06:30.430> and<00:06:31.430> I<00:06:32.300> have<00:06:32.510> the<00:06:32.840> marks<00:06:33.410> lined<00:06:33.770> up

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
installed and I have the marks lined up

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.629 
installed and I have the marks lined up
so<00:06:35.960> really<00:06:36.139> the<00:06:36.590> only<00:06:36.650> thing<00:06:36.979> left<00:06:37.250> to<00:06:37.430> do<00:06:37.610> now

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 
so really the only thing left to do now

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:43.620 
so really the only thing left to do now
is<00:06:38.210> to<00:06:39.110> put<00:06:39.380> it<00:06:39.470> together<00:06:41.740> scrape<00:06:42.740> the<00:06:42.889> gaskets

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:43.630 
is to put it together scrape the gaskets

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.770 
is to put it together scrape the gaskets
clean<00:06:44.630> all<00:06:44.750> the<00:06:44.870> surfaces<00:06:46.330> put<00:06:47.330> together<00:06:47.479> it

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:47.780 
clean all the surfaces put together it

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.139 
clean all the surfaces put together it
should<00:06:47.900> run
