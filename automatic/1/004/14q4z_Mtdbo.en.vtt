00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
 Hello everyone! 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.580
 I got a lot of questions about Japan on my main channel. 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.320
 There is also Japanese and a lot of different things. 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.740
 Also sent to websites like tumblr 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.120
 But only one person 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.360
 Can see my response... maybe 10 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.240
 So I want to do a series of short videos. 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.180
 Answer questions about Japan. 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.260
 This means leaving your question in the message area喔

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.020
 I will do a video to answer some hot questions. 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.380
 So today's video is one of my most common problems. 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.480
 That is... how did you learn Japanese? 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.620
 And it will be a little bit long, so keep watching it喔

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.800
 First of all, my Japan is not perfect. 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.680
 It is functional, but it is not perfect. 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.140
 Not super amazing, I am still learning, so... yeah! 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.360
 Secondly, I am self-learning Japanese. 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.540
 ...so I research myself 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.820
 I don't think this is the most effective way to learn a language. 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.220
 It depends on how you learn 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.120
 But I definitely think that the situation in a classroom is like 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.200
 In the same kind of pressure cooker 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.460
 Everything you have to remember because of the test 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.520
 You must also speak in class 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.420
 This is really helpful. 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.220
 So you should go to a local language class. 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.560
 If there is nothing, continue listening 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.420
 Because I will tell you how to learn Japanese by yourself. 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.140
 The first thing you have to do is to learn pseudonyms, hiragana and katakana. 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.560
 Sit down and learn about things like beasts 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.760
 Because you have to! 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.480
 People I have known have lived in Japan for one year. 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.920
 He has not completed his katakana 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.460
 Do not! You only need to study them for a week, believe me! 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.520
 You can finish it in one day. This is to be memorized. 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.740
 Remember it, learn how to write it - you're done! 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.040
 it is good. I know this sounds a bit crazy, but I am serious. 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.160
 Learn hiragana and katakana 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.680
 Now let's take a look at my favorite Japanese textbook. 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.800
 This is the best textbook for learning Japanese. 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.980
 This book is a little bit academic. 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.200
 But his structure is very, very good, I like it very much. 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.760
 But if you are different from my way of learning, you may not like it so much... this is 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.500
 Genki. This is the second book, the first one is red. 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.220
 You can find it on Amazon and I will put the link below. 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.500
 You can buy it with the exercise book and CD. 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.620
 I have never really used a CD, but I think it should be useful. 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.620
 If you want to learn by yourself 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.960
 I am completely self-taught in this book. 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.560
 It has an amazing structure, as I said. 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.800
 You will get a list of words that you must remember. 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.900
 Because all chapters contain these words 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.240
 So this is a good way to motivate you to actually remember the vocabulary 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.000
 I keep falling of things 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.260
 But anyway, it has a list of words 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.820
 It has grammar, grammar pages, and English interpretation is also very good 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.020
 Then - there are more practice questions 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.300
 Many questions 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.240
 Speaking challenge 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:25.140
 For each lesson, there is a list of Chinese characters on the back. 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.120
 Even if you don't have a Japanese teacher 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.120
 Or a friend or language exchange partner 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.940
 I think you can learn a lot from it. 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.960
 Obviously if you are a beginner. Start with red 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.040
 Then go see the green Genki 2 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.620
 It may be slightly more expensive if it is bought overseas. 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.640
 But if you have a friend who wants to go to Japan, 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.200
 Or a friend who lives in Japan, it is only 3,000 yen. 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.720
 I think this is actually quite cheap for this kind of book. 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.860
 I think I paid $90 in New Zealand. 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.400
 YAY! Not for this price YAY 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.840
 The only downside is - no teacher can check your answer 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.080
 You really have to check yourself, you may accidentally learn the wrong things. 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.260
 There is also "Japanese for everyone", this is another series of introductory textbooks. 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.720
 He also has a high level, medium level distinction 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.080
 I have never used it, but the university is using this book. 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.940
 So if you don't like the style of the Genki textbook. Can think about it 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.660
 If you have already completed Genki 2, I suggest you look at that one. 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.760
 Hard to find a solid study book 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.120
 So when I finish Genki 2 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.420
 I read those books 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.800
 I also did Sankyu (N3) and then I did nikyu (N2) 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.460
 After that, I remembered everything in sankyu. 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.440
 a little bit of repetition 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.900
 So choose a book that is similar to your level. 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.980
 These exercises for Chinese characters are very helpful. 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.600
 It helps me learn Chinese characters and strengthen my grammar. 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.080
 It has grammar, reading, Chinese characters, and vocabulary. 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.880
 These are pretty good. I will put the link below 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.280
 The construction next to it was very noisy, sorry. 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.220
 But I have to continue 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.860
 So Japanese books, comics, magazines, 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.660
 Japanese translation of Japanese books, Japanese movies 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.720
 - These things are very good. 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.160
 Add your learning knowledge... loud! 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.780
 Ok, I am back. Too noisy. I am back. 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.940
 So the last step - you can do it in Japan 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.360
 Or you can get in touch with things in Japan. 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.080
 Japanese music, Japanese cartoon, Japanese TV series, 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.940
 Japanese movies, Japanese and Japanese things. 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.700
 You can set your computer language to Japanese 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.220
 You can speak Japanese to yourself 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.240
 You can make a film in Japanese. 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.740
 If you want to try it out, you can do your own "jikoshoukai" (self-introduction) 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.600
 Then send it online to prove that you watched this video. 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.660
 We can all become very Japanese... 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.840
 The last thing is to use the Internet as a learning tool. 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.200
 I put this reason last 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.720
 Because even if you can learn some cool Japanese on the Internet 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.640
 And you can definitely immerse yourself in the Japanese world. 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.660
 And practicing Japanese online 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.860
 This is by no means the only thing you should do. 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.800
 This is an extra option to complement your learning. 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.540
 I have heard many people and Japanese Skype 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.540
 Or talk on Twitter 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.180
 In fact, there are many Japanese who want to learn English. 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.960
 So you can do a language exchange. 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.180
 There is a website called Lang-8, everyone can correct your Japanese. 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.860
 YouTube has a lot of Japanese videos. 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.160
 You may spend hours or days. 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.640
 Or watch all the videos in a few years 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.760
 Just be careful, because I know, you know 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.840
 Internet is very addictive. 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.300
 It will trick you into thinking that you are learning 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.480
 Actually you don’t have it at all 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:13.100
 Because you may think that you have seen some YouTube videos. 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.160
 But it may not be better than you 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.040
 It’s more efficient to practice Japanese in 10 minutes a day. 

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.660
 I swear that this is the last point. I actually talked about three points, sorry! 

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.720
 The last point is that you can practice a little bit a day. Also don't feel depressed. 

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.920
 I am at my lunch break 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.300
 I will carry my textbook with me. 

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:40.000
 I will use it whenever I have any chance. 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.060
 This really helped me a lot, so maybe this will help you. 

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.040
 Unless you don't work. 

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.700
 So, you... [dropped metal sound] Yeah. 

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.340
 So you can leave your suggestion in the comments section. 

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.260
 And your language learning skills. 

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.180
 And leave your request 

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.680
 If you like this video, please press the praise! 

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.200
 I may help you answer. great! 

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:12.200
 Byeeeee! Wow, it’s so vague. Goodbye. 

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.100
 I look like Boxxy.
