bit<00:01:11.909> easier<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.360> do<00:01:12.659> up<00:01:12.810> at<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> same<00:01:13.290> time

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
bit easier to do up at the same time

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:27.200 
bit easier to do up at the same time
because<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.340> their<00:01:14.490> form<00:01:14.760> factors<00:01:20.150> let's<00:01:21.150> go
