00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.160
 hello dear friends myself again rum 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.160
 cola shocked is another 150 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:36.500
 after 8 months so sports tsey accumulated 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:45.320
 many of its problems known to many as 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:51.019
 tell about him tell all this 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:56.360
 know well, naturally our will take an interest 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:01:01.120
 on the engine exactly that I had 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:05.170
 break down over these eight years from me 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.240
 tore off the gear 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.090
 electric starter and cut gear teeth 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.399
 overrunning clutch parts went of course 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.580
 long and not as expensive as icons 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:18.890
 but at least they came 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:22.390
 the next big crash it was 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.390
 UAH system 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.149
 a generator there are two bats that are here 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.170
 keeps the pick slightly shifted 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:40.679
 I stopped giving out pretty topics 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.590
 most shifted label adjustment 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:47.159
 valve and valve started it turns out 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.409
 piston up comes during valve 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.750
 opens valve piston meets 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:02:00.590
 here they broke off valve cases 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:02:00.590
 Well, after that, after repair, everything became 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:09.259
 literally warm 

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:15.810
 just perfect it today even just 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:19.340
 Akira exporter happened before 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:23.910
 I went to this review I started 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:27.200
 just weird life keep track and after 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.940
 Nights I kick at our starter 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.690
 it only began to categorically become 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.720
 Kacha no longer wanted to be born 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:42.239
 but so small a Falun is a wheel 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:45.690
 let's say there is worth stepping what past 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.220
 all releases pressed the boxer but how 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:53.860
 correct rascal carcass this 100 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:56.500
 But in the cut I completely took off to the spotlight 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.740
 last put here such and then accounts 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.470
 with Kirill 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.990
 cut your number I of plastic 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.200
 under the fridge but as you can see it looks 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.630
 as more or less cool but 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.470
 at least it's a couple since I shot them 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.870
 not heard there broke just the same 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:23.190
 I wanted to like it 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:23.190
 motorcycle departure 52 correct hours 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:32.290
 fifty two hours i ca n't say that 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:38.320
 what for 100000 at the new price 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:41.410
 it's pretty bad bike but if 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:46.420
 fight back nowhere and for example if only 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:50.470
 he will certainly be disappointed but when 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.360
 he drives it how much you get 1 to but 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.290
 it has to be repaired quite 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.380
 often driving performance this 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.850
 the bike is beautiful 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:04.000
 through the fields and drive just without any 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:08.080
 problems that is, he can simply give 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.019
 sharply gas on the field itself you go 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:14.110
 very good and on motocross I'm on it 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:16.540
 often ride suspension seems to hold if 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.549
 strong will be jumping high as 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.729
 professional motocross barter 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.919
 I think this bike just doesn't 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.750
 It withstands both the suspension and 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:29.200
 engines 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.140
 but if so little on light skate 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.420
 But I think this bike will be just 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.820
 excellent for motocross beginnings 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:41.220
 not only walks as soon as you 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:50.880
 learn higher jumping advice 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:50.880
 will just be very very very often but 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:59.640
 when you go just great 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.640
 so 

00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:28.959
 I have a lot to say 

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:28.959
 neodymium 

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:38.109
 I think it all happens after the shooting 

00:07:35.179 --> 00:07:38.109
 loud
