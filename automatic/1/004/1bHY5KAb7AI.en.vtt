autoblog games so first of all and
Leblanc<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.930> first<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.650> always<00:00:23.220> go<00:00:23.340> for<00:00:23.580> a

Leblanc the first I always go for a

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.700 
Leblanc the first I always go for a
Doran<00:00:23.910> ring<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.750> health<00:00:24.990> pots<00:00:25.199> because<00:00:25.529> it

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
Doran ring and to health pots because it

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.040 
Doran ring and to health pots because it
gives<00:00:25.800> me<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.189> manner<00:00:27.090> sustained<00:00:27.539> from<00:00:27.869> the

Dons ring and health from the health

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.750 
Dons ring and health from the health
pots<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.960> first<00:00:33.960> move<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.469> go<00:00:34.649> for<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.890> W<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.489> lot

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
pots and first move I go for the W a lot

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.209 
pots and first move I go for the W a lot
of<00:00:35.850> people<00:00:36.120> tend<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.360> go<00:00:36.480> for<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> queue<00:00:37.219> I

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
of people tend to go for the queue I

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.910 
of people tend to go for the queue I
think<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.780> for<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.809> Blanc<00:00:40.110> you're<00:00:40.800> not

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
think that for the Blanc you're not

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.619 
think that for the Blanc you're not
going<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.100> go<00:00:41.190> for<00:00:41.370> level<00:00:41.579> one<00:00:41.700> kill<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.210> mean

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
going to go for level one kill I mean

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.540 
going to go for level one kill I mean
level<00:00:42.899> two<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.350> when<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.100> can<00:00:44.250> start<00:00:44.430> doing

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
level two is when you can start doing

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.170 
level two is when you can start doing
damage<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.270> i'll<00:00:45.690> show<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.870> how<00:00:46.309> but<00:00:47.309> i<00:00:47.820> think

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
damage and i'll show you how but i think

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.189 
damage and i'll show you how but i think
w<00:00:48.329> just<00:00:48.629> offers<00:00:48.980> more<00:00:50.539> like<00:00:51.539> mobility<00:00:52.110> at

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
w just offers more like mobility at

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.959 
w just offers more like mobility at
level<00:00:52.440> one<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.010> case<00:00:53.039> someone<00:00:53.730> does<00:00:53.910> come

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
level one just in case someone does come

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.029 
level one just in case someone does come
for<00:00:54.180> an<00:00:54.239> early<00:00:54.420> young<00:00:54.600> i<00:00:54.899> think<00:00:55.469> it's<00:00:55.649> much

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
for an early young i think it's much

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.310 
for an early young i think it's much
more<00:00:56.449> useful<00:00:57.449> um<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:59.100> level<00:00:59.940> 2<00:01:00.149> i'm<00:01:00.840> going<00:01:00.899> to

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
more useful um so level 2 i'm going to

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.020 
more useful um so level 2 i'm going to
take<00:01:01.500> my<00:01:01.649> cue<00:01:01.920> now<00:01:02.750> your<00:01:03.750> q<00:01:04.339> marks<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.519> target

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
take my cue now your q marks the target

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.990 
take my cue now your q marks the target
so<00:01:06.659> what's<00:01:07.350> up<00:01:07.470> mark<00:01:07.619> grow<00:01:07.830> them<00:01:08.040> your<00:01:08.760> next

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
so what's up mark grow them your next

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.060 
so what's up mark grow them your next
attack<00:01:09.240> will<00:01:09.270> do<00:01:09.630> more<00:01:10.229> damage<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.979> will

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
attack will do more damage and it will

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.850 
attack will do more damage and it will
also<00:01:11.189> sounds<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.760> target<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.810> your<00:01:13.380> level<00:01:13.650> to

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
also sounds the target so your level to

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.240 
also sounds the target so your level to
rotation<00:01:14.490> should<00:01:14.729> be<00:01:14.880> q<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.570> then<00:01:16.140> W<00:01:16.590> which

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
rotation should be q and then W which

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.060 
rotation should be q and then W which
will<00:01:17.460> put<00:01:18.090> up<00:01:18.240> more<00:01:18.420> damage<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.799> also

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
will put up more damage and it also

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.870 
will put up more damage and it also
sounds<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.759> target<00:01:21.119> once<00:01:21.750> you've<00:01:22.670> got<00:01:23.670> a

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
sounds the target once you've got a

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.149 
sounds the target once you've got a
point<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.450> each<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.869> your<00:01:24.990> moves<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.920> then

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
point in each of your moves you then

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.510 
point in each of your moves you then
want<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.490> as<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.689> level<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:28.020> imax<00:01:28.590> my<00:01:28.920> W<00:01:29.250> first

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
want to as you level of imax my W first

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.960 
want to as you level of imax my W first
because<00:01:30.420> as<00:01:31.020> long<00:01:31.439> as<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.710> do<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.920> rotation<00:01:32.280> q

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
because as long as you do the rotation q

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.960 
because as long as you do the rotation q
first<00:01:33.240> then<00:01:33.479> w<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.380> will<00:01:34.439> do<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.920> nice<00:01:35.549> amount<00:01:35.820> of

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
first then w it will do a nice amount of

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.289 
first then w it will do a nice amount of
damage<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.600> all<00:01:37.560> also<00:01:38.009> offers<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.119> more

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
damage and all also offers you more

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.350 
damage and all also offers you more
mobility<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:40.170> more<00:01:41.040> survivability<00:01:41.610> because

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
mobility and more survivability because

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.460 
mobility and more survivability because
your<00:01:43.259> w<00:01:43.640> jumps<00:01:44.640> forward<00:01:44.880> then<00:01:45.780> reactivate<00:01:46.350> to

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
your w jumps forward then reactivate to

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.899 
your w jumps forward then reactivate to
jump<00:01:46.680> back<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:48.140> it<00:01:49.140> helps<00:01:49.380> confuse<00:01:49.829> your<00:01:50.640> liner

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
jump back so it helps confuse your liner

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.670 
jump back so it helps confuse your liner
as<00:01:51.240> well<00:01:51.450> as<00:01:51.570> junglers<00:01:53.149> I'm<00:01:54.149> then<00:01:54.659> second<00:01:55.470> I

the<00:03:18.820> goal<00:03:19.060> so<00:03:19.989> you<00:03:20.770> want<00:03:20.920> to<00:03:20.980> make<00:03:21.010> sure<00:03:21.810> what

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
the goal so you want to make sure what

some<00:03:23.170> people<00:03:23.440> do<00:03:23.590> too<00:03:23.950> is<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.250> nice<00:03:25.150> tip<00:03:25.450> is<00:03:25.690> that

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
some people do too is a nice tip is that

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
when you get to that swype sent you go

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.030 
when you get to that swype sent you go
invisible<00:03:29.110> for<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.320> second<00:03:29.709> and<00:03:29.890> then

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
there's two of you your clone oyes runs

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.600 
there's two of you your clone oyes runs
away<00:03:32.140> from<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.380> source<00:03:32.560> of<00:03:32.650> damage<00:03:32.950> if<00:03:33.459> you

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
away from the source of damage if you

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.300 
away from the source of damage if you
stay<00:03:33.850> still<00:03:34.200> nine<00:03:35.200> out<00:03:35.350> of<00:03:35.380> ten<00:03:35.590> people<00:03:36.010> will

run<00:03:36.610> after<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.970> Clone<00:03:37.239> thinking<00:03:37.660> oh<00:03:37.840> well

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
run after the Clone thinking oh well

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.060 
run after the Clone thinking oh well
he's<00:03:38.140> not<00:03:38.260> going<00:03:38.410> to<00:03:38.470> stay<00:03:38.590> still<00:03:38.860> he's

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
he's not going to stay still he's

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.860 
he's not going to stay still he's
obviously<00:03:39.280> going<00:03:39.520> to<00:03:39.610> try<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:39.790> run<00:03:39.940> away<00:03:40.030> so

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
obviously going to try and run away so

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.420 
obviously going to try and run away so
they<00:03:41.230> go<00:03:41.350> after<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.709> clone<00:03:41.890> which<00:03:42.070> is<00:03:42.190> running

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
they go after the clone which is running

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.090 
they go after the clone which is running
away<00:03:42.520> but<00:03:43.330> once<00:03:43.870> you<00:03:43.930> get<00:03:44.050> to<00:03:44.110> higher<00:03:44.440> elo<00:03:44.680> this

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
away but once you get to higher elo this

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.420 
away but once you get to higher elo this
won't<00:03:45.340> work<00:03:45.550> because<00:03:45.850> people<00:03:46.300> will<00:03:46.510> know<00:03:46.750> that

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
won't work because people will know that

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.280 
won't work because people will know that
LeBlanc's<00:03:48.430> clone<00:03:48.940> will<00:03:49.150> never<00:03:49.360> stay<00:03:49.630> still<00:03:49.660> so

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
LeBlanc's clone will never stay still so

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.630 
LeBlanc's clone will never stay still so
if<00:03:50.470> you<00:03:50.590> stay<00:03:50.830> still<00:03:51.100> they'll<00:03:51.310> know<00:03:51.520> that

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
if you stay still they'll know that

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.750 
if you stay still they'll know that
that's<00:03:51.790> you<00:03:52.560> best<00:03:53.560> way<00:03:54.010> to<00:03:54.730> do<00:03:54.880> it<00:03:55.060> is<00:03:56.340> as<00:03:57.340> your

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
that's you best way to do it is as your

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.850 
that's you best way to do it is as your
clone<00:03:57.970> runs<00:03:58.209> that<00:03:58.450> way<00:03:58.660> you<00:03:59.290> run<00:03:59.440> that<00:03:59.650> way

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
clone runs that way you run that way

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.960 
clone runs that way you run that way
then<00:04:00.190> they've<00:04:00.340> got<00:04:00.459> a<00:04:00.489> fifty-fifty<00:04:00.940> chance

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
then they've got a fifty-fifty chance

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.110 
then they've got a fifty-fifty chance
they<00:04:01.330> don't<00:04:01.360> know<00:04:01.570> which<00:04:01.690> one<00:04:01.840> to<00:04:01.900> go<00:04:02.080> far<00:04:02.380> and

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
they don't know which one to go far and

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.600 
they don't know which one to go far and
using<00:04:04.120> your<00:04:04.510> e<00:04:05.080> and<00:04:05.410> your<00:04:06.130> w

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
using your e and your w

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.800 
using your e and your w
it's<00:04:08.610> quite<00:04:08.850> easy<00:04:08.880> to<00:04:09.420> escape<00:04:11.570> ok<00:04:12.570> and<00:04:12.720> I'll

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
it's quite easy to escape ok and I'll

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.320 
it's quite easy to escape ok and I'll
talk<00:04:12.840> a<00:04:13.050> lot<00:04:13.290> about<00:04:13.320> the<00:04:13.740> Q<00:04:14.100> and<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.310> W<00:04:14.640> I'm<00:04:15.120> not

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
talk a lot about the Q and the W I'm not

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.970 
talk a lot about the Q and the W I'm not
like<00:04:15.510> to<00:04:15.690> going<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.650> little<00:04:16.799> bit<00:04:16.890> more

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
like to going to a little bit more

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.539 
like to going to a little bit more
detail<00:04:17.310> about<00:04:17.359> they<00:04:18.359> eat<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:18.890> the<00:04:19.890> ultimate

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
detail about they eat and the ultimate

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.830 
detail about they eat and the ultimate
which<00:04:21.299> obviously<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.780> most<00:04:21.900> important<00:04:22.740> move

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
which obviously the most important move

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.550 
which obviously the most important move
for<00:04:24.840> any<00:04:25.020> character<00:04:25.440> hmm<00:04:26.280> so<00:04:27.230> you<00:04:28.230> chain

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
for any character hmm so you chain

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.250 
for any character hmm so you chain
basically<00:04:29.450> it's<00:04:30.450> a<00:04:30.570> skill<00:04:30.780> shot<00:04:31.020> and<00:04:31.400> so<00:04:32.400> you

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
basically it's a skill shot and so you

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.780 
basically it's a skill shot and so you
well<00:04:34.260> harder<00:04:34.830> to<00:04:34.950> learn<00:04:35.070> then<00:04:35.340> there<00:04:35.520> I'm

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
well harder to learn then there I'm

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.600 
well harder to learn then there I'm
skill<00:04:36.030> shot<00:04:36.240> but<00:04:36.620> for<00:04:37.620> this<00:04:37.740> it<00:04:38.010> builds<00:04:38.250> damage

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
skill shot but for this it builds damage

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.450 
skill shot but for this it builds damage
on<00:04:38.730> hit<00:04:39.230> so<00:04:40.230> you<00:04:40.290> hit<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.650> target<00:04:41.010> it<00:04:41.130> slows

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
on hit so you hit the target it slows

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.300 
on hit so you hit the target it slows
them<00:04:41.730> down<00:04:41.760> and<00:04:42.270> then<00:04:42.570> after<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:43.830> kids<00:04:44.070> how

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
them down and then after and kids how

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.570 
them down and then after and kids how
easy<00:04:44.550> after<00:04:45.540> 1.5<00:04:45.900> seconds<00:04:46.500> the<00:04:47.040> target<00:04:47.460> will

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
easy after 1.5 seconds the target will

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.670 
easy after 1.5 seconds the target will
get<00:04:47.730> rooted<00:04:48.120> in<00:04:48.240> place<00:04:48.480> or<00:04:48.780> snared<00:04:49.140> if<00:04:49.380> they

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
get rooted in place or snared if they

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.930 
get rooted in place or snared if they
will<00:04:49.860> still<00:04:50.100> be<00:04:50.190> able<00:04:50.250> to<00:04:50.400> auto-attack

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
will still be able to auto-attack

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.659 
will still be able to auto-attack
through<00:04:51.300> this<00:04:51.480> but<00:04:52.470> it<00:04:52.680> will<00:04:52.890> stop<00:04:53.280> them<00:04:53.520> from

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
through this but it will stop them from

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.510 
through this but it will stop them from
moving<00:04:53.910> and<00:04:54.330> it<00:04:54.419> will<00:04:54.510> also<00:04:54.630> deal<00:04:55.520> additional

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
moving and it will also deal additional

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.040 
moving and it will also deal additional
damage<00:04:57.290> it's<00:04:58.290> also<00:04:58.440> worth<00:04:58.860> noting<00:04:59.130> that<00:05:00.050> the

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
damage it's also worth noting that the

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.900 
damage it's also worth noting that the
second<00:05:01.470> part<00:05:01.680> of<00:05:01.800> your<00:05:01.860> chain<00:05:02.190> will<00:05:02.520> activate

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
second part of your chain will activate

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.290 
second part of your chain will activate
thing<00:05:03.210> like<00:05:03.450> York<00:05:04.320> you<00:05:04.620> mark<00:05:04.950> it<00:05:05.310> will

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
thing like York you mark it will

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.820 
thing like York you mark it will
activate<00:05:06.690> the<00:05:06.900> damage<00:05:07.110> anak<00:05:07.350> will<00:05:07.470> sounds

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
activate the damage anak will sounds

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.700 
activate the damage anak will sounds
them<00:05:07.980> off<00:05:08.070> that<00:05:08.250> as<00:05:08.430> well<00:05:08.640> and<00:05:09.650> II<00:05:12.320> as<00:05:13.320> I<00:05:13.530> say<00:05:13.680> I

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
them off that as well and II as I say I

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.920 
them off that as well and II as I say I
max<00:05:14.040> that<00:05:14.250> last<00:05:14.570> it<00:05:15.570> can<00:05:15.780> be<00:05:15.900> very<00:05:15.930> useful<00:05:16.350> for

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
max that last it can be very useful for

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.950 
max that last it can be very useful for
escaping<00:05:18.930> um<00:05:19.860> it's<00:05:20.550> not<00:05:20.700> really<00:05:21.510> part<00:05:21.870> of<00:05:21.900> the

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
escaping um it's not really part of the

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.270 
escaping um it's not really part of the
road<00:05:22.140> tip<00:05:22.350> where<00:05:22.500> you<00:05:22.590> can<00:05:22.860> put<00:05:23.010> it<00:05:23.070> into<00:05:23.220> the

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
road tip where you can put it into the

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.460 
road tip where you can put it into the
rotation<00:05:23.430> fracture<00:05:23.940> damage<00:05:24.270> but<00:05:24.960> I<00:05:25.169> would<00:05:25.320> use

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
rotation fracture damage but I would use

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.550 
rotation fracture damage but I would use
it<00:05:25.620> more<00:05:25.830> for<00:05:26.220> survivability<00:05:26.610> and<00:05:27.560> escaping

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
it more for survivability and escaping

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.120 
it more for survivability and escaping
or<00:05:28.979> maybe<00:05:29.850> ceasing<00:05:30.500> one<00:05:31.500> person<00:05:31.860> who<00:05:31.950> you<00:05:32.010> I

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
or maybe ceasing one person who you I

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.420 
or maybe ceasing one person who you I
keep<00:05:32.340> out<00:05:32.520> the<00:05:32.640> teamfight<00:05:33.800> now<00:05:34.800> for<00:05:35.370> the

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
keep out the teamfight now for the

keep out the teamfight now for the
ultimate<00:05:35.630> the<00:05:36.630> ultimat<00:05:37.050> is<00:05:37.229> called<00:05:37.710> mimic<00:05:38.070> and

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 
ultimate the ultimat is called mimic and

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
ultimate the ultimat is called mimic and
it's<00:05:39.540> probably<00:05:39.750> pretty<00:05:39.840> obvious<00:05:39.990> then<00:05:40.410> when

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
it's probably pretty obvious then when

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.630 
it's probably pretty obvious then when
it<00:05:40.650> does<00:05:40.800> it<00:05:41.460> mimics<00:05:42.330> or<00:05:42.890> does<00:05:43.890> the<00:05:44.160> last<00:05:44.370> spell

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
it does it mimics or does the last spell

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.060 
it does it mimics or does the last spell
you<00:05:44.760> just<00:05:44.970> cast<00:05:45.120> so<00:05:45.300> let's<00:05:45.479> say<00:05:45.570> I<00:05:45.600> cast<00:05:45.870> my<00:05:46.800> cue

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
you just cast so let's say I cast my cue

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.790 
you just cast so let's say I cast my cue
I<00:05:47.280> can<00:05:47.790> recast<00:05:48.150> Mike<00:05:48.360> you<00:05:48.620> like<00:05:49.620> that

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
I can recast Mike you like that

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.740 
I can recast Mike you like that
and<00:05:51.129> if<00:05:51.789> i<00:05:51.909> use<00:05:52.060> my<00:05:52.210> w<00:05:52.919> it<00:05:53.919> will<00:05:53.979> mimic<00:05:54.419> IW<00:05:55.419> so

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
and if i use my w it will mimic IW so

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.089 
and if i use my w it will mimic IW so
i've<00:05:55.930> moved<00:05:56.050> distortion<00:05:56.650> which<00:05:56.770> makes<00:05:57.009> me

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 
i've moved distortion which makes me

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:00.210 
i've moved distortion which makes me
jump<00:05:57.310> again<00:05:57.960> which<00:05:58.960> I<00:05:59.080> can<00:05:59.289> also<00:05:59.470> reactivate

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
jump again which I can also reactivate

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.279 
jump again which I can also reactivate
to<00:06:00.340> go<00:06:00.430> back<00:06:00.580> to<00:06:00.699> that<00:06:00.789> as<00:06:00.970> well<00:06:01.000> and<00:06:01.389> finally

increase damage on that spell so but

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:33.659 
increase damage on that spell so but
it'll<00:06:31.030> do<00:06:31.180> it<00:06:31.330> proportional<00:06:32.080> to<00:06:32.610> how<00:06:33.610> many

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:33.669 
it'll do it proportional to how many

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:35.730 
it'll do it proportional to how many
points<00:06:34.060> you've<00:06:34.330> got<00:06:34.479> in<00:06:34.629> that<00:06:34.810> also<00:06:35.199> worth

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
points you've got in that also worth

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.680 
points you've got in that also worth
noting<00:06:36.009> that<00:06:36.280> the<00:06:36.879> second<00:06:37.389> the<00:06:37.599> minute

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780 
version of the Q spell will also apply

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.499 
version of the Q spell will also apply
the<00:06:40.870> same<00:06:41.169> effect<00:06:41.349> that<00:06:42.129> the<00:06:42.310> kudos<00:06:43.030> where<00:06:43.389> it

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:43.509 
the same effect that the kudos where it

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:44.939 
the same effect that the kudos where it
will<00:06:43.599> silence<00:06:43.990> them<00:06:44.169> from<00:06:44.409> your<00:06:44.500> next<00:06:44.740> spell
