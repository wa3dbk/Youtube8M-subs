00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.549 

I<00:00:58.980> think<00:00:59.910> it's<00:01:00.059> not<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.539> your<00:01:00.660> starting<00:01:01.079> 22

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
I think it's not just your starting 22

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.779 
I think it's not just your starting 22
that<00:01:01.829> give<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> chance<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.670> be<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
that give you the chance to be a

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.460 
that give you the chance to be a
conference<00:01:03.210> champion<00:01:03.629> but<00:01:04.170> you're<00:01:04.320> going<00:01:04.409> to

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
conference champion but you're going to

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.020 
conference champion but you're going to
have<00:01:04.559> some<00:01:04.830> depth<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.369> think<00:01:05.610> right<00:01:05.790> now<00:01:05.970> we

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
have some depth and I think right now we

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.700 
have some depth and I think right now we
can<00:01:06.240> talk<00:01:06.390> about<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.750> lot<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.140> experience

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
can talk about a lot of the experience

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.499 
can talk about a lot of the experience
coming<00:01:08.009> back<00:01:08.280> but<00:01:08.909> when<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.180> look<00:01:09.330> behind

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
coming back but when you look behind

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:10.940 
coming back but when you look behind
them<00:01:09.869> there's<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.110> lot<00:01:10.259> of<00:01:10.290> freshmen<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.770> have

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
them there's a lot of freshmen that have

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.260 
them there's a lot of freshmen that have
never<00:01:11.070> played<00:01:11.280> before<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.729> those<00:01:11.909> guys<00:01:12.119> are

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
never played before and those guys are

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.179 
never played before and those guys are
one<00:01:12.390> snap<00:01:12.659> away<00:01:12.810> from<00:01:13.110> being<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.320> starter<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:14.159> I

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
one snap away from being a starter so I

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.950 
one snap away from being a starter so I
think<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.520> challenge<00:01:14.940> for<00:01:15.000> us<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.570> spring

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
think the challenge for us in the spring

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.020 
think the challenge for us in the spring
and<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.229> summer<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.860> even<00:01:17.369> going<00:01:17.580> into<00:01:17.820> fall

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
and the summer and even going into fall

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.969 
and the summer and even going into fall
camp<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:19.049> make<00:01:19.200> sure<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.560> we<00:01:19.649> can<00:01:19.799> develop

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
camp is to make sure that we can develop

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.859 
camp is to make sure that we can develop
some<00:01:20.430> depth<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:20.880> those<00:01:21.060> guys<00:01:21.270> can<00:01:21.570> give<00:01:21.750> us

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
some depth so those guys can give us

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.600 
some depth so those guys can give us
some<00:01:21.899> quality<00:01:22.470> plays<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.070> be<00:01:23.159> ready<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.430> be<00:01:23.580> a

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
some quality plays and be ready to be a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:50.370 
some quality plays and be ready to be a
starter<00:01:24.060> if<00:01:24.780> an<00:01:24.930> injury<00:01:25.200> does<00:01:25.409> occur

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.999 

I<00:01:52.380> think<00:01:53.380> we'll<00:01:53.469> be<00:01:53.560> in<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.649> Conference<00:01:53.979> USA

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
I think we'll be in the Conference USA

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.580 
I think we'll be in the Conference USA
championship<00:01:54.700> because<00:01:55.450> we<00:01:55.899> have<00:01:56.079> talent<00:01:56.500> all
