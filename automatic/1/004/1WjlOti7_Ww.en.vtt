00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 good guys welcome to a new 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.830
 gt5 video online we are here in the 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.830
 saints with flowers what happens 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.900
 we are here in the city of clover this 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.519
 is qualified as the acts because no 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.260
 We are here with our super car that 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.609
 all the people going there is not going to have a lot 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.670
 of respect if we go with this car there 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.920
 flows me that we can catch this one that is 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.800
 which is better because it's a bit more 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.490
 intimidating we could rate this 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.360
 here yes but if it is determined it has 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.360
 it indicates to put like this is more tenebrous uncle 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.520
 the episode of three curiosities of the gta 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.230
 5 that about three weeks ago without 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.930
 exaggerating that he did not raise it because with his 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.030
 life as the note left aside 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.920
 because it's not called has come from there 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.260
 the nose is the case we are here os 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.250
 I leave and I'm other curiosities and in this 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.329
 case be accompanied by flow as 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.649
 writing already know that previously 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.270
 up an episode of questions and 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.649
 answers like eight and that's how a 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.120
 little more entertaining because you do what 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.469
 I say, it's just like I've done 200 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.850
 million episodes talking about me alone 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.469
 then I can do it with people like 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.230
 that is more dynamic uncle this truck 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.770
 Does not turn 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.770
 in the future it is noticeable 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.010
 a guy because in this case flutes 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.270
 curiosities honestly I do not remember 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.920
 the chosen ones but I do not remember which 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.390
 they were and then then frame me they're going to 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.680
 catch a little bit because of your pressure to have 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.080
 to say a bit in improvised plan 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.430
 so then when you want you can 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.650
 start to proceed to tell me the 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.710
 curiosities of which is the first one is of 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.930
 fake siegfried or fake if express and the 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.460
 normal action number because always 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.020
 when we steal a titan disappears 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.840
 when I live like now 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.920
 but disappeared to see why when 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.920
 we recorded a titan disappears 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.360
 this is something that happens to everyone and 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.490
 really many people do not know why I 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.319
 I do not know why but I infer that it is 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.509
 in flow or I do not know what's wrong with me 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.509
 character something after doing it 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.130
 There are many people who do not know why I 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.049
 I do not know either but I deduce that this will be 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.729
 only passing when the doctrine 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.619
 disappear is when there are many people in 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.140
 a session then when there's a lot 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.910
 people who have the same level or the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.190
 level to be able to have the titan for free 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.360
 at the teterboro airport but not the 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.150
 saints international airport 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.500
 it turns out that I step on it to see a 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.299
 little and having as many people as the 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.739
 titan unlocked in that area as there 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.239
 times like when you want to ride 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.709
 in your titan disappears and another one appears 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.989
 another person I do not know 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.360
 tucupita flow I think that's when 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.620
 when there are a lot of people like everything 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.090
 the world has its plane then when 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.010
 he will arrive at the airport he has to eat 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.900
 two at a time secret and I already started 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.960
 appear and then with other steps 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.220
 plan another hectares 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.970
 you can put another one on the other 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.840
 person and so on then 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.760
 disappears basically I think so 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.500
 that's why I chose as I say a 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.120
 curiosity that everyone asks and 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.680
 that nobody really knows why 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.690
 exact of it but when I think that 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.070
 basically that's why I can 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.780
 flow dale cane with the following question 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.610
 this question is good from carbap 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.170
 weather and it says because when you go very 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.610
 fast in vehicles like motorcycles and cars 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.830
 you see the whole map and when you go in 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.660
 aircraft or helicopters are not worth so 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.070
 this is true because when it goes down 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.660
 by car and you're sure take thing you 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.010
 It puts everything transparent but when you go 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.600
 by plane even at home you go more 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.070
 fast still that in a car you can not see 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.750
 nothing goes perfect the game even not 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.520
 gives you neither lass nor anything like that why 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.920
 this happens because I think it will happen 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.770
 because it 's practically here heading 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.450
 to the super clue on top of the most bank 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.950
 He saw this happen because when 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.930
 you go with a car down by the 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.580
 piece there are buildings much more graphics 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.380
 that when you go through the air then 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.880
 when you go with a fighter by air 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.200
 only there is heaven we could say 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.790
 that if below are the buildings and such 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.110
 but I think that by air like 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.090
 term graphics and then play them 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.950
 it costs less to render on the console 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.930
 because in a way then comment 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.550
 we continue the flow in attentive attentive you 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:50.540
 you are going to score a goal 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:50.540
 I am totally yes or yes 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.360
 What's up 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:21.540
 with that question the question of why 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.770
 the soul because we are not finding therefore 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.900
 basically because when we go 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.120
 with a plane, I think it's like 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.860
 probably less because the console will 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.090
 it costs less to render is also what 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.470
 chicken graphic that by air less 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:37.700
 traffic then I think it will be for 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:37.700
 that so look yes yes yes 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.980
 the resale picket with the 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.980
 sniper not 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.290
 the last curiosity of this episode the 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.910
 last one is select hd says because 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.960
 when you take out the mobile is weakness for 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.850
 up is the camera has been opened 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.990
 circle that of 50 million 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:07.290
 questions if from the last 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:09.120
 Right when you open the mobile 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.170
 gives it twice in a row this happens to 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.640
 everyone because everyone does not always 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.870
 rapidly moving age cable up 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.650
 project tucked away from the titan 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.650
 a hug flow 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:28.790
 is a question that the mobiles of 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.950
 up is worth it 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.540
 this happens from the last dlc when we take out 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.090
 mobile watched 10 a demonstration here 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.470
 super epic we take out the mobile if we give 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.700
 twice it quickly goes to the camera 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.800
 this is worth 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.120
 I do not know if it was a bus or that ross is what 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.350
 gotten this way because if I want visor 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.900
 because he's gotten to be like that because he 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.340
 and there are many times when we see 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.140
 something that is if we want to take a picture 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.280
 quick because we do not have time to take the 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.020
 mobile the camera is injured then I 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.180
 I think that this implemented 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.010
 option to be able to draw reality the 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.450
 fast the fast camera you know for 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.060
 to be able to take out the camera in a more 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.140
 fast then I think it imparts 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.000
 this good but partly it is wrong since 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.770
 always us when we see the mobile 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.790
 we open it and reduce them slowly but 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.440
 quickly we give for example 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.910
 contacts today we are going to list activities 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.320
 or fast activity then we are 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.520
 accustomed to give them fast that we 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.990
 it happens because now we give it fast and 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.610
 so then let it be seen and then we 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.720
 is going to look like the camera not then like 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.040
 I say part is fine and part is 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.270
 more but good basically that's why we 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.100
 that is a book or anything like that 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.470
 it can be a project that is better 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.420
 well because yes so that to be able to take 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.440
 the camera more quickly as well as 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.840
 sunsets and the curiosities of this 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.960
 last episode thanks for being 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:32.120
 writing me the questions thanks to you 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.200
 and I think it's a bushing so in 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.370
 serious 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.389
 can not be 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.389
 totally the opposite 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.800
 in the criteria all your 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.510
 questions and leaning on a piece of the 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.520
 xxi gray more episodes and nothing because we 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.520
 we see the next video panting chau
