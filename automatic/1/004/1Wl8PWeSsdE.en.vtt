00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
some extreme testing first we're going

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.130 
some extreme testing first we're going
to<00:01:11.700> take<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.000> boot<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.600> Artic<00:01:12.870> Pro

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
to take this boot this the Artic Pro

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.170 
to take this boot this the Artic Pro
we're<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> submergent<00:01:14.670> check<00:01:14.880> for<00:01:15.030> any<00:01:15.150> leaks

we're a submergent check for any leaks

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.780 
we're a submergent check for any leaks
it's<00:01:15.540> going<00:01:15.690> to<00:01:15.750> go<00:01:15.870> above<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:17.040> rubber<00:01:17.550> line

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
it's going to go above the rubber line

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.160 
it's going to go above the rubber line
so<00:01:18.060> we're<00:01:18.150> going<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.300> see<00:01:18.420> how<00:01:18.479> long<00:01:18.690> can<00:01:18.930> last

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
so we're going to see how long can last

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.620 
so we're going to see how long can last
and<00:01:19.440> if<00:01:19.530> water<00:01:19.979> comes<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.520> from<00:01:20.760> that<00:01:20.970> then

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
and if water comes in from that then

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.580 
and if water comes in from that then
we're<00:01:21.750> going<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.900> let<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.110> stay<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.410> there<00:01:22.560> all

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
we're going to let it stay in there all

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.260 
we're going to let it stay in there all
night<00:01:22.710> we'll<00:01:23.100> weigh<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.310> down<00:01:23.400> let's<00:01:24.030> stay<00:01:24.240> in

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
night we'll weigh it down let's stay in

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.030 
night we'll weigh it down let's stay in
there<00:01:24.450> all<00:01:24.540> night<00:01:24.720> freeze<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:25.830> see<00:01:25.950> if

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
there all night freeze so we can see if

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.380 
there all night freeze so we can see if
the<00:01:26.130> compression<00:01:26.520> breaks<00:01:26.940> hang<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.240> rubber
