00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:09.749 
the cat imitation and it says this car
so<00:02:08.229> broke<00:02:08.379> that<00:02:08.739> should<00:02:09.280> have<00:02:09.399> been<00:02:09.429> a<00:02:09.520> secret

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
so broke that should have been a secret

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.430 
so broke that should have been a secret
but<00:02:10.030> they<00:02:10.149> made<00:02:10.300> it<00:02:10.330> a<00:02:10.479> common<00:02:10.899> it's<00:02:11.260> your

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
but they made it a common it's your

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.990 
but they made it a common it's your
opponent's<00:02:11.890> turn<00:02:12.099> this<00:02:12.400> card<00:02:12.730> will<00:02:12.879> be

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
opponent's turn this card will be

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.550 
opponent's turn this card will be
brought<00:02:13.239> to<00:02:13.270> the<00:02:13.480> cemetery<00:02:13.840> doing<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.349> magic

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
brought to the cemetery doing a magic

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.369 
brought to the cemetery doing a magic
and<00:02:14.890> trap<00:02:15.099> force<00:02:15.610> however<00:02:16.239> as<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.660> turns<00:02:16.900> ended

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
and trap force however as it turns ended

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.589 
and trap force however as it turns ended
so<00:02:18.129> that<00:02:18.280> means<00:02:18.489> if<00:02:18.670> they<00:02:18.790> play<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.030> card<00:02:19.360> it'll

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
so that means if they play a card it'll

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.000 
so that means if they play a card it'll
