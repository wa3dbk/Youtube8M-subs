00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:46.100 

and<00:00:22.140> put<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.470> your<00:00:22.590> profile

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.420 

we<00:00:47.110> call<00:00:47.320> on<00:00:47.470> this<00:00:47.590> side<00:00:47.800> you<00:00:47.980> can<00:00:48.040> see<00:00:48.160> the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
we call on this side you can see the

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.300 
we call on this side you can see the
profile<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:52.990> plane<00:00:53.260> actually<00:00:53.800> makes<00:00:54.070> the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.310 
profile so the plane actually makes the

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.550 
profile so the plane actually makes the
profile<00:00:54.760> there<00:00:55.060> and<00:00:55.450> the<00:00:55.810> plane<00:00:56.080> is<00:00:56.110> sprung

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.560 
profile there and the plane is sprung

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.200 
profile there and the plane is sprung
I'm<00:00:56.740> holding<00:00:57.100> that<00:00:57.130> angle<00:00:57.790> and<00:00:57.910> you'll<00:00:58.030> see

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
I'm holding that angle and you'll see

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.720 
I'm holding that angle and you'll see
two<00:00:58.450> lines<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.890> those<00:01:00.190> are<00:01:00.400> called<00:01:00.640> the

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
two lines and those are called the

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.110 
two lines and those are called the
spring<00:01:01.060> lines<00:01:01.300> and<00:01:02.230> that's<00:01:02.350> why<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:03.730> call<00:01:03.970> the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
spring lines and that's why we call the

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.270 
spring lines and that's why we call the
one<00:01:04.330> it's<00:01:04.630> prom<00:01:05.670> okay<00:01:07.350> see<00:01:08.350> so<00:01:08.500> that<00:01:08.530> was<00:01:08.800> just

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
one it's prom okay see so that was just

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.950 
one it's prom okay see so that was just
a<00:01:09.400> second<00:01:10.090> so<00:01:10.240> if<00:01:10.300> I<00:01:10.420> was<00:01:10.570> doing<00:01:10.600> one<00:01:10.930> this

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
a second so if I was doing one this

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.820 
a second so if I was doing one this
eight<00:01:11.260> feet<00:01:11.470> long

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
eight feet long

200 years ago they ignore it chip a

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.980 
200 years ago they ignore it chip a
little<00:01:22.410> off<00:01:24.060> yeah<00:01:25.060> that's<00:01:25.270> right

I would come pretty close with Sonic on

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.810 
I would come pretty close with Sonic on
magnet<00:01:55.880> in<00:01:56.870> any<00:01:57.050> multiplying<00:01:57.680> well<00:01:58.330> yeah

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
magnet in any multiplying well yeah

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.840 
magnet in any multiplying well yeah
better<00:02:01.820> than<00:02:01.940> around<00:02:02.240> oh<00:02:02.800> my<00:02:03.800> head<00:02:03.979> right<00:02:04.460> now

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
better than around oh my head right now

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.060 
better than around oh my head right now
I<00:02:04.880> have<00:02:05.090> a<00:02:05.119> bunch<00:02:05.750> of<00:02:05.930> molding<00:02:06.619> things<00:02:06.860> and<00:02:07.040> I

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
I have a bunch of molding things and I

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.330 
I have a bunch of molding things and I
like<00:02:07.220> them<00:02:07.400> because<00:02:07.959> it's<00:02:08.959> like<00:02:09.050> glass<00:02:09.500> yeah

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
like them because it's like glass yeah

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.000 
like them because it's like glass yeah
underneath<00:02:10.759> I<00:02:11.330> put<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.290> group<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:12.830> now<00:02:12.980> I

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
underneath I put the group and now I

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:27.390 
underneath I put the group and now I
want<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.280> put<00:02:13.400> an<00:02:13.520> inlay<00:02:13.880> in<00:02:14.060> there<00:02:26.320> listen

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
want to put an inlay in there listen

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.390 
want to put an inlay in there listen
that<00:02:28.400> plane<00:02:28.670> this<00:02:29.830> here<00:02:30.830> that<00:02:30.980> makes<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:32.050> so

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
that plane this here that makes it so

00:02:33.400 --> 00:03:09.920 
that plane this here that makes it so
because<00:02:34.400> I<00:02:34.550> continue<00:02:42.550> that<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:50.540> don't

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.570 

so<00:03:10.930> use<00:03:11.170> enough<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:11.920> match<00:03:12.160> fresh<00:03:13.860> you<00:03:14.860> have

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
so use enough to match fresh you have

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.480 
so use enough to match fresh you have
more<00:03:15.850> than<00:03:16.000> planes<00:03:16.300> now<00:03:16.630> set<00:03:16.990> yes<00:03:17.980> as<00:03:18.220> much

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
more than planes now set yes as much

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:58.170 
more than planes now set yes as much
tonguing<00:03:19.480> groups<00:03:54.360> that's<00:03:55.360> why<00:03:55.630> you<00:03:57.090> there's<00:03:58.090> a

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
tonguing groups that's why you there's a

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.240 
tonguing groups that's why you there's a
lot<00:03:58.360> of<00:03:58.480> little<00:03:58.690> things<00:03:58.720> that<00:03:59.140> you<00:03:59.290> learn<00:04:02.250> okay

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
lot of little things that you learn okay

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.520 
lot of little things that you learn okay
I'm<00:04:03.370> gonna<00:04:03.520> put<00:04:03.700> a<00:04:03.730> little<00:04:03.850> blue<00:04:04.150> in<00:04:04.180> there<00:04:04.530> if

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
I'm gonna put a little blue in there if

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.650 
I'm gonna put a little blue in there if
I<00:04:05.709> can<00:04:05.860> get<00:04:05.950> my<00:04:06.070> move<00:04:06.310> all<00:04:06.459> the<00:04:06.670> work<00:04:06.850> that's

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
I can get my move all the work that's

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:15.009 
I can get my move all the work that's
the<00:04:07.780> hardest<00:04:08.080> thing

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:21.409 

an<00:04:16.019> antenna<00:04:16.380> clue<00:04:16.760> it<00:04:17.760> works<00:04:20.060> it's<00:04:21.060> not<00:04:21.239> the

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
an antenna clue it works it's not the

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.440 
an antenna clue it works it's not the
really<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:21.840> glue<00:04:22.250> that's<00:04:23.389> important<00:04:24.389> that's

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
really the glue that's important that's

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:31.840 
really the glue that's important that's
really<00:04:24.780> how<00:04:24.960> this<00:04:25.110> how<00:04:25.470> well<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:25.950> joint<00:04:26.220> fits
