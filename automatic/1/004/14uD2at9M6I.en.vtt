what<00:00:15.089> we<00:00:15.210> present<00:00:15.389> today<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.230> completely<00:00:17.100> new

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
what we present today is completely new

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.670 
what we present today is completely new
helicopter<00:00:18.210> design<00:00:18.570> which<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.199> meant<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.560> be

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
helicopter design which is meant to be

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.470 
helicopter design which is meant to be
eco<00:00:20.039> efficient<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.699> which<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.029> meant<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.359> be

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
eco efficient in which is meant to be

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.279 
eco efficient in which is meant to be
very<00:00:21.990> silent<00:00:23.269> what<00:00:24.269> we<00:00:24.420> have<00:00:24.570> done<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:25.019> to

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
very silent what we have done is to

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.279 
very silent what we have done is to
completely<00:00:26.130> renew<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.640> helicopter<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.539> we

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
completely renew the helicopter so we

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.589 
completely renew the helicopter so we
change<00:00:28.619> everything<00:00:29.010> which<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.640> relevant<00:00:30.359> on

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
change everything which is relevant on

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.749 
change everything which is relevant on
the<00:00:30.630> helicopter<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.800> terms<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.369> efficiency

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
the helicopter in terms of efficiency

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:56.510 
the helicopter in terms of efficiency
and<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.390> terms<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.750> noise

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.030 

what<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.180> can<00:00:57.360> see<00:00:57.570> behind<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.500> completely

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
what you can see behind is a completely

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.670 
what you can see behind is a completely
new<00:00:59.370> rotor<00:00:59.970> systems<00:01:00.540> so<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:01.050> have<00:01:01.200> a<00:01:01.230> new<00:01:01.440> main

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
new rotor systems so we have a new main

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.280 
new rotor systems so we have a new main
rotor<00:01:01.950> of<00:01:02.400> five<00:01:02.640> bladed<00:01:02.970> bearing<00:01:03.840> less<00:01:04.020> main

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
rotor of five bladed bearing less main

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.160 
rotor of five bladed bearing less main
rotor<00:01:04.530> with<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> lot<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.760> new<00:01:06.120> features<00:01:06.390> for

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
rotor with a lot of new features for

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.350 
rotor with a lot of new features for
example<00:01:07.230> increase<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.070> diameter<00:01:08.250> we<00:01:09.060> reduce

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
example increase the diameter we reduce

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.870 
example increase the diameter we reduce
the<00:01:09.570> tip<00:01:09.750> speed<00:01:09.900> we<00:01:10.470> change<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.130> blade<00:01:11.580> length

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
the tip speed we change the blade length

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.780 
the tip speed we change the blade length
on<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.860> efficiency<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.370> the<00:01:14.580> rotor

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
on so that the efficiency of the rotor

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.420 
on so that the efficiency of the rotor
and<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:16.110> noise<00:01:16.260> emission<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.800> rotor<00:01:17.100> is

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
and the noise emission of the rotor is

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.880 
and the noise emission of the rotor is
drastically<00:01:18.090> reduced<00:01:18.420> we<00:01:19.320> have<00:01:19.440> a<00:01:19.470> completely

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
drastically reduced we have a completely

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.640 
drastically reduced we have a completely
new<00:01:20.160> finesse<00:01:20.640> tone<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.720> design<00:01:22.080> has<00:01:22.410> been

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
new finesse tone so the design has been

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.700 
new finesse tone so the design has been
adopted<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.400> our<00:01:23.640> blue<00:01:23.910> edge<00:01:24.119> style<00:01:24.930> blades<00:01:25.320> so

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
adopted to our blue edge style blades so

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.370 
adopted to our blue edge style blades so
we<00:01:25.920> have<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.250> kind<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.700> fancy<00:01:27.690> and<00:01:27.720> very

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
we have this kind of fancy and very

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.410 
we have this kind of fancy and very
effective<00:01:28.920> curvature<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> finest

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
effective curvature on on the finest

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.010 
effective curvature on on the finest
hand<00:01:30.600> blades<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:31.890> we<00:01:32.490> have<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> lot<00:01:32.910> of

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
hand blades and we have a lot of

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.510 
hand blades and we have a lot of
aerodynamic<00:01:34.020> detail<00:01:34.350> work<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.100> body<00:01:35.250> of

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.380 

we<00:02:01.500> have<00:02:01.650> very<00:02:01.860> ambitious<00:02:02.160> targets<00:02:02.700> we<00:02:03.030> wanted

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
we have very ambitious targets we wanted

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.360 
we have very ambitious targets we wanted
to<00:02:03.540> reduce<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.020> fuel<00:02:04.200> consumption<00:02:04.590> up<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.070> 40

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
to reduce the fuel consumption up to 40

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.270 
to reduce the fuel consumption up to 40
percent<00:02:05.550> and<00:02:06.300> we<00:02:06.450> wanted<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.810> reduce<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
percent and we wanted to reduce the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.859 
percent and we wanted to reduce the
acoustic<00:02:08.280> emission<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.150> helicopter<00:02:09.690> by
