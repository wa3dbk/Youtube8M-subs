00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.509 
all feel a bit awkward and uncomfortable
to<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.880> positioning<00:03:24.569> of<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.750> few<00:03:25.079> years<00:03:25.519> I

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
to the positioning of the few years I

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.449 
to the positioning of the few years I
wanted<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.389> establish<00:03:27.750> what<00:03:28.650> is<00:03:28.799> a<00:03:28.829> stakes

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
wanted to establish what is a stakes

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.629 
wanted to establish what is a stakes
here<00:03:29.910> that's<00:03:30.900> why<00:03:31.079> the<00:03:31.139> guy<00:03:31.410> takes<00:03:31.889> the<00:03:32.069> cold

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
here that's why the guy takes the cold

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.039 
here that's why the guy takes the cold

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
lot of space and also a place came in a

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.819 
lot of space and also a place came in a
big<00:03:50.489> armchair<00:03:51.180> because<00:03:51.840> i<00:03:51.989> wanted<00:03:52.319> to<00:03:52.530> show

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
big armchair because i wanted to show

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.539 
big armchair because i wanted to show
that<00:03:53.220> he<00:03:53.519> is<00:03:53.579> after<00:03:54.180> all<00:03:54.750> in<00:03:55.169> control<00:03:55.500> it<00:03:56.400> is

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
that he is after all in control it is

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.940 
that he is after all in control it is
all<00:03:57.030> his<00:03:57.510> decision<00:03:58.459> we<00:03:59.459> like<00:03:59.669> it<00:03:59.849> or<00:04:00.000> not

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
all his decision we like it or not

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.930 
all his decision we like it or not
and<00:04:01.069> maybe<00:04:01.280> we<00:04:01.550> do<00:04:01.670> not<00:04:01.819> who<00:04:02.390> do<00:04:02.450> not<00:04:02.660> like<00:04:02.900> it

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
and maybe we do not who do not like it

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.720 
and maybe we do not who do not like it
and<00:04:04.940> for<00:04:05.900> many<00:04:05.989> many<00:04:06.200> reasons<00:04:06.379> but<00:04:06.950> what's

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
and for many many reasons but what's

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.030 
and for many many reasons but what's
hardest<00:04:08.120> this<00:04:08.599> time<00:04:08.810> I<00:04:09.110> think<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.769> big

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
hardest this time I think the big

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.059 
hardest this time I think the big
armchair<00:04:10.670> makes<00:04:11.209> him<00:04:11.510> look<00:04:12.230> more<00:04:12.470> important

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
armchair makes him look more important

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.050 
armchair makes him look more important
or<00:04:13.340> appear<00:04:14.209> more<00:04:14.480> important<00:04:15.280> without<00:04:16.280> it<00:04:16.310> I

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
or appear more important without it I

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.170 
or appear more important without it I
guess<00:04:17.479> he<00:04:17.930> will<00:04:18.139> just<00:04:18.440> being<00:04:18.799> a<00:04:19.190> punk<00:04:19.489> in<00:04:20.030> her

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
guess he will just being a punk in her

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.930 
guess he will just being a punk in her
room<00:04:20.450> he's<00:04:21.139> holding<00:04:21.739> something<00:04:21.769> blue<00:04:22.520> in<00:04:22.760> his

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
room he's holding something blue in his

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.409 
room he's holding something blue in his
hand<00:04:23.270> yep<00:04:23.900> and<00:04:24.340> it<00:04:25.340> could<00:04:25.610> be<00:04:25.639> a<00:04:25.820> blue<00:04:26.090> feather

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
hand yep and it could be a blue feather

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.940 
hand yep and it could be a blue feather
or<00:04:26.870> a<00:04:27.530> blue<00:04:28.010> flower<00:04:28.729> petal<00:04:29.330> even<00:04:30.290> he<00:04:30.560> is<00:04:30.740> not

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
or a blue flower petal even he is not

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.560 
or a blue flower petal even he is not
sure<00:04:31.250> what<00:04:31.669> it<00:04:31.970> is<00:04:33.040> actually<00:04:34.040> as<00:04:34.460> he's<00:04:34.850> making

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
sure what it is actually as he's making

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.170 
sure what it is actually as he's making
that<00:04:35.870> decision<00:04:36.350> he's<00:04:36.860> basically<00:04:37.460> choosing

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
that decision he's basically choosing

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.830 
that decision he's basically choosing
between<00:04:38.690> what<00:04:39.200> makes<00:04:39.410> him<00:04:39.680> more<00:04:39.800> happy<00:04:40.250> and<00:04:40.840> if

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
between what makes him more happy and if

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.800 
between what makes him more happy and if
he<00:04:42.290> has<00:04:42.560> a<00:04:42.590> hard<00:04:42.950> time<00:04:43.070> kicking<00:04:43.550> it<00:04:43.820> maybe<00:04:44.510> he

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
he has a hard time kicking it maybe he

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.010 
he has a hard time kicking it maybe he
just<00:04:44.840> i<00:04:45.590> mean<00:04:45.889> maybe<00:04:46.310> just<00:04:46.790> means<00:04:47.150> that<00:04:47.419> he

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
just i mean maybe just means that he

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.409 
just i mean maybe just means that he
doesn't<00:04:48.500> know<00:04:48.800> what<00:04:49.160> happiness<00:04:49.520> means<00:04:49.700> to<00:04:50.180> him

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
doesn't know what happiness means to him

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:55.770 
doesn't know what happiness means to him
so<00:04:51.229> I<00:04:51.530> him<00:04:52.479> examining<00:04:53.479> that<00:04:53.690> blue<00:04:54.650> thing<00:04:54.710> is

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780
