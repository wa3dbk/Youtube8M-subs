00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.090
 so we are now on the 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.759
 sigma stand that presents several 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.020
 novelties so this picture that has 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.800
 so the first one is a huge 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.170
 telephoto that it's a cent 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.990
 fifty 600 mm that addresses 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.060
 obviously to photo lovers of 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.060
 sport or animal photo 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.500
 it's a goal that go into the 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.990
 new sport range 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.570
 delamarry so upscale openness 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:40.850
 slippery 5 6 3 we find of course 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.920
 two-level optical stabilization 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.080
 with a gyroscopic system that goes 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.230
 allow you to scroll through 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.790
 portrait orientation the possibility of 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.239
 ability to program manual retouch 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.650
 of the point and a global tropicalization 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.710
 of ethics to use it in 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.480
 shooting conditions a little bit 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.800
 extreme so the goal is enough 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.519
 heavy pretty imposing enough 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.310
 impressive 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:09.140
 we remove the sun visor so we find 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.640
 of course distance indicators from 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.009
 focusing focus ring and 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.610
 zooming ring which can be used to 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:19.430
 this way up there with a system of 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.050
 pumping and little trick interesting on 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.280
 has the ability to lock 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.229
 the goal in a position 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.930
 particular if for example you want 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.100
 only take pictures in 400 mm 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.490
 avoid bad manners 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.190
 you put in place the loch and the ring 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.630
 of focus is totally 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.180
 locked so this optics will 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.909
 available during October at a price that 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.000
 will turn around 1800 euros in 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.760
 less on channel and 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.650
 nikon and sigma to start confolens 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:53.229
 it is to continue there is a small 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:56.500
 brother of this optics up always 1 156 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.090
 years that comes in the range is from 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.950
 at sigma we realize everything from 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.619
 after that the goal is much more 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.930
 small and a fortiori much lighter 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.760
 that his big brother is the same beach 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.250
 focal length the spat opening made the 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.590
 same formulation that we do not have the 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.090
 same level of finishing treatment 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.160
 embedded 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.700
 in the goal sigma also launches 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.440
 so 1 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.360
 super mega zoom 18 300 mm 3 5 6 3 for 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.730
 SLR equipped with aps sensor c and 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.019
 associate his new telephoto lens with 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.629
 new converters 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.540
 1.4 converter and converter 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.830
 twice they too designed to be 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.360
 used in conditions a little 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.360
 extreme shooting
