00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:12.920 
back which is a good thing let's put the
sim<00:03:04.930> card<00:03:04.959> in

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.420 

so<00:03:13.530> this<00:03:13.980> is<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.219> I<00:03:14.939> see<00:03:15.239> if<00:03:15.359> it's<00:03:15.510> actually

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
so this is the I see if it's actually

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.979 
so this is the I see if it's actually
got<00:03:17.430> some<00:03:17.579> power<00:03:17.849> in<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.480> battery<00:03:20.989> probably

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
got some power in the battery probably

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.860 
got some power in the battery probably
not<00:03:23.629> well<00:03:24.629> it<00:03:24.810> did

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
not well it did

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.309 
not well it did
Phil<00:03:26.860> vibrate<00:03:27.489> uh<00:03:27.670> this<00:03:28.420> is<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:31.319> USB

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
Phil vibrate uh this is the USB

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.950 
Phil vibrate uh this is the USB

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.800 

might<00:03:39.590> be<00:03:39.710> hard<00:03:39.890> to<00:03:39.950> see<00:03:40.280> in

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.410 

the<00:03:46.380> Sun

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.040 

there's<00:03:50.050> the<00:03:50.700> Nokia<00:03:51.700> I<00:03:52.030> mean<00:03:52.209> the<00:03:52.450> t-mobile

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
there's the Nokia I mean the t-mobile

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.199 
there's the Nokia I mean the t-mobile
branding<00:03:53.620> which<00:03:54.099> was<00:03:54.280> similar<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.640> what<00:03:54.880> I<00:03:54.910> saw

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
branding which was similar to what I saw

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.750 
branding which was similar to what I saw
with<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.780> e73<00:03:56.530> mode<00:03:56.560> when<00:03:57.099> I<00:03:57.160> tried<00:03:57.520> it<00:03:57.550> out

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
with the e73 mode when I tried it out

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:05.750 
with the e73 mode when I tried it out
and<00:04:00.690> this<00:04:01.690> is<00:04:01.930> a<00:04:01.959> symbian3<00:04:03.569> look<00:04:04.569> to<00:04:04.750> it<00:04:04.900> I

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
and this is a symbian3 look to it I

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.780 
and this is a symbian3 look to it I
believe<00:04:06.760> this<00:04:06.880> is<00:04:06.940> both<00:04:07.180> portrait<00:04:07.569> landscape

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
believe this is both portrait landscape

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:15.409 
believe this is both portrait landscape
will<00:04:09.790> confirm<00:04:10.150> that<00:04:10.440> when<00:04:11.440> i<00:04:11.530> use<00:04:11.709> it<00:04:13.200> yes<00:04:14.200> I

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
will confirm that when i use it yes I

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:18.449 
will confirm that when i use it yes I

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
think if I oldest properly you know to

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.200 
think if I oldest properly you know to
worry<00:04:18.609> about<00:04:18.700> seeing<00:04:19.030> me<00:04:20.609> has<00:04:21.609> call<00:04:21.910> buttons

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
worry about seeing me has call buttons

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.320 
worry about seeing me has call buttons
on<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.419> bottom<00:04:23.370> call<00:04:24.370> an<00:04:24.520> end<00:04:24.729> which<00:04:24.910> is<00:04:25.120> good

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
on the bottom call an end which is good

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.240 
on the bottom call an end which is good
that<00:04:25.540> way<00:04:25.690> this<00:04:25.810> is<00:04:25.990> a<00:04:26.020> menu<00:04:26.590> button<00:04:28.320> volume<00:04:29.320> on

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
that way this is a menu button volume on

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:36.659 
that way this is a menu button volume on
the<00:04:30.669> side<00:04:34.860> guessing<00:04:35.860> this<00:04:35.979> is<00:04:36.130> the<00:04:36.160> earphone

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
the side guessing this is the earphone

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:43.490 
the side guessing this is the earphone
jack<00:04:36.910> at<00:04:37.419> the<00:04:37.510> top<00:04:37.810> here<00:04:39.030> and<00:04:40.560> there<00:04:41.560> is<00:04:41.860> a

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
jack at the top here and there is a

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.950

believe<00:04:44.500> this<00:04:44.740> is<00:04:44.919> no<00:04:45.550> that's<00:04:46.120> not<00:04:46.300> for<00:04:46.840> the

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
believe this is no that's not for the

believe this is no that's not for the
camera<00:04:47.770> strap<00:04:48.600> so<00:04:49.600> there<00:04:49.930> is<00:04:50.139> no<00:04:50.410> holes<00:04:50.710> for<00:04:50.919> a

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
camera strap so there is no holes for a

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.490 
camera strap so there is no holes for a
camera<00:04:51.280> strap<00:04:51.490> on<00:04:51.669> here<00:04:51.960> so<00:04:52.960> this<00:04:53.110> is<00:04:53.290> what<00:04:53.410> it

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
camera strap on here so this is what it

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.700 
camera strap on here so this is what it
would<00:04:53.530> look<00:04:53.650> like<00:04:53.919> if<00:04:54.460> it's<00:04:54.789> facing<00:04:55.270> somebody

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710
