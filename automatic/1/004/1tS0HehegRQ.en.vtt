00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.949
 bonjour li garson hi girls and 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.150
 boys of all ages speak and 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.220
 shows spinning top 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.270
 video prepared jointly with the company 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.579
 mail.ru 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.610
 when i started doing this review how 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.400
 usually first carefully studied tth them 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.920
 x30 and began to compare its characteristics 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.199
 with others stay even tt10 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.290
 but suddenly I realized that it has no 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.860
 sense for two obvious reasons of 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.620
 the first 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.040
 tanker who has already accumulated such smells 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.039
 soup 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.410
 loyalty and experience to buy legions and 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.410
 machine level 10 has behind 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.660
 so much gaming experience that he just 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.140
 having looked at tth machines with one eye 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.899
 will easily understand which one to take and not 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.479
 need to chew anything not about the way 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.660
 tanking is not about the pros cons 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.580
 all this in this case is absolutely 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.100
 unnecessarily it's like explaining 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.470
 what ferrari owner what gasoline to fill 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.939
 Of course the best and most expensive 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.549
 and here it is actually the second reason if 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.729
 compare all armored vehicles in the game with 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.479
 cars then level 1 is an economy 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.780
 the class 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.890
 cheap and angry and mad and 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.640
 learn to play not particularly the cost 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.380
 tank 7 8 level business class workers 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.150
 horses 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.290
 Nines and tens is already premium 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.659
 contain expensive but prestigious and buy 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.840
 top legions and cars head up 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.740
 all other dozens of it like supercars 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.649
 or expensive limousines among all others 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.320
 car elite elite and as stated 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.400
 in that old movie i think bargaining is here 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.040
 inappropriate 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.450
 I swear to you a top gun of Isa is 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.540
 my own thought 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.360
 they are ideas from mail.ru and that's why 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.370
 talk about these cars in the ordinary 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.480
 a pragmatic way, I think not quite 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.510
 correct it is clear that this legion 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.030
 armored vehicles can optionally be found to 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.250
 what to carp but it's like 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.799
 find spots in the sun and start it over 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.159
 it is shame not to offend anyone and not 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.540
 forget the other three french cars 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:46.420
 represented in the game now too 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.540
 unique and very interesting in their own way about 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.079
 two of them have an automatic loader 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.290
 drum type 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:56.260
 and mars is 15 so generally the only light 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.900
 tank level 10 with a record maximum 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.400
 speed of 75 kilometers per hour and 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.069
 frontal armor 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.859
 from which ricochets heavy shells 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.680
 tanks of the tenth level but back to mx 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:11.230
 30 bright representative 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.730
 and that few and even i would 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.799
 said an elite group of armored vehicles 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.000
 it just like everyone else is not without 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.269
 their unique 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.739
 chips and features in the game and mx 30 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.910
 presented as the medium tank of the tenth 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.819
 level 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.310
 but in reality it was the coolest 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.590
 french serial main combat 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.430
 design tank he cousin 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:42.760
 German leopard 1 was issued to them x30 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:44.229
 20 years from 1966 to 1986 and only in 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.379
 one thousand nine hundred and ninety second 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:49.690
 was replaced by the next tank or 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.549
 Claire despite the fact that the French 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.260
 cars are of great interest to 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.650
 battle players 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.349
 they are very rarely met just like those 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.680
 over expensive cars on city streets 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:05.370
 more often perhaps only Mars 15 is this super 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.079
 scout got for their size and tth 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.780
 residence in the battles on the global map and 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:13.659
 The main character of this review is x 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.329
 30 I met for the whole time of recording video 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:18.940
 materials only once on the official 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.070
 the game forum has a guide for this tank and 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.099
 there are only a few pages 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.400
 comments the audience of the game is simply not 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:27.620
 I realized that to this 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.560
 the tank does not need to be approached from a position 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.479
 Farm to farm are not expensive and cheap 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.190
 no need to look in him for what he 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:37.130
 initially were not going to give 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.350
 developers on mx 30 just need 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.590
 play for fun is not 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.360
 looking back at silver and stuff 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.229
 unnoticed in battle by no ally and 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.650
 opponents 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.590
 this tank will not stay and this and 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.389
 there is his main goal 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.690
 attract as much attention as possible 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:59.180
 myself in one battle I wrote a player on mars 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.449
 15 that i ride speed khaki 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.210
 although it is actually married at mx 30 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:08.120
 top speed 65 kilometers per hour and 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.970
 good dynamics maybe of course he 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.160
 meant my other videos and didn't understand 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.310
 that there is a specially accelerated recording of everything 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:19.039
 combat for dynamism they are only mine 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.590
 car but in another battle 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:24.289
 the player who is probably the first time 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:27.949
 collided with a m x 30 wrote well 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:30.650
 a whopper but how else is this tank and 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:33.979
 should stand out among all and not at all 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:37.099
 he needs to be a copy of a leopard 1 of course 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:40.220
 you should not worry that mx 30 is weak 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:41.900
 the car he will not let himself be offended and in battle 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.590
 on gives on sopatke 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.960
 the same leopard fv 200 fourteenth 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.270
 so of course with a competent game, but I 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.090
 I think among the owners of these machines 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.050
 Krivorukov hardly meets Well 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.050
 that's all 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:06:00.320
 we will summarize the video turned out 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:04.130
 shorter than usual see reason number 1 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:06.680
 at the beginning of the conversation and mx 30 is not m7 and 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.870
 about him as they say if necessary 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.570
 explain it is not necessary to explain 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:14.570
 when you already want this technique 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:18.010
 put yourself in the hangar means it's her 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:21.710
 time and questions of free experience 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:25.070
 loyalty or silver on the bill as well 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:27.409
 ways to use it in battle will 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:30.590
 to worry you at the very least 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:32.630
 all this will be available 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.449
 it only remains to wish you all 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.939
 most elite of their own reflections 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:38.749
 Top of them sharing the top thanks for 

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:41.479
 viewing 

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:43.930
 play beautiful and do not merge up 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:43.930
 meeting
