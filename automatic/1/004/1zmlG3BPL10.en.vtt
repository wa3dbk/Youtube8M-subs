00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
you're going to do a smaller circle that

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.310 
you're going to do a smaller circle that
will<00:00:28.619> be<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.920> nose<00:00:29.420> we've<00:00:30.420> an<00:00:30.689> even<00:00:31.109> smaller

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
will be the nose we've an even smaller

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.520 
will be the nose we've an even smaller
circle<00:00:32.009> on<00:00:32.130> top<00:00:32.160> like<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.870> and<00:00:33.870> then<00:00:34.140> we're

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
circle on top like that and then we're

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.069 
circle on top like that and then we're
going<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.800> draw<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.100> kidney<00:00:35.670> shape<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.930> you're

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
going to draw a kidney shape so you're

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.700 
going to draw a kidney shape so you're
going<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.290> start<00:00:37.620> around<00:00:37.829> here<00:00:38.719> go<00:00:39.719> down<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
going to start around here go down and

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.100 
going to start around here go down and
round<00:00:41.579> like<00:00:43.340> that<00:00:44.539> so<00:00:45.539> once<00:00:45.750> you've<00:00:45.930> drawn

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
round like that so once you've drawn

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.110 
round like that so once you've drawn
your<00:00:46.140> kidney<00:00:46.710> shape<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.190> time<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.820> draw<00:00:48.059> the

your kidney shape it's time to draw the
back<00:00:48.390> glow<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:49.230> from<00:00:49.500> here<00:00:49.739> we'll<00:00:49.980> go<00:00:50.129> round

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
back glow so from here we'll go round

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.229 
back glow so from here we'll go round
and<00:00:52.350> down<00:00:53.449> now<00:00:54.449> back<00:00:54.660> up<00:00:54.690> again<00:00:55.340> and<00:00:56.340> then

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
you're going to do the front leg so

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.920 
you're going to do the front leg so
we're<00:01:18.689> going<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.900> start<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.380> around<00:01:19.680> here<00:01:20.220> and

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
we're going to start it around here and

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:28.219 
we're going to start it around here and
draw<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.259> another<00:01:23.009> leg<00:01:26.570> now<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.630> make<00:01:27.960> this

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
draw in another leg now you make this

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.460 
draw in another leg now you make this
stage<00:01:28.650> what<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.640> draw<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> line<00:01:30.210> just<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.229> make

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
stage what to draw a line just to make

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.859 
stage what to draw a line just to make
sure<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:32.250> your<00:01:32.400> feet<00:01:32.700> will<00:01:32.880> be<00:01:32.909> on<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.600> same

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
sure that your feet will be on the same

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.260 
sure that your feet will be on the same
level<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.500> I've<00:01:35.280> still<00:01:35.610> got<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.880> come<00:01:36.030> down<00:01:36.060> a

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
level so I've still got to come down a

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.160 
level so I've still got to come down a
bit<00:01:36.360> further<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:38.490> then<00:01:38.700> draw<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.240> another

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
bit further and then draw in another

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.889 
bit further and then draw in another
circle<00:01:42.619> so<00:01:43.619> now<00:01:43.799> we<00:01:43.860> need<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.430> do<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:45.329> back

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
circle so now we need to do the back

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.249 
circle so now we need to do the back
legs<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:47.250> on<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.729> side<00:01:48.030> will<00:01:48.420> start<00:01:48.810> and

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
legs so on this side will start and

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.319 
legs so on this side will start and
we've<00:01:49.829> got<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.100> make<00:01:50.280> sure<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.640> finishes<00:01:51.119> up

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
we've got to make sure it finishes up

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.170 
we've got to make sure it finishes up
around<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.259> line<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.520> it's<00:01:53.729> shorter<00:01:53.790> than

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
around this line so it's shorter than

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.600 
around this line so it's shorter than
the<00:01:54.420> front<00:01:54.659> leg<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.259> I'm<00:01:55.350> going<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.590> draw<00:01:55.920> in

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
the front leg so I'm going to draw in

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.359 
the front leg so I'm going to draw in
the<00:01:56.939> next<00:01:57.299> legs<00:01:57.540> that's<00:01:57.899> going<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.680> overlap<00:01:59.070> a

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
the next legs that's going to overlap a

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.120 
the next legs that's going to overlap a
little<00:01:59.399> bit<00:02:01.040> calm<00:02:02.040> down<00:02:02.869> and<00:02:03.869> then<00:02:04.710> do<00:02:04.920> another

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
little bit calm down and then do another

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.229 
little bit calm down and then do another
circle<00:02:05.969> here<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:07.489> then<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.610> same<00:02:08.879> on<00:02:08.910> the

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
circle here and then the same on the

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:15.290 
circle here and then the same on the
other

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300
