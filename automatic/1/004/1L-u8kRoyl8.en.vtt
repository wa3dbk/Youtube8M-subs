00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
really smooth but at one dollar I think

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.250 
really smooth but at one dollar I think
it's<00:01:18.990> okay

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.140 

so<00:01:26.260> far<00:01:26.530> I've<00:01:26.620> played<00:01:26.860> this<00:01:27.010> game<00:01:27.340> and<00:01:27.640> it<00:01:27.910> is

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
so far I've played this game and it is

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.730 
so far I've played this game and it is
not<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:30.070> easiest<00:01:30.460> game<00:01:30.760> I've<00:01:31.090> ever<00:01:31.120> played

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
not the easiest game I've ever played

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.340 
not the easiest game I've ever played
the<00:01:32.740> easiest<00:01:33.160> driving<00:01:33.970> game<00:01:34.210> or<00:01:34.540> racing<00:01:35.140> game

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
the easiest driving game or racing game

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:45.140 
the easiest driving game or racing game
I've<00:01:35.590> ever<00:01:35.620> played<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:38.350> is<00:01:38.770> a<00:01:38.800> bit<00:01:39.040> challenging

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.690 

let's<00:01:46.150> see<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:47.470> not<00:01:47.680> accelerometer<00:01:48.400> base

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
let's see it's not accelerometer base

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.030 
let's see it's not accelerometer base
nor<00:01:49.450> is<00:01:49.570> there<00:01:49.750> an<00:01:49.840> option<00:01:50.080> to<00:01:50.500> turn<00:01:50.680> on<00:01:50.890> the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
nor is there an option to turn on the

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.390 
nor is there an option to turn on the
accelerometer<00:01:51.580> you<00:01:52.480> have<00:01:53.050> to<00:01:53.200> control<00:01:53.530> with

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
accelerometer you have to control with

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:08.750 
accelerometer you have to control with
the<00:01:54.580> on<00:01:56.700> onboard<00:01:57.700> virtual<00:01:58.510> keys<00:02:01.290> for<00:02:02.290> brake

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:27.260 

system

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.510 

this<00:02:28.270> as<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.260> phone<00:02:29.440> is<00:02:29.590> normal<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.100> touch<00:02:30.310> you

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
this as the phone is normal to touch you

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.240 
this as the phone is normal to touch you
can<00:02:30.670> only<00:02:30.790> press<00:02:31.060> one<00:02:31.300> key<00:02:31.330> at<00:02:31.630> a<00:02:31.660> time<00:02:31.930> which

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
can only press one key at a time which

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.050 
can only press one key at a time which
really<00:02:33.250> takes<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:33.700> game<00:02:33.940> play<00:02:34.150> out<00:02:34.180> of<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:34.600> and

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
really takes the game play out of it and

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:45.300 
really takes the game play out of it and
the<00:02:37.060> soundtrack<00:02:37.570> is<00:02:37.780> really<00:02:38.080> annoying<00:02:44.130> if<00:02:45.130> you

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
the soundtrack is really annoying if you

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.680
