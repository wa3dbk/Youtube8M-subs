00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 and old age are selling shit 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.550
 Uncle everything clear there must be careful now 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:18.359
 that I will not stop 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:19.980
 The round is already going on hey people 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.660
 I am welcome to the next episode 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.609
 as well as games today always crack on the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.560
 areal valley and yes we are still here 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.800
 no players because it's easy 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.130
 because we play well in 1.8 we are 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.809
 have a bit of armor coming and 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.559
 Today we have a really cool one too 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.329
 team at the start 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.770
 Today it's about the minecraft 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.600
 See how dear friends see 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.329
 actually especially foreign players 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.710
 the game minecraft 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.300
 and yes, how do you rate that? 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.649
 Minecraft 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.760
 I really thought so about it 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.770
 you really get a chance to see me 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.960
 Talk that's really interesting 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.510
 I have to say the topic , yes, if you are now 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.250
 for example, to any type 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.250
 I'll say you go now to the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.539
 example does not know and the question yes 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.220
 how do you like workshops, for example ? 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.670
 two now just as an example battlefield 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.100
 normal games stop the yes no idea 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.720
 just every year probably every year new 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.390
 part comes out just ordinary games 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.560
 which one has known for some time then 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.320
 would probably say yes of course 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.210
 I find myself cool every now and then 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.040
 It does not matter if you for example 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.290
 even now after minecraft asks how 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.450
 do you really think minecraft says so 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.610
 the bulk of the team is one 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.770
 child play so it is not up now 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.840
 a single person and related 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.970
 but if you do not minecraft now 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.380
 plays and maybe even now 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.659
 the older one really says that 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.530
 Much to a yes yes minecraft is 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.220
 a children's game 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.439
 this is a game where you block with yes 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.899
 built a pixelate resolution 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.090
 But I think that's real 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.270
 my opinion that minecraft 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.350
 really that's what it's the most 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.549
 resolution and why why you call it 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.540
 minecraft as a children's game 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.930
 that is probably due to the 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.939
 resolution on the pixel game and that is 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.000
 really the special that one here by 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.709
 poster and no other resolution 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.630
 or quality as in normal games 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.130
 like pop for example so that you can do that 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.560
 you could never compare in life is 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.960
 Of course, that's clear, too 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.020
 team but so think stop 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.710
 also many that here because you here 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.730
 with 44 corners or square bells 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.530
 he said he can build 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.010
 that's just a killerspiel or something 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.540
 especially as a minecraft freshman if you are 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.040
 no idea or anything like that yet and 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.250
 not particularly active on youtube 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.290
 then you build it but nowadays it is 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.790
 really so that you can go though 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.180
 youtube videos or spectators that one 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.190
 really fast pvp play 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.410
 learn and there was of course even earlier 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.970
 not in minecraft and pvp for example 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.230
 minecraft pvp that has nothing to do with 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.660
 age still a player that has 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.520
 nothing really with a mini game 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.990
 that we do so philippines 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.180
 minecraft is really really right 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.500
 cool thing and dust me now 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.600
 not sell off and old ones all yes 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.770
 to shit uncle must all clear since 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.840
 Now watch out that I am not off 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.780
 stopped 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.380
 the round is already running that is 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.020
 not so good now 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.610
 and yes damn it shoots you in the 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.070
 bow okay then I can break down now 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.660
 and that's my opinion 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.280
 I would not minecraft 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.990
 to call war 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.150
 Now maybe we can in the 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.770
 Write comments or now 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.600
 maybe write something like that in the 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.960
 Comments 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:39.030
 Minecraft gamble but really many 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:42.900
 a little younger player and it is 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.890
 naturally wants to clear all of the case is 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.950
 I also do not deny it 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.840
 minecraft really playing a lot of 11 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.640
 12 13 14 year old maybe even 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.500
 sometimes even under the age of eleven the year 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.560
 a game that's only outdoor setting is 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.630
 very clear but it also gamble what 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.050
 You may not necessarily notice 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.300
 really many adult people too or 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.600
 I too at the age of 17 years or so 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.900
 just under 17 he said to be more specific 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:12.060
 and that's really the case 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.500
 So play if you really say 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.209
 yes minecraft only small children 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.930
 You really can not say that because 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.970
 it really is not just that 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.039
 minecraft, for example, small children 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.320
 gamble or just a little younger people that 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.960
 no way but really 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.789
 many adults and do not know one 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.000
 to really judge game play outweigh 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:36.539
 because of the graphics because of the pixels because 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.669
 the different blocks yes that knows 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.020
 I do not think so cool right now 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.639
 you like your opinion in the 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.360
 I will write comments on each one 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.509
 very happy 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.860
 yes, very good things that works 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:49.470
 In any case , I've got it too 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.090
 just super blatant gameplay 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.580
 taken with the child out of the same 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.710
 theme of course but there I have unfortunately 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.030
 forgot to take the case course and 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.009
 so on a whole recording on the ass 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:04.050
 because there are black stripes everywhere 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:05.090
 video web and it was not so good 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.560
 but okay 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.060
 that's the point again have to spawn 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.070
 also a trek that of course a lot 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.180
 beautiful 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.979
 what can you do about the whole topic 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.130
 in conclusion say so my opinion 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:19.259
 In any case, as already said that 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.570
 minecraft is not a kid's game for me 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:23.099
 first of all, many younger people and me are gambling 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.380
 Come on how come hereby for 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:28.949
 younger people minecraft but also many 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.449
 older people minecraft and so of the 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:32.970
 age can not minecraft as gti 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:36.659
 play pvp is really cool in 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:39.180
 minecraft and that's really a right one 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:40.860
 cool thing and I think it will 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.120
 not too much in the world today 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.370
 single player or something built 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.680
 You always think yes if you have something from 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.330
 minecraft is okay you put on blog 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.590
 Block each other but determined 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:55.470
 no case, that 's actually what you're doing 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:58.409
 I would not say so many more clearly 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:01.009
 if you start and no pvp knows clearly 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:05.370
 what he does differently but I do not know 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:07.080
 that does not do that much anymore but so 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.370
 for example, projects like life 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.430
 or as clearly as you need even 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.020
 is also super cool because you need 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.259
 of course, but still my game 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.060
 really for the most part still pvp and yes 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:20.280
 that in itself to the video 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.050
 ok and in four seconds it starts in 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.729
 40 seconds he said and 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.590
 I'm just waiting where is there 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:27.789
 What people are doing is so funny 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.770
 back is still a player be 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:32.319
 maybe we get the pure 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.539
 Of course, it would be ice and where is it 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:37.090
 halloren players move again like 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:40.210
 it looks like now and he is up or 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:42.879
 up there is definitely one else would 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:45.940
 I walk straight into the wall right here 

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:48.400
 there is one that could be good 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.840
 still get if he does not cut off now 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.930
 and that I am not yet 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:56.289
 I feel from behind and 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.770
 I'll jostle him over java and java 

00:06:56.289 --> 00:06:59.800
 com 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:02.259
 then I could still get and there 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:06.069
 puts a lighter tactical but me 

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:07.210
 I dodged and so we still have 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:10.180
 once hit the ground 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:12.129
 zack and zack there we killed them 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.229
 we can get started 

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:16.569
 mister old and it lives now too 

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:17.409
 just one more time know the same 

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:20.080
 Golden Apple 

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:23.460
 we are addressed here no matter and here 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:26.080
 A juicy bread is called play summit 

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:31.180
 krása summit 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:42.400
 we want to give films how are you ok 

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:49.090

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:51.340
 Shortly I have no angel merkel we 

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.870
 have needed a heart but okay good 

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.789
 is already relatively late 

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.870
 That's why I would say at recommends 

00:07:54.789 --> 00:07:57.430
 the same time the recording 

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.560
 I'll upload it quickly now 

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:02.199
 do not know how it used to be now 

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:04.659
 on at 22 o'clock 42 

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:06.430
 yes I am already relatively late but good 

00:08:04.659 --> 00:08:08.469
 Of course I want a video every day 

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:11.080
 I hope it has you in spite of it 

00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:12.279

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.529
 I have there I hope you have it 

00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:15.699
