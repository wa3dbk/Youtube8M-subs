00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.099
 two 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.570
 what he does in accreditation is to do 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.570
 more transparent 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.340
 the level of quality that the 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.419
 institutions careers 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.820
 faculties that forces that own 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:34.079
 institutions first you find 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:38.070
 what are the areas where they are most 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.460
 back not in terms of effectiveness of 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.110
 quality 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.910
 to encourage them to improve is 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.940
 highly beneficial for any 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:52.620
 institution that enters the process does not 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.480
 only by the seal of quality or of 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.970
 quality certification but because 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.040
 the process itself and the service is 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.890
 gives young people who follow careers 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.610
 within the organization is improved 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.610
 enormously 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.840
 I think it's fundamental to always say 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.820
 and when it's a serious process if 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.890
 it's just going to be a process of 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.710
 national accreditation based on 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.030
 criteria that do not really show 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.120
 that effectively their universities 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.580
 they have the quality that deserves to be 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.190
 accredited because I think the process is not 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.760
 will be more successful that habit of 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.760
 tune in 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:41.170
 when I upload the first accreditation 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:44.380
 of ebit in Latin America there was only 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.630
 a university of mexico and one of chile 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:51.300
 who had international accreditation 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:54.790
 so we 're not so to say so 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.800
 late in regards to accreditations 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.290
 international what experience 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.630
 international of these processes we 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.970
 indicates is that you have to concentrate on 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.460
 some or few areas where it really is 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.280
 can make a significant difference 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.239
 a substantial substantive improvement in a 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.239
 relatively short term 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.260
 undoubtedly when we start 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.470
 the process and already practically 7 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.019
 maybe up to 8 years ago we saw that if 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.610
 Well, it was feasible because of the quality of the 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.580
 studies and the prestige of 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.099
 peaceful university that in many 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.019
 standards there was no problem in 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.420
 reach them undoubtedly said that 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.269
 there were others we had to do 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.239
 a very special effort to achieve 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:45.330
 achieve the minimum levels required 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.599
 by the accreditor the process concluded 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.849
 the year 2006 already with the first 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:54.870
 accreditation of one of the careers of 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:57.810
 tecsup before this organism of the USA 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.410
 that process involved participation of 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.200
 all the staff from the highest of 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.410
 the highest managerial levels up 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.450
 the educational levels at the end is the 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.370
 own institution that you see 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.410
 benefited with these processes of 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.709
 improvement that contains the quality and 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.060
 the country also as a system looks 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.489
 benefited because it does more 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.090
 competitive and the only way that 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.310
 we can achieve 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.440
 the development that we have as a system 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.800
 better education institutions 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.800
 superior both technological and 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.800
 university
