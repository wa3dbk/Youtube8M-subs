00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:11.110 

I<00:00:07.570> think<00:00:08.570> where<00:00:09.230> the<00:00:09.469> prophecy<00:00:09.950> is<00:00:10.280> a<00:00:10.309> bad<00:00:10.639> card

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120 
I think where the prophecy is a bad card

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.579 
I think where the prophecy is a bad card
because<00:00:11.450> you<00:00:11.570> don't<00:00:11.839> have<00:00:12.019> enough<00:00:12.380> control

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:12.589 
because you don't have enough control

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:14.589 
because you don't have enough control
over<00:00:13.339> whether<00:00:13.519> you<00:00:13.759> win<00:00:13.910> the<00:00:14.000> sum<00:00:14.179> of<00:00:14.210> the<00:00:14.360> car

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:14.599 
over whether you win the sum of the car

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.290 
over whether you win the sum of the car
to<00:00:14.870> use<00:00:15.080> it<00:00:15.230> for<00:00:15.349> the<00:00:15.440> most<00:00:15.620> ideal<00:00:16.689> situations

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
to use it for the most ideal situations

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.609
