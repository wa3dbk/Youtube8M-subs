00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
right Helms a lead notice the same thing

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.000 
right Helms a lead notice the same thing
as<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:47.309> tacking<00:00:47.760> but<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.690> time<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.649> jib<00:00:49.860> is

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
as in tacking but this time the jib is

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.160 
as in tacking but this time the jib is
on<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> other<00:00:50.399> side<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.940> boat<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.420> you

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
on the other side of the boat and you

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.770 
on the other side of the boat and you
can<00:00:52.199> see<00:00:52.559> right<00:00:52.860> away<00:00:53.010> how<00:00:53.699> funny<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.270> looks

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
can see right away how funny it looks

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.150 
can see right away how funny it looks
I<00:00:54.920> had<00:00:55.920> my<00:00:56.070> boat<00:00:56.730> my<00:00:57.239> direction<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.780> my<00:00:57.870> boat<00:00:58.160> up

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
I had my boat my direction of my boat up

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.290 
I had my boat my direction of my boat up
into<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.910> wind<00:01:00.090> as<00:01:00.239> much<00:01:00.420> as<00:01:00.570> possible<00:01:02.300> and

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
into the wind as much as possible and

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.109 
into the wind as much as possible and
the<00:01:04.260> boat<00:01:04.439> slows<00:01:04.799> down<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.580> jib<00:01:05.880> that's

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
the boat slows down it's the jib that's

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.830 
the boat slows down it's the jib that's
pushing<00:01:06.330> back<00:01:06.659> on<00:01:06.689> us<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.880> once<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.180> get<00:01:09.360> once

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
pushing back on us and once you get once

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.090 
pushing back on us and once you get once
you<00:01:09.869> get<00:01:10.049> installed<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.470> usually<00:01:10.680> stays<00:01:10.890> but

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
you get installed it usually stays but

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.380 
you get installed it usually stays but
it<00:01:11.189> takes<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.430> little<00:01:11.580> bit<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.760> finesse<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.119> work

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
it takes a little bit of finesse to work

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.910 
it takes a little bit of finesse to work
your<00:01:12.570> way<00:01:12.659> into<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.049> don't<00:01:13.140> get<00:01:13.350> frustrated

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920
