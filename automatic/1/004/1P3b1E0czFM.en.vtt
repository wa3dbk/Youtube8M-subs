Chuck but today I'm going to try to make
a<00:00:23.250> prototype<00:00:23.750> basically<00:00:25.310> replacing<00:00:26.630> this<00:00:27.630> lid

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
a prototype basically replacing this lid

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.910 
a prototype basically replacing this lid
to<00:00:29.760> my<00:00:29.880> reservoir<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.230> reservoir<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.769> my

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920

toilet gardener is that there is going

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.830 
toilet gardener is that there is going
to<00:01:05.100> be<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.510> wick<00:01:06.510> which<00:01:07.470> I've<00:01:07.740> just<00:01:07.770> gotten<00:01:08.460> some

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
to be a wick which I've just gotten some

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.080 
to be a wick which I've just gotten some
cotton<00:01:09.840> sashing<00:01:10.380> for<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.070> basically<00:01:11.880> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
cotton sashing for and basically the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.609 
cotton sashing for and basically the
wick<00:01:12.299> will<00:01:12.600> hang<00:01:12.810> down<00:01:13.080> through<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> hole<00:01:14.640> in

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
wick will hang down through a hole in

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.570 
wick will hang down through a hole in
the<00:01:16.640> in<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.090> tray<00:01:18.720> itself<00:01:19.009> down<00:01:20.009> into<00:01:20.490> the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
the in the tray itself down into the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.840 
the in the tray itself down into the
water<00:01:21.259> probably<00:01:22.259> about<00:01:22.380> an<00:01:22.979> eighth<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.700> an

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
water probably about an eighth of an

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.050 
water probably about an eighth of an
inch<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.920> wick<00:01:26.159> will<00:01:26.400> constantly<00:01:26.880> be

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
inch so that the wick will constantly be

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.950 
inch so that the wick will constantly be
sucking<00:01:27.900> moisture<00:01:28.080> up<00:01:28.590> into<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.790> dirt<00:01:30.600> and

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
sucking moisture up into the dirt and

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.770 
sucking moisture up into the dirt and
you<00:01:31.229> won't<00:01:31.439> ever<00:01:31.560> have<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.799> water<00:01:32.159> this<00:01:32.780> I've

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
you won't ever have to water this I've

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.740 
you won't ever have to water this I've
drilled<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.979> hole<00:01:35.009> for<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.790> wick<00:01:36.090> I'm<00:01:36.509> going<00:01:36.689> to

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
drilled a hole for the wick I'm going to

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.780 
drilled a hole for the wick I'm going to
have<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.869> make<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.229> little<00:01:37.380> bit<00:01:37.590> larger<00:01:38.130> but

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
have to make it a little bit larger but

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.770 
have to make it a little bit larger but
it's<00:01:39.240> pretty<00:01:39.390> important<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.500> hole<00:01:40.890> is

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
it's pretty important that this hole is

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.440 
it's pretty important that this hole is
very<00:01:42.780> tight<00:01:43.079> around<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.590> wick<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.610> as<00:01:44.850> not<00:01:45.149> to

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
very tight around the wick so as not to

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.859 
very tight around the wick so as not to
a<00:01:45.890> let<00:01:46.890> dirt<00:01:47.220> fall<00:01:47.640> down<00:01:47.909> into<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.630> reservoir

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
a let dirt fall down into the reservoir

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.319 
a let dirt fall down into the reservoir
and<00:01:49.790> be<00:01:51.229> one<00:01:52.250> possible<00:01:53.250> problem<00:01:53.310> i<00:01:53.790> foresee

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
and be one possible problem i foresee

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.649 
and be one possible problem i foresee
what<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.689> whole<00:01:55.409> venture<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:56.659> eventually

into<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.709> water<00:02:38.120> hopefully<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.209> got<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.599> about

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
into the water hopefully I got it about

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.140 
into the water hopefully I got it about
right<00:02:39.959> I<00:02:40.440> didn't<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.830> don't<00:02:40.980> want<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.519> sashing

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
right I didn't I don't want the sashing

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.540 
right I didn't I don't want the sashing
to<00:02:42.330> go<00:02:42.450> too<00:02:42.510> far<00:02:42.690> into<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.260> water<00:02:43.550> because

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
to go too far into the water because

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.880 
to go too far into the water because
otherwise<00:02:44.879> you're<00:02:45.420> going<00:02:45.569> to<00:02:45.629> end<00:02:45.690> up<00:02:45.959> sucking

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
otherwise you're going to end up sucking

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.160 
otherwise you're going to end up sucking
all<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.250> water<00:02:47.489> out<00:02:47.580> of<00:02:47.730> your<00:02:47.819> tank<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.450> when

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
all the water out of your tank and when

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.729 
all the water out of your tank and when
you<00:02:49.260> have<00:02:49.379> a<00:02:49.410> nice<00:02:49.560> juicy<00:02:49.860> dump<00:02:51.530> would<00:02:52.530> it<00:02:52.560> be

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
you have a nice juicy dump would it be

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.280 
you have a nice juicy dump would it be
tough<00:02:53.010> for<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:53.849> to<00:02:53.940> flush<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.209> you'll<00:02:54.959> have<00:02:55.110> to

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
tough for you to flush it you'll have to

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.780 
tough for you to flush it you'll have to
flush<00:02:55.650> twice<00:02:55.860> maybe<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:57.470> did<00:02:58.470> too<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:59.220> try<00:02:59.550> to

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
flush twice maybe I did too to try to

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.710 
flush twice maybe I did too to try to
give<00:03:00.060> more<00:03:01.489> even<00:03:02.489> water<00:03:02.879> distribution

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
give more even water distribution

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.680 
give more even water distribution
moisture<00:03:04.319> distribution<00:03:04.980> coming<00:03:05.909> up<00:03:06.060> through

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
moisture distribution coming up through

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.100 
moisture distribution coming up through
the<00:03:06.930> wick<00:03:08.030> that<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.060> wick<00:03:09.390> seem<00:03:09.659> to<00:03:09.810> be<00:03:09.930> doing

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
the wick that a wick seem to be doing

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.259 
the wick that a wick seem to be doing
pretty<00:03:10.230> well<00:03:10.470> but<00:03:10.800> i'm<00:03:11.010> going<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.340> priming

them i added some potting soil and i'm
about<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:17.090> add<00:03:18.090> some<00:03:18.420> seeds<00:03:18.750> i<00:03:19.489> hope<00:03:20.489> that<00:03:20.700> it's

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
about to add some seeds i hope that it's

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.110 
about to add some seeds i hope that it's
enough<00:03:20.940> grass<00:03:21.360> seed<00:03:22.099> i'm<00:03:23.099> gonna<00:03:23.310> kind<00:03:23.879> of<00:03:23.909> work

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
enough grass seed i'm gonna kind of work

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:31.339 
enough grass seed i'm gonna kind of work

gardener has been properly fully seated
and<00:03:36.060> I'm<00:03:36.360> working<00:03:36.900> up<00:03:36.959> a<00:03:37.019> sweat<00:03:37.200> we're<00:03:38.040> going

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
and I'm working up a sweat we're going

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.440 
and I'm working up a sweat we're going
to<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.340> garden<00:03:38.959> toilet<00:03:39.959> card<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:41.269> no<00:03:42.269> it's

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
to the garden toilet card and no it's

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.520 
to the garden toilet card and no it's
just<00:03:42.599> kind<00:03:42.840> of<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:43.019> waiting<00:03:43.470> game<00:03:45.349> see<00:03:46.349> what

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
just kind of a waiting game see what

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.820 
just kind of a waiting game see what
happens<00:03:46.980> but<00:03:47.480> hopefully<00:03:48.480> this<00:03:49.230> grass<00:03:49.560> will

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
happens but hopefully this grass will

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.289 
happens but hopefully this grass will
grow<00:03:49.860> like<00:03:50.400> crazy<00:03:50.610> and<00:03:52.159> I<00:03:53.159> won't<00:03:53.939> ever<00:03:54.090> have<00:03:54.239> to

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
grow like crazy and I won't ever have to

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.570 
grow like crazy and I won't ever have to
water<00:03:54.689> it<00:03:54.870> because<00:03:55.439> it<00:03:55.709> will<00:03:55.920> be<00:03:55.950> sucking

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
water it because it will be sucking

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.570 
water it because it will be sucking
moisture<00:03:56.790> up<00:03:57.780> through<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.620> reservoir<00:03:59.310> and

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
moisture up through the reservoir and

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.690 
moisture up through the reservoir and
also<00:04:00.360> I<00:04:00.689> take<00:04:01.409> showers<00:04:01.980> in<00:04:02.010> here<00:04:02.459> it<00:04:02.580> gets

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
also I take showers in here it gets

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.059 
also I take showers in here it gets
pretty<00:04:02.939> humid<00:04:03.450> in<00:04:03.569> here<00:04:03.599> I<00:04:04.110> think<00:04:04.709> these<00:04:05.010> are

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
pretty humid in here I think these are

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.729 
pretty humid in here I think these are
pretty<00:04:05.400> good<00:04:05.489> growing<00:04:05.939> conditions<00:04:06.120> for<00:04:07.049> just

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
pretty good growing conditions for just

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.710 
pretty good growing conditions for just
about<00:04:07.830> any<00:04:08.099> plant<00:04:09.439> this<00:04:10.439> is<00:04:11.060> almost<00:04:12.060> exactly<00:04:12.299> a

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
about any plant this is almost exactly a

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.060 
about any plant this is almost exactly a
week<00:04:12.989> after<00:04:13.980> I<00:04:15.019> first<00:04:16.019> made<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.380> toilet

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
week after I first made the toilet

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.379 
week after I first made the toilet
gardener<00:04:17.549> I<00:04:17.759> actually<00:04:18.449> did<00:04:18.780> water<00:04:19.169> it<00:04:19.470> a

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
gardener I actually did water it a

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:22.230 
gardener I actually did water it a
couple<00:04:21.389> of<00:04:21.509> times<00:04:21.570> this

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
couple of times this

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.650 
couple of times this
week<00:04:22.830> because<00:04:23.830> i<00:04:23.860> read<00:04:24.340> the<00:04:24.490> instructions<00:04:25.330> on

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
week because i read the instructions on

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.400 
week because i read the instructions on
the<00:04:26.050> grass<00:04:26.380> seeds<00:04:27.900> basically<00:04:28.900> calling<00:04:29.139> for

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
the grass seeds basically calling for

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:37.589 
the grass seeds basically calling for
them<00:04:29.530> to<00:04:29.650> be<00:04:32.250> in<00:04:34.259> essentially<00:04:35.259> in<00:04:35.380> mud<00:04:36.509> for<00:04:37.509> the

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
them to be in essentially in mud for the

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:42.059 
them to be in essentially in mud for the
first<00:04:38.220> week<00:04:39.220> or<00:04:39.430> so<00:04:39.490> you<00:04:40.090> gotta<00:04:40.259> germinate<00:04:41.259> the

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:42.069 
first week or so you gotta germinate the

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:43.650 
first week or so you gotta germinate the
experiments<00:04:42.699> going<00:04:42.819> pretty<00:04:43.120> good<00:04:43.330> at<00:04:43.509> least

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
experiments going pretty good at least

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.779 
experiments going pretty good at least
from<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:43.960> growing<00:04:44.349> standpoint<00:04:44.889> and<00:04:45.580> I'm

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
from the growing standpoint and I'm

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.600 
from the growing standpoint and I'm
probably<00:04:46.479> not<00:04:46.690> gonna<00:04:46.990> water<00:04:47.349> it<00:04:47.560> anymore<00:04:48.160> from

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
probably not gonna water it anymore from

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.669 
probably not gonna water it anymore from
now
