00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.120
 today we introduce professor gerardo 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.760
 Iovane expert models and technologies 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.860
 computer security systems 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.709
 the professor is the author of over 200 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.619
 scientific publications has achieved 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:18.780
 two research doctorates and winner of 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.670
 several international awards and has 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.060
 also achieved a master's degree in 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.400
 specialization today is here with us in 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.720
 quality of coordinator for starting the 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.640
 new degree in engineering 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.200
 IT for security el 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.660
 innovation at our university 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.239
 at the university campus 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.859
 good morning professor then I would like 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.570
 to ask you some questions precisely for 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:41.190
 illustrate our students what they are 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.280
 the contents of this new course by 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.199
 degree for that which concerns the degree 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.909
 three-year 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.170
 we would like to know what the goal of 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.059
 new course of engineering studies 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.960
 security information e 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.350
 innovation 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.979
 yes with this new degree course has 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.600
 now 10 years since the fall of the 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:03.719
 twin towers 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.040
 the president of the Inca wanted 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:11.100
 make an impression in this area 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.500
 forming a university a course of 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.570
 new concept degree that not 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.719
 was about engineering 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.530
 information in general but that 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:24.719
 focus his attention on themes 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.090
 particularly challenging and therefore 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:31.170
 in the information age they couldn't 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:36.329
 that surely be safety el 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.280
 innovation and let's say wanting to make a 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.130
 compare with other degree courses 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.630
 how it differs from one 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.100
 any other engineering degree 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.159
 information 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.200
 here compared to the traditional courses of 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.170
 information Engineering 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.229
 the course that is creating the link 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.799
 campus university aims to create gods 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:02.100
 industry professionals at the sites e 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:05.399
 of knowledge with particular e 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.469
 specific expertise on the topics referred to 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.950
 then we talked about the issues of the 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.690
 security in all its forms 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.489
 on the themes of innovation, that is, everything 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.550
 what today can be an element 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.260
 founding for the country system 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.260
 relative to the complete 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.260
 competitiveness to the ability to compete 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:29.659
 on the international market in a perspective 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.040
 of a far east so let's say 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:34.200
 of the current increasing of the extreme 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.480
 east where we have one 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.269
 really very lively competition 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.830
 and active and as far as those are concerned 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.480
 that will be the future outlets 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.220
 employment 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.540
 yes as regards the outlets 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:52.019
 occupational and obvious that the topic 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.230
 of innovation as well as the theme of 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:58.379
 security will allow the creation of 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.110
 high professional figures 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:06.900
 this attractiveness for the market 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:09.390
 as regards the figure of bitti 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.450
 then manager or site manager then 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.209
 as regards the three-year degree 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.840
 and then as regards instead 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:21.239
 everything related to the masterful 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.819
 exact wanting to go just to touch 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.090
 the master's degree 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:29.250
 what are the themes that characterize the 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.140
 content of these courses and what they are 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.189
 instead the employment opportunities of the 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:40.049
 Master's degree today when speaking 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:42.930
 of security there is the opportunity to 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.370
 to identify a series of fundamental themes 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.920
 concerning infrastructure 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.159
 therefore critical the relative protection 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.500
 which concerns not so much the encryption as 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.959
 we hear about it in general 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.799
 information protection la 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:01.110
 data protection up to 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.150
 the one on which perhaps we as a country 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.849
 we are a little further back in the scenario 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.159
 International or the ses ment so 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.739
 the ability to evaluate therefore in the case 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:13.650
 specific to assess the risks of 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.230
 evaluate threats and why not mitigate them 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.870
 also following 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:23.880
 more technology and more 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:25.620
 awareness in the use of the same 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.340
 until you get to the themes of course 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:33.330
 foundations of advanced algorithms 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:36.110
 the ability to equip ours the 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.550
 our technological infrastructure with 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.920
 algorithms that are able to not 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.900
 replace man but always help him 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.750
 more in what are the choices 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.630
 therefore operative for the decision making the 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.910
 problem solving with regards to 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.270
 employment opportunities here too 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:57.540
 certainly creating new figures 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:01.950
 for an international market that is 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:05.610
 strongly in evolution and for which it is 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:08.250
 necessary right now to invest in 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.530
 new generations also with approaches 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.320
 innovative didactics and with this a 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:16.310
 element that I would treat particularly 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.390
 with interest because of the approach that 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.060
 we intend to carry on inside 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.190
 of the course of study is an approach 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.500
 not oriented exclusively to 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.750
 skills as typically occurred in the 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.570
 Italian training systems but it is 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:33.420
 strongly oriented to the development of 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.160
 capacity then the skills become 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:38.040
 a tool to make available 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.050
 of learners so that they can 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.050
 enhance what are theirs 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.360
 natural inclinations very well for 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.090
 conclude we want to see those that 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.130
 will be what fallout for training 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.060
 of new business sectors for the 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.060
 country system 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.850
 in conclusion certainly from the point of 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:01.110
 view of the country system 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:04.050
 just listen to the current newscasts 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.090
 rather than and surf the internet for 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.170
 understand how important it is to 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.180
 be able to compete in the scenario 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.670
 international investing 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.520
 investing in research on innovation 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:18.270
 invest in emerging themes for sure 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.930
 li infosecurity is such an emerging theme 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.100
 as in the last ten years 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:25.870
 we worked mainly on networks 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:28.350
 then on the basic infrastructure today 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:31.570
 we will work mainly on services that 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:35.229
 somehow we are able to create 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:38.110
 for the users and therefore evident as 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:39.460
 put in this context the new ones 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.160
 highly professional figures 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:45.009
 specialized on security and 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.960
 on technological innovation will give to 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:47.949
 our users certainly a march 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.110
 more 

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:52.500
 very well and we thank the professor 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.500
 thank you
