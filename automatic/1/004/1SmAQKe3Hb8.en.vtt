00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:05.630
 Y 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.080
 what I do is short of the pieces 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.080
 same 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.790
 and cut the circle over 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.770
 alive 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.250
 OK 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.380
 the pink will be our base color so 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.280
 so much 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.890
 we will have to cut 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.010
 in a circle also in red 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.219
 but leaving 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.570
 well one centimeter approximately as 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.570
 I already said we can do it by eye 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.910
 or drawing what 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:56.310
 we have the red circle now we will have 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.490
 to make a hole in the middle 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:02.990
 example with a pencil with hole tips 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.990
 medium and here 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.360
 we will pass in clean living 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.360
 and we will bend the tip 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.610
 I have cut into a piece that is like 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.600
 my hand more or less 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.600
 a candle 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.340
 First 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:34.140
 hooks we will take care with the 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.820
 glue droplets 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.610
 the two papers 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.230
 we give you a little bit more ball shape 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.090
 A) Yes 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.990
 before hooking it because once 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.299
 hooked 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.299
 as I say we can load it all 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.650
 as you see 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.440
 It looks like a little flower 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:06.010
 super cute if for example we can 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:09.880
 also play with blues and yellow or 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.710
 blue and white well see you 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.440
 we are in another installment of pixie 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.340
 I hope you've been creative 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.340
 useful tutorial
