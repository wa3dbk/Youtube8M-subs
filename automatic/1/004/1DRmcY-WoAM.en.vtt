00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
it how these things are made they have a

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.570 
it how these things are made they have a
chamber<00:02:46.280> on<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.489> inside<00:02:46.970> called<00:02:47.360> air<00:02:47.600> chamber

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
what it's going to look

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.480 
what it's going to look
just<00:03:48.690> what<00:03:49.350> it<00:03:49.470> sounded<00:03:49.920> like<00:03:49.980> and<00:03:50.160> that's

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
just what it sounded like and that's

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.240 
just what it sounded like and that's

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
what's important anyway these I could

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.510 
what's important anyway these I could
sell<00:03:53.750> or<00:03:54.750> would<00:03:55.050> sell<00:03:55.290> a<00:03:55.320> little<00:03:55.800> cheaper<00:03:56.190> than

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
I would something like this that really

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.940 
I would something like this that really
took<00:04:01.770> a<00:04:01.830> lot<00:04:02.160> of<00:04:02.190> time<00:04:02.490> to<00:04:02.850> shape<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:03.450> to<00:04:03.950> shine

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
took a lot of time to shape and to shine

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.070 
took a lot of time to shape and to shine
all<00:04:05.610> that<00:04:05.970> good<00:04:06.209> stuff<00:04:06.860> this<00:04:07.860> one<00:04:08.190> is<00:04:09.080> really

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
all that good stuff this one is really

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.490 
all that good stuff this one is really
durable<00:04:10.610> they<00:04:11.610> all<00:04:11.790> pretty<00:04:12.180> much<00:04:12.300> are<00:04:12.690> but

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
durable they all pretty much are but

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.230 
durable they all pretty much are but
I've<00:04:13.680> dropped<00:04:13.950> this<00:04:14.190> split<00:04:14.520> several<00:04:14.940> times

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
I've dropped this split several times

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.160 
I've dropped this split several times
and<00:04:15.570> it's<00:04:15.720> it's<00:04:16.620> held<00:04:16.859> up<00:04:17.100> very<00:04:17.130> well<00:04:17.900> this<00:04:18.900> is

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
and it's it's held up very well this is

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:33.890 
and it's it's held up very well this is
my<00:04:19.320> stop<00:04:19.380> state<00:04:19.950> series<00:04:32.330> can<00:04:33.330> start<00:04:33.660> out<00:04:33.780> with

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
my stop state series can start out with

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.810 
my stop state series can start out with
these<00:04:34.020> splits<00:04:34.350> I<00:04:34.590> start<00:04:34.890> out<00:04:34.980> with<00:04:35.280> either<00:04:35.640> a

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
these splits I start out with either a

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:43.360 
these splits I start out with either a
2.2<00:04:36.480> or<00:04:38.030> a<00:04:39.230> long<00:04:40.230> one<00:04:41.070> not<00:04:41.280> to<00:04:41.520> cut<00:04:42.150> it<00:04:42.270> in<00:04:42.330> half

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
2.2 or a long one not to cut it in half

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.900 
2.2 or a long one not to cut it in half
then<00:04:44.370> take<00:04:44.700> a<00:04:45.320> router<00:04:46.320> and<00:04:47.040> I<00:04:47.550> wrap<00:04:47.760> the<00:04:47.970> inside

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
then take a router and I wrap the inside

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.590 
then take a router and I wrap the inside
and<00:04:50.910> also<00:04:51.419> route<00:04:51.919> the<00:04:52.919> flue<00:04:53.220> in<00:04:53.940> the<00:04:54.060> top<00:04:54.300> part

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
and also route the flue in the top part

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.820 
and also route the flue in the top part
here<00:04:54.960> then<00:04:55.770> glue<00:04:55.979> it<00:04:56.100> together<00:04:57.620> after<00:04:58.620> that

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
here then glue it together after that

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.010 
here then glue it together after that
it's<00:04:59.490> shaped<00:04:59.940> send<00:05:00.930> it<00:05:01.080> down<00:05:01.290> and<00:05:02.660> then<00:05:03.660> we<00:05:03.750> put

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
it's shaped send it down and then we put

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.150 
it's shaped send it down and then we put
the<00:05:04.229> finger<00:05:04.800> holes<00:05:05.010> into<00:05:05.310> it<00:05:05.729> up<00:05:05.880> and<00:05:07.160> the

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
the finger holes into it up and the

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.940 
the finger holes into it up and the
sounds<00:05:08.850> pretty<00:05:09.090> simple<00:05:09.530> but<00:05:10.530> there's<00:05:10.770> really

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
sounds pretty simple but there's really

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.659 
sounds pretty simple but there's really
a<00:05:11.040> lot<00:05:11.250> luck<00:05:11.669> to<00:05:11.910> it<00:05:12.710> it's<00:05:13.710> just<00:05:14.100> very<00:05:14.340> it

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
a lot luck to it it's just very it

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.670 
a lot luck to it it's just very it

this is the only one that I had
has<00:05:44.990> actually<00:05:45.530> turned<00:05:45.770> out<00:05:46.010> halfway<00:05:46.400> decent

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
has actually turned out halfway decent

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.310 
has actually turned out halfway decent
that<00:05:48.410> are<00:05:48.500> really<00:05:48.740> difficult<00:05:49.330> but<00:05:50.330> if<00:05:50.990> I<00:05:51.170> ever

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
that are really difficult but if I ever
