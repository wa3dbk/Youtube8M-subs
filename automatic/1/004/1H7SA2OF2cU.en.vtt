because a lot of the new people getting

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.630 
because a lot of the new people getting
into<00:00:36.510> vaping<00:00:36.719> start<00:00:37.590> off<00:00:37.800> with<00:00:38.010> those<00:00:38.160> spinner

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
into vaping start off with those spinner

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.970 
into vaping start off with those spinner
or<00:00:38.969> twist<00:00:39.360> type<00:00:39.660> batteries<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.649> when<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.800> heard

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
or twist type batteries so when I heard

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.799 
or twist type batteries so when I heard
they<00:00:41.129> were<00:00:41.190> coming<00:00:41.280> out<00:00:41.579> with<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.910> spinner<00:00:42.450> -

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
they were coming out with the spinner -

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.660 
they were coming out with the spinner -
I<00:00:43.140> thought<00:00:43.620> that's<00:00:43.739> gonna<00:00:43.980> be<00:00:44.129> great<00:00:44.460> it's

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
I thought that's gonna be great it's

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.459 
I thought that's gonna be great it's
probably<00:00:45.059> variable<00:00:45.570> wattage<00:00:45.750> which<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.320> gonna

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
probably variable wattage which is gonna

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.139 
probably variable wattage which is gonna
make<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.739> even<00:00:46.829> easier<00:00:47.190> for<00:00:47.460> new<00:00:47.789> people

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
make it even easier for new people

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.779 
make it even easier for new people
getting<00:00:48.750> into<00:00:48.899> vaping<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.410> use<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.520> figured

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
getting into vaping to use and I figured

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.000 
getting into vaping to use and I figured
it<00:00:50.879> would<00:00:50.969> have<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> higher<00:00:51.420> voltage<00:00:51.750> range<00:00:52.350> but

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
it would have a higher voltage range but

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.200 
it would have a higher voltage range but
unfortunately<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:53.820> was<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> little

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
unfortunately I was a little

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.430 
unfortunately I was a little
disappointed<00:00:54.719> when<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.930> did<00:00:55.110> come<00:00:55.320> out

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
disappointed when it did come out

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.799 
disappointed when it did come out
although<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.980> does<00:00:56.160> look<00:00:56.520> awesome<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:57.449> love<00:00:57.690> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
although it does look awesome I love the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.170 
although it does look awesome I love the
design<00:00:58.140> style<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:59.370> lighting<00:00:59.760> tells<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.090> how

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
design style the lighting tells you how

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.270 
design style the lighting tells you how
much<00:01:00.300> power<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.809> left<00:01:00.840> inside<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.620> V<00:01:01.980> there

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
much power is left inside the V there

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.850 
much power is left inside the V there
and<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:03.570> dial<00:01:03.899> on<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.229> bottom<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.650> kind<00:01:04.830> of

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
and the dial on the bottom is kind of

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.609 
and the dial on the bottom is kind of
nice<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.100> bulky<00:01:05.700> makes<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.030> easy<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.299> spin<00:01:06.780> but

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
nice and bulky makes it easy to spin but

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.640 
nice and bulky makes it easy to spin but
it<00:01:07.680> was<00:01:08.010> still<00:01:08.310> only<00:01:08.729> three<00:01:09.720> point<00:01:10.020> three<00:01:10.080> to

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
it was still only three point three to

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.520 
it was still only three point three to
four<00:01:10.890> point<00:01:11.189> eight<00:01:11.430> vaping<00:01:12.090> range<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
four point eight vaping range and the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.929 
four point eight vaping range and the
biggest<00:01:13.830> disappointment<00:01:14.520> was<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.850> was

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
biggest disappointment was that it was

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.910 
biggest disappointment was that it was
still<00:01:15.210> variable<00:01:15.780> voltage<00:01:16.020> with<00:01:16.680> all<00:01:16.799> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
still variable voltage with all the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.980 
still variable voltage with all the
variable<00:01:17.310> wattage<00:01:17.430> devices<00:01:18.299> coming<00:01:18.570> out<00:01:18.720> that

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
variable wattage devices coming out that

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.359 
variable wattage devices coming out that
I<00:01:19.020> was<00:01:19.259> really<00:01:19.439> surprised<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.009> vision

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
I was really surprised that the vision

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.100 
I was really surprised that the vision
spinner<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.970> twist<00:01:21.240> batteries<00:01:21.659> didn't<00:01:21.930> step

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
spinner and twist batteries didn't step

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.050 
spinner and twist batteries didn't step
up<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.409> variable<00:01:22.860> wattage<00:01:22.979> as<00:01:23.369> well<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.030> I

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
up the variable wattage as well so I

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.580 
up the variable wattage as well so I
kind<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.360> felt<00:01:24.570> like<00:01:24.630> although<00:01:24.869> these<00:01:25.170> vision

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
kind of felt like although these vision

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.410 
kind of felt like although these vision
spinners<00:01:26.009> were<00:01:26.159> very<00:01:26.460> popular<00:01:26.790> batteries

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
spinners were very popular batteries

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.719 
spinners were very popular batteries
back<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.810> their<00:01:27.930> day<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:29.130> these<00:01:29.280> vision

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
back in their day and that these vision

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.730 
back in their day and that these vision
spinner<00:01:29.909> twos<00:01:30.240> were<00:01:30.450> highly<00:01:30.720> anticipated<00:01:31.470> but

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
spinner twos were highly anticipated but

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.870 
spinner twos were highly anticipated but
I<00:01:31.770> just<00:01:32.040> feel<00:01:32.189> like<00:01:32.280> they<00:01:32.400> kind<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.640> took<00:01:32.759> a

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
I just feel like they kind of took a

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.340 
I just feel like they kind of took a
wrong<00:01:33.060> turn<00:01:33.119> somewhere<00:01:33.720> along<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.259> way<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:36.840> I

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
wrong turn somewhere along the way and I

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.679 
wrong turn somewhere along the way and I
guess<00:01:37.619> crashed<00:01:38.100> well<00:01:38.820> just<00:01:39.150> within<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.479> past

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
guess crashed well just within the past

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.469 
guess crashed well just within the past
couple<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:40.140> months<00:01:40.350> all<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.340> changed<00:01:42.060> when

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
couple of months all that changed when

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.600 
couple of months all that changed when
we<00:01:42.659> had<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> brand<00:01:43.259> new<00:01:43.409> entry<00:01:44.100> into<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
we had a brand new entry into the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.990 
we had a brand new entry into the
spinner<00:01:45.390> twist<00:01:45.960> type<00:01:46.229> batteries<00:01:46.799> with<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
spinner twist type batteries with the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
this thing has a variable wattage

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.039 
this thing has a variable wattage
between<00:02:00.869> 3<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.189> 15<00:02:02.969> watts<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.689> actually

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
between 3 and 15 watts and actually

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.380 
between 3 and 15 watts and actually
bakes<00:02:04.259> up<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.560> 6<00:02:04.920> volts<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:05.969> this<00:02:06.119> thing<00:02:06.240> will

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
bakes up to 6 volts so this thing will

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.630 
bakes up to 6 volts so this thing will
bake<00:02:06.540> any<00:02:06.810> resistance<00:02:07.439> up<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.619> 2<00:02:07.829> v<00:02:08.099> all<00:02:08.520> the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
bake any resistance up to 2 v all the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.760 
bake any resistance up to 2 v all the
way<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.789> 15<00:02:09.239> watts<00:02:09.479> no<00:02:09.840> problem

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
way to 15 watts no problem

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.740 
way to 15 watts no problem
so<00:02:11.280> they're<00:02:11.550> both<00:02:11.760> 1600

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
so they're both 1600

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.020 
so they're both 1600
my<00:02:12.960> batteries<00:02:13.650> which<00:02:14.520> means<00:02:14.730> they're<00:02:14.880> gonna

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
my batteries which means they're gonna

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.700 
my batteries which means they're gonna
hold<00:02:15.210> about<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.540> same<00:02:15.720> amount<00:02:15.840> of<00:02:16.080> juice<00:02:16.410> or

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
than have to try and use a thread cover

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.440 
than have to try and use a thread cover
when<00:02:55.380> I<00:02:55.410> don't<00:02:55.860> but<00:02:56.400> with<00:02:56.610> that<00:02:56.760> adapter<00:02:57.300> on

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450

there<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:57.750> can<00:02:57.870> see<00:02:58.110> very<00:02:58.770> similar<00:02:59.310> so<00:02:59.880> now

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
there you can see very similar so now

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.790 
there you can see very similar so now
this<00:03:00.209> can<00:03:00.270> fit<00:03:00.630> all<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:00.840> your<00:03:00.959> ego<00:03:01.380> threaded

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
tanks like this aerotank mini dam so I

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.699 
tanks like this aerotank mini dam so I
do<00:03:05.790> like<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.239> stylistic<00:03:06.900> differences<00:03:07.380> better

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
do like the stylistic differences better

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.130 
do like the stylistic differences better
about<00:03:08.070> this<00:03:08.250> Panamax<00:03:08.760> battery<00:03:09.209> but<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.720> real

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
about this Panamax battery but the real

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.440 
about this Panamax battery but the real

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
difference is when you turn it on so

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.150 
difference is when you turn it on so
when<00:03:12.600> you<00:03:12.690> click<00:03:12.870> on<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.230> Fantomex<00:03:13.680> battery

to<00:03:28.200> vaping<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:28.950> you<00:03:29.489> have<00:03:29.670> to<00:03:29.850> calculate<00:03:30.090> at

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
to vaping is you have to calculate at

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.949 
to vaping is you have to calculate at
least<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.200> a<00:03:31.310> general<00:03:32.310> degree<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:33.269> resistance

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
least to a general degree the resistance

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.720 
least to a general degree the resistance
versus<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.590> voltage<00:03:34.980> you<00:03:35.010> want<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:35.370> vape<00:03:35.519> it

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
versus the voltage you want to vape it

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.670 
versus the voltage you want to vape it
at<00:03:35.880> so<00:03:36.390> for<00:03:36.540> example<00:03:36.930> I've<00:03:37.019> got<00:03:37.170> two<00:03:37.350> tanks

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
at so for example I've got two tanks

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.910 
at so for example I've got two tanks
here<00:03:38.130> I<00:03:38.310> have<00:03:38.850> a<00:03:38.880> one<00:03:39.390> ohm<00:03:39.570> coil<00:03:40.320> in<00:03:40.709> this

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
here I have a one ohm coil in this

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.699 
here I have a one ohm coil in this
aerotank<00:03:41.400> mega<00:03:41.730> and<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.299> have<00:03:42.480> a<00:03:42.510> 2<00:03:42.810> ohm<00:03:43.019> coil<00:03:43.380> in

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
aerotank mega and I have a 2 ohm coil in

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.520 
aerotank mega and I have a 2 ohm coil in
this<00:03:44.430> novelist<00:03:45.269> mini<00:03:45.660> so<00:03:45.959> I'm<00:03:46.079> gonna<00:03:46.200> have<00:03:46.380> to

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
this novelist mini so I'm gonna have to

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.650 
this novelist mini so I'm gonna have to
adjust<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:47.010> voltage<00:03:47.190> quite<00:03:47.880> a<00:03:47.910> bit<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:48.480> get<00:03:48.630> a

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
adjust the voltage quite a bit to get a

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.420 
adjust the voltage quite a bit to get a
similar<00:03:49.049> vape<00:03:49.410> out<00:03:49.620> of<00:03:49.739> each<00:03:49.860> of<00:03:50.010> these<00:03:50.100> tanks

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
similar vape out of each of these tanks

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.580 
similar vape out of each of these tanks
we're<00:03:51.120> on<00:03:51.239> the<00:03:51.360> phantom<00:03:51.750> X<00:03:52.019> because<00:03:52.410> it's

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
we're on the phantom X because it's

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.960 
we're on the phantom X because it's
variable<00:03:52.980> wattage<00:03:53.130> you<00:03:53.430> aren't<00:03:53.820> going<00:03:53.940> to

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
variable wattage you aren't going to

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.940 
variable wattage you aren't going to
have<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.209> adjust<00:03:54.510> anything<00:03:54.930> if<00:03:55.380> you<00:03:55.739> want<00:03:55.890> to

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
have to adjust anything if you want to

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.009 
have to adjust anything if you want to
bake<00:03:56.100> this<00:03:56.250> at<00:03:56.400> 13<00:03:56.790> watts<00:03:57.030> you<00:03:57.299> simply<00:03:57.660> set<00:03:57.989> it

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
bake this at 13 watts you simply set it

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.750 
bake this at 13 watts you simply set it
and<00:03:58.290> then<00:03:58.799> you<00:03:58.890> can<00:03:59.010> put<00:03:59.160> anything<00:03:59.400> you<00:03:59.579> want

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
and then you can put anything you want

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.699 
and then you can put anything you want
on<00:04:00.120> there<00:04:00.299> and<00:04:00.510> it<00:04:00.660> will<00:04:00.690> do<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:00.989> calculations

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
on there and it will do the calculations

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.220 
on there and it will do the calculations
for<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.040> and<00:04:02.549> vape<00:04:03.000> you<00:04:03.180> at<00:04:03.329> 13<00:04:03.720> watts<00:04:03.989> no

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
for you and vape you at 13 watts no

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.170 
for you and vape you at 13 watts no
matter<00:04:04.410> what<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.680> resistance<00:04:05.190> is<00:04:05.370> anything

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
matter what the resistance is anything

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.880 
matter what the resistance is anything
over<00:04:06.420> one<00:04:06.630> resistance<00:04:07.230> this<00:04:07.380> thing<00:04:07.560> will<00:04:07.680> read

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
over one resistance this thing will read

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.970 
over one resistance this thing will read
so<00:04:08.820> all<00:04:09.209> you<00:04:09.360> have<00:04:09.510> to<00:04:09.570> do<00:04:09.750> on<00:04:09.900> this<00:04:10.079> is<00:04:10.350> adjust

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
so all you have to do on this is adjust

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.300 
so all you have to do on this is adjust
the<00:04:11.390> dial<00:04:12.390> on<00:04:12.600> the<00:04:12.750> bottom<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:13.410> that's<00:04:14.100> gonna

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
the dial on the bottom and that's gonna

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.670 
the dial on the bottom and that's gonna
bring<00:04:14.549> up<00:04:14.880> your<00:04:15.090> screen<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:16.049> you're

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
bring up your screen and you're

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.370 
bring up your screen and you're
automatically<00:04:17.430> adjusting<00:04:18.359> your<00:04:18.540> wattage<00:04:18.810> and

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
automatically adjusting your wattage and

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.380 
automatically adjusting your wattage and
you<00:04:19.979> can<00:04:20.130> see<00:04:20.370> it<00:04:20.489> has<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:20.910> reading<00:04:21.239> of<00:04:21.359> your

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
you can see it has the reading of your

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.180 
you can see it has the reading of your
ohms<00:04:21.690> right<00:04:22.080> there<00:04:22.410> which<00:04:22.650> is<00:04:22.680> reading<00:04:22.950> it<00:04:23.099> at

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
ohms right there which is reading it at

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.490 
ohms right there which is reading it at
1.9<00:04:23.789> but<00:04:24.150> I<00:04:24.210> believe<00:04:24.419> it's<00:04:24.570> a<00:04:24.630> 2<00:04:24.870> ohm

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
1.9 but I believe it's a 2 ohm

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.770 
1.9 but I believe it's a 2 ohm
resistance<00:04:25.700> and<00:04:26.700> then<00:04:27.030> like<00:04:27.180> I<00:04:27.300> said<00:04:27.360> you<00:04:27.690> can

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
resistance and then like I said you can

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.960 
resistance and then like I said you can
go<00:04:27.870> all<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:27.990> way<00:04:28.110> down<00:04:28.320> to<00:04:28.470> 3<00:04:28.800> and<00:04:29.220> it<00:04:29.789> does

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
go all the way down to 3 and it does

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.260 
go all the way down to 3 and it does
swing<00:04:30.300> around<00:04:30.630> for<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:30.960> 15<00:04:31.789> so<00:04:32.789> this<00:04:32.910> is<00:04:33.090> set<00:04:33.240> a

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
swing around for the 15 so this is set a

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.779 
swing around for the 15 so this is set a
13.5<00:04:34.140> watts<00:04:34.560> let's<00:04:34.979> go<00:04:35.130> ahead<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:35.400> take<00:04:35.490> a<00:04:35.520> hit

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
13.5 watts let's go ahead and take a hit

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:40.600 
13.5 watts let's go ahead and take a hit
oh<00:04:37.940> you<00:04:38.940> gotta<00:04:39.120> love<00:04:39.360> that<00:04:39.390> Nautilus<00:04:40.080> mini

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
oh you gotta love that Nautilus mini

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.860 
oh you gotta love that Nautilus mini
alright<00:04:41.610> so<00:04:41.760> now<00:04:41.940> without<00:04:42.300> doing<00:04:42.479> anything

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
alright so now without doing anything

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.339 
alright so now without doing anything
else<00:04:43.200> I<00:04:43.500> can<00:04:43.740> put<00:04:44.039> a<00:04:44.070> 1<00:04:44.340> ohm<00:04:44.550> resistance

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:45.349 
else I can put a 1 ohm resistance

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.589 
else I can put a 1 ohm resistance
aerotank<00:04:46.349> mega<00:04:46.710> and<00:04:47.130> vape<00:04:47.940> it<00:04:48.090> at<00:04:48.180> the<00:04:48.270> exact

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
aerotank mega and vape it at the exact

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:50.240 
aerotank mega and vape it at the exact
same<00:04:48.840> wattage<00:04:49.110> without<00:04:49.590> ever<00:04:49.830> giving<00:04:49.979> it<00:04:50.190> a

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
same wattage without ever giving it a

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:57.740 
same wattage without ever giving it a
thought<00:04:54.950> so<00:04:55.950> I<00:04:55.979> have<00:04:56.280> to<00:04:56.460> say<00:04:56.729> that<00:04:57.360> with<00:04:57.720> the

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
thought so I have to say that with the

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.290 
thought so I have to say that with the
advantage<00:04:58.440> of<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:58.680> variable<00:04:59.160> wattage<00:04:59.370> with

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
advantage of the variable wattage with

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.790 
advantage of the variable wattage with
the<00:05:00.450> advantage<00:05:00.870> of<00:05:00.990> having<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:01.349> LED<00:05:01.740> screen

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
the advantage of having the LED screen

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.040 
the advantage of having the LED screen
right<00:05:02.520> on<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.820> front<00:05:03.180> and<00:05:03.510> with<00:05:03.960> the
