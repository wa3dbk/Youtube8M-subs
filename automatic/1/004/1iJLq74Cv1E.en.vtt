and then they fly and this was real life

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.880 
and then they fly and this was real life
you'd<00:02:10.630> probably<00:02:10.840> look<00:02:11.020> pretty<00:02:11.260> stupid<00:02:11.470> doing

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
neck and I was thinking about it if you

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.390 
neck and I was thinking about it if you
think<00:04:22.990> about<00:04:23.050> it<00:04:23.199> if<00:04:23.379> Roman<00:04:23.710> was<00:04:23.860> in<00:04:23.979> real<00:04:24.189> life

that'd<00:04:24.699> be<00:04:24.849> a<00:04:24.909> pretty<00:04:25.090> messed<00:04:25.719> up<00:04:25.840> technique

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
that'd be a pretty messed up technique

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.379 
that'd be a pretty messed up technique
having<00:04:27.250> arms<00:04:27.580> come<00:04:27.789> out<00:04:27.879> of<00:04:27.969> your<00:04:28.060> body<00:04:28.180> and

kind of messed up like i was looking at
and<00:04:31.810> it's<00:04:31.930> like<00:04:32.080> if<00:04:32.199> that<00:04:32.349> was<00:04:32.500> like<00:04:32.650> your<00:04:33.430> life

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639
