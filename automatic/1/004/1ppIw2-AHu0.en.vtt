00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.310 
making sure it goes into like the final
round<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.719> should<00:02:03.899> pretty<00:02:04.140> much

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
round and you should pretty much

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.870 
round and you should pretty much
guarantee<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:05.040> you'll<00:02:05.250> get<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.549> third

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
guarantee that you'll get the third

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.670 
guarantee that you'll get the third
ending<00:02:06.360> but<00:02:06.719> just<00:02:06.899> quote<00:02:07.049> unquote<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.409> think

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.589 
ending but just quote unquote I think
the<00:02:07.829> bad<00:02:08.069> ending<00:02:08.459> for<00:02:08.640> most<00:02:08.849> characters<00:02:09.390> at

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
the bad ending for most characters at

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.510 
the bad ending for most characters at
this<00:02:10.110> point<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.530> will<00:02:10.619> have<00:02:10.679> unlocked<00:02:11.310> all

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
this point you will have unlocked all

that's not really confirmed yet but just

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.050 
that's not really confirmed yet but just
for<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.590> sake<00:02:46.769> of<00:02:46.829> making<00:02:47.129> sure<00:02:47.489> it<00:02:47.609> works<00:02:47.790> I

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
for the sake of making sure it works I

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.190 
for the sake of making sure it works I
would<00:02:48.120> probably<00:02:48.419> just<00:02:48.629> try<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.019> get<00:02:49.139> through

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
this fight is but I do have a couple of

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.860 
this fight is but I do have a couple of
tips<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.250> make<00:03:38.370> it<00:03:38.430> a<00:03:38.639> bit<00:03:38.879> easier<00:03:39.120> because<00:03:39.540> he

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
tips to make it a bit easier because he

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.129 
tips to make it a bit easier because he
is<00:03:40.049> AI<00:03:40.409> he<00:03:41.129> is<00:03:41.250> not<00:03:41.549> Skynet<00:03:42.209> we<00:03:42.359> have<00:03:42.689> the<00:03:42.900> power

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
is AI he is not Skynet we have the power

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.439 
is AI he is not Skynet we have the power
to<00:03:43.470> overcome<00:03:43.500> this<00:03:44.220> computer<00:03:44.609> opponent<00:03:45.090> the

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:45.449 
to overcome this computer opponent the

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:46.819 
to overcome this computer opponent the
character<00:03:45.810> I<00:03:45.840> recommend<00:03:46.349> for<00:03:46.500> this<00:03:46.650> is

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
character I recommend for this is

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.189 
character I recommend for this is
actually<00:03:47.400> saberwolf<00:03:47.759> or<00:03:48.120> chief<00:03:48.449> Thunder<00:03:48.930> the

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
actually saberwolf or chief Thunder the

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:50.809 
actually saberwolf or chief Thunder the
biggest<00:03:49.560> reason<00:03:49.889> is<00:03:49.979> that<00:03:50.040> saberwolf<00:03:50.489> has

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
biggest reason is that saberwolf has

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.460 
biggest reason is that saberwolf has
launching<00:03:51.359> combos<00:03:51.720> that<00:03:51.930> results<00:03:52.290> in<00:03:52.379> about

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
launching combos that results in about

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.979 
launching combos that results in about
maybe<00:03:53.159> 10<00:03:53.519> to<00:03:53.669> 20<00:03:53.939> percent<00:03:54.090> damage<00:03:54.629> at<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.840> use

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
maybe 10 to 20 percent damage at the use

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.259 
maybe 10 to 20 percent damage at the use
of<00:03:55.169> meter<00:03:55.379> but<00:03:56.040> they're<00:03:56.340> unbreakable<00:03:56.790> you

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
of meter but they're unbreakable you

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.369 
of meter but they're unbreakable you
launch<00:03:57.509> them<00:03:57.689> into<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:57.870> air<00:03:58.049> and<00:03:58.259> you're

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
launch them into the air and you're

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:59.839 
launch them into the air and you're
juggling<00:03:58.650> them<00:03:59.040> there<00:03:59.250> was<00:03:59.340> never<00:03:59.519> like<00:03:59.669> an

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
juggling them there was never like an

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:01.759 
juggling them there was never like an
opener<00:04:00.269> there<00:04:00.449> was<00:04:00.540> never<00:04:00.689> an<00:04:00.870> ender<00:04:01.229> it<00:04:01.530> means

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
opener there was never an ender it means

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.289 
opener there was never an ender it means
that<00:04:01.949> shadow<00:04:02.159> Jago<00:04:02.579> can't<00:04:02.790> do<00:04:02.879> anything<00:04:03.209> about

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
that shadow Jago can't do anything about

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:04.939 
that shadow Jago can't do anything about
that<00:04:03.419> small<00:04:03.780> amount<00:04:04.049> of<00:04:04.139> damage<00:04:04.500> kind<00:04:04.769> of<00:04:04.859> like

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:04.949 
that small amount of damage kind of like

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:05.869 
that small amount of damage kind of like
throwing<00:04:05.310> it<00:04:05.609> away

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
throwing it away

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.670 
throwing it away
Jago<00:04:06.419> also<00:04:06.659> has<00:04:06.810> a<00:04:06.840> really<00:04:07.139> good<00:04:07.290> way<00:04:07.409> to<00:04:07.470> do

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
Jago also has a really good way to do

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.140 
Jago also has a really good way to do
this<00:04:07.709> as<00:04:08.009> well<00:04:08.159> because<00:04:08.430> if<00:04:08.609> you<00:04:08.699> throw<00:04:08.909> shadow

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
this as well because if you throw shadow

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.300 
this as well because if you throw shadow
Jago<00:04:09.419> with<00:04:09.659> Jago<00:04:09.930> you<00:04:10.409> can<00:04:10.590> cancel<00:04:10.829> that<00:04:10.979> into

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
Jago with Jago you can cancel that into

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.770 
Jago with Jago you can cancel that into
special<00:04:11.639> moves<00:04:11.849> and<00:04:12.120> you<00:04:12.239> know<00:04:12.359> juggle<00:04:12.689> them

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
special moves and you know juggle them

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.689 
special moves and you know juggle them
in<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.959> air<00:04:13.109> a<00:04:13.139> whole<00:04:13.379> bunch<00:04:13.620> using<00:04:14.370> saberwolf

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
in the air a whole bunch using saberwolf

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:16.370 
in the air a whole bunch using saberwolf
is<00:04:14.970> where<00:04:15.120> i<00:04:15.150> have<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.359> most<00:04:15.629> expertise

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
is where i have the most expertise

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.499 
is where i have the most expertise
though<00:04:16.650> um<00:04:16.949> but<00:04:17.250> i<00:04:17.280> do<00:04:17.430> guarantee<00:04:17.940> that<00:04:18.180> using

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:18.509 
though um but i do guarantee that using

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:19.849 
though um but i do guarantee that using
a<00:04:18.570> character<00:04:18.870> like<00:04:18.930> thunder<00:04:19.289> will<00:04:19.440> be<00:04:19.470> very

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
a character like thunder will be very

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.589 
a character like thunder will be very
good<00:04:20.130> because<00:04:20.280> you<00:04:20.430> literally<00:04:20.909> get<00:04:21.209> 30%

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
good because you literally get 30%

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.810 
good because you literally get 30%
damage<00:04:22.109> as<00:04:22.380> a<00:04:22.440> result<00:04:22.710> of<00:04:23.010> one<00:04:23.219> command<00:04:23.520> gray

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
damage as a result of one command gray

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.070 
damage as a result of one command gray
and<00:04:24.060> that's<00:04:24.480> going<00:04:24.630> to<00:04:24.690> be<00:04:24.810> extremely

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
and that's going to be extremely

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.140 
and that's going to be extremely
effective<00:04:25.530> but<00:04:26.070> with<00:04:26.550> saberwolf

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
effective but with saberwolf

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.030 
effective but with saberwolf
