00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:06.580
 hello again today I will perform this 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:08.770
 makeup with a very marked green eye 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.600
 and lips in coral tone both the 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.570
 shadows like the products of the face 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.580
 are from the palette everything nice to face 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.110
 that as you can see they have their colors 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.330
 so alive if you do not want to lose 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.120
 none of my videos do I invite you to 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.250
 subscribe to my channel well for more messes 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.670
 we begin by applying a shadow 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.830
 Emerald only on the mobile eyelid 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.499
 we take a black shadow and draw a 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.079
 outer line joining the mobile eyelid 

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:36.969
 with the immobile and then the 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:41.540
 we carry through the fold of 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:43.970
 eyelid as you can see in the video as well 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.700
 and with that same shadow we profile 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.280
 the upper lashes we apply 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.110
 a shadow in a champagne tone on the 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.600
 first third of the fold of the 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.270
 eyelids as transition we are going to 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.070
 use the shade color virus and the 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.530
 we are going to apply on the fold of the 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.980
 eyelids in the bone of the eyebrows 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.990
 we use this broken white with the tone 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.570
 champagne will light us half 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.360
 internal of the lower lashes and the 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.970
 rest let's apply the green shadow and 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.800
 only in the corner we are going to apply 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.140
 the black woman that we are going to take her 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.930
 little bit up we darken the 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.580
 look with a pencil in clean tone for 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.300
 give a little more thickness to the 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.280
 tabs 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.110
 We are going to use false eyelashes but 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.060
 this step is optional 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.950
 we want the green highlight more like this 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.530
 that we apply an extra with our 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.240
 buds to mix the eyelashes with each other 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.729
 we apply mask 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.320
 we go with the face we illuminate the zone 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.060
 high of the cheekbones and with what we 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.580
 remain the brush in the center 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.840
 front and bridge of the nose darkens mos 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.619
 the area under the cheekbone 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.329
 and the line of the jaw like blusher 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.729
 let's use a peach tone 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.560
 sorry, it looks a little fuzzy but 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.750
 now in the next step I'm going to see the 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.119
 result we finish with the lips 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.969
 using a lipstick on a 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.219
 pink coral tone and you've already done 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.649
 finished this green garlic light that has 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.479
 appeared or if you liked him 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.910
 meditated up and leave me any 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.160

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.230

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.450
 black lips a little bit and have pio 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.400
 Gothic and other lips darker in 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.730
