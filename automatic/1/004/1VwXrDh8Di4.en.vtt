00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.850
 think the pieces of the mark 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.730
 and if he waits 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:23.930
 the speeds in both pieces in 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:29.840
 plastic and that is in this way 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:34.730
 from the very weird I really liked 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:41.260
 that it's really complete what so 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:47.300
 we have the trap of speeding voice and 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:49.250
 it's very simple and the details are 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.600
 it's annoying that's all the time 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.170
 seal with the the painting have seen good 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.949
 right here 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:02.809
 kate and bolts but we see that a point 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:06.070
 the painting is so epic consecrated 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:10.390

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:20.719
 in the voice of speed here good it's 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:25.520
 one piece too it's a pity 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:27.710
 that they have so he is not in the 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.780
 real car there is this piece that is 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:35.000
 going on in it will have to maybe make a 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.460
 little work and painting on this 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.500
 piece there to give the impression that they 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.719
 is said of both pieces ok no balances 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.229
 solid piece 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:48.469
 we will see how we do the editing 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:53.079
 mont-royal cat six rows change the 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:54.909
 color of the tree what color 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.770
 Metallic

 kanda speed ok let's go and we'll go 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:17.000
 place vices install bliss 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.990
 here and here is the other side and we 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.320
 start serving 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:28.220
 it is a step too dark and auxerre 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:32.900

 defend is too tight is not fake 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:08.450
 very tight because otherwise the control of 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:12.430
 place and that's it and oh no our box of 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.430
