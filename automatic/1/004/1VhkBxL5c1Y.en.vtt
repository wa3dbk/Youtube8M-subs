00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
that Busan but um yeah I just think it's

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.810 
that Busan but um yeah I just think it's
going<00:03:34.540> way<00:03:35.380> too<00:03:35.410> far<00:03:35.920> it's<00:03:36.250> not<00:03:36.310> really

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
going way too far it's not really

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.880 
going way too far it's not really
necessary<00:03:36.970> but<00:03:37.660> I'm<00:03:37.840> yeah<00:03:38.440> that's<00:03:38.620> just<00:03:38.680> my

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
necessary but I'm yeah that's just my

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.290 
necessary but I'm yeah that's just my
two<00:03:38.950> cents<00:03:39.310> on<00:03:39.430> it<00:03:39.580> I<00:03:39.670> think<00:03:39.880> we<00:03:39.970> should<00:03:40.120> leave

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
two cents on it I think we should leave

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.540 
two cents on it I think we should leave
the<00:03:41.050> guys<00:03:41.260> alone<00:03:41.590> for<00:03:41.830> a<00:03:41.980> little<00:03:42.100> bit<00:03:42.280> they<00:03:42.430> may
