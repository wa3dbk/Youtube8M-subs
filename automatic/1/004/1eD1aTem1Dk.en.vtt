try and trim lymon airily brush off as

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.540 
try and trim lymon airily brush off as
much<00:02:51.070> snow<00:02:51.850> or<00:02:52.210> ice<00:02:52.240> as<00:02:52.660> we<00:02:52.810> can<00:02:54.210> and<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:57.250> course

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
much snow or ice as we can and of course

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.630 
much snow or ice as we can and of course
the<00:02:57.820> other<00:02:58.000> thing<00:02:58.060> that's<00:02:58.480> very<00:02:58.630> important<00:02:59.290> is

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
the other thing that's very important is

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.090 
the other thing that's very important is
to<00:03:00.640> take<00:03:01.000> out<00:03:01.240> the<00:03:01.450> batteries<00:03:01.990> and<00:03:02.260> turn<00:03:02.860> off

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
to take out the batteries and turn off

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.460 
to take out the batteries and turn off
the<00:03:03.310> camera<00:03:03.790> since<00:03:04.540> usually<00:03:04.720> you<00:03:05.110> leave<00:03:05.140> these

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
the camera since usually you leave these

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.620 
the camera since usually you leave these
things<00:03:05.500> on<00:03:05.920> overnight<00:03:06.460> and<00:03:06.730> you<00:03:07.240> leave<00:03:07.390> them

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
things on overnight and you leave them

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.440 
things on overnight and you leave them
with<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:08.320> battery<00:03:08.590> in<00:03:08.710> and<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:10.090> battery<00:03:10.390> is

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
with the battery in and the battery is

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.050 
with the battery in and the battery is
probably<00:03:10.780> still<00:03:11.020> good<00:03:11.410> it's<00:03:11.980> just<00:03:12.160> super<00:03:12.760> cold

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
probably still good it's just super cold

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.510 
probably still good it's just super cold
so<00:03:13.300> it<00:03:13.420> thinks<00:03:13.660> it's<00:03:13.810> dead<00:03:14.050> and<00:03:14.950> when<00:03:15.280> it<00:03:15.370> warms

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
so it thinks it's dead and when it warms

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.120 
so it thinks it's dead and when it warms
up<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:15.940> may<00:03:16.090> turn<00:03:16.300> back<00:03:16.540> on<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:17.200> boom<00:03:17.890> your

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
up it may turn back on and boom your

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.560 
up it may turn back on and boom your
camera's<00:03:18.490> dead<00:03:18.730> because<00:03:19.120> there's<00:03:19.360> water

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
camera's dead because there's water

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.860 
camera's dead because there's water
inside<00:03:20.020> it<00:03:20.080> now<00:03:20.250> or<00:03:21.250> at<00:03:21.490> least<00:03:21.610> hopefully<00:03:22.120> not

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
inside it now or at least hopefully not

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.110 
inside it now or at least hopefully not
but<00:03:23.440> leaking<00:03:23.830> into<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.160> science<00:03:24.520> inside<00:03:24.880> of<00:03:25.030> it

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
but leaking into it science inside of it

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:32.370 
but leaking into it science inside of it
maybe<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:27.730> we'll<00:03:28.540> see<00:03:28.750> how<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:29.140> goes<00:03:31.380> alright

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
maybe so we'll see how it goes alright

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.400 
maybe so we'll see how it goes alright
so<00:03:32.830> after<00:03:33.120> dusting<00:03:34.120> off<00:03:34.270> most<00:03:34.810> of<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:35.080> frost

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
so after dusting off most of the frost

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.410 
so after dusting off most of the frost
with<00:03:35.830> our<00:03:36.070> gloves<00:03:36.840> we're<00:03:37.840> getting<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:39.420> little

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
with our gloves we're getting a little

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.930 
with our gloves we're getting a little
bit<00:03:40.570> closer<00:03:40.930> with<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.650> lens<00:03:41.980> pen<00:03:42.430> brush

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
bit closer with the lens pen brush

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.390 
bit closer with the lens pen brush
thingy<00:03:43.350> try<00:03:44.350> and<00:03:44.470> get<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.709> frost<00:03:44.980> out<00:03:45.220> of<00:03:45.340> the

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
thingy try and get the frost out of the

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.640 
thingy try and get the frost out of the
cracks<00:03:47.550> should<00:03:48.550> be<00:03:48.780> should<00:03:49.780> be<00:03:49.840> no<00:03:50.020> problem<00:03:50.530> to

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
cracks should be should be no problem to

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.910 
cracks should be should be no problem to
keep<00:03:50.830> these<00:03:50.980> things<00:03:51.190> alive<00:03:52.770> trying<00:03:53.770> to<00:03:53.830> be

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
keep these things alive trying to be

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.030 
keep these things alive trying to be
careful<00:03:54.130> not<00:03:54.550> to<00:03:54.780> breathe<00:03:55.780> on<00:03:56.080> the<00:03:56.320> cameras<00:03:56.740> or

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
careful not to breathe on the cameras or

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:07.250 
careful not to breathe on the cameras or
warm<00:03:57.550> them<00:03:57.790> up<00:03:57.910> too<00:03:58.120> much

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.289 

I'm<00:04:08.260> definitely<00:04:08.819> concerned<00:04:09.819> about<00:04:09.969> the<00:04:10.090> lens

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
I'm definitely concerned about the lens

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:11.640 
I'm definitely concerned about the lens
mount<00:04:10.480> go<00:04:10.750> right<00:04:10.930> into<00:04:11.079> the<00:04:11.290> lens<00:04:11.500> mount

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
mount go right into the lens mount

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.530 
mount go right into the lens mount
because<00:04:11.829> that's<00:04:12.099> one<00:04:12.790> of<00:04:12.879> the<00:04:12.969> main<00:04:13.180> entry

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
because that's one of the main entry

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.199 
because that's one of the main entry
points<00:04:13.930> for<00:04:13.959> water<00:04:15.570> so<00:04:16.650> yeah<00:04:17.940> that<00:04:18.940> and<00:04:19.150> the

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
points for water so yeah that and the

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.810 
points for water so yeah that and the
dials<00:04:19.750> I<00:04:22.740> think<00:04:23.740> if<00:04:23.830> we<00:04:23.889> can<00:04:24.009> brush<00:04:24.310> off<00:04:24.580> the

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
dials I think if we can brush off the

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.779 
dials I think if we can brush off the
majority<00:04:25.150> of<00:04:25.479> it<00:04:25.630> from<00:04:25.870> the<00:04:26.860> main<00:04:27.100> buttons<00:04:27.580> and

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789 
majority of it from the main buttons and

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:40.220 
majority of it from the main buttons and
things<00:04:28.710> should<00:04:29.710> be<00:04:29.860> fine

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.640 

hah<00:04:40.950> guts<00:04:41.580> there<00:04:41.850> is<00:04:42.000> ice<00:04:42.180> inside<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:42.990> stereo

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
hah guts there is ice inside the stereo

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:51.410 
hah guts there is ice inside the stereo
microphone<00:04:44.190> so<00:04:44.520> that<00:04:45.450> may<00:04:45.600> be<00:04:45.660> toast<00:04:50.420> we've

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
microphone so that may be toast we've

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.700 
microphone so that may be toast we've
managed<00:04:51.810> to<00:04:51.840> get<00:04:51.990> off<00:04:52.200> most<00:04:52.680> of<00:04:52.890> the<00:04:53.640> ice<00:04:54.710> and

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
managed to get off most of the ice and

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.690 
managed to get off most of the ice and
it's<00:04:56.160> just<00:04:56.580> starting<00:04:56.910> to<00:04:57.740> fall<00:04:58.740> out<00:04:59.010> of<00:04:59.370> what

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
it's just starting to fall out of what

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.110 
it's just starting to fall out of what
little<00:05:00.000> remains<00:05:00.440> so<00:05:01.440> we'll<00:05:01.650> just<00:05:01.860> kind<00:05:02.040> of<00:05:02.190> be

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
little remains so we'll just kind of be

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.330 
little remains so we'll just kind of be
ready<00:05:03.300> to<00:05:03.480> paper-towel<00:05:03.990> it<00:05:04.200> down<00:05:07.070> one<00:05:08.070> thing<00:05:08.250> I

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
buttons I'm gonna face the camera up or

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.940 
buttons I'm gonna face the camera up or
face<00:05:17.220> the<00:05:17.430> buttons<00:05:17.730> down<00:05:18.260> so<00:05:19.260> that<00:05:19.530> when<00:05:19.830> I'm

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
face the buttons down so that when I'm

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.950 
face the buttons down so that when I'm
jamming<00:05:20.460> the<00:05:20.640> basically<00:05:21.570> I<00:05:21.630> want<00:05:21.780> to<00:05:21.840> just

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
jamming the basically I want to just

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.090 
jamming the basically I want to just
kind<00:05:22.110> of<00:05:22.230> poke<00:05:22.590> the<00:05:23.400> buttons<00:05:23.700> with<00:05:23.910> this<00:05:24.060> brush

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
kind of poke the buttons with this brush

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.100 
kind of poke the buttons with this brush
and<00:05:26.100> hopefully<00:05:26.550> the<00:05:26.670> gravity<00:05:27.540> you<00:05:27.660> know<00:05:27.780> help

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
and hopefully the gravity you know help

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.350 
and hopefully the gravity you know help
the<00:05:28.260> ice<00:05:29.040> just<00:05:29.370> kind<00:05:29.610> of<00:05:29.640> fall<00:05:29.940> out<00:05:30.120> of<00:05:30.180> the

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
the ice just kind of fall out of the

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.940 
the ice just kind of fall out of the
buttons<00:05:30.630> instead<00:05:30.900> of<00:05:31.080> getting<00:05:31.320> jammed<00:05:31.740> in

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
buttons instead of getting jammed in

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:38.000 
buttons instead of getting jammed in
even<00:05:32.370> further<00:05:32.640> there<00:05:36.260> so<00:05:37.260> we<00:05:37.440> should<00:05:37.650> be<00:05:37.800> good

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
even further there so we should be good

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.710 
even further there so we should be good
with<00:05:38.040> this<00:05:38.460> camera<00:05:38.970> it's<00:05:39.180> got<00:05:39.360> lots<00:05:39.600> of

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
with this camera it's got lots of

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.680 
with this camera it's got lots of
weather<00:05:39.900> sealing<00:05:41.300> I'll<00:05:42.300> say<00:05:42.510> I'm<00:05:42.570> just

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
weather sealing I'll say I'm just

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.670 
weather sealing I'll say I'm just
worried<00:05:42.960> about<00:05:43.020> the<00:05:43.260> other<00:05:43.380> two<00:05:43.650> but<00:05:45.680> let's

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
worried about the other two but let's

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:53.660 
worried about the other two but let's
see<00:05:46.860> how<00:05:47.070> it<00:05:47.190> goes<00:05:50.180> and<00:05:51.680> here<00:05:52.680> we<00:05:52.830> have<00:05:53.130> the

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:53.670 
see how it goes and here we have the

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.750 
see how it goes and here we have the
finished<00:05:54.120> result<00:05:54.780> the<00:05:55.740> battery<00:05:56.100> is<00:05:56.250> still<00:05:56.490> out

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
finished result the battery is still out

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.760 
finished result the battery is still out
the<00:05:56.970> camera<00:05:57.300> is<00:05:57.450> still<00:05:57.690> off<00:05:57.990> and<00:05:58.380> we're<00:05:58.680> gonna

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
the camera is still off and we're gonna

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.100 
the camera is still off and we're gonna
wait<00:05:59.040> probably<00:05:59.970> thirty<00:06:00.480> minutes<00:06:00.810> or<00:06:00.900> an<00:06:01.020> hour

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
wait probably thirty minutes or an hour

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.620 
wait probably thirty minutes or an hour
or<00:06:01.350> so<00:06:01.710> before<00:06:01.950> we<00:06:02.190> stick<00:06:02.400> the<00:06:02.520> battery<00:06:02.910> in<00:06:03.120> and

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
or so before we stick the battery in and

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.470 
or so before we stick the battery in and
turn<00:06:03.870> it<00:06:03.900> all<00:06:04.140> back<00:06:04.350> on<00:06:04.970> it's<00:06:05.970> just<00:06:06.180> in<00:06:06.300> case

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:06.480 
turn it all back on it's just in case

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.570 
turn it all back on it's just in case
there's<00:06:06.780> any<00:06:06.990> tiny<00:06:07.440> bit<00:06:07.680> of<00:06:07.770> moisture<00:06:08.160> inside

completely unsealed camera this beginner
Nikon<00:06:14.640> d50<00:06:15.510> 300<00:06:17.390> but<00:06:18.390> I'm<00:06:18.990> pretty<00:06:19.320> confident

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
Nikon d50 300 but I'm pretty confident

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.650 
Nikon d50 300 but I'm pretty confident
at<00:06:19.950> this<00:06:20.100> point<00:06:20.190> that<00:06:20.640> we<00:06:20.820> will<00:06:21.090> bring<00:06:21.390> them

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 
at this point that we will bring them

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.800 
at this point that we will bring them
all<00:06:21.900> back<00:06:21.930> to<00:06:22.350> life<00:06:22.380> no<00:06:23.010> problem<00:06:23.540> and<00:06:24.540> I<00:06:24.780> think

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
all back to life no problem and I think

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.850 
all back to life no problem and I think
it<00:06:25.260> definitely<00:06:25.610> all<00:06:26.610> came<00:06:26.970> down<00:06:27.210> to<00:06:27.620> the<00:06:28.620> use

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
it definitely all came down to the use

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.810 
it definitely all came down to the use
of<00:06:29.100> the<00:06:29.310> brush<00:06:29.670> to<00:06:29.700> you<00:06:30.690> know<00:06:30.810> kind<00:06:31.050> of<00:06:31.820> helped

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
of the brush to you know kind of helped

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.210 
of the brush to you know kind of helped
a<00:06:32.910> lot<00:06:33.060> with<00:06:33.360> getting<00:06:33.750> the<00:06:34.110> ice<00:06:34.410> off<00:06:34.740> of<00:06:34.800> them

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220 
a lot with getting the ice off of them

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.670 
a lot with getting the ice off of them
without<00:06:35.640> pushing<00:06:36.150> it<00:06:36.450> further<00:06:36.690> into<00:06:37.410> the

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
without pushing it further into the

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:43.220 
without pushing it further into the
button<00:06:37.980> holes<00:06:41.390> all<00:06:42.390> right<00:06:42.510> so<00:06:42.720> the<00:06:42.840> cameras

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:43.230 
button holes all right so the cameras

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.930 
button holes all right so the cameras
are<00:06:43.380> pretty<00:06:43.530> much<00:06:43.830> good<00:06:44.130> to<00:06:44.280> go<00:06:44.310> except<00:06:44.910> for

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 
are pretty much good to go except for

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.600 
are pretty much good to go except for
the<00:06:45.120> last<00:06:45.330> thing<00:06:45.600> here<00:06:45.930> is<00:06:46.110> the<00:06:46.860> lens<00:06:47.070> element

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.610 
the last thing here is the lens element

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.850 
the last thing here is the lens element
and<00:06:47.790> I've<00:06:48.180> kind<00:06:48.480> of<00:06:48.630> been<00:06:48.870> hesitant<00:06:49.350> to<00:06:49.470> really

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 
and I've kind of been hesitant to really

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.010 
and I've kind of been hesitant to really
go<00:06:50.130> to<00:06:50.190> town<00:06:50.520> on<00:06:50.550> the<00:06:50.820> lens<00:06:51.000> element<00:06:51.450> because<00:06:51.750> I

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020 
go to town on the lens element because I

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.350 
go to town on the lens element because I
don't<00:06:52.380> want<00:06:52.500> to<00:06:52.560> scratch<00:06:52.800> it<00:06:53.010> obviously<00:06:53.430> so

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 
don't want to scratch it obviously so

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.300 
don't want to scratch it obviously so
I'm<00:06:54.750> just<00:06:55.110> going<00:06:55.349> to<00:06:55.530> let<00:06:55.770> it<00:06:55.800> thaw<00:06:56.099> out

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.310 
I'm just going to let it thaw out

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.779 
I'm just going to let it thaw out
carefully<00:06:56.909> and<00:06:57.060> slowly<00:06:57.210> and<00:06:58.039> be<00:06:59.039> ready<00:06:59.250> with<00:06:59.580> a
