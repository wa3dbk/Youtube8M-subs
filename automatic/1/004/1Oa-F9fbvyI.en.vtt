00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:19.120 
I got a pretty good deal on this and the

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.370 
I got a pretty good deal on this and the
reason<00:00:19.300> why<00:00:19.510> I<00:00:19.540> bought<00:00:19.750> this<00:00:19.960> I<00:00:20.110> was<00:00:20.200> actually

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
reason why I bought this I was actually

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.690 
reason why I bought this I was actually
had<00:00:20.650> some<00:00:21.010> pretty<00:00:21.160> neat<00:00:21.460> features<00:00:22.150> here<00:00:22.450> so<00:00:23.700> it

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:24.700 
had some pretty neat features here so it

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.460 
had some pretty neat features here so it
has<00:00:25.119> look<00:00:25.510> at<00:00:25.600> the<00:00:25.660> features<00:00:25.960> right<00:00:26.110> there<00:00:26.290> has

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
has look at the features right there has

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.940 
has look at the features right there has
HDMI<00:00:26.890> of<00:00:27.220> course<00:00:27.460> they<00:00:27.580> should<00:00:28.230> 1080p<00:00:29.230> but<00:00:29.860> it

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950 
HDMI of course they should 1080p but it

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.090 
HDMI of course they should 1080p but it
also<00:00:30.100> has<00:00:30.370> an<00:00:30.520> Ethernet<00:00:30.670> and<00:00:31.090> USB<00:00:31.360> 2.0<00:00:32.140> so<00:00:32.379> I'm

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
also has an Ethernet and USB 2.0 so I'm

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.140 
also has an Ethernet and USB 2.0 so I'm
thinking<00:00:33.430> you<00:00:33.520> can<00:00:33.640> actually<00:00:33.850> hook<00:00:33.940> it<00:00:34.030> up

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150 
thinking you can actually hook it up

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.860 
thinking you can actually hook it up
through<00:00:34.330> the<00:00:34.450> internet<00:00:34.780> and<00:00:34.930> stream<00:00:35.320> videos

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
through the internet and stream videos

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.450 
through the internet and stream videos
much<00:00:37.870> like<00:00:38.050> one<00:00:38.199> of<00:00:38.260> those<00:00:38.320> media<00:00:38.800> players<00:00:39.160> and

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
much like one of those media players and

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
if it takes a USB key you can also

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.660 
if it takes a USB key you can also
transfer<00:00:42.280> it<00:00:42.400> onto<00:00:42.879> a<00:00:43.360> USB<00:00:43.870> so<00:00:44.170> it<00:00:44.290> plays

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
transfer it onto a USB so it plays

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
button here's the back of it the bottom

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.680 
button here's the back of it the bottom
the<00:02:43.420> side<00:02:44.640> let's<00:02:45.640> check<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:45.940> back<00:02:46.120> for<00:02:46.600> the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
the side let's check the back for the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.960 
the side let's check the back for the
inputs<00:02:47.050> there<00:02:47.650> you<00:02:47.740> go<00:02:48.540> so<00:02:49.540> we<00:02:49.720> have<00:02:49.750> your

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
inputs there you go so we have your

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.140 
inputs there you go so we have your
component<00:02:51.970> we<00:02:52.420> have<00:02:53.280> HDMI<00:02:54.280> your<00:02:54.670> coaxial

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
component we have HDMI your coaxial

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.330 
component we have HDMI your coaxial
optical<00:02:55.780> Ethernet<00:02:56.470> so<00:02:56.710> it<00:02:56.800> does<00:02:56.980> have<00:02:57.130> that

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
optical Ethernet so it does have that

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.400 
optical Ethernet so it does have that
Ethernet<00:02:57.880> port<00:02:58.150> right<00:02:58.330> there<00:02:58.360> and<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.880> USB<00:03:01.410> so

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
Ethernet port right there and the USB so

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.100 
Ethernet port right there and the USB so
it<00:03:02.590> does<00:03:02.860> have<00:03:03.190> all<00:03:03.340> that<00:03:03.720> so<00:03:04.720> I'm<00:03:04.780> thinking

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
it does have all that so I'm thinking

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.300 
it does have all that so I'm thinking
like<00:03:05.230> so<00:03:05.410> you<00:03:05.470> can<00:03:05.590> hook<00:03:05.710> it<00:03:05.770> up<00:03:05.800> the<00:03:05.950> internet

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
like so you can hook it up the internet

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.030 
like so you can hook it up the internet
and<00:03:06.550> stream<00:03:06.970> things<00:03:07.290> my<00:03:08.290> next<00:03:08.560> video<00:03:08.800> like<00:03:08.950> I

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
and stream things my next video like I

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.340 
and stream things my next video like I
said<00:03:09.220> I'll<00:03:09.340> do<00:03:09.490> the<00:03:09.610> review<00:03:09.970> of<00:03:10.000> it<00:03:10.240> and<00:03:10.350> I'll

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350
