00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello I'm lugo from mom and teacher 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.450
 dotcom and today I will make a review 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.450
 about the the very big hugs 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.340
 he is not a great option to give away in 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.920
 any occasion like Christmas 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.220
 birthday or kings day this nice 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.560
 doll is suitable for children over 18 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.869
 months what makes it an ideal toy 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.380
 for the high activity stage of the 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.750
 that 50 some disadvantages obstacles when playing 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.910
 with the engine now zonal the same can 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.010
 children interact with children 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.560
 they love receiving feedback from 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.930
 what they do so this is the most 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.090
 perfect because when you hug it you give 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.420
 account when you put it on your head or 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.210
 when you play with him and he says phrases 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.519
 according to what you 're doing this is not 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.899
 it sounds a lot to the children themselves two 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:57.940
 used pieces also children see 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:02.289
 the color of elmo which is a very red 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:05.260
 striking and it's soft texture what 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:07.300
 makes it easy to manipulate move and play 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.220
 anywhere 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.140
 the mod amine helps develop the 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.680
 imagination when he touches his left foot 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.350
 he proposes to play 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.430
 do some things like horse 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.410
 frog astronaut and children move 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.640
 according to what he does not ask and this one 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.260
 he answers 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.660
 so you can imagine that you are being 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.460
 some character or some animal too 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.580
 he does not have the option to help them 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.770
 nap when he backs elmo 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.600
 says he has the dream and starts 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.450
 sing a lullaby 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.259
 then he starts snoring those sounds 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.259
 like he's sleeping 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.560
 and finally I show you a great option 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.259
 for its size 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.960
 because it makes them think that they are like 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.780
 was a friend of hers that has fun 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.170
 same time and they like things 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.890
 he does not have my stamp of approval is a 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.970
 Very fun toy for children and 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.560
 even small children call them 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.560
 a lot of attention but it's special
