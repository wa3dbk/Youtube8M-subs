and here at Budds Creek the new mex 51
is<00:00:43.120> like<00:00:43.360> I<00:00:43.480> said<00:00:43.660> it's<00:00:43.840> it's<00:00:44.290> like<00:00:44.350> if<00:00:44.530> 756<00:00:45.160> on

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
is like I said it's it's like if 756 on

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.210 
is like I said it's it's like if 756 on
steroids<00:00:45.850> it's<00:00:46.150> uh<00:00:46.269> I<00:00:46.690> don't<00:00:47.680> know<00:00:47.800> it's<00:00:48.010> it's

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
steroids it's uh I don't know it's it's

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.500 
steroids it's uh I don't know it's it's
pretty<00:00:48.400> much<00:00:48.519> everything<00:00:48.970> that<00:00:49.000> you<00:00:49.210> want<00:00:49.449> on

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
pretty much everything that you want on

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.509 
pretty much everything that you want on
a<00:00:49.570> 756<00:00:50.260> and<00:00:50.500> it<00:00:50.559> carries<00:00:50.830> over<00:00:50.980> into<00:00:51.100> the<00:00:51.280> hard

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
a 756 and it carries over into the hard

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.299 
a 756 and it carries over into the hard
pack<00:00:51.729> as<00:00:51.909> well<00:00:51.940> so<00:00:52.420> it's<00:00:53.260> definitely<00:00:54.100> headed

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
pack as well so it's definitely headed

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:55.979 
pack as well so it's definitely headed
in<00:00:54.370> the<00:00:54.460> right<00:00:54.580> direction<00:00:54.640> and<00:00:55.420> I<00:00:55.479> think<00:00:55.870> it's

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
in the right direction and I think it's

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.729 
in the right direction and I think it's
a<00:00:56.110> change<00:00:56.440> for<00:00:56.559> the<00:00:56.620> better<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
a change for the better the

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.920 
a change for the better the
straight-line<00:01:00.129> grip<00:01:00.400> on<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:00.820> the<00:01:01.059> new<00:01:01.210> MX<00:01:01.540> 51

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
straight-line grip on the the new MX 51

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.560 
straight-line grip on the the new MX 51
is<00:01:02.080> good<00:01:02.290> it<00:01:02.500> seems<00:01:02.979> to<00:01:03.250> keep<00:01:03.879> traction<00:01:04.210> and

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
is good it seems to keep traction and

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.330 
is good it seems to keep traction and
both<00:01:04.870> the<00:01:05.140> soft<00:01:05.379> stuff<00:01:05.530> and<00:01:05.830> the<00:01:05.890> hard<00:01:06.040> stuff

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
both the soft stuff and the hard stuff

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.670 
both the soft stuff and the hard stuff
so<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.900> really<00:01:08.020> good<00:01:08.200> to<00:01:08.229> kind<00:01:08.350> of<00:01:08.530> have<00:01:08.650> a

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
so it's really good to kind of have a

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.100 
so it's really good to kind of have a
tire<00:01:08.950> that<00:01:08.979> is<00:01:09.280> good<00:01:10.030> on<00:01:10.150> every<00:01:10.450> condition<00:01:10.720> and

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
tire that is good on every condition and

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.899 
tire that is good on every condition and
can<00:01:11.920> withstand<00:01:12.580> any<00:01:13.330> kind<00:01:13.540> of<00:01:13.570> dirt<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:15.760> the

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
can withstand any kind of dirt in the

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.660 
can withstand any kind of dirt in the
corner<00:01:16.240> sits<00:01:16.570> with<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.860> having<00:01:18.159> you<00:01:18.280> know<00:01:18.369> two

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
corner sits with the having you know two

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.590 
corner sits with the having you know two
different<00:01:18.939> kinds<00:01:19.030> of<00:01:19.180> dirt<00:01:19.390> it

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
different kinds of dirt it

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.230 
different kinds of dirt it
and<00:01:20.810> it<00:01:20.930> works<00:01:21.260> great<00:01:21.380> it's<00:01:21.770> it's<00:01:22.490> pretty<00:01:23.090> much

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
and it works great it's it's pretty much

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.090 
and it works great it's it's pretty much
everything<00:01:23.630> that<00:01:23.780> you<00:01:23.840> really<00:01:24.110> want<00:01:24.320> it<00:01:24.500> can

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
really predict what it's going to do

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.580 
really predict what it's going to do
it's<00:01:26.689> never<00:01:27.320> doing<00:01:27.650> anything<00:01:27.710> stupid<00:01:28.100> and<00:01:28.400> and

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
it's never doing anything stupid and and

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.310 
it's never doing anything stupid and and
definitely<00:01:30.590> an<00:01:30.710> awesome<00:01:30.979> fire<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:33.020> new

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
definitely an awesome fire the new

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.530 
definitely an awesome fire the new
advantages<00:01:33.830> from<00:01:34.100> from<00:01:34.549> this<00:01:34.670> tire<00:01:34.940> is<00:01:34.970> I

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
advantages from from this tire is I

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.490 
advantages from from this tire is I
think<00:01:35.960> that<00:01:36.290> it<00:01:37.280> crosses<00:01:38.149> over<00:01:38.479> so<00:01:38.750> well<00:01:38.960> and<00:01:39.170> I

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
think that it crosses over so well and I

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.529 
think that it crosses over so well and I
think<00:01:39.530> that<00:01:39.950> with<00:01:40.610> it<00:01:40.729> being<00:01:40.850> consistent

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
think that with it being consistent

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.270 
think that with it being consistent
everywhere<00:01:41.899> it's<00:01:42.110> it<00:01:42.649> definitely<00:01:43.039> takes<00:01:43.159> a

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
everywhere it's it definitely takes a

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.609 
everywhere it's it definitely takes a
little<00:01:43.399> mind<00:01:43.640> games<00:01:43.850> often<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:44.479> you<00:01:45.200> can<00:01:45.350> have

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
little mind games often and you can have

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.180 
little mind games often and you can have
a<00:01:45.649> lot<00:01:45.830> more<00:01:45.979> confidence<00:01:46.430> in<00:01:46.520> your<00:01:46.670> tires<00:01:48.190> yeah

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
a lot more confidence in your tires yeah

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.580 
a lot more confidence in your tires yeah
the<00:01:49.399> new<00:01:49.549> MX<00:01:49.850> 51<00:01:50.360> it<00:01:50.630> definitely<00:01:51.080> gives<00:01:51.350> you<00:01:51.530> a

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
the new MX 51 it definitely gives you a

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.990 
the new MX 51 it definitely gives you a
little<00:01:51.740> more<00:01:51.830> opportunity<00:01:52.490> on<00:01:52.580> what<00:01:52.789> you<00:01:52.880> can

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
little more opportunity on what you can

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.050 
little more opportunity on what you can
take<00:01:53.270> it<00:01:53.890> with<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:55.009> lines<00:01:55.250> and<00:01:55.610> how

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
take it with the lines and how

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.660 
take it with the lines and how
everything<00:01:56.330> changes<00:01:56.960> I<00:01:57.229> believe<00:01:57.530> that<00:01:57.670> you

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
everything changes I believe that you

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.639 
everything changes I believe that you
can<00:01:58.880> almost<00:01:59.270> take<00:01:59.600> that<00:01:59.750> dryer<00:02:00.050> line<00:02:00.380> that

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
can almost take that dryer line that

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.440 
can almost take that dryer line that
might<00:02:00.830> be<00:02:00.950> better<00:02:01.130> rather<00:02:01.789> than<00:02:02.000> looking<00:02:02.300> for

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
might be better rather than looking for

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.350 
might be better rather than looking for
the<00:02:02.539> soft<00:02:02.780> a<00:02:02.960> key<00:02:03.020> stuff<00:02:03.350> so<00:02:03.710> being<00:02:04.340> able<00:02:04.490> to<00:02:04.729> to

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
the soft a key stuff so being able to to

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.080 
the soft a key stuff so being able to to
kind<00:02:05.479> of<00:02:05.569> go<00:02:05.720> where<00:02:05.869> you<00:02:05.960> want<00:02:06.200> and<00:02:06.880> it<00:02:07.880> be

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
kind of go where you want and it be

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.770 
kind of go where you want and it be
predictable<00:02:08.660> is<00:02:08.780> really<00:02:09.259> good<00:02:09.410> I<00:02:10.690> think<00:02:11.690> the

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
predictable is really good I think the
