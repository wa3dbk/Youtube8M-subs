00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.110
 however difficult it I will have 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.690
 reached an inexorable conclusion and 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.879
 deeply disturbing 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.070
 I think an elite of people together with 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.199
 the companies that manage have got 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.180
 control not only our energy the 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.249
 food supply education and 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.560
 health but each of the facets 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:28.630
 of our life and they do it by controlling 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.089
 the world of finance but do not create 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.870
 more value but they actually control 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:36.870
 the source of the money 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.870
 workman 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.430
 when the money is guided I saw that 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.630
 dragged to the top of a pyramid 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.150
 here we are at the base of the pyramid 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.340
 with our day to day above 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.320
 we are the government people at 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.120
 that you have been granted a monopoly of 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.160
 power and they use it to impose the 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.200
 taxes and control us are we 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.540
 agreement or not but those who control them 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.550
 to them in the next level we 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.860
 we found many companies 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.720
 people think that today they are 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.570
 those that govern the world and not the 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.920
 national states and they call it 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.600
 corporatocracy to get the 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.000
 global resources and control the 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.860
 markets is corporatocracy should have 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.780
 access to cheap big money 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.490
 corporations get their loans to 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.650
 a special interest of the great 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.479
 banks which means that those who 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.710
 the big banks control the elite 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.500
 wealthy are the ones who actually 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.180
 they control the corporations while 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.009
 I followed the money I realized that 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.660
 almost all the ideas I had about 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.660
 of capital are not true 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.649
 It is curious the fact that we 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.350
 we pose very few questions about 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.420
 everyday things like for example when 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.119
 we go to a bank and we ask for a loan 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.159
 of let's say 50,000 dollars or 50,000 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.829
 pounds that happens actually let's see 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.840
 many people have life based 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.600
 in ideas that are far from the 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.060
 reality what really happens is that 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.579
 if you ask 50,000 pounds write that in 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.679
 your account is 50,000 pounds that's all 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:05.079
 what they do does not mint coins or 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.159
 print tickets do not resort to any 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.410
 precious metal 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.660
 they simply write on a screen 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.929
 computer that your account has 50 thousand 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.929
 pounds 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.829
 from that moment you start paying 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.410
 interests on a quantity of money 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:23.190
 that has never existed that does not exist and 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.190
 that will not exist 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.010
 phase 1 is like launching the phase 1 fishing line 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.560
 you put a lot of money units 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.870
 for this exchange 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.150
 you lower the interests and you grant many 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.140
 loans this is the part of the cycle that 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.140
 we call boom 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.190
 as there are many exchange units 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.050
 in circulation there is a lot of money 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.080
 that changes hands that generates a great 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.510
 economic activity that generates employment and 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.490
 how you spend more and more money increases 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.160
 the demand so the companies 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.020
 they request more credits of money just 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.079
 come out of the oven to increase its 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.689
 production 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:07.370
 people get confidence in their routine 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:08.959
 it turns out that I work for such a company and 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.909
 has many orders works of 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.650
 wonder I have work insured and 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:16.780
 you know I'm thinking of buying a 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.189
 biggest house in history then 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.849
 they start to change what they do is throw 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:26.030
 of the line raise interest rates 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:28.280
 knauf and pipo now every time less 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.919
 people who get the credits 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.579
 because the conditions of concession 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:36.530
 have hardened and also by increasing the 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.600
 interest rates 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.420
 a large part of the salary of 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.630
 people are destined to pay that rise 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.720
 of interest and not consumption 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.750
 suddenly no longer so much money on 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.880
 circulation and therefore buy less 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.740
 things 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.140
 the profits of the companies are 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.820
 they begin to decrease they begin to reduce 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.120
 the jobs and some 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.340
 begin to close and people lose their 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.630
 jobs can no longer pay for 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.630
 mortgages of those big houses
