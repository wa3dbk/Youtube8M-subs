moving head what makes this so special
is<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.170> first<00:01:16.409> time<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.979> we

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
is the this is the first time that we

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.880

put a continuous pan rotation in any of
our<00:01:20.009> moving<00:01:20.189> heads<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> Intimidator<00:01:21.150> line

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
our moving heads in the Intimidator line

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.780 
our moving heads in the Intimidator line
and<00:01:21.570> as<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.170> can<00:01:22.350> see<00:01:22.530> behind<00:01:22.710> me<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.430> never

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
and as you can see behind me it never

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.820 
and as you can see behind me it never
stops<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.330> spins<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.750> helicopter<00:01:25.439> so<00:01:25.590> just

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
stops it spins like a helicopter so just

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.190 
stops it spins like a helicopter so just
imagine<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.729> effects<00:01:27.119> for<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.390> moment<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.990> what

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
imagine the effects for a moment of what

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.130 
imagine the effects for a moment of what
you<00:01:28.290> can<00:01:28.439> achieve<00:01:28.560> with<00:01:29.369> quad<00:01:29.790> color<00:01:30.090> LEDs<00:01:30.600> red

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
use the built in Auto programs and then

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.359 
use the built in Auto programs and then
you<00:01:41.390> add<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.810> all<00:01:42.869> together<00:01:43.200> on<00:01:43.649> top<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.280> the
