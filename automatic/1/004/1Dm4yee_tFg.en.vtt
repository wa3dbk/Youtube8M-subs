00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:08.099
 and then youtube personal about new ps 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.110
 I'm here to talk about your two 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.690
 things for you are 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.590
 first I made a video with this 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.619
 program that the system test and test 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.650
 system that limits the performance of the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.050
 device I did as s3 me and more 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.900
 four other devices you can 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.029
 check the channel youtube.com barreiros 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:37.320
 br br It 's just like that 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:40.410
 Another point was that my computer the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.559
 The user keeps up a lot and he 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.860
 next that matheus lima and that 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:52.739
 program that I ran the test in 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.559
 system it the virus that it the antivirus 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.899
 detected a threat 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:01.010
 So what did I do, I got the 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.439
 my s3 me here 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.680
 I installed avast mobile security 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.350
 so I installed it and had it searched 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.080
 o my cell phone to see what it was 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.960
 happening here with avast is 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.960
 protecting you and stepchildren let's 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:32.939
 here winning is another little thing 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:35.880
 that has a scanning blog none 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.329
 problem was found that I did it 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.329
 my cell phone 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.100
 Let's do it again, I can choose the 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.399
 day of the week that I want to win a lot 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.399
 automatic 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.320
 then matheus lime 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.399
 I agree with him that the antivirus 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:09.350
 reporter given the detected threat 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:09.350
 because this program the test program 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.160
 he has an advertisement that I've circled 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.890
 I rode on all other devices 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.459
 always offline without being connected to the 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.269
 Internet 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:26.730
 there is no problem found 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.880
 So what can happen is that a 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.239
 another antivirus may have detected that 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:37.440
 this would be a threat a test of this 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:42.260
 one system may have detected you and 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:45.599
 Your talking is a threat, but I 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.060
 I installed avast as you saw it and 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:51.540
 I did not have any problem then this 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.640
 video is to clarify that the program 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.780
 it can be detected by another 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.299
 antivirus solution for another is a problem that 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.250
 I can understand Spanish at these 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.370
 things pro celular 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.420
 so if you stay in doubt 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.610
 in the program you install an antivirus 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.819
 Then he was asking to earn his 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.590
 phone for you to understand a threat 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.109
 independent of this program that the 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.380
 if you want to install an asset 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:24.660
 you are and check also you see that 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.930
 your place is your cell phone use 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.620
 device is protected or does not 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.250
 folks 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.889
 so this is the tip is if about the 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:39.060
 of the antivirus that the avastin I used 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:41.340
 here a system that was not detected 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.389
 by him but may have been detected by 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.730
 another program 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:47.579
 It's okay if you like, give your jewelry. 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.299
 Leave the market, okay, thank you and until 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.299
 more personal
