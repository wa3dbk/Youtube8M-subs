ambition it has a din of five to twelve

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.410 
ambition it has a din of five to twelve
hence<00:00:35.680> the<00:00:35.950> twelve<00:00:36.219> and<00:00:36.460> the<00:00:36.520> name<00:00:36.700> it<00:00:37.210> has<00:00:37.270> a

stand<00:00:37.719> height<00:00:37.960> from<00:00:38.200> the<00:00:38.320> ski<00:00:38.530> to<00:00:38.649> the<00:00:38.739> top<00:00:38.890> of

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
stand height from the ski to the top of

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.410 
stand height from the ski to the top of
the<00:00:39.070> deck<00:00:39.219> here<00:00:39.489> on<00:00:39.579> the<00:00:39.670> where<00:00:40.030> the<00:00:40.120> boot<00:00:40.239> goes

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
the deck here on the where the boot goes

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.619 
the deck here on the where the boot goes
of<00:00:40.690> 38<00:00:41.079> mils<00:00:41.350> weighs<00:00:42.070> in<00:00:42.219> at<00:00:42.309> about<00:00:42.460> 1930<00:00:43.329> grams

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.840 
of 38 mils weighs in at about 1930 grams
so<00:00:44.260> about<00:00:44.410> four<00:00:44.710> pounds<00:00:44.890> eight<00:00:45.249> ounces<00:00:45.309> which

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
so about four pounds eight ounces which

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.579 
so about four pounds eight ounces which
is<00:00:45.999> pretty<00:00:46.179> respectable<00:00:46.690> for<00:00:47.320> a<00:00:47.350> frame

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:47.589 
is pretty respectable for a frame

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.529 
is pretty respectable for a frame
binding<00:00:48.010> like<00:00:48.160> this<00:00:48.370> it's<00:00:48.940> got<00:00:49.030> a<00:00:49.089> warranty<00:00:49.449> of

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
binding like this it's got a warranty of

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:52.439 
binding like this it's got a warranty of
two<00:00:49.719> years<00:00:50.019> and<00:00:50.320> it's<00:00:51.219> a<00:00:51.370> one<00:00:51.640> size<00:00:51.909> fits<00:00:51.940> all

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
two years and it's a one size fits all

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:53.910 
two years and it's a one size fits all
binding<00:00:52.989> so<00:00:53.170> that's<00:00:53.320> kind<00:00:53.589> of<00:00:53.620> a<00:00:53.710> unique

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
binding so that's kind of a unique

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.389 
binding so that's kind of a unique
feature<00:00:54.249> of<00:00:54.399> this<00:00:54.640> so<00:00:55.210> this<00:00:56.079> will<00:00:56.289> fit<00:00:56.440> a<00:00:56.649> 2<00:00:57.100> 60

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
feature of this so this will fit a 2 60

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.459 
feature of this so this will fit a 2 60
ml<00:00:57.579> boot<00:00:57.760> all<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.030> way<00:00:58.120> up<00:00:58.179> to<00:00:58.269> a<00:00:58.300> 350<00:00:59.109> ml<00:00:59.289> boot

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
ml boot all the way up to a 350 ml boot

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.439 
ml boot all the way up to a 350 ml boot
so<00:01:00.010> if<00:01:00.190> you've<00:01:00.309> got<00:01:00.399> different<00:01:00.819> sized<00:01:01.149> boots

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
so if you've got different sized boots

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.689 
so if you've got different sized boots
or<00:01:01.719> different<00:01:02.409> people<00:01:02.589> using<00:01:02.859> the<00:01:02.949> ski<00:01:03.219> you

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
or different people using the ski you

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.250 
or different people using the ski you
don't<00:01:03.909> have<00:01:04.120> to<00:01:04.300> buy<00:01:04.420> different<00:01:04.659> bindings<00:01:05.170> it

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
don't have to buy different bindings it

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.219 
don't have to buy different bindings it

are four rides or positions with this
binding<00:01:14.320> that<00:01:14.470> we'll<00:01:14.620> look<00:01:14.710> at<00:01:14.860> in<00:01:15.010> a<00:01:15.070> minute

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
binding that we'll look at in a minute

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.420 
binding that we'll look at in a minute
there<00:01:16.240> is<00:01:16.509> a<00:01:16.540> zero<00:01:17.100> there's<00:01:18.100> also<00:01:18.250> five

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
there is a zero there's also five

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.429 
there is a zero there's also five
degrees<00:01:18.759> 10<00:01:19.030> degrees<00:01:19.060> and<00:01:19.299> 15<00:01:19.719> degrees<00:01:19.899> so<00:01:20.200> for

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
degrees 10 degrees and 15 degrees so for

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.160 
degrees 10 degrees and 15 degrees so for
riser<00:01:20.649> Heights<00:01:21.000> quite<00:01:22.000> good<00:01:22.240> for<00:01:22.840> touring

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
riser Heights quite good for touring

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.660 
riser Heights quite good for touring
you've<00:01:23.320> got<00:01:23.409> a<00:01:23.439> set<00:01:23.680> up<00:01:23.770> for<00:01:23.950> all<00:01:24.070> sort<00:01:24.399> of<00:01:24.490> an

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
you've got a set up for all sort of an

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.030 
you've got a set up for all sort of an
inclination<00:01:24.969> of<00:01:25.540> a<00:01:25.750> skin<00:01:25.990> track<00:01:26.259> and<00:01:26.680> it's

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
inclination of a skin track and it's

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.160 
inclination of a skin track and it's
also<00:01:27.159> got<00:01:27.340> a<00:01:27.399> free<00:01:27.670> flex<00:01:28.030> system<00:01:28.299> and<00:01:29.049> what

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
also got a free flex system and what

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.539 
also got a free flex system and what
that<00:01:29.320> means<00:01:29.500> is<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:29.860> two<00:01:30.009> design<00:01:30.340> in<00:01:30.490> the

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
that means is the two design in the

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.370 
that means is the two design in the
center<00:01:30.789> here<00:01:31.119> it's<00:01:31.479> actually<00:01:31.750> got<00:01:31.899> some<00:01:32.049> flex

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
center here it's actually got some flex

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.679 
center here it's actually got some flex
in<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:32.619> back<00:01:32.799> here<00:01:33.100> so<00:01:33.130> as<00:01:33.729> you<00:01:34.000> flex<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.450> ski

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
in the back here so as you flex the ski

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.660 
in the back here so as you flex the ski
the<00:01:34.869> binding<00:01:35.229> will<00:01:35.380> float<00:01:35.740> essentially<00:01:36.369> on

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
the binding will float essentially on

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.999 
the binding will float essentially on
the<00:01:37.030> ski<00:01:37.270> and<00:01:37.320> eliminate<00:01:38.320> that<00:01:38.469> dead<00:01:38.710> spot

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
the ski and eliminate that dead spot

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.069 
the ski and eliminate that dead spot
when<00:01:39.159> you're<00:01:39.310> skiing<00:01:39.579> so<00:01:40.390> why<00:01:40.780> don't<00:01:40.899> we<00:01:40.930> go

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
when you're skiing so why don't we go

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:42.810 
when you're skiing so why don't we go
ahead<00:01:41.170> and<00:01:41.439> take<00:01:41.770> a<00:01:41.799> closer<00:01:42.070> look<00:01:42.219> at<00:01:42.579> the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
ahead and take a closer look at the

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.389 
ahead and take a closer look at the
riser<00:01:43.030> Heights<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:44.590> here<00:01:44.740> we<00:01:44.829> are<00:01:44.859> in<00:01:45.039> ski<00:01:45.219> mode

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
riser Heights so here we are in ski mode

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.999 
riser Heights so here we are in ski mode
