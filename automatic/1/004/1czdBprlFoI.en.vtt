 uniform does not have a flag but 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.150
 no one doubts that they are Russian this

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.309
 extremely important region for 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.480
 Moscow is where is still found

 evening jean françois bélanger 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.650
 Moscow is Crimea first because 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.359
 it's at its doors and because there's 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.369
 a large Russian fleet is a 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.380
 important Russian population a 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.820
 population undergoing Jean-François the 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.419
 repercussions of this showdown so 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.830
 between the West and Russia 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.450
 really with each passing day with 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.920
 every parent who passed on tension is 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.840
 more and more lively more and more 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.640
 palpable here on the ground writes my 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.650
 impact testing everywhere 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.070
 to push populations to 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:47.140
 to tear each other apart on the issue around 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.290
 of this Ukrainian engineers base 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.570
 marine of the visit not really 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.180
 welcome Russian soldiers 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.130
 arrived in the morning blocking 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.510
 the entry would please me and 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.270
 government representatives 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.940
 self - proclaimed crimes came 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.479
 to parley or rather to negotiate a 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.630
 surrender 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.310
 all the soldiers who want to leave 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.829
 to leave in ukraine can 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.659
 said he who wants to stay here serve them 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:16.420
 the crimea where russia can also 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.670
 so many options unacceptable to the eyes 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.439
 of the base commander and we continue 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.329
 I respond to the orders of the command of 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.920
 the navy of ukraine says he we do not 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:26.170
 will leave this base only if kiev we 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.580
 give the order 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.770
 but obviously this face to face between 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.000
 brother country soldiers came throwing 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.130
 all a stir in this little 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.860
 community where everyone here lived 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.630
 together in peace at least until there is 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.970
 a few days the red knelt 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.950
 to pass you who bundles the attention 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.990
 Minister has clearly moved up a notch 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.729
 between his neighbors who come from 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:52.280
 discover also ideological left by 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.320
 magna already lioubov media aya lives 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.850
 right next to the military base and 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.070
 really have not reassured by the 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.539
 turn of events now 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.039
 genomics on the menu turgot the people 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.869
 before to be interested in the origins 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.570
 ethnic her neighbors said she tatar 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.130
 Ukrainian russian what's going on 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.660
 currently is very dangerous said she 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.680
 I do not want this to end 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.320
 like in Yugoslavia two blocks away 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.790
 another military base is still sporting 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.700
 proudly the colors of Ukraine 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.450
 his commander and it's to keep the 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.430
 cool head 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.320
 in the middle of the bible chaos to continue 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.610
 knees should be avoided at all 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.030
 price that people are dying stupidly 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.980
 decreases and for that he has a message to 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.739
 the intention of the politicians of each 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.420
 side it's a crossover to judge burgaud 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.880
 they have to sit around a table 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.130
 and pour a glass of tea take some 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.250
 gift points and talk to each other to find 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.530
 together a peaceful issue so if 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.750
 simple yet visibly so 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.750
 complicated here jean françois belleau
