 channel video this time I come to you 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.500
 to bring something pretty pretty good for 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.760
 so to say and it is the tool this 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.500
 courses boys that many of you 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.540
 maybe you know it since it's a 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.950
 similar tool such as the 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.450
 team spirit that skype and you're 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.789
 tools that are therefore a chat by 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.910
 voice not basically what happens is that 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.860
 with these one 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.180
 getting into the lole and so on 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.890
 once in a while qualifiers keys to 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.539
 people that you pass a link to you 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.580
 goals in your room and to be able to talk 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.710
 just that and all this and if you want then you 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.119
 you get in and if not then obviously not but yes 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.670
 you want you can just try it with 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.710
 your friends to change from ts to 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.000
 this tool well I leave this 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.340
 it's in beta so you're 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.629
 register and ask for a password 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.000
 God knows when the key arrives 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.949
 but I bring you a way to be able 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.059
 use it totally free and from this 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.430
 same moment that I'm watching the video 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.820
 which is why it's very interesting to come back 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.710
 to start 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.820
 the first thing we have to do is the 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.070
 description of this video 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.750
 you'll find a couple of links the first 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.780
 link that you'll see was something like beta 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.610
 point course voice dotcom bar join and 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.289
 then a link this is my personal link 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.180
 it's going to be here from you 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.800
 downloads the official game is the page 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.789
 ok to go to the state what are you 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.350
 watching on screen 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:11.300
 gioja firm and you have been invited by 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.070
 have and gamer to participate in the 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.080
 void course while you play league of 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.670
 legends and here we would give the button 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.470
 download and we will download what 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.850
 the client would be the client of course 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.830
 well this is official already have no 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.270
 kind of trap that is what happens that 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.190
 once you download you would have 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.650
 what to give here to apply for the beta 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.330
 and all those things this step we're going to 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.950
 do it in another way and it's very simple 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.590
 let's go to the second link that I'm going to 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.150
 leave the description of the video which 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.650
 will simply be a file that 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.320
 we're going to have to download what's worth 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.880
 flame course point voice low bar or 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.370
 well under what is to maintain and james 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.760
 are 7 megabytes we would give here to download 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.760
 regular 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.630
 we would create these seconds that here 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.260
 and here we would put the word is that 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.200
 he asks us weed 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.450
 we would give to continue 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.039
 and we would give you to download file in the 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.049
 virtual mode with the browser so that 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.369
 do not download more shits and here we see 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.689
 that the course of 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.819
 voice tenebris gamer etcetera etcetera 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.349
 etcetera once we have it 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.430
 downloaded a very simple we have it 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.440
 here already on the desk here 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.530
 I prepared that what we have to do 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.640
 very simple we will be clicking 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.140
 here obviously we see that having in 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.870
 account installed to be able to extract the 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.330
 rar files we will be here 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.519
 we hope it ends the nothing takes a 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.459
 little bit and here we have everything that we 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:34.330
 they bring elect has extracted this what 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.890
 we take everything and we are going to copy it 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.830
 and let's go to the route where we have 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.480
 installed the course that as you will see 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.460
 when is we have the tool that we 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.720
 let the owling like this the one who throws the 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.730
 project to the tool already for 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.260
 execute it if we execute it without these 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.300
 files what will happen is that it will ask us 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.130
 that we put our login our 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.720
 account and of course obviously as not 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.580
 we have the beta key because we can not 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.200
 enter then what we do is 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.720
 we take the files extracts from said 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.120
 we copy them and we go to the route where 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.100
 the tool is installed by 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.250
 defect the route is this you are going to see 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.510
 It is worth two points if users 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.520
 you in English or in Spanish or as 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.100
 be your user the applications 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.050
 data app data roaming then the 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.370
 client of course client and then on the 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.890
 usual bar that would be the archives 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.690
 binaries and then then here simply 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.400
 We do everything we paste 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.500
 let's copy we give to perform 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.660
 this action will speak to us to copy and 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.070
 replace this copy us all the 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.780
 files that you are seeing is worth everything 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.459
 this little ones 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.350
 and it simply because it only takes 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.640
 that we execute from here same if 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.640
 we want the application we execute it 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.360
 will do a test on the internet and not 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.250
 I know what wafers already tells us so that 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.200
 work properly we need to have 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.360
 the service pack 1 installed is worth this is 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.340
 a thing of windows but we already see that 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.989
 we are inside the games if not 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.340
 we would have put in your files as 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.319
 I would ask us to register one 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.150
 tell a story now simply already 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.920
 we can enter the rooms that we want 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.510
 we need you to pass the link 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.130
 or else we can also create our 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.780
 own room that would give you to create 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.730
 we will select in this case the game 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.500
 the league of legends 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.640
 and here we would be like a 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.640
 sky as you see when I call 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.980
 the marquito stops being green and 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.450
 when you talk, it turns green 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.560
 similar to what would be sky here we see 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.260
 the options 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.320
 the museum the micro museum here the 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.180
 options to configure it here then 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.479
 it would be a voice chat 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.669
 jane oops very simple is everything and 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.930
 then that's why it's called to hang how 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.820
 to make your friends join then 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.620
 very simply we take in what would be 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.060
 the link this hits it we will copy cheese 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.970
 we passed on to our friends who also 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.380
 have the course be installed then by 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.509
 the part we can also change our 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.330
 nick and we can also change our 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:46.639
 avatar with the character that we want the 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.259
 league of legends in this case so 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.880
 nothing I leave you with this tool I hope 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:51.560
 that you enjoy it a lot and enjoy it 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.720
 because while no change in this so 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.900
 this is all a greeting and even the 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.900
 next
