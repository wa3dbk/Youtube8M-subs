00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 good morning to all the guys with it 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.089
 staff of www.lexbook.it link to facebook 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.550
 to the company in description and we are here 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.210
 today finally with the players is view of the 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.030
 timoria 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.089
 let's start with maria toti a very good one 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.060
 player with 94 over, but has not 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.980
 nothing to see or pay even better 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.160
 very few features in the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.960
 comparisons of robben messi and ronaldo one is 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.160
 a player who despite his 94 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.710
 god flight from the offensive midfielder 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.810
 central still pays for its faults e 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.850
 so in my opinion they still remain 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.530
 those among the strongest of the game a 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.870
 player who at 96 plus speed 6 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.809
 compared to the version no longer informs 7 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.750
 for the physical 78 and the defense 64 a 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.480
 very good value 65 of drift more 8 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.940
 91 passing and 88 shooting plus 9 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.520
 compared to the version not in 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.379
 form is a very good player I have 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.320
 tried in so many roles all the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.520
 roles as a central midfielder 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.670
 striker 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.129
 and where I liked it in 4 3 3 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.280
 that co.co.co he used as cerci e 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.500
 in 4 2 2 2 as you are looking for in 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.150
 so that you can run driblare e 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.830
 above all take advantage of his skills 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.229
 pass and cross because this 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.470
 player in the official database of 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.630
 export cross rate not even 99 in that 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.159
 site is written 100 of cross is a 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.350
 player who makes good crosses either 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.270
 right or left of the passages 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.369
 phenomenal both right and left 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.070
 player who at 91 division one hundred of 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.740
 cross 79 precision punishment 90 's 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.430
 short passages 89 of long passages a 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.530
 player who in any role you use a 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.840
 my opinion should be used to play for i 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.579
 comrades must not be the companions a 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.350
 play for him because he is in 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.579
 able to do everything that is can 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.899
 help you all the team in 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.520
 tranquility excellent speed 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.590
 excellent acceleration 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.540
 I think it's still a lot more agile 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.430
 compared to him however this is 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.439
 another thing is a player though 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.630
 when he arrives in front of the doorman in mine 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.369
 opinion suffers a lot that 84 of 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.320
 finalization I do not say it is a 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.810
 low value I'm not saying he doesn't score a goal 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.750
 but if the others make the other 9 goals 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.360
 of his race that is I speak of robben 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.820
 resigned of Rome 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.760
 aldo if the others make nine goals on 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.100
 ten is not done on ten of throws is a 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.380
 player who misses the goals and then the 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.880
 finalization 84 omitted among the cons 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.740
 because if you have to compare it to i 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.180
 other aliens 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.800
 let's say it's still a nice step 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.660
 below especially with regards to 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.830
 this then another thing that is not me 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.720
 only liked the two foot weak stars 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.130
 why then skip the whole team but 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.680
 if you get to pull right discs 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.330
 seriously that pulling to cross 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.400
 he is the TV in the side out is me 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.380
 happened twice ie I pulled then 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.060
 find at least the maximum I take the 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.430
 first post as I arrived from the right 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.720
 and he really threw it out of favor 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.370
 a player who then the two stars 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.290
 weaker with regards to shooting and 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.060
 the finalization really makes it 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.360
 much weaker in this respect 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.739
 compared to the others to the link of the game is 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.390
 a player that for this reason I tell you not 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.400
 spend 4 million rather take me 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.830
 put and ronaldo if you have i 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.290
 credits to take him as well as 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.000
 all the monsters in the game then use it 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.940
 but used by in the middle of the field or 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.560
 not used to 4 1 2 1 2 as a cyclist 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.239
 in short, as an outsider who can go 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.940
 at the bottom I can all jump 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.380
 pull left or at any rate I can a 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.630
 cross a player who can play 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.130
 for others I will repeat it endlessly 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.810
 this in my opinion a player who 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.030
 must play for others a good one 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.400
 department mate in attack though 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.380
 many times you don't see why because 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.350
 this word trade aldo high another 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.239
 small flaw with regards to this 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.709
 kind of roles so that he isn't 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.540
 always where it must be so if you 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.440
 take it, spend 4 million to play 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.299
 only with di maria 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.340
 it can happen easily that you 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.200
 you find you put the midfielder today and there 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.810
 on duty instead of Maria and Maria 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.760
 Larger or midfield is a player 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.290
 who sacrifices a lot for others e 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.970
 who, if used in midfield, recovers 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.130
 many balloons 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.660
 in yesterday's video I said look 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.830
 look what a strong defender he saw 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.269
 today the statistics I realized 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.150
 that good or bad there was also a response 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.560
 on the card 81 of interceptions 71 of 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.820
 contrasts is a player with his 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.010
 speed can safely a 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.110
 recover the player who is running 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.030
 even if you use it as an exterior and then 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.799
 maybe even steal the ball if a 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.480
 half in midfield may be that face 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.250
 a nice cut to intercept the 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.200
 balloon then defensive phase also 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.690
 pretty good as far as the 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.820
 Shooting super pollicioni power by up to 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.560
 98 of power throw pull of left the 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.919
 goalkeeper almost never blocks it 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.750
 he makes a goal out of four though anyway 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.180
 you get in the door can be 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.010
 quietly you make goals with 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.810
 then the rebounds after the comes 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.680
 ball your attacker and away a 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.500
 player who boasted of 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.270
 enhanced the 88 good value launcher 86 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.580
 di tira on flight 81 of penalty 84 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.440
 finalization 91 of very good effect 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.580
 shooting left and above 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.440
 as for the passage to 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.400
 very good value then obviously there is the 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.950
 speed we said the player 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.290
 very fast 96 and accelerations on 96 of 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.760
 98 speed of agility repeats 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.710
 still in my opinion it is much more agile 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.320
 put the 94 check equal to 96 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.760
 4 star dribbling and skill is a 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.770
 player who can dribble all the 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.479
 team in one stroke very fast it is 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.979
 really able to throw ball 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.710
 long and run run to go on 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:08.380
 bottom but for the umpteenth time I tell you 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.820
 use it as an assistant and not as 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.380
 assisted is a player who must 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.970
 play for others do not have to be 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.979
 the others to play with him at least in mine 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.660
 opinion or at least for as the game if I 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:18.310
 have you tried tell me what you think 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.710
 tell me if you agree with me and 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.750
 above all remember that its strength 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.520
 physics is not good at all because 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.440
 especially when it starts in speed it can 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.470
 it happens that the defender takes you back and 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.479
 The physical strength really pays them 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.740
 and tell me what you think of the review though 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:34.740
 you enjoyed putting on a lay person
