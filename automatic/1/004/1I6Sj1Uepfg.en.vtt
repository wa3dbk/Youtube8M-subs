00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
be going two inches pass cuz I think

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:52.370 
be going two inches pass cuz I think
this<00:00:42.719> one<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:42.960> closer<00:00:44.360> just<00:00:45.360> make<00:00:45.570> sure

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:52.380 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.240 

so<00:00:52.950> now<00:00:53.190> we<00:00:53.250> have<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:54.500> 357

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
so now we have a 357

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:18.820 
so now we have a 357
I<00:00:57.340> prints<00:00:57.850> that<00:00:58.090> close<00:00:58.540> to<00:00:58.960> that

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.210 

and<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:20.040> think<00:01:20.280> pretty<00:01:20.520> much<00:01:20.670> after<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.210> get<00:01:21.570> a

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
and I think pretty much after you get a

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.370 
and I think pretty much after you get a
pass<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:24.229> 300<00:01:25.229> magic<00:01:25.590> comment<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.380> really

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
pass a 300 magic comment on that really
