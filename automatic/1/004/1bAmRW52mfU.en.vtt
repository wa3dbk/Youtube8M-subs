stroke<00:00:23.660> combination<00:00:24.470> is<00:00:24.710> a<00:00:41.170> little<00:00:42.170> sort<00:00:42.860> of<00:00:42.920> a

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
stroke combination is a little sort of a

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.150 
stroke combination is a little sort of a
secret<00:00:44.900> about<00:00:45.020> how<00:00:45.290> to<00:00:45.350> do<00:00:45.530> this<00:00:45.680> well<00:00:45.950> as

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
secret about how to do this well as

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.160 
secret about how to do this well as
remember<00:00:46.670> from<00:00:47.510> DVD<00:00:48.170> one<00:00:48.470> this<00:00:49.989> motion<00:00:50.989> that<00:00:51.140> I

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
remember from DVD one this motion that I

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.560 
remember from DVD one this motion that I
talked<00:00:51.530> to<00:00:51.650> you<00:00:51.739> about<00:00:51.829> that<00:00:52.010> where<00:00:52.820> all<00:00:53.120> the

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
talked to you about that where all the

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.400 
talked to you about that where all the
movement<00:00:54.079> on<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.280> frame<00:00:56.090> drum<00:00:56.920> is<00:00:57.920> these<00:00:58.820> two

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
movement on the frame drum is these two

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.290 
movement on the frame drum is these two
vectors<00:01:00.410> between<00:01:00.980> these<00:01:01.190> fingers<00:01:01.460> down<00:01:02.090> to

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
vectors between these fingers down to

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.960 
vectors between these fingers down to
the<00:01:02.390> elbow<00:01:02.720> in<00:01:03.200> between<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:04.339> index<00:01:04.699> finger

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
the elbow in between the index finger

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.260 
the elbow in between the index finger
the<00:01:05.149> thumb<00:01:05.210> down<00:01:05.990> to<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.290> elbow<00:01:10.270> straight

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
the thumb down to the elbow straight

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.539 
the thumb down to the elbow straight
line<00:01:11.600> moving<00:01:12.079> there<00:01:12.409> straight<00:01:13.069> flow<00:01:13.399> of

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
line moving there straight flow of

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:24.910 
line moving there straight flow of
energy<00:01:14.829> so<00:01:16.420> we're<00:01:17.420> going<00:01:17.600> to<00:01:17.659> go<00:01:23.590> so<00:01:24.590> here's

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
energy so we're going to go so here's

00:01:24.920 --> 00:02:20.110 
energy so we're going to go so here's
that<00:01:25.189> motion

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.210 

okay<00:02:21.120> if<00:02:21.360> you<00:02:21.540> have<00:02:21.870> trouble<00:02:22.500> going<00:02:23.069> at<00:02:23.190> that

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
okay if you have trouble going at that

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:42.410 
okay if you have trouble going at that
speed<00:02:24.140> start<00:02:25.140> slow<00:02:38.989> you<00:02:40.040> only<00:02:41.040> play<00:02:41.549> as<00:02:41.940> fast

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
speed start slow you only play as fast

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.070 
speed start slow you only play as fast
as<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:43.019> can<00:02:43.200> play<00:02:43.440> cleanly<00:02:44.630> so<00:02:45.630> just<00:02:45.840> practice

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
as you can play cleanly so just practice

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.960 
as you can play cleanly so just practice
up<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.739> level<00:02:47.099> of<00:02:47.280> where<00:02:47.489> you<00:02:47.610> can<00:02:47.760> play

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
up to the level of where you can play

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.180 
up to the level of where you can play
cleanly<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:49.019> when<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.470> put<00:02:49.650> in<00:02:49.769> a<00:02:49.860> lot<00:02:50.040> of

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
cleanly and when you put in a lot of

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.400 
cleanly and when you put in a lot of
time<00:02:50.459> practicing<00:02:50.940> at<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:51.660> level<00:02:51.900> slowly

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
time practicing at that level slowly

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.440 
time practicing at that level slowly
you'll<00:02:52.739> get<00:02:52.920> better<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.370> better<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:54.120> play<00:02:54.420> a

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
you'll get better and better and play a

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.319 
you'll get better and better and play a
little<00:02:54.630> bit<00:02:54.780> faster
