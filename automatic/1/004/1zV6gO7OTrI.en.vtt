00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
because he's so aggressive with a stick

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.210 
because he's so aggressive with a stick
that<00:02:10.160> I<00:02:10.220> I<00:02:10.640> make<00:02:11.060> sure<00:02:11.269> that<00:02:11.860> he<00:02:12.860> doesn't<00:02:13.040> get

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
that I I make sure that he doesn't get

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.070 
that I I make sure that he doesn't get
rotated<00:02:13.640> so<00:02:14.030> he<00:02:14.120> touches<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.480> really<00:02:14.840> nicely

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
rotated so he touches it really nicely

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.350 
rotated so he touches it really nicely
and<00:02:15.560> when<00:02:15.769> he<00:02:15.920> goes<00:02:16.129> aggressively<00:02:17.000> at<00:02:17.150> it

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
and when he goes aggressively at it

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.990 
and when he goes aggressively at it
instead<00:02:17.720> of<00:02:17.780> holding<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.519> super<00:02:19.519> far<00:02:19.730> away<00:02:19.760> so

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
instead of holding it super far away so

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.150 
instead of holding it super far away so
that<00:02:20.209> it's<00:02:20.390> impossible<00:02:20.690> actually<00:02:21.260> hold<00:02:21.980> it<00:02:22.099> a

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
that it's impossible actually hold it a

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.680 
that it's impossible actually hold it a
little<00:02:22.190> bit<00:02:22.430> closer<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:23.209> just<00:02:23.239> look<00:02:23.450> at<00:02:23.569> him
