00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.280
 here 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.920
 Hello everyone, today we talk 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.710
 of the importance of the sight of 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.540
 prevention in the geriatric patient 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.310
 especially as this allows 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.740
 both to prevent certain 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.140
 directly related issues 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.509
 age is to make diagnoses 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.130
 early with timely intervention 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.380
 therapeutic and therefore greater 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.410
 resolution probability of 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.390
 same pathology in the geriatric dog o 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.820
 check at least important 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.469
 every six months then at least a couple of 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.989
 times a year must be brought with 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:42.280
 regularity even in the absence of signs 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.859
 obvious clinical 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.899
 in the opinion of the owner directly 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:50.559
 attributable to a situation of type 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:52.239
 pathological he and watson a boxer of 10 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.879
 half years of age so it's definitely 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.249
 a patient to be considered geriatric 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.859
 came the inspection visit for a 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:01.589
 careful evaluation not only of anomalies 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.129
 obvious what they can be 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.260
 alterations of his system 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.960
 cardiovascular but also for 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.670
 situations that greatly reduce the 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.680
 quality of life of our animals in the 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.270
 recent years such as a correct one 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.850
 evaluation of the muscle apparatus 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.799
 skeletal it is important to remember that 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.450
 animals especially big gold 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.210
 size are subject to phenomena 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.240
 arthrosics which are then accompanied by a 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.159
 gc phenomena therefore of tenderness 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.020
 that if not properly corrected not 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.939
 only reduce the quality of life of the 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.829
 our animal but also reduce 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.170
 interaction as the dog has less 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.090
 want to play about walking and 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.860
 interact with the owner not 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.000
 let us forget that the expectation of the 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.740
 our animals and certainly 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.110
 life expectancy of our animals 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.000
 and certainly increased compared to 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.119
 therefore some years ago some pathologies 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.740
 that were not diagnosed before 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.259
 they are now more frequently not alone 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.630
 diagnosed but need treatment 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.719
 that if carried out at the appropriate time 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.420
 surely allow the animal to 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.490
 spend more years with us 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.649
 I recommend despite the visit of 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.770
 check must be done with one 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.960
 half-yearly or even more frequent 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.730
 if necessary it is very important the 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.580
 active collaboration of the owner 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.250
 in 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.350
 of the health of our animals 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.260
 any new training we can 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.720
 quietly warn simply 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.640
 caressing our animal or even 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.620
 of sometimes fish to ours 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.870
 eyes in the eyes of the owner banal 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.640
 because not attributable to lessons from 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.010
 scratching or redness of the skin 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.710
 underlying can hide some 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.080
 underlying endocrine pathologies that are 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.730
 diagnosed in time would shorten 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.970
 very much the life of our animals 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.920
 having said this I francesco and watson vi 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.140
 we say goodbye and see each other again 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.380
 time for the next appointment 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.380
 Goodbye to everyone
