important<00:01:29.909> thing<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.119> need<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.299> look<00:01:30.509> at<00:01:30.720> is

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
important thing you need to look at is

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.080 
important thing you need to look at is
the<00:01:31.110> kernel<00:01:31.500> now<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.220> said<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.520> before<00:01:32.700> I'm

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
the kernel now like I said it before I'm

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.819 
the kernel now like I said it before I'm
on<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.390> stock<00:01:33.600> kernel<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.110> can<00:01:34.259> see<00:01:34.409> it

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
on the stock kernel and you can see it

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.499 
on the stock kernel and you can see it
doesn't<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.490> case<00:01:35.729> set<00:01:36.000> hard<00:01:36.270> boot

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
doesn't have the case set hard boot

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.660 
doesn't have the case set hard boot
patch<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.229> something<00:01:37.590> you'll<00:01:37.770> need<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
patch this is something you'll need the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.609 
patch this is something you'll need the
kernel<00:01:39.030> needs<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.659> actually<00:01:39.810> allow<00:01:40.380> this

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
kernel needs this to actually allow this

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.280 
kernel needs this to actually allow this
to<00:01:40.860> run<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.640> some<00:01:42.329> kernels<00:01:42.750> some<00:01:42.930> custom

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
to run so some kernels some custom

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.920 
to run so some kernels some custom
kernels<00:01:43.619> like<00:01:43.740> Franco<00:01:44.280> or<00:01:44.610> elemental<00:01:45.509> will

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
kernels like Franco or elemental will

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.990 
kernels like Franco or elemental will
have<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.320> patch<00:01:46.560> already<00:01:47.040> installed<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.970> you

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
have this patch already installed so you

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.460 
have this patch already installed so you
don't<00:01:48.210> need<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.420> worry<00:01:48.600> about<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:48.960> next<00:01:49.290> step

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
don't need to worry about this next step

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.080 
don't need to worry about this next step
but<00:01:50.009> if<00:01:50.189> you're<00:01:50.340> like<00:01:50.490> me<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.790> you're<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.000> the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
but if you're like me and you're on the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.609 
but if you're like me and you're on the
stock<00:01:51.299> kernel<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.750> will<00:01:51.899> need<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.229> tick<00:01:52.439> this

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
stock kernel you will need to tick this

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.310 
stock kernel you will need to tick this
kernel<00:01:53.009> box<00:01:53.220> here<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.640> then<00:01:54.600> choose<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
kernel box here and then choose the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.469 
kernel box here and then choose the
right<00:01:55.500> kernel<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.040> we're<00:01:56.280> on<00:01:56.399> Android<00:01:56.790> 4.4.2

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
right kernel so we're on Android 4.4.2

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.499 
right kernel so we're on Android 4.4.2
we'll<00:01:58.140> click<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:59.090> we<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.270> all<00:02:00.390> the

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
we'll click that and we have all the

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.120 
we'll click that and we have all the
other<00:02:00.540> stuff<00:02:00.689> tick<00:02:01.110> like<00:02:01.290> multi<00:02:01.680> ROM<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.040> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
other stuff tick like multi ROM and the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.490 
other stuff tick like multi ROM and the
recovery<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.640> does<00:02:02.820> install<00:02:03.540> its<00:02:03.750> own<00:02:03.930> custom

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
recovery it does install its own custom

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.920 
recovery it does install its own custom
twr<00:02:05.490> pea<00:02:05.640> recovery<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.390> do<00:02:06.570> need<00:02:06.750> to

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
twr pea recovery that you do need to

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.839 
twr pea recovery that you do need to
install<00:02:07.229> different<00:02:07.409> roms<00:02:07.740> with<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.160> right

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
install different roms with and right

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.040 
install different roms with and right
now<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.030> can<00:02:09.209> see<00:02:09.330> it's<00:02:09.450> unfortunately

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
now you can see it's unfortunately

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.869 
now you can see it's unfortunately
Ubuntu<00:02:10.770> touch<00:02:10.979> does<00:02:11.250> not<00:02:11.430> support<00:02:11.730> this

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
Ubuntu touch does not support this

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.400 
Ubuntu touch does not support this
device<00:02:12.180> when<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.540> does<00:02:12.750> there<00:02:12.959> may<00:02:13.080> be<00:02:13.110> another

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
option

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.320 
option
here<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.070> you<00:02:14.190> can<00:02:14.370> install<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:14.910> as<00:02:15.090> well

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
here that you can install that as well

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.970 
here that you can install that as well
so<00:02:15.510> that's<00:02:15.630> pretty<00:02:15.840> cool<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:16.800> we're<00:02:16.950> just

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
so that's pretty cool so we're just

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.310 
so that's pretty cool so we're just
going<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.250> hit<00:02:17.310> install<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:19.020> started

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
going to hit install and it started

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.630 
going to hit install and it started
doing<00:02:19.530> its<00:02:19.680> thing<00:02:19.800> here<00:02:20.040> it's<00:02:20.160> downloading

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
doing its thing here it's downloading

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.280 
doing its thing here it's downloading
everything<00:02:20.880> it<00:02:21.120> needs<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.360> work<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:21.990> you'll

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
everything it needs to work so you'll

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.680 
everything it needs to work so you'll
just<00:02:22.500> wait<00:02:22.650> for<00:02:22.800> this

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
just wait for this

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.810 
just wait for this
okay<00:02:25.620> so<00:02:25.680> there's<00:02:25.950> two<00:02:26.070> things<00:02:26.250> that<00:02:26.460> say<00:02:26.580> need

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
okay so there's two things that say need

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.790 
okay so there's two things that say need
recovery<00:02:27.300> here<00:02:27.570> so<00:02:27.780> we'll<00:02:27.960> reboot<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.560> let<00:02:28.710> it

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
recovery here so we'll reboot and let it

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.790 
recovery here so we'll reboot and let it
do<00:02:28.920> its<00:02:29.070> thing<00:02:29.900> I'll<00:02:30.900> fast-forward<00:02:31.320> all<00:02:31.650> this

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
do its thing I'll fast-forward all this

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.210 
do its thing I'll fast-forward all this
because<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.130> is<00:02:32.280> kind<00:02:32.460> of<00:02:32.520> boring<00:02:37.070> all<00:02:38.070> right

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
because this is kind of boring all right

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.820 
because this is kind of boring all right
so<00:02:38.400> that's<00:02:38.490> it<00:02:38.730> it's<00:02:38.910> rebooting<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:40.710> can

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
so that's it it's rebooting so you can

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.050 
so that's it it's rebooting so you can
see<00:02:40.980> here<00:02:41.130> it's<00:02:41.220> gonna<00:02:41.340> auto<00:02:41.550> boot<00:02:41.970> we're

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
see here it's gonna auto boot we're

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.130 
see here it's gonna auto boot we're
gonna<00:02:42.180> leave<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.540> at<00:02:42.600> that<00:02:42.630> because<00:02:42.780> we<00:02:42.960> don't

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
gonna leave it at that because we don't

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.720 
gonna leave it at that because we don't
have<00:02:43.290> any<00:02:43.410> roms<00:02:43.680> right<00:02:43.890> now<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:44.280> that's<00:02:44.580> the

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
have any roms right now so that's the

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.190 
have any roms right now so that's the
little<00:02:44.880> boot<00:02:45.120> menu<00:02:45.300> that<00:02:45.600> is<00:02:45.750> going<00:02:46.020> to<00:02:46.080> be

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
little boot menu that is going to be

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.750 
little boot menu that is going to be
displayed<00:02:46.560> every<00:02:46.860> time<00:02:47.040> your<00:02:47.190> device<00:02:47.460> reboots

so it's just booting into the ROM I had

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.120 
so it's just booting into the ROM I had

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
let's let it do this okay so we're

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.450 
let's let it do this okay so we're
booted<00:02:58.230> back<00:02:58.350> up<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.710> if<00:02:58.770> we<00:02:58.890> dive<00:02:59.040> back<00:02:59.280> into

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
won't need to do that patch so that's it

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.340 
won't need to do that patch so that's it

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
already have one on there it's called

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.910 
already have one on there it's called
Beanstalk<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.180> we're<00:03:21.360> going<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.680> reboot<00:03:22.680> into

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
Beanstalk so we're going to reboot into

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.710 
Beanstalk so we're going to reboot into
the<00:03:23.010> recovery<00:03:24.620> recovery<00:03:25.620> yes<00:03:26.550> so<00:03:27.510> if<00:03:27.600> you're

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
the recovery recovery yes so if you're

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.030 
the recovery recovery yes so if you're
familiar<00:03:27.870> with<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.350> team<00:03:28.530> wing<00:03:28.709> custom

familiar with the team wing custom

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.680 
familiar with the team wing custom
recovery<00:03:29.280> not<00:03:29.640> much<00:03:29.850> has<00:03:30.060> changed<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.630> only

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
recovery not much has changed the only

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.570 
recovery not much has changed the only
difference<00:03:31.170> is<00:03:31.320> if<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:31.590> dive<00:03:31.770> into<00:03:31.980> advanced

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
difference is if you dive into advanced

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.220 
difference is if you dive into advanced
you'll<00:03:32.940> notice<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.360> now<00:03:33.510> have<00:03:33.690> a<00:03:33.720> new<00:03:33.959> section

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
you'll notice you now have a new section

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.870 
you'll notice you now have a new section
called<00:03:34.620> multi<00:03:35.040> ROM<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:35.370> this<00:03:35.489> is<00:03:35.610> where<00:03:35.760> you

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
it and boot it from the USB drive so if

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.870 
it and boot it from the USB drive so if
we<00:04:13.050> plug<00:04:13.260> this<00:04:13.410> in<00:04:13.620> we'll<00:04:14.459> just<00:04:14.610> give<00:04:14.730> it<00:04:14.820> a

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
we plug this in we'll just give it a

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.870 
we plug this in we'll just give it a
second<00:04:15.330> and<00:04:15.480> we'll<00:04:15.660> hit<00:04:15.780> refresh<00:04:16.019> a<00:04:16.290> few<00:04:16.560> times

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
second and we'll hit refresh a few times

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.370 
second and we'll hit refresh a few times
you<00:04:17.880> can<00:04:17.910> see<00:04:18.180> there<00:04:18.390> that<00:04:18.600> it<00:04:18.690> does<00:04:18.870> turn<00:04:19.140> up

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
you can see there that it does turn up

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.380 
you can see there that it does turn up
and<00:04:19.560> you<00:04:19.590> can<00:04:19.830> actually<00:04:20.100> boot<00:04:20.340> roms<00:04:20.640> from<00:04:21.299> a

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
and you can actually boot roms from a

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.090 
and you can actually boot roms from a
USB<00:04:21.690> stick<00:04:22.109> so<00:04:22.140> that's<00:04:22.440> pretty<00:04:22.710> cool<00:04:22.919> but

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
USB stick so that's pretty cool but

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.530 
USB stick so that's pretty cool but
right<00:04:23.340> now<00:04:23.490> we'll<00:04:23.730> just<00:04:23.880> leave<00:04:24.060> it<00:04:24.240> as<00:04:24.390> the

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
right now we'll just leave it as the

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.850 
right now we'll just leave it as the
internal<00:04:25.020> memory<00:04:25.169> we'll<00:04:25.890> hit<00:04:26.070> next<00:04:26.130> and

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
internal memory we'll hit next and

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.830 
internal memory we'll hit next and
select<00:04:28.860> rom<00:04:29.310> source<00:04:29.700> so<00:04:30.030> what<00:04:30.330> we<00:04:30.419> want<00:04:30.600> to<00:04:30.690> do

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
select rom source so what we want to do

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.110 
select rom source so what we want to do
is<00:04:31.169> zip<00:04:31.800> file<00:04:32.070> but<00:04:32.280> you<00:04:32.370> can<00:04:32.580> actually<00:04:32.729> choose

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
is zip file but you can actually choose

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.820 
is zip file but you can actually choose
to<00:04:33.360> install<00:04:33.690> a<00:04:33.750> rom<00:04:34.020> from<00:04:34.320> and<00:04:34.470> nandroid

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
to install a rom from and nandroid

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.250 
to install a rom from and nandroid
backup<00:04:34.890> or<00:04:35.550> from<00:04:35.789> adb<00:04:36.270> silo<00:04:36.720> so<00:04:36.870> that's<00:04:37.020> pretty

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
backup or from adb silo so that's pretty

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.360 
backup or from adb silo so that's pretty
cool<00:04:37.440> but<00:04:37.620> right<00:04:37.830> now<00:04:37.950> we'll<00:04:38.100> choose

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
cool but right now we'll choose

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.460 
cool but right now we'll choose
zip<00:04:38.550> file<00:04:38.820> and<00:04:39.090> we're<00:04:40.020> going<00:04:40.169> to<00:04:40.199> choose<00:04:40.440> a

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
zip file and we're going to choose a

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:50.659 
zip file and we're going to choose a
beanstalk<00:04:41.280> and<00:04:42.380> swipe<00:04:43.380> to<00:04:43.410> confirm<00:04:49.610> okay<00:04:50.610> so

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
beanstalk and swipe to confirm okay so

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.040 
beanstalk and swipe to confirm okay so
that's<00:04:50.910> installed<00:04:51.330> but<00:04:51.510> you<00:04:51.540> do<00:04:51.750> need<00:04:51.900> to

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
that's installed but you do need to

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.840 
that's installed but you do need to
install<00:04:52.350> G<00:04:52.590> apps<00:04:52.740> for<00:04:53.010> each<00:04:53.130> separate<00:04:53.610> ROM<00:04:53.820> you

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
install G apps for each separate ROM you

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.520 
install G apps for each separate ROM you
install<00:04:54.330> otherwise<00:04:54.630> they<00:04:54.840> won't<00:04:54.990> have<00:04:55.290> them

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
install otherwise they won't have them

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.900 
install otherwise they won't have them
so<00:04:55.710> we're<00:04:55.830> going<00:04:55.919> to<00:04:56.010> hit<00:04:56.160> back<00:04:56.370> a<00:04:56.400> few<00:04:56.639> times

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
so we're going to hit back a few times

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.150 
so we're going to hit back a few times

got your internal rom and then you've

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.040 
got your internal rom and then you've
got<00:05:44.639> Beanstalk<00:05:45.150> so<00:05:45.300> you<00:05:45.389> could<00:05:45.570> have<00:05:45.750> a<00:05:45.780> list

log<00:05:57.060> to<00:05:57.210> sdcard<00:05:57.660> but<00:05:58.229> we<00:05:58.349> want<00:05:58.560> to<00:05:58.650> boot

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
log to sdcard but we want to boot

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.800 
log to sdcard but we want to boot
Beanstalk<00:05:59.580> so<00:05:59.789> we'll<00:05:59.910> hit<00:06:00.000> Beanstalk<00:06:00.510> hit

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
Beanstalk so we'll hit Beanstalk hit

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.210 
Beanstalk so we'll hit Beanstalk hit
boot<00:06:01.130> and<00:06:02.990> boom<00:06:03.990> we<00:06:04.200> should<00:06:04.410> now<00:06:04.590> be<00:06:04.800> booting

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
boot and boom we should now be booting

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:24.100 
boot and boom we should now be booting
beanstalks<00:06:05.970> let's<00:06:06.240> see<00:06:06.389> what<00:06:06.510> happens

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.450 

okay<00:06:25.110> so<00:06:25.169> we<00:06:25.379> booted<00:06:25.680> up<00:06:25.800> that<00:06:25.949> initial<00:06:26.129> boot

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
okay so we booted up that initial boot

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.159 
okay so we booted up that initial boot
did<00:06:26.699> take<00:06:26.879> around<00:06:27.120> three<00:06:27.419> to<00:06:27.569> four<00:06:27.599> minutes<00:06:28.050> I

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169 
did take around three to four minutes I

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:29.540 
did take around three to four minutes I
guess<00:06:28.349> that's<00:06:28.560> just<00:06:28.650> the<00:06:28.889> Rama<00:06:29.099> it<00:06:29.340> may<00:06:29.490> be

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
guess that's just the Rama it may be

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.640 
guess that's just the Rama it may be
different<00:06:30.120> depending<00:06:30.300> on<00:06:31.110> the<00:06:31.229> ROM<00:06:31.409> you<00:06:31.530> do

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
different depending on the ROM you do

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.529 
different depending on the ROM you do
we're<00:06:31.800> going<00:06:31.919> to<00:06:31.979> skip<00:06:32.159> this<00:06:32.370> for<00:06:32.550> now<00:06:32.610> just<00:06:33.389> so

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:33.539 
we're going to skip this for now just so

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:35.119 
we're going to skip this for now just so
we<00:06:33.659> can<00:06:33.810> actually<00:06:34.020> boot<00:06:34.409> up<00:06:34.530> into<00:06:34.770> the<00:06:34.860> ROM<00:06:35.009> and

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:35.129 
we can actually boot up into the ROM and

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:42.129 
we can actually boot up into the ROM and
see<00:06:35.280> what<00:06:35.430> it<00:06:35.520> says<00:06:35.840> no<00:06:36.840> no<00:06:37.289> no<00:06:37.530> no<00:06:37.800> no<00:06:38.189> no

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:42.139 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:44.540 

finish<00:06:43.139> here<00:06:43.889> we<00:06:44.069> go

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
finish here we go

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.119 
finish here we go
so<00:06:45.120> you<00:06:45.180> can<00:06:45.389> choose<00:06:45.629> the<00:06:46.080> launcher<00:06:46.860> we<00:06:47.009> will

00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:47.129 
so you can choose the launcher we will

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:48.589 
so you can choose the launcher we will
choose<00:06:47.310> the<00:06:47.520> google<00:06:47.789> edition<00:06:48.120> launcher<00:06:48.449> for

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:48.599 
choose the google edition launcher for

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:52.040 
choose the google edition launcher for
now<00:06:48.830> and<00:06:49.830> here<00:06:50.430> we<00:06:50.550> go<00:06:50.699> wrong<00:06:50.969> Beanstalk<00:06:51.659> as

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.050 
now and here we go wrong Beanstalk as

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.510 
now and here we go wrong Beanstalk as
simple<00:06:52.469> as<00:06:52.590> that<00:06:52.710> if<00:06:52.830> we<00:06:52.919> dive<00:06:53.099> into<00:06:53.310> the

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
simple as that if we dive into the

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.679 
simple as that if we dive into the
settings<00:06:54.289> jump<00:06:55.289> into<00:06:55.560> about<00:06:55.860> phone<00:06:56.539> you<00:06:57.539> can

00:06:57.679 --> 00:06:57.689 
settings jump into about phone you can

00:06:57.689 --> 00:06:59.779 
settings jump into about phone you can
see<00:06:57.840> that<00:06:58.020> we<00:06:58.139> are<00:06:58.319> on<00:06:58.529> the<00:06:58.680> Beanstalk<00:06:59.250> romp<00:06:59.580> it

00:06:59.779 --> 00:06:59.789 
see that we are on the Beanstalk romp it

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:03.860 
see that we are on the Beanstalk romp it
is<00:07:00.479> on<00:07:00.810> the<00:07:01.080> Beanstalk<00:07:01.770> kernel<00:07:02.219> as<00:07:02.400> well<00:07:02.870> so

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:03.870 
is on the Beanstalk kernel as well so

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:05.330 
is on the Beanstalk kernel as well so
you<00:07:03.930> could<00:07:04.199> do<00:07:04.349> everything<00:07:04.620> you<00:07:04.889> normally<00:07:05.250> do

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 
you could do everything you normally do

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.189 
you could do everything you normally do
on<00:07:05.370> a<00:07:05.460> ROM<00:07:05.669> here<00:07:05.909> set<00:07:06.150> it<00:07:06.180> all<00:07:06.360> up<00:07:06.389> exactly<00:07:07.050> how

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 
on a ROM here set it all up exactly how

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:09.529 
on a ROM here set it all up exactly how
you<00:07:07.259> wanted<00:07:07.650> to<00:07:07.830> and<00:07:08.099> let's<00:07:08.550> say<00:07:08.789> we<00:07:09.120> reboot

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:09.539 
you wanted to and let's say we reboot

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:19.550 
you wanted to and let's say we reboot
the<00:07:09.659> phone<00:07:09.870> now<00:07:11.930> into<00:07:12.930> an<00:07:13.560> old<00:07:13.740> reboot<00:07:18.560> we're

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 
the phone now into an old reboot we're

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.170 
the phone now into an old reboot we're
gonna<00:07:19.680> get<00:07:19.830> that<00:07:19.919> little<00:07:20.099> boot<00:07:20.400> menu<00:07:20.580> here<00:07:20.969> it

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:21.180 
gonna get that little boot menu here it

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.179 
gonna get that little boot menu here it
takes<00:07:21.449> four<00:07:21.779> seconds<00:07:22.169> to<00:07:22.349> disappear<00:07:22.919> all<00:07:23.039> it

00:07:23.179 --> 00:07:23.189 
takes four seconds to disappear all it

00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:25.640 
takes four seconds to disappear all it
auto<00:07:23.400> boots<00:07:23.759> and<00:07:24.360> we'll<00:07:24.870> use<00:07:24.900> the<00:07:25.229> internal

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:25.650 
auto boots and we'll use the internal

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.230 
auto boots and we'll use the internal
ROM<00:07:25.919> you<00:07:25.949> can<00:07:26.189> actually<00:07:26.310> change<00:07:26.699> these<00:07:26.909> around

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 
ROM you can actually change these around

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.149 
ROM you can actually change these around
if<00:07:27.389> you<00:07:27.479> want<00:07:27.690> Beanstalk<00:07:28.229> to<00:07:28.409> boot<00:07:28.589> first<00:07:28.889> it's

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:29.159 
if you want Beanstalk to boot first it's

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:31.519 
if you want Beanstalk to boot first it's
in<00:07:29.279> the<00:07:29.339> multi<00:07:30.060> ROM<00:07:30.300> settings<00:07:30.719> will<00:07:31.319> choose

00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:31.529 
in the multi ROM settings will choose

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:39.120 
in the multi ROM settings will choose
the<00:07:31.680> internal<00:07:32.099> rom<00:07:32.219> to<00:07:32.400> boot<00:07:32.550> now

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:39.130 

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.379 

so<00:07:40.130> it's<00:07:40.280> booted<00:07:40.580> back<00:07:40.729> up<00:07:40.910> there<00:07:41.120> and<00:07:41.300> if<00:07:41.360> we

00:07:41.379 --> 00:07:41.389 
so it's booted back up there and if we

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:43.150 
so it's booted back up there and if we
dive<00:07:41.690> into<00:07:42.020> the<00:07:42.259> settings<00:07:42.620> you'll<00:07:42.860> notice

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:43.160 
dive into the settings you'll notice

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.559 
dive into the settings you'll notice
that<00:07:43.310> everything<00:07:43.580> is<00:07:43.819> the<00:07:44.000> same<00:07:44.210> as<00:07:44.389> when<00:07:44.539> we

00:07:44.559 --> 00:07:44.569 
that everything is the same as when we

00:07:44.569 --> 00:07:46.540 
that everything is the same as when we
left<00:07:44.840> it<00:07:45.050> if<00:07:45.350> we<00:07:45.470> go<00:07:45.620> into<00:07:45.740> Batphone<00:07:46.220> we're<00:07:46.430> on

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:46.550 
left it if we go into Batphone we're on

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.010 
left it if we go into Batphone we're on
the<00:07:46.669> stock<00:07:46.910> rom<00:07:47.150> and<00:07:47.300> the<00:07:47.389> colonel<00:07:47.750> that<00:07:47.870> it
