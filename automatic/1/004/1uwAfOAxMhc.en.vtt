00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
right here which is programmable you can

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.400 
right here which is programmable you can
just<00:02:56.270> keep<00:02:56.420> that<00:02:56.600> in<00:02:56.750> your<00:02:56.810> vehicle<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.380> can

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
just keep that in your vehicle you can

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.170 
just keep that in your vehicle you can
actually<00:02:57.860> set<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.360> rev<00:02:59.360> limiter<00:03:00.850> idle<00:03:01.850> speed

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
actually set the rev limiter idle speed

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.140 
actually set the rev limiter idle speed
anything<00:03:03.110> can<00:03:03.380> be<00:03:03.500> done<00:03:03.680> off<00:03:03.950> of<00:03:04.100> that<00:03:04.250> and<00:03:04.610> in

a nice simple computer even has a blue

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.330 
a nice simple computer even has a blue
light<00:03:08.780> that<00:03:08.810> will<00:03:09.140> stay<00:03:09.410> on<00:03:09.440> steady<00:03:09.980> if<00:03:10.190> you

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
light that will stay on steady if you

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.480 
light that will stay on steady if you
ever<00:03:10.490> set<00:03:10.850> a<00:03:10.910> code<00:03:11.300> any<00:03:11.630> one<00:03:11.900> of<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.110> sensors

ever set a code any one of the sensors

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.400 
ever set a code any one of the sensors
that<00:03:13.490> light<00:03:13.850> will<00:03:14.060> blink<00:03:14.240> and<00:03:14.630> you<00:03:15.230> can

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
that light will blink and you can

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.070 
that light will blink and you can
actually<00:03:15.590> download<00:03:15.980> any<00:03:16.880> codes<00:03:17.480> right<00:03:17.810> from

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
actually download any codes right from

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.030 
actually download any codes right from
the<00:03:18.200> handheld<00:03:18.710> device<00:03:19.360> so<00:03:20.560> one<00:03:21.560> other<00:03:21.710> thing

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
the handheld device so one other thing

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.440 
the handheld device so one other thing
on<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:24.310> fuel<00:03:25.310> hookup<00:03:25.760> I'm<00:03:26.030> going<00:03:26.210> to<00:03:26.270> actually

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
on the fuel hookup I'm going to actually

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.300 
on the fuel hookup I'm going to actually
show<00:03:26.810> you<00:03:26.840> right<00:03:27.050> here<00:03:27.110> we<00:03:27.650> just<00:03:27.830> temporarily

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
show you right here we just temporarily

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.420 
show you right here we just temporarily
have<00:03:28.610> our<00:03:28.790> fuel<00:03:29.060> pump<00:03:29.300> mounted<00:03:29.690> on<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:29.930> cart

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
have our fuel pump mounted on the cart

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.790 
have our fuel pump mounted on the cart
the<00:03:31.430> fuel<00:03:31.850> line<00:03:32.060> that<00:03:33.020> would<00:03:33.140> come<00:03:33.380> from<00:03:33.410> the

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
the fuel line that would come from the

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.850 
the fuel line that would come from the
rear<00:03:34.010> of<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.190> car<00:03:34.459> goes<00:03:35.360> to<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.810> front<00:03:36.170> of<00:03:36.320> the

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
rear of the car goes to the front of the

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.100 
rear of the car goes to the front of the
throttle<00:03:37.850> body<00:03:37.880> that's<00:03:38.330> where<00:03:38.540> your<00:03:38.660> hookup

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
throttle body that's where your hookup

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
throttle body that's where your hookup
for<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.090> fuel<00:03:41.090> line<00:03:41.300> is<00:03:41.540> and<00:03:41.870> then<00:03:42.410> coming<00:03:42.890> on

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
for the fuel line is and then coming on

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.449 
for the fuel line is and then coming on
to<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.520> back<00:03:43.760> side<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.959> fuel<00:03:45.260> line<00:03:45.500> comes<00:03:46.250> out

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
to the back side the fuel line comes out

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.210 
to the back side the fuel line comes out
and<00:03:46.790> that<00:03:47.450> goes<00:03:48.020> right<00:03:48.290> to<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.530> fuel<00:03:48.950> pressure

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
and that goes right to the fuel pressure

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.199 
and that goes right to the fuel pressure
regulator<00:03:50.020> right<00:03:51.020> there<00:03:51.640> you<00:03:52.640> have<00:03:52.820> a<00:03:52.850> vacuum

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
regulator right there you have a vacuum

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.050 
regulator right there you have a vacuum
line<00:03:53.980> from<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.100> pressure<00:03:55.340> regulator<00:03:55.940> that

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
line from the pressure regulator that

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.540 
line from the pressure regulator that
hooks<00:03:56.270> to<00:03:56.570> the<00:03:56.620> right<00:03:57.620> rear<00:03:57.920> the<00:03:58.160> throttle

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
hooks to the right rear the throttle

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.150 
hooks to the right rear the throttle
body<00:03:58.760> and<00:03:58.970> then<00:03:59.840> the<00:03:59.989> fuel<00:04:00.260> pressure<00:04:00.530> return

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
body and then the fuel pressure return

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.370 
body and then the fuel pressure return
comes<00:04:01.580> out<00:04:01.820> of<00:04:01.940> the<00:04:02.030> bottom<00:04:02.390> and<00:04:02.570> goes<00:04:03.080> back<00:04:03.320> to

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
comes out of the bottom and goes back to

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.430 
comes out of the bottom and goes back to
the<00:04:03.650> fuel<00:04:03.950> tank<00:04:04.220> so<00:04:04.780> that's<00:04:05.780> pretty<00:04:06.080> much<00:04:06.170> I

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
the fuel tank so that's pretty much I

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.350 
the fuel tank so that's pretty much I
just<00:04:06.620> want<00:04:06.830> to<00:04:06.920> go<00:04:07.010> over<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:07.340> basics<00:04:07.880> of<00:04:08.120> how

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
just want to go over the basics of how

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.470 
just want to go over the basics of how
to<00:04:09.110> hook<00:04:09.410> up<00:04:09.620> these<00:04:09.739> fast<00:04:10.070> efi<00:04:10.550> systems<00:04:11.120> the

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
to hook up these fast efi systems the

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.170 
to hook up these fast efi systems the
instructions<00:04:12.140> are<00:04:12.380> very<00:04:12.410> simple<00:04:13.250> there's

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
instructions are very simple there's

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.320 
instructions are very simple there's
like<00:04:14.480> 10<00:04:15.440> or<00:04:15.590> 15<00:04:15.950> pages<00:04:16.250> here<00:04:16.609> but<00:04:16.790> everything

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
like 10 or 15 pages here but everything

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.539 
like 10 or 15 pages here but everything
is<00:04:17.510> just<00:04:17.810> if<00:04:18.020> you<00:04:18.140> read<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.560> instructions<00:04:19.220> it

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
is just if you read the instructions it

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.590 
is just if you read the instructions it
is<00:04:20.140> extremely<00:04:21.140> reliable<00:04:21.850> it<00:04:22.850> adapts<00:04:23.419> to<00:04:23.480> any

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
is extremely reliable it adapts to any

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.940 
is extremely reliable it adapts to any
engine<00:04:24.200> and<00:04:24.410> we<00:04:25.280> run<00:04:25.520> these<00:04:25.669> on<00:04:25.880> all<00:04:26.030> of<00:04:26.210> our

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
engine and we run these on all of our

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.080 
engine and we run these on all of our
customers<00:04:27.950> engines<00:04:28.340> I<00:04:28.520> want<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:28.880> fuel

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
customers engines I want the fuel

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.250 
customers engines I want the fuel
injection<00:04:29.450> we've<00:04:29.840> had<00:04:30.050> a<00:04:31.930> lot<00:04:32.930> of

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
injection we've had a lot of

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.290 
injection we've had a lot of
