 that the disk image is mounted it takes 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.100
 a few seconds and then

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:33.170
 you 're going to click run 7.15 here 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.100
 you clicked right away on dock 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.150
 then you will come to the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.590
 harness installation of the game you

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.310
 cut the music you click next

 here you have to leave the location 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.399
 installing the game personally 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.060
 but I will leave it by default 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.250
 very much like that 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.530
 you click again on next 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.420
 here you can choose whether or not to create 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.899
 a nikon on the desk and in the menu 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.310
 start 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.590
 so I'm going to coach the two wells 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.649
 gas you click next and to finish 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.610
 you click on one from 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.649
 now the game is going on 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.360
 installation so the installation can 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.189
 take in my opinion a fortnight 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.930
 of minutes so I'm just going 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.379
 cut the video and I find you soon 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.550
 that the installation will be finished 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.700
 the installation is now 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.200
 completed 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.849
 so here you will be able to tick 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.660
 this box if you do not have 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.060
 directx 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.190
 if you only own or know 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.019
 another game has already installed you 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.590
 directx it's not necessary to check 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:28.000
 so you click on finish then you 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.200
 see that so I chose to myself 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.380
 create an account on the desktop an icon 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.319
 was created here is so now 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.819
 we will have to copy the crack which the 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.260
 back and the installation of the game so for 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.709
 do this you will go all 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.170
 simply 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.090
 in fact in their virtual image that 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.390
 you have mounted with daemon tools 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.890
 so you open the virtual drive is 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.660
 here you will have one of those cracks you 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.360
 will go into this one you go 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.360
 simply copied these three 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.739
 files tell if you're going to stick them 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.630
 in the game installation directory 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.069
 so if the coen was created to us on the 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.780
 office or just right click on 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.640
 the open icon at the location of the 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.810
 file got you there and if you come 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.280
 you did not choose to make a 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.410
 icon on the desktop and you go in 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.250
 your say that c program files and you 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.390
 look for football manager 2014 for that 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.160
 it's the game installation folder 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.750
 now we're going to do right click 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.370
 collar to stick the three cards 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.290
 and crack we make you copy 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.720
 replace copy replace ecopy 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.720
 replaced here you click continue 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.010
 once the three files are copied and 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.870
 well it's all good in fact you're going 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.700

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.430
 this window and launch the game via this 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.489

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.950
 at play everything is functional there is no 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.910
 worry then we're just going to still 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.750

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.860
 French you can start a game 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.440
 will have no problem normally so if 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.870
 never precisely would you have a possible 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.880
 problem 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.260
 Well, there is a little girl 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.300
 manipulation to solve problems 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.590
 then try anyway first 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.480
 it's to see if you have a problem 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.310
 if you have no problem this 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.510
 video is over for you otherwise you 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.700
 go on and you do what I'm going 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.870
 show you right away so if you 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.390
 have problems there will be a hotel 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.960
 in the description with a patch to 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.820
 Download 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.310
 so it's always displayed dot eggs 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.450
 who weighs 260 5 and words so that's it 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.740
 file that will fix us all 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.050
 just the few bugs we 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.980
 could possibly have a 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.680
 Once you have downloaded this file 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.940
 you're going to copy it click 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.680
 right copy you will go back in 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.360
 the installation folder of the game here 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.350
 and you the collar is just more 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.640
 right collar so I 'm already going 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.380
 glued it is here 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:24.170
 in fact you will execute it yourself 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:27.730
 double scream on executed or 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.730
 wait while the patch opens 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.580
 then we 'll get to this if that 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.430
 tell you well that this is it helps 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.380
 correct to update the game you 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.740
 leave that as you click 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.540
 install then that's going to take a few 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.080
 small seconds normally wait 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.080
 a little time 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:03.370
 once the installation of the patch is 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.800
 finished you will have two windows 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.419
 internet that will open up more one 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.409
 command window here you will want on 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.830
 a touch any 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:13.719
 and you can do it again but this is 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.610
 present normally there is no more 

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:17.289
 worry you can start your game by 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.909
 double launch double-clicking pardon 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:20.439
 on this icon and you can everything 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:20.949
 just play it and start a 

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:22.599
 career 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:24.759
 so I did not want to say at first but 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:26.620
 that you feared in my opinion you do not 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:28.509
 can not enjoy the online mode 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.560
 just that's quite 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:30.849
 normal is that we cost we crack a 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.430
 day we do not have access to multiplayer 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:35.349
 so here listen to this video touches to 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.759
 coming to an end I'm still going to just 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:37.900
 lancel jo and i will find you in 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:39.460
 the game to prove to you that really 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.560
 everything works perfectly at everything from 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.120
 then we end up in play and you 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.479
 see that it works perfectly 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.370
 well 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:46.719
 I simply double click on 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.539
 the icon so that was written on my 

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:51.759
 office and so I come across some on 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:53.830
 this menu so here is the game works 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:55.060
 alright i'm not going either i do not wanna 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.139
 to play it is not a 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.279
 good gameplay but at least I you 

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:59.249
 proves that it works perfectly 

00:06:57.279 --> 00:07:01.419
 well 

00:06:59.249 --> 00:07:03.610
 so you can create a new 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:04.779
 career and its stars I will not go 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.500
 further but you see that 

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:08.529
