00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.659 

my<00:00:00.659> tortoise<00:00:01.260> hibernates<00:00:01.740> in<00:00:01.860> my<00:00:01.979> garage<00:00:02.159> and

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
my tortoise hibernates in my garage and

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.910 
my tortoise hibernates in my garage and
while<00:00:02.850> he<00:00:03.120> was<00:00:03.330> hibernating<00:00:03.629> this<00:00:04.200> winter<00:00:04.620> we

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
while he was hibernating this winter we

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.210 
while he was hibernating this winter we
did<00:00:05.100> this<00:00:05.250> stone<00:00:05.700> work<00:00:06.029> and<00:00:06.440> he<00:00:07.440> hasn't<00:00:07.830> quite

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
did this stone work and he hasn't quite

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.310 
did this stone work and he hasn't quite
figured<00:00:08.639> out<00:00:08.730> how<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:09.000> negotiate<00:00:09.269> this<00:00:09.929> step

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
figured out how to negotiate this step

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.440 
figured out how to negotiate this step
yet<00:00:10.650> I've<00:00:11.130> seen<00:00:11.370> him<00:00:11.490> over<00:00:11.670> here<00:00:11.880> on<00:00:12.000> his<00:00:12.179> back

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
yet I've seen him over here on his back

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.629 
yet I've seen him over here on his back
a<00:00:12.480> couple<00:00:12.990> times<00:00:13.259> so<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:13.950> want<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.250> build<00:00:14.429> him<00:00:14.549> a

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
a couple times so I want to build him a

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.970 
a couple times so I want to build him a
ramp<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.540> I've<00:00:15.660> got<00:00:15.839> this<00:00:16.049> piece<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.560> maple

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
ramp and I've got this piece of maple

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.470

it's left over from a cabinet and I've
got<00:00:18.630> some<00:00:18.810> three-quarter<00:00:19.350> inch<00:00:19.470> poplar<00:00:19.980> I

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
got some three-quarter inch poplar I

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.759 
got some three-quarter inch poplar I
also<00:00:21.330> want<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.660> be<00:00:21.779> able<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.960> use<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.320> ramp<00:00:22.529> to

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
also want to be able to use the ramp to

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.259 
also want to be able to use the ramp to
help<00:00:22.949> me<00:00:23.039> get<00:00:23.160> my<00:00:23.310> tools<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:23.970> out<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.180> the

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
help me get my tools in and out of the

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.900 
help me get my tools in and out of the
garage<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.410> table<00:00:25.830> saw<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.160> 26<00:00:26.670> inches

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
garage and this table saw it 26 inches

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.770 
garage and this table saw it 26 inches
wide<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.779> widest

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:29.780 
wide is the widest

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.450 
wide is the widest
here's<00:00:30.780> my<00:00:30.990> finished<00:00:31.290> ramp<00:00:31.560> it's<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:32.130> couple

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
here's my finished ramp it's a couple

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.370 
here's my finished ramp it's a couple
triangles<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.180> some<00:00:33.330> stringers<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.110> weighs

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
triangles and some stringers it weighs

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.340 
triangles and some stringers it weighs
about<00:00:34.620> eight<00:00:34.890> pounds<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.870> here's<00:00:36.870> how<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.050> made

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
about eight pounds and here's how I made

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.490 
about eight pounds and here's how I made
it<00:00:38.840> 22<00:00:39.840> by<00:00:39.989> 7<00:00:40.100> that's<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.340> plan<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:42.320> did<00:00:43.320> some

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
it 22 by 7 that's the plan I did some

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.369 
it 22 by 7 that's the plan I did some
quick<00:00:43.710> layout<00:00:44.070> work<00:00:44.340> with<00:00:44.580> pencil<00:00:44.970> and<00:00:45.060> ruler

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
quick layout work with pencil and ruler

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.690 
quick layout work with pencil and ruler
alright<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.800> easy<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.309> three

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
alright so this is easy this is three

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.260 
alright so this is easy this is three
cuts<00:00:47.970> I'll<00:00:48.300> have<00:00:48.540> two<00:00:48.690> triangles<00:00:50.000> this<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.120> my

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
cuts I'll have two triangles this is my

00:00:51.270 --> 00:01:13.590 
cuts I'll have two triangles this is my
setup

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.630 

after<00:01:14.600> I<00:01:14.630> finished<00:01:15.080> my<00:01:15.170> three<00:01:15.770> cuts<00:01:16.070> I<00:01:16.340> took<00:01:16.610> a

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
after I finished my three cuts I took a

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.610 
after I finished my three cuts I took a
look<00:01:16.820> at<00:01:16.970> these<00:01:17.060> two<00:01:17.240> triangles<00:01:17.570> and<00:01:18.020> they

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
look at these two triangles and they

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.250 
look at these two triangles and they
were<00:01:18.680> exactly<00:01:19.370> the<00:01:19.490> same<00:01:19.690> so<00:01:20.690> we're<00:01:20.840> off<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:21.050> a

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
were exactly the same so we're off to a

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.860 
were exactly the same so we're off to a
good<00:01:21.560> start

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.190 

I<00:01:24.430> like<00:01:25.430> working<00:01:25.610> with<00:01:25.820> wood<00:01:26.420> I<00:01:26.450> don't<00:01:26.930> like

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
I like working with wood I don't like

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.950 
I like working with wood I don't like
sawdust<00:01:28.070> so<00:01:28.580> I<00:01:28.910> try<00:01:29.540> and<00:01:29.570> get<00:01:29.690> a<00:01:29.750> tight

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
sawdust so I try and get a tight

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.780 
sawdust so I try and get a tight
connection<00:01:30.230> on<00:01:30.500> everything<00:01:30.920> I'm<00:01:31.340> using<00:01:31.520> some

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
connection on everything I'm using some

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.940 
connection on everything I'm using some
PVC<00:01:32.150> tape<00:01:32.570> and<00:01:32.840> a<00:01:32.930> piece<00:01:33.140> of<00:01:33.260> cardboard<00:01:33.530> tube

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
PVC tape and a piece of cardboard tube

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
PVC tape and a piece of cardboard tube
and<00:01:34.250> my<00:01:34.910> vacuum<00:01:35.120> fits<00:01:35.570> snugly<00:01:36.230> into<00:01:36.350> my<00:01:36.560> saw

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
and my vacuum fits snugly into my saw

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.280 
and my vacuum fits snugly into my saw
and<00:01:37.970> I<00:01:38.090> have<00:01:38.270> one<00:01:38.390> of<00:01:38.480> these<00:01:38.540> outlets<00:01:38.960> that

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
and I have one of these outlets that

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.380 
and I have one of these outlets that
when<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.950> saw<00:01:40.160> powers<00:01:40.550> on<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.850> vacuum<00:01:41.180> power

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
when the saw powers on the vacuum power

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.500 
when the saw powers on the vacuum power
is<00:01:41.540> on<00:01:41.690> and<00:01:42.020> that's<00:01:42.770> my<00:01:43.100> rig<00:01:43.430> I<00:01:43.730> try<00:01:44.450> and

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
is on and that's my rig I try and

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:51.250 
is on and that's my rig I try and
capture<00:01:44.660> all<00:01:44.900> the<00:01:45.140> sawdust<00:01:49.900> what<00:01:50.900> I<00:01:50.930> want<00:01:51.200> to

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
capture all the sawdust what I want to

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.380 
capture all the sawdust what I want to
do<00:01:51.350> now<00:01:51.530> is<00:01:51.740> cut<00:01:51.980> two<00:01:52.190> notches<00:01:52.400> into<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.180> back

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
do now is cut two notches into the back

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.360 
do now is cut two notches into the back
of<00:01:53.600> both<00:01:53.810> triangles<00:01:54.290> and<00:01:54.740> then<00:01:55.010> I'll<00:01:55.130> use

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
of both triangles and then I'll use

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.120 
of both triangles and then I'll use
these<00:01:55.730> two<00:01:56.120> long<00:01:56.390> stringers<00:01:57.080> along<00:01:57.830> with<00:01:58.010> the

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
these two long stringers along with the

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.710 
these two long stringers along with the
two<00:01:58.280> triangles<00:01:58.820> to<00:01:58.910> build<00:01:59.090> a<00:01:59.150> frame<00:01:59.390> for<00:01:59.630> the

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
two triangles to build a frame for the

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:17.110 
two triangles to build a frame for the
ramp<00:02:02.200> set<00:02:03.200> your<00:02:03.350> saw<00:02:03.560> to<00:02:03.620> the<00:02:03.830> correct<00:02:04.100> depth

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
having a sled like this makes it really

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.490 
having a sled like this makes it really
easy<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.790> cut<00:02:21.000> little<00:02:21.150> notches<00:02:21.840> out<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.380> wood

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
easy to cut little notches out of wood

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.080 
easy to cut little notches out of wood
ascribed<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.650> line<00:02:25.830> on<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.160> top<00:02:26.400> stringer<00:02:26.880> at

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
ascribed a line on the top stringer at

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.330 
ascribed a line on the top stringer at
the<00:02:27.240> same<00:02:27.480> angle<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.260> ramp<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.860> then<00:02:29.310> I

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
the same angle of the ramp and then I

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.400 
the same angle of the ramp and then I
use<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.670> protractor<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.570> measure<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:31.020> angle

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.440 

then<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.560> set<00:02:34.770> my<00:02:34.920> table<00:02:35.130> saw<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.880> same<00:02:36.180> angle

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
then I set my table saw that same angle

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:51.830 
then I set my table saw that same angle
and<00:02:36.840> I<00:02:37.080> rip<00:02:37.350> top<00:02:37.740> string

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.240 

all<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.050> corners<00:02:53.410> went<00:02:53.590> together<00:02:53.740> really

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
all the corners went together really

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.490 
all the corners went together really
clean<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:54.940> then<00:02:55.300> you<00:02:55.720> put<00:02:55.930> this<00:02:56.110> piece<00:02:56.320> of

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
clean and then you put this piece of

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.230 
clean and then you put this piece of
plywood<00:02:56.680> on<00:02:57.010> top<00:02:57.990> and<00:02:58.990> there's<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.650> RAM<00:03:00.240> it's

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
plywood on top and there's the RAM it's

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.030 
plywood on top and there's the RAM it's
important<00:03:01.570> to<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:01.810> first<00:03:02.080> corner<00:03:02.380> square<00:03:02.800> I

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
important to the first corner square I

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.940 
important to the first corner square I
have<00:03:03.610> these<00:03:03.820> wooden<00:03:04.720> right<00:03:04.930> angles<00:03:05.380> that<00:03:05.890> I

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
have these wooden right angles that I

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.060 
have these wooden right angles that I
made<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:07.600> then<00:03:07.720> cut<00:03:07.990> in<00:03:08.260> my<00:03:09.180> sled<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.950> they

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
made and then cut in my sled and they

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.520 
made and then cut in my sled and they
have<00:03:12.220> that<00:03:12.400> clamped<00:03:12.820> up<00:03:12.940> right<00:03:13.150> here<00:03:13.440> give<00:03:14.440> me

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
have that clamped up right here give me

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.410 
have that clamped up right here give me
a<00:03:14.560> nice<00:03:14.800> square<00:03:15.160> right<00:03:15.430> angle<00:03:15.760> on<00:03:15.880> that<00:03:16.060> first

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
a nice square right angle on that first

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.960 
a nice square right angle on that first
corner<00:03:16.870> I<00:03:20.070> attach<00:03:21.070> the<00:03:21.310> bottom<00:03:21.459> stringer

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
corner I attach the bottom stringer

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.640 
corner I attach the bottom stringer
first<00:03:22.270> and<00:03:22.510> I<00:03:22.570> put<00:03:22.750> both<00:03:22.959> corners<00:03:23.440> together

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
first and I put both corners together

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.910 
first and I put both corners together
with<00:03:24.100> glue<00:03:24.430> and<00:03:24.730> screws<00:03:25.270> and<00:03:25.660> clamps<00:03:26.320> using<00:03:26.800> my

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
with glue and screws and clamps using my

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.210 
with glue and screws and clamps using my
right<00:03:27.100> angles<00:03:28.440> here's<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:29.590> second<00:03:29.980> corner

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
right angles here's the second corner

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:37.130 
right angles here's the second corner
everything<00:03:31.090> went<00:03:31.270> together<00:03:31.390> really<00:03:31.840> easy<00:03:32.230> I

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.840 

did<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.230> same<00:03:38.440> thing<00:03:38.680> with<00:03:38.830> the<00:03:38.950> top<00:03:39.160> string<00:03:39.520> I

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
did the same thing with the top string I

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.790 
did the same thing with the top string I
use<00:03:40.090> a<00:03:40.120> piece<00:03:40.420> of<00:03:40.600> scrap<00:03:40.870> wood<00:03:41.110> to<00:03:41.170> spread<00:03:41.650> the

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
use a piece of scrap wood to spread the

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.890 
use a piece of scrap wood to spread the
glue<00:03:41.920> and<00:03:42.700> then<00:03:42.820> I<00:03:42.880> just<00:03:43.150> held<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:43.450> stringer

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
glue and then I just held the stringer

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.690 
glue and then I just held the stringer
in<00:03:44.020> place<00:03:44.350> and<00:03:44.620> screwed<00:03:44.950> it<00:03:45.040> in<00:03:45.160> I<00:03:45.340> didn't<00:03:45.610> even

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
in place and screwed it in I didn't even

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.550 
in place and screwed it in I didn't even
clamp<00:03:46.060> it<00:03:46.239> I<00:03:48.450> use<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.630> same<00:03:49.870> process<00:03:50.530> to

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
clamp it I use the same process to

00:03:50.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
clamp it I use the same process to
attach<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.280> maple<00:03:51.640> top<00:03:51.880> panel

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.309 

once<00:04:13.580> the<00:04:13.730> plywood<00:04:14.150> was<00:04:14.299> attached<00:04:14.659> the<00:04:15.140> ranch

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
once the plywood was attached the ranch

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:22.000 
once the plywood was attached the ranch
was<00:04:15.560> really<00:04:15.890> solid<00:04:20.229> so<00:04:21.229> let's<00:04:21.380> check<00:04:21.620> this<00:04:21.769> for

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
was really solid so let's check this for

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:28.210 
was really solid so let's check this for
square<00:04:25.030> here's<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.240> second<00:04:26.630> side<00:04:27.160> this<00:04:28.160> thing

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
square here's the second side this thing

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.260 
square here's the second side this thing
is<00:04:28.490> a<00:04:28.520> square<00:04:28.970> square<00:04:29.419> can<00:04:29.600> be<00:04:29.780> I<00:04:31.000> cut<00:04:32.000> three

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
is a square square can be I cut three

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.150 
is a square square can be I cut three
stringers<00:04:32.660> on<00:04:32.810> the<00:04:32.900> chop<00:04:33.139> saw<00:04:33.470> I<00:04:33.710> figured<00:04:34.070> it

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
stringers on the chop saw I figured it

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.360 
stringers on the chop saw I figured it
was<00:04:34.250> easier<00:04:34.610> than<00:04:34.729> making<00:04:34.940> more<00:04:35.240> triangles

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
was easier than making more triangles

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.890 
was easier than making more triangles
then<00:04:37.370> I<00:04:37.400> screwed<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:37.940> stringers<00:04:38.330> in<00:04:38.510> first

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
then I screwed the stringers in first

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:46.120 
then I screwed the stringers in first
from<00:04:39.169> the<00:04:39.260> sides<00:04:39.530> and<00:04:39.860> then<00:04:40.190> from<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.610> top<00:04:45.130> if

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
from the sides and then from the top if

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.040 
from the sides and then from the top if
you<00:04:46.370> have<00:04:46.400> an<00:04:46.669> application<00:04:47.419> for<00:04:47.660> a<00:04:47.690> really

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
you have an application for a really

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.409 
you have an application for a really
strong<00:04:48.380> really<00:04:48.919> light<00:04:49.130> ramp<00:04:49.520> this<00:04:50.000> might<00:04:50.240> be<00:04:50.389> a

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
strong really light ramp this might be a

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:51.370 
strong really light ramp this might be a
good<00:04:50.690> way<00:04:50.810> to<00:04:50.870> go

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
good way to go

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.400 
good way to go
it<00:04:51.710> fits<00:04:52.039> perfectly<00:04:52.940> I<00:04:52.970> tested<00:04:53.810> it<00:04:53.900> holds<00:04:54.260> my

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
it fits perfectly I tested it holds my

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.100 
it fits perfectly I tested it holds my
weight<00:04:54.620> easily<00:04:54.949> it's<00:04:55.310> very<00:04:55.400> solid<00:04:56.000> I<00:04:56.449> also

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
weight easily it's very solid I also

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.290 
weight easily it's very solid I also
tested<00:04:57.500> it<00:04:57.740> by<00:04:57.860> pulling<00:04:58.130> the<00:04:58.340> table<00:04:58.729> saw<00:04:58.940> of<00:04:59.150> it

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
tested it by pulling the table saw of it

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.240 
tested it by pulling the table saw of it
and<00:04:59.539> it<00:04:59.630> works<00:04:59.870> exactly<00:05:00.470> as<00:05:00.740> you<00:05:01.010> would<00:05:01.100> expect

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
and it works exactly as you would expect

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.500 
and it works exactly as you would expect
and<00:05:01.880> I'm<00:05:02.360> not<00:05:02.539> going<00:05:02.720> to<00:05:02.780> chip<00:05:02.990> my<00:05:03.169> stone<00:05:04.510> yeah

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
and I'm not going to chip my stone yeah

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.060 
and I'm not going to chip my stone yeah
haven't<00:05:05.840> even<00:05:05.930> finished<00:05:06.229> cleaning<00:05:06.770> up<00:05:06.919> the

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
haven't even finished cleaning up the

you figured it out I wish I would have

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:15.100 
you figured it out I wish I would have
got<00:05:11.690> that<00:05:11.780> on<00:05:11.900> video<00:05:11.990> we're<00:05:12.650> getting<00:05:12.860> them<00:05:12.949> all
