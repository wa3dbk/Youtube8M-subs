00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
water before you do this that will make

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.190 
water before you do this that will make
the<00:02:48.040> curls<00:02:48.310> last<00:02:48.580> longer<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.239> I<00:02:49.599> want<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:49.900> say

the curls last longer and I want to say

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.410 
the curls last longer and I want to say
that<00:02:50.920> I<00:02:51.160> just<00:02:51.340> wanted<00:02:51.640> to<00:02:51.670> lose<00:02:51.880> the<00:02:52.060> kill<00:02:52.270> but

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
that I just wanted to lose the kill but

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.320 
that I just wanted to lose the kill but

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
really I just forgot so if you do you

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.470 
really I just forgot so if you do you
can<00:02:55.480> also<00:02:55.660> use<00:02:55.810> curl<00:02:56.500> enhancer<00:02:57.160> if<00:02:57.340> you<00:02:58.270> want

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
to but I just prefer not to use product

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.210 
to but I just prefer not to use product
in<00:03:00.670> my<00:03:00.790> hair<00:03:00.819> before<00:03:01.150> i<00:03:01.360> sleep<00:03:01.630> and<00:03:01.980> then<00:03:02.980> just

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
in my hair before i sleep and then just

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.699

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:12.660 
tying it off lasso section with a hair
time<00:03:05.920> and<00:03:06.790> this<00:03:07.300> is<00:03:07.450> it<00:03:11.190> right<00:03:12.190> so<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.489> next

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
time and this is it right so the next

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.090 
time and this is it right so the next
morning<00:03:12.790> we're<00:03:13.450> all<00:03:13.569> looking<00:03:13.690> great<00:03:13.870> as<00:03:14.440> usual

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100

first<00:03:17.470> hair<00:03:17.890> tie<00:03:18.100> and<00:03:18.400> then<00:03:18.640> unravel<00:03:19.239> that

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
first hair tie and then unravel that

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.330 
first hair tie and then unravel that
first<00:03:20.410> little<00:03:20.530> curl<00:03:20.799> and<00:03:20.950> this<00:03:21.069> is<00:03:21.160> what<00:03:21.310> it

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
first little curl and this is what it

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.039 
first little curl and this is what it
should<00:03:21.430> come<00:03:21.640> out<00:03:21.670> like<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:22.209> nice<00:03:22.810> little

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
should come out like a nice little

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.100 
should come out like a nice little
spring<00:03:23.380> and<00:03:23.590> then<00:03:24.069> you<00:03:24.280> can<00:03:24.519> remove<00:03:24.730> that<00:03:25.360> hair

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
spring and then you can remove that hair

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.100 
spring and then you can remove that hair
tie<00:03:26.319> that<00:03:26.530> held<00:03:26.799> a<00:03:26.950> ponytail<00:03:27.459> and<00:03:27.930> then<00:03:28.930> just

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
tie that held a ponytail and then just

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.509 
tie that held a ponytail and then just
leave<00:03:29.260> it<00:03:29.380> like<00:03:29.500> that<00:03:29.530> for<00:03:29.769> now<00:03:30.100> we'll<00:03:30.340> come

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
leave it like that for now we'll come

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:31.949 
leave it like that for now we'll come
back<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:30.940> it<00:03:31.060> and<00:03:31.180> then<00:03:31.360> loosen<00:03:31.600> all<00:03:31.810> these

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
back to it and then loosen all these

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.229 
back to it and then loosen all these
curls<00:03:32.260> and<00:03:32.500> then<00:03:33.400> just<00:03:33.580> keep<00:03:33.700> on<00:03:33.880> doing<00:03:34.150> that

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
curls and then just keep on doing that

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.759 
curls and then just keep on doing that
until<00:03:34.450> you've<00:03:34.810> taken<00:03:35.019> out<00:03:35.200> all<00:03:35.260> of<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:35.590> hair

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
until you've taken out all of the hair

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:42.870 
until you've taken out all of the hair
ties<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:40.890> you<00:03:41.890> can<00:03:42.069> bash<00:03:42.280> through<00:03:42.549> it<00:03:42.670> if<00:03:42.790> you

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
ties and you can bash through it if you

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.520 
ties and you can bash through it if you
want<00:03:43.120> to<00:03:43.299> but<00:03:43.510> I<00:03:43.540> just<00:03:43.600> prefer<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.200> tighter

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
want to but I just prefer the tighter

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.449 
want to but I just prefer the tighter
look<00:03:44.920> of<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.819> curl<00:03:46.209> together<00:03:46.690> if<00:03:47.440> that<00:03:48.250> makes

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
look of the curl together if that makes

00:03:48.459 --> 00:04:04.020 
look of the curl together if that makes
sense

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.940 

and<00:04:04.120> then<00:04:04.870> know<00:04:05.170> what<00:04:05.350> you<00:04:05.440> want<00:04:05.560> to<00:04:05.650> do<00:04:05.770> is

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
and then know what you want to do is

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.680 
and then know what you want to do is
