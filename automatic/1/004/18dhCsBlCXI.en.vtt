00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.469
 I'll show you in tomb in this video 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.900
 raider in the barrack town the 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.079
 challenge to rest bedded 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.340
 then you have five white sheets in the 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:21.779
 destroying senior city 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.180
 We start again with ours 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.250
 campfire in the very north of the area 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.809
 you have to run down the stairs 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:37.290
 and I've never had that first 

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:38.760
 hang down on the wall and how 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.650
 most designed just noticed 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.470
 i have the challenge or the 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.880
 challenge not activated me 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.930
 It took a while until I got that 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.410
 come out but what you still do 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.660
 got to 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.090
 we have to go to her after the statues 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.550
 you flared with rope file 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.170
 tear down that I have now 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.379
 complete rest video no longer 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.390
 that's what I'm showing now 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.620
 having said that always costs you because of me 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.879
 I already said the recording 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.050
 completely finished that only now 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.920
 one more addendum I now 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.619
 push in between 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.090
 but I ask as I said the same 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.060
 again I wonder why that 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.619
 does not work now that knows 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.619
 I know now you can do it 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.369
 the second book hangs behind the 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.440
 helicopter 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.270
 to do it again completely ums 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.990
 carree pensions apparently I have it 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.820
 tempted by the campfire out to shoot 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.200
 but it was not me I'm in front there 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.990

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.670
 right looks against but not we have to 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.670
 unfortunately God once completely run around 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.220
 if you arrived at the gate that was in 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.250
 the southern part of the barracks city 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:53.050
 leads you just turn 90 degrees 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.429
 to the right and see there where God 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.560

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:57.429

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.770

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:05.500

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.479

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:18.040
 you can just go here again 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:19.239
 down the street and then see the cloth there 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:25.599
 hang up 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:28.950
 a position to take the worst 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.950

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:40.910
