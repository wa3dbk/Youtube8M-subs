00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.310
 we're talking team numbers 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:33.619
 who has in his hands the teacher enrique 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.289
 Meza to another part of the statistics 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.899
 that has the effectiveness in the attack 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:41.000
 effectiveness to 10.9 percent in what

 We are talking about scoring a goal 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.479
 match so it's a lot the size that 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.619
 has the teacher enrique meza also 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.320
 when this team of monarchs morelia 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.970
 Raúl is also in trouble 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.490
 percentage in the problem 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.470
 the permanence in the maximum circuit that 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.130
 It is the primary mission team

 Monarchs Morelia stay at the maximum 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.850
 circuit because it's a team that 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.360
 got in trouble 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.450
 they neglected the team and sold the 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.490
 better players reinforced the atlas 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.770
 as we all already know and now 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.200
 monarchs have these problems some 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.920
 they came back to reinforce this team and 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.410
