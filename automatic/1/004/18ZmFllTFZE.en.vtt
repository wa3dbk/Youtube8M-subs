the current generation CTS is this
longer<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.289> lower<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.800> leaner<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.279> lighter

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
longer and lower the leaner and lighter

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.540 
longer and lower the leaner and lighter
it<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.330> being<00:00:24.570> built<00:00:24.810> on<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.230> new<00:00:25.650> rear-wheel

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
it is being built on a new rear-wheel

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.929 
it is being built on a new rear-wheel
drive

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
drive

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.929 
drive
lightweight<00:00:27.630> architecture<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.310> available

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
lightweight architecture it is available

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.420 
lightweight architecture it is available
with<00:00:30.119> all-wheel<00:00:30.390> drive<00:00:30.869> specific<00:00:31.380> events<00:00:31.830> and

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
with all-wheel drive specific events and

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.630

is<00:00:32.790> four<00:00:33.390> inches<00:00:33.750> longer<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.440> vicar<00:00:34.770> jet<00:00:35.190> one

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
is four inches longer the vicar jet one

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.310 
is four inches longer the vicar jet one
inch<00:00:35.820> lower<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.630> believe<00:00:37.079> it's<00:00:38.120> 250<00:00:39.120> come<00:00:39.390> later

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
inch lower I believe it's 250 come later

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.920 
inch lower I believe it's 250 come later
so<00:00:40.829> like<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.670> said<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:42.090> new<00:00:42.270> light<00:00:42.510> weight

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
so like I said that new light weight

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.060 
so like I said that new light weight
through<00:00:43.200> your<00:00:43.230> wheels<00:00:43.559> right<00:00:43.890> other
