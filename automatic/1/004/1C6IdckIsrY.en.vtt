approximately how much length I achieve
maybe<00:01:37.040> my<00:01:38.040> hair<00:01:38.250> doesn't<00:01:38.430> grow<00:01:38.670> quite<00:01:39.090> hot

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
maybe my hair doesn't grow quite hot

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.999 
maybe my hair doesn't grow quite hot
quite<00:01:39.810> like<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.140> doesn't<00:01:40.380> grow<00:01:40.470> half<00:01:40.680> an<00:01:40.860> inch

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
quite like it doesn't grow half an inch

a<00:01:41.100> month<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.420> little<00:01:42.659> less<00:01:42.930> than<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.470> um<00:01:44.250> I

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
a month so a little less than that um I

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.280

know if you can see a difference I

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.300 
know if you can see a difference I
initially<00:05:04.780> did<00:05:04.930> not<00:05:05.080> see<00:05:05.260> any<00:05:05.440> difference<00:05:05.919> but

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
initially did not see any difference but

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.930 
initially did not see any difference but
I<00:05:06.580> do<00:05:06.639> notice<00:05:07.000> that<00:05:07.150> in<00:05:07.600> previous<00:05:08.169> pictures

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
I do notice that in previous pictures

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.940 
I do notice that in previous pictures
the<00:05:09.940> top<00:05:10.240> does<00:05:10.510> not<00:05:10.660> lay<00:05:10.840> down<00:05:11.020> as<00:05:11.440> well

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
the top does not lay down as well

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.730 
the top does not lay down as well
it<00:05:12.100> kind<00:05:13.000> of<00:05:13.090> just<00:05:13.150> cuz<00:05:13.900> it<00:05:14.020> was<00:05:14.260> shorter<00:05:14.650> of

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
it kind of just cuz it was shorter of

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.650 
it kind of just cuz it was shorter of
course<00:05:15.010> and<00:05:15.520> so<00:05:15.910> the<00:05:16.030> talk<00:05:16.210> was<00:05:16.389> getting

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
course and so the talk was getting

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.320 
course and so the talk was getting
longer<00:05:16.930> and<00:05:17.350> it's<00:05:17.500> laying<00:05:17.740> down<00:05:18.330> differently

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
longer and it's laying down differently

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.950 
longer and it's laying down differently
oh<00:05:19.620> man<00:05:21.240> I'm<00:05:22.240> loving<00:05:22.570> No

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
okay so this is new I twisted my hair I

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.560 
okay so this is new I twisted my hair I
did<00:05:26.590> not<00:05:26.770> like<00:05:26.979> the<00:05:27.400> twists<00:05:27.910> I<00:05:28.060> mean<00:05:28.300> they<00:05:28.419> look

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
did not like the twists I mean they look

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
did not like the twists I mean they look
they<00:05:28.900> look<00:05:29.080> good<00:05:29.380> but<00:05:29.550> my<00:05:30.550> sides<00:05:31.270> are<00:05:31.750> space

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
they look good but my sides are space

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.129 
they look good but my sides are space
here<00:05:32.950> just<00:05:32.979> naturally<00:05:33.970> space<00:05:34.300> year<00:05:34.600> and<00:05:34.870> less

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
here just naturally space year and less

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:37.710 
here just naturally space year and less
thick<00:05:35.500> than<00:05:35.740> the<00:05:35.860> rest<00:05:36.039> of<00:05:36.160> my<00:05:36.340> hair<00:05:36.370> and<00:05:36.820> so<00:05:37.360> it

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
thick than the rest of my hair and so it

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.779 
thick than the rest of my hair and so it
looks<00:05:37.960> like<00:05:38.080> I<00:05:38.139> don't<00:05:38.200> have<00:05:38.320> as<00:05:38.530> much<00:05:38.860> twists

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:39.789 
looks like I don't have as much twists

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:41.370 
looks like I don't have as much twists
on<00:05:40.030> the<00:05:40.120> side<00:05:40.300> outside<00:05:40.690> of<00:05:40.840> the<00:05:40.900> sides<00:05:41.110> of<00:05:41.260> my

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
on the side outside of the sides of my

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.110 
on the side outside of the sides of my
head<00:05:41.410> and<00:05:41.830> the<00:05:42.160> rest<00:05:42.340> of<00:05:42.460> my<00:05:42.580> hair<00:05:42.610> is<00:05:42.880> not<00:05:43.000> as

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
head and the rest of my hair is not as

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.839 
head and the rest of my hair is not as
thick<00:05:43.389> so<00:05:44.229> anyway<00:05:44.620> I<00:05:44.650> took<00:05:45.070> the<00:05:45.220> twists<00:05:45.550> out<00:05:45.669> I

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.849 
thick so anyway I took the twists out I

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:47.490 
thick so anyway I took the twists out I
wear<00:05:46.060> them<00:05:46.240> for<00:05:46.270> about<00:05:46.660> three<00:05:46.900> days<00:05:47.020> took<00:05:47.289> them

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
wear them for about three days took them

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.950 
wear them for about three days took them
out<00:05:47.680> and<00:05:47.950> I<00:05:48.789> was<00:05:48.910> wearing<00:05:49.120> two<00:05:49.180> twists<00:05:49.419> out<00:05:49.630> but

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
out and I was wearing two twists out but

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.170 
out and I was wearing two twists out but
the<00:05:50.050> thing<00:05:50.289> is<00:05:50.320> that<00:05:50.830> when<00:05:51.430> I<00:05:51.460> wear<00:05:51.639> twist<00:05:51.940> outs

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
the thing is that when I wear twist outs

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.540 
the thing is that when I wear twist outs
I<00:05:52.479> tend<00:05:52.720> to<00:05:52.780> get<00:05:52.960> a<00:05:53.020> lot<00:05:53.320> of<00:05:53.620> one<00:05:54.070> strand<00:05:54.310> knots

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
I tend to get a lot of one strand knots

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.060 
I tend to get a lot of one strand knots
especially<00:05:55.150> once<00:05:55.330> it<00:05:55.479> starts<00:05:55.750> shrinking<00:05:56.710> up

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
especially once it starts shrinking up

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.969 
especially once it starts shrinking up
on<00:05:57.250> itself<00:05:57.580> curling<00:05:58.419> up<00:05:58.539> on<00:05:58.690> itself<00:05:59.020> because<00:05:59.770> I

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 
on itself curling up on itself because I

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:02.310 
on itself curling up on itself because I
would<00:06:00.190> seem<00:06:00.580> it<00:06:00.789> after<00:06:01.180> every<00:06:01.810> morning<00:06:02.110> I<00:06:02.200> was

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
would seem it after every morning I was

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.839 
would seem it after every morning I was
going<00:06:02.530> to<00:06:02.680> shower<00:06:02.860> and<00:06:03.010> steam<00:06:03.280> my<00:06:03.460> hair<00:06:03.669> just

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:03.849 
going to shower and steam my hair just

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:05.640 
going to shower and steam my hair just
to<00:06:03.910> get<00:06:04.030> some<00:06:04.180> moisture<00:06:04.360> in<00:06:04.690> and<00:06:04.900> my<00:06:05.470> hair

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
to get some moisture in and my hair

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.560 
to get some moisture in and my hair
would<00:06:05.740> naturally<00:06:06.130> curl<00:06:06.370> up<00:06:06.610> and<00:06:06.910> he<00:06:06.970> was<00:06:07.450> sure

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
would naturally curl up and he was sure

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.550 
would naturally curl up and he was sure
not<00:06:07.810> that<00:06:08.050> ever<00:06:08.289> so<00:06:09.070> hey<00:06:09.220> hey<00:06:09.400> why<00:06:09.760> don't<00:06:09.820> I

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
not that ever so hey hey why don't I

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.730 
not that ever so hey hey why don't I
braid<00:06:11.560> it<00:06:12.010> like<00:06:13.110> it<00:06:14.110> looked<00:06:14.349> like<00:06:14.470> if<00:06:14.620> I

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
braid it like it looked like if I

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.990 
braid it like it looked like if I
