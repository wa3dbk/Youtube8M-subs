you're fishing along the rivers so you

but you can increase the chance of

catching cold salmon by paying attention

catching cold salmon by paying attention
to<00:03:28.530> several<00:03:28.770> things<00:03:29.130> so<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.880> first<00:03:30.120> one<00:03:30.300> will

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
to several things so the first one will

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.990 
to several things so the first one will
be<00:03:30.450> tied<00:03:30.840> you<00:03:31.800> want<00:03:32.010> to<00:03:32.100> time<00:03:32.550> your<00:03:32.730> type

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
be tied you want to time your type

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.390 
be tied you want to time your type
correctly<00:03:33.270> so<00:03:34.080> salmon<00:03:34.680> will<00:03:34.800> come<00:03:34.980> into<00:03:35.160> the

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
correctly so salmon will come into the

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.640 
correctly so salmon will come into the

river with the incoming tide so if

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.380

you're<00:03:37.800> fishing<00:03:38.160> two<00:03:38.520> or<00:03:38.670> three<00:03:38.850> hours<00:03:39.060> before

the<00:03:40.080> tide<00:03:40.290> Peaks<00:03:40.680> as<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.550> tie<00:03:41.760> starts<00:03:42.090> coming

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
the tide Peaks as the tie starts coming

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.290 
the tide Peaks as the tie starts coming
in<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.770> until<00:03:43.770> the<00:03:43.920> tides<00:03:44.220> peaking<00:03:44.790> that's

feet<00:03:58.320> that<00:03:59.190> can<00:03:59.220> be<00:03:59.459> pretty<00:03:59.700> good<00:03:59.940> because<00:04:00.239> all

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
feet that can be pretty good because all

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.210 
feet that can be pretty good because all
the<00:04:00.540> times<00:04:00.690> of<00:04:00.870> fish<00:04:01.050> will<00:04:01.200> coming<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:01.770> it

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
the times of fish will coming and it

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.310 
the times of fish will coming and it
will<00:04:02.310> also<00:04:02.489> retreat<00:04:03.360> a<00:04:03.390> little<00:04:03.510> bit<00:04:03.870> going

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
will also retreat a little bit going

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.160 
will also retreat a little bit going
downstream<00:04:04.950> so<00:04:05.580> it<00:04:06.209> really<00:04:06.540> depends<00:04:06.900> on<00:04:07.020> the

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
downstream so it really depends on the

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.500 
downstream so it really depends on the
location<00:04:07.650> some<00:04:08.160> places<00:04:08.790> are<00:04:09.060> really<00:04:09.209> good

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
location some places are really good

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.210 
location some places are really good
when<00:04:09.660> it's<00:04:09.870> high<00:04:10.019> tide<00:04:10.290> other<00:04:10.709> place<00:04:11.070> is

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
when it's high tide other place is

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.310 
when it's high tide other place is
really<00:04:11.459> good<00:04:11.640> when<00:04:11.820> it's<00:04:11.970> low<00:04:12.180> tide<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:12.720> the

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
really good when it's low tide and the

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.900 
really good when it's low tide and the
only<00:04:13.470> way<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.650> find<00:04:13.950> out<00:04:14.100> out<00:04:14.340> is<00:04:14.550> the

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
only way to find out out is the

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.320 
only way to find out out is the
Kettleman<00:04:15.390> fish<00:04:15.660> and<00:04:16.760> fish<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:17.910> same<00:04:18.030> spot

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
Kettleman fish and fish the same spot

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.810 
Kettleman fish and fish the same spot
again<00:04:18.660> again<00:04:19.019> record<00:04:19.890> down<00:04:20.040> your<00:04:20.310> results<00:04:20.730> in

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
again again record down your results in

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.150 
again again record down your results in
your<00:04:20.910> fishing<00:04:21.359> diary<00:04:21.660> so<00:04:22.320> you<00:04:22.410> can<00:04:22.530> go<00:04:22.680> back<00:04:22.919> in

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
your fishing diary so you can go back in

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.980 
your fishing diary so you can go back in
the<00:04:23.250> following<00:04:23.640> year<00:04:23.910> and<00:04:24.120> look<00:04:24.330> at<00:04:24.479> it<00:04:24.630> again

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
the following year and look at it again

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.350 
the following year and look at it again
and<00:04:25.200> see<00:04:25.860> how<00:04:25.890> how<00:04:26.490> it<00:04:26.640> is<00:04:26.789> at

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
and see how how it is at

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.619 
and see how how it is at
at<00:04:27.650> given<00:04:28.650> tide<00:04:29.270> so<00:04:30.270> tight<00:04:30.569> is<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.960> first<00:04:31.259> one

00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:32.629 
at given tide so tight is the first one

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:35.390 
at given tide so tight is the first one
also<00:04:33.629> the<00:04:33.900> time<00:04:34.080> of<00:04:34.229> the<00:04:34.349> season<00:04:34.560> so<00:04:35.099> like<00:04:35.370> I

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
also the time of the season so like I

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.189 
also the time of the season so like I
say<00:04:35.639> the<00:04:35.819> officially<00:04:36.360> opens<00:04:36.659> in<00:04:36.810> early

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
say the officially opens in early

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.830 
say the officially opens in early
October<00:04:37.710> and<00:04:38.060> usually<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.210> first<00:04:39.539> three

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
October and usually the first three

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.270 
October and usually the first three
weeks<00:04:40.020> October<00:04:40.530> is<00:04:40.620> best

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
weeks October is best

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.059 
weeks October is best
I<00:04:41.310> find<00:04:41.879> that<00:04:42.030> mid<00:04:42.360> October<00:04:42.719> is<00:04:42.870> it's<00:04:43.469> probably

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069 
I find that mid October is it's probably

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:47.240 
I find that mid October is it's probably
the<00:04:44.870> period<00:04:45.870> that<00:04:45.990> when<00:04:46.409> the<00:04:46.530> fishery<00:04:46.889> Peaks

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
the period that when the fishery Peaks

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.619 
the period that when the fishery Peaks
you<00:04:47.460> can<00:04:47.610> catch<00:04:47.819> them<00:04:48.000> in<00:04:48.120> November<00:04:48.240> as<00:04:48.599> well

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:48.629 
you can catch them in November as well

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:51.529 
you can catch them in November as well
but<00:04:49.409> generally<00:04:49.590> that<00:04:49.979> by<00:04:50.789> laying<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:51.210> fishery

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539

now<00:04:53.669> some<00:04:53.969> fishing<00:04:54.300> spots<00:04:54.569> are<00:04:54.689> better<00:04:54.870> than

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
now some fishing spots are better than

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.020 
now some fishing spots are better than
others<00:04:55.710> at<00:04:55.949> least<00:04:56.250> cold<00:04:56.520> salmon<00:04:56.759> are

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:26.129 
fish a little bit I'll make them stop

fish a little bit I'll make them stop
going<00:05:27.090> up<00:05:27.240> and<00:05:27.479> they<00:05:27.539> will<00:05:27.659> stay<00:05:27.840> a<00:05:27.870> little<00:05:27.990> bit

going up and they will stay a little bit
and<00:05:28.590> that<00:05:29.129> kind<00:05:29.340> of<00:05:29.370> increase<00:05:29.639> the<00:05:29.849> chance<00:05:30.150> of

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
and that kind of increase the chance of

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.510 
and that kind of increase the chance of
catching<00:05:30.509> them<00:05:30.840> sometimes<00:05:31.349> so<00:05:32.009> look<00:05:32.250> for

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
catching them sometimes so look for

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.610 
catching them sometimes so look for
places<00:05:33.180> where<00:05:33.509> the<00:05:33.690> river<00:05:33.900> kind<00:05:34.139> of<00:05:34.229> bends<00:05:34.500> a

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
places where the river kind of bends a

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.070 
places where the river kind of bends a
little<00:05:34.680> bit<00:05:35.060> so<00:05:36.060> they'll<00:05:36.270> have<00:05:36.300> to<00:05:36.509> change<00:05:36.930> the

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
little bit so they'll have to change the

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.070 
little bit so they'll have to change the
direction<00:05:37.669> look<00:05:38.669> for<00:05:38.849> piers<00:05:39.180> look<00:05:39.449> for<00:05:39.599> pylons

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
direction look for piers look for pylons

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.309 
direction look for piers look for pylons
as<00:05:40.229> I<00:05:40.259> said<00:05:40.590> look<00:05:41.250> for<00:05:41.490> rocks<00:05:42.300> in<00:05:42.569> the<00:05:42.659> water<00:05:42.900> so

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:43.319 
as I said look for rocks in the water so

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:45.550 
as I said look for rocks in the water so
if<00:05:43.500> you<00:05:43.650> come<00:05:43.860> down<00:05:43.889> during<00:05:44.460> low<00:05:44.639> tide<00:05:44.669> and

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
if you come down during low tide and

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
just start retrieving I don't want to be

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.219 
just start retrieving I don't want to be
retrieving<00:06:23.849> like<00:06:24.029> really<00:06:24.449> fast<00:06:24.690> you<00:06:24.990> want<00:06:25.199> to

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:25.229 
retrieving like really fast you want to

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:28.430 
retrieving like really fast you want to
be<00:06:25.379> doing<00:06:25.680> a<00:06:25.949> pretty<00:06:26.819> gradual<00:06:27.330> retrieve<00:06:27.810> but

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
be doing a pretty gradual retrieve but

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.290 
be doing a pretty gradual retrieve but
not<00:06:28.620> too<00:06:28.860> slow<00:06:29.039> so<00:06:29.159> that<00:06:29.580> it's<00:06:29.699> not<00:06:29.879> dragging

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
not too slow so that it's not dragging

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.300 
not too slow so that it's not dragging
along<00:06:30.690> boardings<00:06:31.199> so<00:06:31.560> otherwise<00:06:32.069> would<00:06:32.279> be

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
along boardings so otherwise would be

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.570 
along boardings so otherwise would be
snagging<00:06:32.879> up<00:06:33.409> just<00:06:34.409> fairly<00:06:34.800> slow<00:06:35.069> enough<00:06:35.370> for

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
snagging up just fairly slow enough for

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.270 
snagging up just fairly slow enough for
the<00:06:35.669> fish<00:06:35.849> to<00:06:35.880> chase

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.390 

and<00:06:39.320> have<00:06:40.320> your<00:06:40.410> fishing<00:06:40.890> rod<00:06:41.040> point

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 
and have your fishing rod point

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.370 
and have your fishing rod point
downwards<00:06:42.120> so<00:06:42.480> we<00:06:42.600> have<00:06:42.750> enough<00:06:42.990> moon<00:06:43.230> to

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 
downwards so we have enough moon to

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.940 
downwards so we have enough moon to
strike<00:06:43.710> when<00:06:44.310> the<00:06:44.520> fish<00:06:44.730> does<00:06:45.330> bite<00:06:45.600> and

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:45.950 
strike when the fish does bite and

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.560 
strike when the fish does bite and
always<00:06:46.950> keep<00:06:47.160> that<00:06:47.340> little<00:06:47.520> in<00:06:47.730> the<00:06:47.850> water<00:06:48.090> all

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:48.570 
always keep that little in the water all

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.170 
always keep that little in the water all
the<00:06:48.630> way<00:06:48.960> to<00:06:49.020> shore<00:06:49.380> because<00:06:50.160> as<00:06:50.340> I<00:06:50.430> say<00:06:50.670> the

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 
the way to shore because as I say the

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.240 
the way to shore because as I say the
fish<00:06:51.450> can<00:06:51.750> be<00:06:51.930> chasing<00:06:52.380> all<00:06:52.530> the<00:06:52.620> way<00:06:52.770> in<00:06:52.980> up

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250 
fish can be chasing all the way in up

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.370 
fish can be chasing all the way in up
and<00:06:53.970> they<00:06:54.510> sometimes<00:06:54.990> I<00:06:55.080> don't<00:06:55.170> actually

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 
and they sometimes I don't actually

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.710

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 
commit to Lou until it gets very close

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.540

to shore so keep your low in the water
and<00:06:59.820> keep<00:06:59.970> them<00:07:00.120> out<00:07:00.210> when<00:07:00.390> your<00:07:00.480> lures<00:07:00.780> well

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 
and keep them out when your lures well

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.360 
and keep them out when your lures well
because<00:07:01.290> all<00:07:01.410> the<00:07:01.500> time<00:07:01.590> you<00:07:01.650> can<00:07:01.860> see<00:07:02.310> the
