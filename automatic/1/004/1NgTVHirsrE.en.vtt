be the happier that cell is because as a

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.869 
be the happier that cell is because as a

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
volume ratio gets really big we're gonna

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.049 
volume ratio gets really big we're gonna
do<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> math<00:00:48.629> problem<00:00:48.660> together<00:00:49.020> ready<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:50.059> would

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
do a math problem together ready I would

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.310 
do a math problem together ready I would
go<00:00:51.180> through<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.539> with<00:00:51.719> me<00:00:51.870> if<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.050> were<00:00:52.199> you

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
go through this with me if I were you

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.080 
go through this with me if I were you
okay<00:00:55.219> what<00:00:56.219> we're<00:00:56.340> gonna<00:00:56.399> do<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.850> we're<00:00:57.030> gonna

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
okay what we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.369 
okay what we're gonna do is we're gonna
imagine<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.809> cell<00:00:58.770> that's<00:00:58.980> shaped<00:00:59.219> like<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.399> cube

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
imagine a cell that's shaped like a cube

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.510 
imagine a cell that's shaped like a cube
okay<00:01:01.379> because<00:01:01.559> cubes<00:01:01.980> are<00:01:02.129> easy<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.430> do

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
okay because cubes are easy to do

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.009 
okay because cubes are easy to do
surface<00:01:02.820> area<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.030> volume<00:01:03.090> measurements

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
surface area and volume measurements

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.090 
surface area and volume measurements
with<00:01:05.720> so<00:01:06.720> here's<00:01:06.960> our<00:01:07.049> original<00:01:07.200> cube<00:01:07.770> and

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
with so here's our original cube and

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.070 
with so here's our original cube and
this<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> cell<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.510> just<00:01:09.659> happens<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.930> be<00:01:10.020> a

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
this is a cell it just happens to be a

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.690 
this is a cell it just happens to be a
cube<00:01:10.409> shaped<00:01:10.680> cell<00:01:14.090> is<00:01:15.090> what<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> thing<00:01:15.600> oh<00:01:16.700> yeah

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
cube shaped cell is what a thing oh yeah

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.190 
cube shaped cell is what a thing oh yeah
you've<00:01:18.000> got<00:01:18.210> you've<00:01:18.450> got<00:01:18.479> cells<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.080> are

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
you've got you've got cells that are

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.539 
you've got you've got cells that are
called<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:20.150> cuboidal<00:01:21.150> epithelial<00:01:21.840> cells

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
called the cuboidal epithelial cells

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.649 
called the cuboidal epithelial cells
they're<00:01:23.549> shaped<00:01:23.759> like<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:26.390> relaxed<00:01:27.390> they're

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
they're shaped like you relaxed they're

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.190 
they're shaped like you relaxed they're
shaped<00:01:27.840> like<00:01:27.960> cubes<00:01:29.900> imagine<00:01:30.900> if<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.049> will

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
shaped like cubes imagine if you will

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.100 
shaped like cubes imagine if you will
we've<00:01:31.439> got<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.890> box<00:01:32.220> shaped<00:01:32.520> cell<00:01:32.880> okay<00:01:33.840> and

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
we've got this box shaped cell okay and

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.039 
we've got this box shaped cell okay and
this<00:01:34.770> box<00:01:35.009> safe<00:01:35.250> cell<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:38.810> let's<00:01:39.810> say<00:01:39.990> two

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
this box safe cell is let's say two

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:47.139 
this box safe cell is let's say two
units<00:01:40.790> by<00:01:42.439> two<00:01:43.439> units<00:01:44.930> by<00:01:45.930> two<00:01:46.350> units<00:01:46.619> tall

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
units by two units by two units tall

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:53.940 
units by two units by two units tall
it's<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.299> true<00:01:48.540> cube

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.350 

which<00:01:54.950> would<00:01:55.100> mean<00:01:55.190> that<00:01:55.250> on<00:01:55.610> this<00:01:55.880> cell<00:01:56.120> if

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
which would mean that on this cell if

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.810 
which would mean that on this cell if
I'm<00:01:56.510> if<00:01:56.900> I'm<00:01:57.160> let's<00:01:58.160> say<00:01:58.280> we<00:01:58.400> get<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:58.610> blood

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
I'm if I'm let's say we get the blood

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.220 
I'm if I'm let's say we get the blood
going<00:01:58.850> by<00:01:59.240> here<00:01:59.540> there's<00:01:59.690> a<00:01:59.750> blood<00:01:59.930> vessel

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
going by here there's a blood vessel

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.930 
going by here there's a blood vessel
that<00:02:00.260> cruises<00:02:00.920> by<00:02:01.010> the<00:02:01.070> cell<00:02:01.370> and<00:02:01.550> next<00:02:01.790> door

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
that cruises by the cell and next door

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.190 
that cruises by the cell and next door
to<00:02:02.060> this<00:02:02.150> cell<00:02:02.360> it<00:02:02.450> would<00:02:02.540> have<00:02:02.690> other<00:02:02.900> cell

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
to this cell it would have other cell

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.200 
to this cell it would have other cell
neighbors<00:02:03.560> on<00:02:03.800> top<00:02:04.430> of<00:02:04.610> it<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:04.790> beside<00:02:05.090> them

neighbors on top of it and beside them

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.670 
neighbors on top of it and beside them
whatever<00:02:05.390> but<00:02:05.660> at<00:02:05.810> least<00:02:05.960> one<00:02:06.200> surface<00:02:06.560> would

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
whatever but at least one surface would

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.620 
whatever but at least one surface would
be<00:02:06.740> exposed<00:02:07.220> to<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.430> blood<00:02:07.640> so<00:02:08.180> here's<00:02:08.390> blood

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
be exposed to the blood so here's blood

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.140 
be exposed to the blood so here's blood

the<00:02:36.920> point<00:02:37.880> I'm<00:02:37.940> trying<00:02:38.000> to<00:02:38.180> make<00:02:38.270> here<00:02:38.570> is

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
the point I'm trying to make here is

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.810 
the point I'm trying to make here is
that<00:02:39.050> this<00:02:39.410> little<00:02:39.590> cube<00:02:39.830> shaped<00:02:40.040> cell<00:02:40.250> wants

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
that this little cube shaped cell wants

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.580 
that this little cube shaped cell wants
to<00:02:41.000> have<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.180> lot<00:02:41.330> of<00:02:41.360> its<00:02:41.570> surface<00:02:41.990> exposed<00:02:42.470> to

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
to have a lot of its surface exposed to

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.840 
to have a lot of its surface exposed to
the<00:02:42.680> blood<00:02:42.890> because<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.250> can<00:02:43.340> move<00:02:43.459> stuff<00:02:43.670> in

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
the blood because it can move stuff in

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.520 
the blood because it can move stuff in
from<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.510> blood<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:44.870> move<00:02:45.020> stuff<00:02:45.200> back<00:02:45.350> out

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
from the blood and move stuff back out

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.440 
from the blood and move stuff back out
to<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:45.950> blood<00:02:46.130> if<00:02:46.370> it's<00:02:46.520> got<00:02:46.670> lots<00:02:46.880> of<00:02:47.000> surface

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
to the blood if it's got lots of surface

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.870 
to the blood if it's got lots of surface
exposed<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.200> blood<00:02:48.640> that's<00:02:49.640> why<00:02:49.820> this

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
exposed to the blood that's why this

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.550 
exposed to the blood that's why this
whole<00:02:50.090> surface<00:02:50.390> area<00:02:50.630> business<00:02:51.020> is<00:02:51.140> important

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
whole surface area business is important

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.140 
whole surface area business is important
to<00:02:51.620> cells<00:02:51.860> all<00:02:52.760> right

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
to cells all right

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.810 
to cells all right
so<00:02:53.660> watch<00:02:53.950> what's<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.070> cell<00:02:55.280> want<00:02:55.490> again<00:02:55.700> as

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
so watch what's the cell want again as

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.240 
so watch what's the cell want again as
far<00:02:55.970> as<00:02:56.060> surface<00:02:56.269> area<00:02:56.420> to<00:02:56.480> volume<00:02:56.570> ratio<00:02:56.780> goes

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
far as surface area to volume ratio goes

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.780 
far as surface area to volume ratio goes
they<00:02:58.250> want<00:02:58.280> surface<00:02:58.760> area<00:02:58.910> to<00:02:58.970> volume<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.600> be

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
they want surface area to volume to be

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.680 
they want surface area to volume to be
it<00:03:01.790> wants<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.060> surface<00:03:02.360> area<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.600> volume

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
it wants the surface area to volume

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.979 
it wants the surface area to volume
ratio<00:03:02.930> to<00:03:03.290> be<00:03:03.350> very<00:03:03.650> high<00:03:04.580> so<00:03:05.540> let's<00:03:05.570> take<00:03:05.959> a

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
ratio to be very high so let's take a

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.320 
ratio to be very high so let's take a
look<00:03:06.170> here<00:03:06.440> first<00:03:07.370> let's<00:03:07.610> calculate<00:03:07.760> surface

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
look here first let's calculate surface

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.270 
look here first let's calculate surface
area<00:03:08.570> ready<00:03:09.140> follow-along<00:03:09.620> do<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.130> math

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
area ready follow-along do the math

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
area ready follow-along do the math
because<00:03:10.400> I'm<00:03:10.550> gonna<00:03:10.670> ask<00:03:10.850> you<00:03:11.000> to<00:03:11.060> do<00:03:11.120> it<00:03:11.209> on<00:03:11.239> a

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
because I'm gonna ask you to do it on a

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:17.699 
because I'm gonna ask you to do it on a
test<00:03:12.580> surface<00:03:13.580> area<00:03:14.350> equals<00:03:15.350> length<00:03:15.760> by<00:03:16.760> width

24 units is the surface area what's the
volume<00:03:50.330> of<00:03:51.100> this<00:03:52.100> box<00:03:52.370> that<00:03:52.610> we<00:03:52.730> just<00:03:52.940> drew

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
volume of this box that we just drew

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.070 
volume of this box that we just drew
yeah<00:03:55.340> it's<00:03:55.459> gonna<00:03:55.549> be<00:03:55.640> two<00:03:55.850> lengths<00:03:56.330> no<00:03:56.840> wait<00:03:57.019> a

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
yeah it's gonna be two lengths no wait a

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.780 
yeah it's gonna be two lengths no wait a
minute<00:03:57.260> I'll<00:03:57.350> did<00:03:57.590> it<00:03:57.769> it<00:03:58.160> didn't<00:03:58.430> let's<00:03:58.670> not

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
minute I'll did it it didn't let's not

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.170 
minute I'll did it it didn't let's not
do<00:03:58.880> that

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
do that

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:06.400 
do that
it's<00:03:59.299> length<00:03:59.600> by<00:04:00.560> width<00:04:02.800> by<00:04:03.800> height

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.650 

okay<00:04:07.410> so<00:04:08.130> now<00:04:08.190> I<00:04:08.250> fill<00:04:08.460> in<00:04:08.550> what<00:04:08.670> I<00:04:08.700> know<00:04:08.819> length

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
okay so now I fill in what I know length

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.170 
okay so now I fill in what I know length
is<00:04:09.810> two<00:04:10.050> by<00:04:10.590> width<00:04:10.830> is<00:04:11.040> two<00:04:12.050> by<00:04:13.050> height<00:04:13.410> is<00:04:13.680> 2<00:04:14.400> 2

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
is two by width is two by height is 2 2

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.500 
is two by width is two by height is 2 2
by<00:04:15.300> 2<00:04:15.360> is<00:04:16.100> 4<00:04:17.100> by<00:04:17.280> 2<00:04:17.340> is<00:04:17.790> 8<00:04:18.720> so<00:04:20.030> now<00:04:21.030> if<00:04:21.180> I<00:04:21.239> want<00:04:21.450> to

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
by 2 is 4 by 2 is 8 so now if I want to

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.300 
by 2 is 4 by 2 is 8 so now if I want to
figure<00:04:21.660> out<00:04:21.780> surface<00:04:22.320> area<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.590> volume<00:04:22.620> ratio

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
figure out surface area to volume ratio

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.840 
figure out surface area to volume ratio
I<00:04:23.640> do<00:04:24.030> this<00:04:25.340> surface<00:04:26.340> area<00:04:28.280> by<00:04:29.280> familiar<00:04:29.700> with

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
I do this surface area by familiar with

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.080 
I do this surface area by familiar with
this<00:04:30.770> surface<00:04:31.770> area<00:04:31.919> and<00:04:32.310> then<00:04:32.430> a<00:04:32.460> colon<00:04:32.790> and

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
this surface area and then a colon and

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.270 
this surface area and then a colon and
then<00:04:33.380> volume<00:04:34.380> would<00:04:34.650> be<00:04:34.710> surface<00:04:35.070> area<00:04:35.220> to

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
then volume would be surface area to

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.740 
then volume would be surface area to
volume<00:04:35.340> ratio<00:04:35.850> is<00:04:35.970> how<00:04:36.060> math<00:04:36.270> nerds<00:04:36.570> would

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
volume ratio is how math nerds would

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.790 
volume ratio is how math nerds would
look<00:04:37.080> at<00:04:37.169> that<00:04:37.910> okay<00:04:39.530> surface<00:04:40.530> area<00:04:40.710> to<00:04:40.770> volume

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
look at that okay surface area to volume

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.190 
look at that okay surface area to volume
ratio<00:04:41.570> equals<00:04:42.570> surface<00:04:43.410> area<00:04:45.080> divided<00:04:46.080> by

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
ratio equals surface area divided by

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.390 
ratio equals surface area divided by
volume<00:04:48.290> so<00:04:49.290> now<00:04:49.440> I'm<00:04:49.770> gonna<00:04:49.950> do<00:04:50.130> I'm<00:04:50.340> gonna

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
volume so now I'm gonna do I'm gonna

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.800 
volume so now I'm gonna do I'm gonna
fill<00:04:50.669> in<00:04:50.760> what<00:04:50.880> I<00:04:50.910> know<00:04:51.030> what<00:04:51.300> was<00:04:51.419> my<00:04:51.540> surface

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
fill in what I know what was my surface

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:58.730 
fill in what I know what was my surface
area<00:04:52.700> 24<00:04:54.620> divided<00:04:55.620> by<00:04:55.650> 8<00:04:55.830> I<00:04:57.500> get<00:04:58.500> a<00:04:58.530> surface

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
area 24 divided by 8 I get a surface

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.420 
area 24 divided by 8 I get a surface
area<00:04:59.130> of<00:04:59.370> 3<00:05:00.890> our<00:05:01.890> surface<00:05:02.220> area<00:05:02.340> to<00:05:02.400> volume

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
area of 3 our surface area to volume

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.760 
area of 3 our surface area to volume
ratio<00:05:02.640> excuse<00:05:03.180> me<00:05:03.300> of<00:05:03.990> 3<00:05:06.290> ever<00:05:07.290> you<00:05:07.380> understand

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
ratio excuse me of 3 ever you understand

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.040 
ratio excuse me of 3 ever you understand
how<00:05:07.860> I<00:05:07.919> did<00:05:08.070> all<00:05:08.220> the<00:05:08.340> parts<00:05:08.550> of<00:05:08.669> that<00:05:08.870> first<00:05:09.870> I

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
how I did all the parts of that first I

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.080 
how I did all the parts of that first I
figured<00:05:10.290> out<00:05:10.380> surface<00:05:10.710> area<00:05:10.950> then<00:05:11.729> I<00:05:11.760> figured

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
figured out surface area then I figured

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.659 
figured out surface area then I figured
out<00:05:12.210> volume<00:05:12.720> then<00:05:13.710> I<00:05:13.830> divided<00:05:14.100> surface<00:05:14.460> area

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
out volume then I divided surface area

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:20.180 
out volume then I divided surface area
by<00:05:14.790> volume<00:05:15.180> and<00:05:15.540> I<00:05:16.470> got<00:05:16.650> 2<00:05:16.830> 3<00:05:18.680> if<00:05:19.680> I<00:05:19.890> want<00:05:20.100> that

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
by volume and I got 2 3 if I want that

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.680 
by volume and I got 2 3 if I want that
surface<00:05:20.520> area<00:05:20.700> to<00:05:20.760> volume<00:05:20.790> ratio<00:05:21.390> to<00:05:21.600> get

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
surface area to volume ratio to get

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.090 
surface area to volume ratio to get
bigger<00:05:21.990> what<00:05:22.260> could<00:05:22.380> I<00:05:22.440> do<00:05:22.500> to<00:05:22.710> the<00:05:22.800> size<00:05:22.979> of

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
bigger what could I do to the size of

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.979 
bigger what could I do to the size of
the<00:05:23.160> box<00:05:24.350> yeah<00:05:25.350> make<00:05:25.650> it<00:05:25.770> smaller
