00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.770
 new video presentation of 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.120
 windows are saying so this video is going to you 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.639
 give all the novelties of windows 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.400
 say that they appeared in January 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.020
 2015 so this is not a video that goes 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.539
 you learn all the news 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.609
 2009 10 if you want to know all this 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.260
 last you can go back on my 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.519
 old video presentation of 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.359
 windows say what I 'm doing for example to 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.949
 from September 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.930
 in fact I make a hen and me so 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.250
 with the novelties that are brought 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.660
 little by little by microsoft so 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.430
 some news for the month of 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.300
 January 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.500
 notice first of all which one knows 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.899
 a conference not very long ago 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.489
 about windows 10 and so he 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.140
 will be free the first year for the 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.230
 users of windows seven and 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.510
 windows 8 points 1 so free 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.399
 just a year the just the time 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.070
 to update then well 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.890
 obviously the version will pay off 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.770
 to all users a little bit 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.149
 like windows 8 points which was a 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.920
 small update of windows 8 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:08.400
 know that the free of this offer 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.840
 by by microsoft does not apply on 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.260
 the company versions of windows seven 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.360
 and windows 8 or else 8.1 need for 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.119
 windows rt art users and 8 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.840
 points and it's just because it's 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.590
 not the goal of microsoft 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.590
 it's just to leave to 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.509
 the average user as we time 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.220
 to make the transition to windows 10 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.070
 so that's the first news that is 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.770
 very important announced directly 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.700
 by microsoft 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.220
 if we go back to the features 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.799
 who were already wii blocks unveiled 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.780
 so we have the return of the menu 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.310
 start as well as the switch between 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.840
 tablet mode and stop mode 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.240
 I talked about it in my first video 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.939
 in September I think so it's good 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.360
 confirmed as well as the voice assistant 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.070
 cortana which is therefore also confirmed 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.040
 So corta micky asic again 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.869
 like syria or google now who will 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.579
 so allow you to take the 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.439
 control your computer using 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.860
 your voice for example to make a 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.540
 dictation 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.399
 if you want to dictate your mails by 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.979
 example look for items on the 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.970
 hard drive etc 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.019
 we will see that it is very intuitive 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.430
 behind in the latest version 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.440
 windows developers that is 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.680
 available on the microsoft website 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.970
 windows 10 you can try cortana 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.310
 is integrated so you can try it 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.319
 and talk to him and you will see that she will do 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.170
 what you ask him in the limit 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.180
 what she can do 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.140
 last new so daniel novelty 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.450
 there have not been many new 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.890
 festive land for fashion january on 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.079
 expects a lot more things for them 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.459
 next few months we have a 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:41.579
 important novelty that is the project 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.049
 spartan spartan browser project that's going 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.140
 come gradually replace 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:48.180
 internet explorer is worried that is in 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.859
 collapsing right now so 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.959
 that's why microsoft has put in 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.160
 place a new browser 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.870
 it is a browser so who will have 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.970
 a new interface a new engine 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.910
 also rendering that will be rethinking 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.340
 much faster and especially it was 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.299
 created in order to be compatible with ordered 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.299
 you can now do your 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.620
 research by dictating everything you 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.379
 actually want to sailors who will 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.569
 always search on the internet is 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.430
 also have a better 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.910
 integration of the voice assistant into the 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.730
 Navigator 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.049

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.250
 that we just discovered in January so 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:26.120
 and that will gradually be extended 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.230
 and then developed by microsoft 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.540
 until the next update 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.069
