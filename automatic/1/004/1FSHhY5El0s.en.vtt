00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
that are rolling down here and so

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.550 
that are rolling down here and so

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
that just kind of spaced around the path

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.710 
that just kind of spaced around the path
and<00:04:37.130> we<00:04:37.550> can<00:04:37.669> destroy<00:04:37.940> those<00:04:38.120> later<00:04:38.330> on<00:04:38.539> but

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
and we can destroy those later on but

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.909 
and we can destroy those later on but
right<00:04:38.810> now<00:04:38.960> something<00:04:39.289> we<00:04:39.380> can<00:04:39.470> do<00:04:39.560> about<00:04:39.680> them

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
right now something we can do about them

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.439 
right now something we can do about them
for<00:04:40.370> now<00:04:40.460> you<00:04:40.520> can<00:04:40.729> use<00:04:40.850> them<00:04:41.000> as<00:04:41.120> kind<00:04:41.270> of<00:04:41.389> a

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
for now you can use them as kind of a

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:42.790 
for now you can use them as kind of a
barrier<00:04:41.690> to<00:04:41.930> avoid<00:04:42.169> getting<00:04:42.350> hit<00:04:42.620> by<00:04:42.740> the

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
barrier to avoid getting hit by the

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.560 
barrier to avoid getting hit by the
rolling<00:04:43.190> folders<00:04:43.520> then<00:04:44.120> in<00:04:44.210> case<00:04:44.330> you<00:04:44.419> want<00:04:44.539> to

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
rolling folders then in case you want to

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.000 
rolling folders then in case you want to
head<00:04:44.690> towards<00:04:44.990> the<00:04:45.080> dogless<00:04:45.380> cavern<00:04:45.710> and<00:04:45.860> if

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
head towards the dogless cavern and if

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
head towards the dogless cavern and if
you've<00:04:46.160> been<00:04:46.250> following<00:04:46.370> a<00:04:46.580> walkthrough<00:04:46.729> we

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
you've been following a walkthrough we

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.430 
you've been following a walkthrough we

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
played at a magic bean here in the past

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.930 
played at a magic bean here in the past
and<00:04:48.710> so<00:04:48.800> now<00:04:48.919> it's<00:04:49.070> grown<00:04:49.310> into<00:04:49.460> a<00:04:49.550> magic<00:04:49.820> bean

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.200 
gold so Tula number 55 you can

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.690 
gold so Tula number 55 you can
technically<00:06:47.530> get<00:06:47.740> this<00:06:47.860> in<00:06:47.980> the<00:06:48.040> past<00:06:48.190> -<00:06:48.460> you

technically get this in the past - you
need<00:06:48.850> boomerang<00:06:49.330> so<00:06:49.630> rather<00:06:50.230> than<00:06:50.410> go<00:06:50.740> right

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:50.770
