00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
feet just normally without a skateboard

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.109 
feet just normally without a skateboard
and<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:17.070> think<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.430> trying<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.760> do<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.000> with<00:00:18.090> a

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
and I think of trying to do it with a

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.450 
and I think of trying to do it with a
skateboard<00:00:18.420> doing<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.140> 360<00:00:20.039> with<00:00:20.189> your<00:00:20.279> board

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
skateboard doing a 360 with your board

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.099

than<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.640> double<00:00:20.970> kickflip<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:21.510> it's<00:00:21.960> pretty

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
than a double kickflip so it's pretty

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.769 
than a double kickflip so it's pretty
difficult<00:00:22.350> trick<00:00:22.769> if<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.070> helped<00:00:23.400> you
