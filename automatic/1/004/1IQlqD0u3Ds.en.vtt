00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
change around fin design someone just

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.460 
change around fin design someone just
open<00:01:14.760> up<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:14.970> whole<00:01:15.270> new<00:01:15.300> world<00:01:15.750> for<00:01:15.930> us<00:01:16.230> so

blessing this went straight out the
start<00:01:23.730> of<00:01:23.850> making<00:01:23.970> thin<00:01:24.960> templates<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.650> just

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
start of making thin templates and just

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.890 
start of making thin templates and just
playing<00:01:26.190> around<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:26.700> widths<00:01:27.510> and<00:01:27.630> Heights

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
playing around with widths and Heights

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.500 
playing around with widths and Heights
and<00:01:28.230> and<00:01:28.380> volumes<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.550> fin<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:30.090> came<00:01:30.330> up<00:01:30.480> with

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
and and volumes of fin I came up with

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.900 
and and volumes of fin I came up with
the<00:01:30.780> red<00:01:30.960> line<00:01:31.170> which<00:01:31.980> was<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> wide<00:01:32.550> based

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
the red line which was a wide based

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.880 
the red line which was a wide based
narrow<00:01:33.330> tip<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.320> become<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.620> quite<00:01:34.860> a

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
narrow tip and that become a quite a

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.610 
narrow tip and that become a quite a
popular<00:01:35.100> fin<00:01:35.550> in<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.940> range<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.690> I<00:01:36.990> reduced

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
popular fin in the range and I reduced

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.500 
popular fin in the range and I reduced
the<00:01:37.740> size<00:01:38.010> of<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.340> fin<00:01:38.640> down<00:01:38.910> into<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.300> white

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
the size of that fin down into the white

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.859 
the size of that fin down into the white
line<00:01:39.780> put<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.440> the<00:01:40.590> FCS<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.520> do<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> quad<00:01:42.000> set<00:01:42.330> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
line put it the FCS to do a quad set the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.200 
line put it the FCS to do a quad set the
Aqua<00:01:43.229> lime<00:01:43.440> they<00:01:43.979> asked<00:01:44.280> me<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.460> come<00:01:44.729> up<00:01:44.970> with

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
Aqua lime they asked me to come up with

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.040 
Aqua lime they asked me to come up with
a<00:01:45.270> SUP<00:01:45.630> fin<00:01:45.930> basically<00:01:46.890> played<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:48.630> volume

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
a SUP fin basically played the volume

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.320 
a SUP fin basically played the volume
out<00:01:49.260> of<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.680> red<00:01:49.950> line<00:01:50.190> burst<00:01:50.760> of<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:50.970> tips

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
out of the red line burst of the tips

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.010 
out of the red line burst of the tips
into<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.830> side<00:01:53.100> front<00:01:53.490> fins<00:01:53.820> small<00:01:54.479> rear<00:01:54.780> fin

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
into the side front fins small rear fin

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.230 
into the side front fins small rear fin
again<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:56.010> I<00:01:56.040> could<00:01:56.100> play<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.700> slide<00:01:57.030> around

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.040 
again so I could play and slide around
on<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:58.080> quads<00:01:58.380> for<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.310> SUP<00:01:59.580> range<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.210> really

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
on the quads for the SUP range so really

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.240 
on the quads for the SUP range so really
specifically<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.770> SUP<00:02:02.130> range<00:02:02.490> squad<00:02:02.940> setup

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
specifically a SUP range squad setup

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.990 
specifically a SUP range squad setup
my<00:02:06.250> TC<00:02:07.000> sup<00:02:07.240> fan<00:02:07.479> quad<00:02:07.899> set<00:02:08.319> up<00:02:08.530> for<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.099> sup<00:02:09.369> is

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
my TC sup fan quad set up for the sup is

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.930 
my TC sup fan quad set up for the sup is
basically<00:02:10.660> designed<00:02:11.260> around<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:12.550> wider

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
basically designed around the wider

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.380 
basically designed around the wider
areas<00:02:13.900> of<00:02:14.110> sup<00:02:14.379> tails<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.730> kind<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.090> area

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
areas of sup tails and the kind of area

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.880 
areas of sup tails and the kind of area
we're<00:02:16.599> turning<00:02:17.019> off<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:17.349> so<00:02:17.620> I've<00:02:17.680> got<00:02:17.860> a

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
we're turning off and so I've got a

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.460 
we're turning off and so I've got a
wider<00:02:18.220> base<00:02:18.550> than<00:02:19.000> your<00:02:19.150> average<00:02:19.300> Finn<00:02:19.810> I've

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
wider base than your average Finn I've

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.160 
wider base than your average Finn I've
got<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.620> wide<00:02:20.860> a<00:02:20.890> tip<00:02:21.280> that<00:02:21.310> leans<00:02:21.819> back<00:02:22.420> so<00:02:23.049> we

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
got a wide a tip that leans back so we

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.289 
got a wide a tip that leans back so we
get<00:02:23.319> a<00:02:23.349> little<00:02:23.620> bit<00:02:23.739> more<00:02:23.830> draw<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.580> FCS<00:02:25.030> to

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
get a little bit more draw the FCS to

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.600 
get a little bit more draw the FCS to
system<00:02:25.780> which<00:02:25.900> is<00:02:26.049> so<00:02:26.319> solid<00:02:26.739> as<00:02:27.010> it<00:02:27.190> is<00:02:27.370> and

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
bottom of the board so we went on the

bottom of the board so we went on the
contours<00:03:27.510> that<00:03:27.690> allows<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.320> waters<00:03:28.740> to<00:03:28.890> be
