00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.030
 me 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.670
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.000
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.190
 tan 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.730
 Five 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.730
 Ha 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:50.810
 Today's new r 1200 gs f test drive so this short 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.950
 I would like to deliver an impression 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:58.400
 Although this gs is really totally new 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.550
 It's on the floor too Engine this is first 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.090
 With the latest design 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:08.480
 You're a generator, you're all in a mission 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.610
 What was housed in this engine crankcase is a very compact engine 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:15.250
 It has become 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:20.200
 It's such that the place has become a high Metropolitan mounting position when compared to a little slightly before the next section 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:24.180
 But entered against You're still the overall thing it into what had been attached to the top 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:28.180
 It does say that I want to enter into what had growth behind it is or as painful 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:31.900
 It is the concentration of mass is now being songs 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:35.409
 I think the balance low center of gravity is not lost again 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:40.450
 Speaking of the parts that are so new 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:41.370
 g Now here is we are newly adopted something called dynamic Lisa 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.500
 so 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.590
 This is 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.830
 Well there is also a place called off road use 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.230
 that 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.900
 sweater 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:55.159
 The stroke sensor is attached and always touch the road surface condition to match it 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.069
 Setting 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:59.640
 It is supposed to be me was Motorcyclists 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.910
 so 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:08.010
 Various that ac dbs that 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:13.020
 It's a good thing, but it can be changed with what is printed, so only one button on one hand very much 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:14.720
 It is telling me that the setting for the current driving is fast . 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.320
 I can do it 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:21.530
 The new model is also a water-cooled engine, but that very 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:26.150
 The pickup is getting better a 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:29.600
 The first is the Tteyuu I wish I think we have become awkward it looks a little 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:34.700
 There was an image , but when I actually got on it, I did not have such a thing. 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.360
 It's very close to the operation of the throttle on the right hand, and it's already moving directly 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.460
 But 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.520
 I can run slowly though , for example , a little something like winding 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.110
 I wo n't run 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:51.780
 When everything is very quick looking 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:55.240
 It 's a production with children and it's plus Ride by wire from this time if you take that 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.320
 Computer the neighborhood about the place has become so those that do not use a wire 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:03.270
 I think that management is very well done 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:07.230
 The riding mode is finally ãƒ¼ or after road mode 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.639
 There is a thing called Henry road network , but the setting according to it ends in the end 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:15.310
 After throttle 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:20.200
 It is all connected to Jesus ac abs 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:23.240
 After all gs It is that we want to run a place that seems a little 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:27.889
 Though it is short, I tried running 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:30.380
 So what I thought is that the boxer engine is made because it has a low center of gravity 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.760
 There is an impression that it is easy to ride 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:37.170
 Just that 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.849
 The throttle pickup is so good that I want to be careful a bit 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.020
 so 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:46.990
 Try it in various ways and try it 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:51.940
 Although it was the first time that touched 1000 form gs This is Well 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:56.500
 Of course there are engines and so on, and there are places that are totally new to chassis and so on 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:59.889
 But more than that, for example, where the screen can be done with one hand 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.009
 Where is the tandem seat slightly shifted back and forth? 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:06.920
 Really easy to use 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:11.100
 I felt that say are well thought good place also with the Do I have evolved 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:15.600
 Most of previous models are on the way 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:17.009
 The reaction engine has changed, but it continues for ten years in the same way. 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.400
 So 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:25.349
 Though it was Tokai , there was really a full model change 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.189
 From now on other vehicles may also be used by this kindergarten after all 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:28.139
 I wonder 

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:33.330
 gs itself 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:37.039
 Moreover is it 's such a s Yes Nde going into much in this form while you Naa Tianshou 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.039
 said it was an imco technology 

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:53.089
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.729
 me 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.729
 Yeah Eeeeeeee 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.750
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.500
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.500
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:36.620
 wh 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.620
