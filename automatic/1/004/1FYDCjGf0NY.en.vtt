00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.430
 hello today we are going to learn how to make a 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.620
 flower of a satin bow like this that 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.940
 you see here that it will be very useful when 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.309
 let's make a gift to someone about 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.330
 everything in Christmas so that there is much more 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:19.200
 I hope you like it 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.000
 to make our flower with a bow of 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.560
 satso of this type then we're going to need 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.930
 the tie the gift in which we are going to 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.590
 place and scissors to help us in 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.590
 the process 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.829
 let's start by folding our loop 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.370
 well, more or less 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:39.309
 a bit so it will be like a 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.239
 hand one and a half hand and let's go 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:48.480
 Doubling it like this is always the same 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.480
 size by turning several turns 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.620
 It is important that we are staying 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.620
 spiritual 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.150
 well then when we have done some 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.770
 for example seven or ten or a thing like that 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.420
 the more we make more pompous will be 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:17.939
 our final result 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.939
 let's give it a little slice 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.840
 we already have the folds done as you 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.229
 I say among many others we do the best 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.159
 between 7 and 10 such a thing and more or less 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:35.590
 in the central part we are going to stick some 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.010
 cuts tiny milestones 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.200
 to fine tune it 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.200
 you have to do it very carefully 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.680
 so that they do not cut off completely and do not 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.680
 break vale 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.660
 we are cutting 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.660
 you see the same thing on the opposite side 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.060
 you support me where we have cut like this 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.600
 approximately 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:11.230
 and we are going to use a bit of what 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:15.340
 has left us to tie it around 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:18.660
 this part finite and we will be 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.660
 tight tight vale 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.569
 everything tight that you can 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.550
 we have made several turns so that it is 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.550
 even more your appetite 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.530
 Y 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.380
 now we go 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.480
 once it's tight to cut the 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.849
 ends are left over 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.140
 stick to the knot but not too much 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:59.480
 I do not know what we're up to 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.180
 well then once ready now what 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.280
 we are going to do is go separating our 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.280
 tie to form the flower 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.940
 well then once we have stretched 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.800
 well every end what we have done has 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.780
 been paste it in the regal and as you see 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.480
 It is quite decorative and quite 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.680
 original if you liked this way of 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.720
 decorate our Christmas gifts 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.110
