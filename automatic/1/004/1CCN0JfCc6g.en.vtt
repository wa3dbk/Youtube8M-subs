00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
now it gets a little distorted that's

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.480 
now it gets a little distorted that's
because<00:01:33.930> it's<00:01:34.050> such<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> small<00:01:34.440> speaker<00:01:34.860> that

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
because it's such a small speaker that

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.060 
because it's such a small speaker that
it<00:01:35.580> does<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> 40-millimeter<00:01:36.840> driver<00:01:37.410> 40

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
it does have a 40-millimeter driver 40

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.400 
it does have a 40-millimeter driver 40
40<00:01:38.430> millimeter<00:01:38.760> Conan<00:01:39.180> here<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.260> say

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
40 millimeter Conan here and like I say

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.960 
40 millimeter Conan here and like I say
the<00:01:40.530> cables<00:01:40.860> integrated<00:01:41.340> which<00:01:41.460> we<00:01:41.640> think<00:01:41.820> is

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
the cables integrated which we think is

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.550 
the cables integrated which we think is
a<00:01:42.030> very<00:01:42.210> nice<00:01:42.330> touch<00:01:42.770> so<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.970> volume

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
a very nice touch so the the volume

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.710 
a very nice touch so the the volume
control<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.590> down<00:01:46.860> here<00:01:47.300> to<00:01:48.300> charge<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
control is down here to charge the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.750 
control is down here to charge the
device<00:01:48.870> you<00:01:49.140> plug<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.440> a<00:01:49.500> USB<00:01:49.920> cable<00:01:50.130> here<00:01:50.490> will

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
device you plug in a USB cable here will

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.330 
device you plug in a USB cable here will
show<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.000> USB<00:01:51.330> cable<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.870> moment<00:01:52.340> so

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
show you that USB cable in a moment so

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.040 
show you that USB cable in a moment so
now<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.520> can<00:01:53.730> also<00:01:53.850> connect<00:01:54.270> multiple<00:01:54.480> of

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
now you can also connect multiple of
