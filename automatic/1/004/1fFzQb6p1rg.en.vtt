00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.410
 it is important when it comes down 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:33.039
 know that the stride is slightly more 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.920
 wide just like the arm and the pass 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:39.820
 again it has to project level 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:43.000
 chest is projected further forward 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.180
 in such a way that with the stroke 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.309
 seeks to raise it to the chest but 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.309
 projecting the hand forward 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.090
 it is important when it comes to living 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.430
 descending that the body has relaxed 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.220
 avoid that 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.370
 the foot hits the asphalt or the road 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.730
 and it is very important that the 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:12.300
 phrasing does not rise like when you go up or 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:15.450
 you walk flat but that arm is 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.130
 slightly lower the projection no longer 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.960
 it's elk in front of the body if it's not 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.150
 slightly backwards it is important 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.790
 that at the time of lowering everything is avoided 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.060
 patter with the asphalt and avoid 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.430
 any tension of the body in the train 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.170
 higher 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.980
 we must run with a body as 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.980
 relaxed possible
