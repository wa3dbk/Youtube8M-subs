00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.710
 hello your great club members this video is 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.380
 for some who still do not know how 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:24.790
 refute the seats in this case 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:27.039
 We are with unasur and highland 2014 and 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:32.169
 the procedure is as follows 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:34.290
 inside the seats there are two leaves 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.010
 in the first 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.900
 we throw 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.930
 and only one part rests 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.290
 in 2015 as it has another head 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.780
 lost this position the truth that for 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.410
 it 's a shame because we can take a 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.880
 child and we can take something some kind of 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.720
 face that needs a little more space 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.140
 that the trunk 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.140
 but well we stretch the other rope 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:09.640
 and they are already rebutted now we have to 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.300
 do the following here on this side if 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.300
 you want to go around 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:21.740
 there is a handle 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.840
 that enables the way to refute 800 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.610
 also bring a soda that this goes 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.380
 directly on the seat of the 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.380
 companion to prevent it from moving 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.700
 saved many times 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.920
 thanks to this function that not all 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.150
 others bring but 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:49.810
 we are pleasantly satisfied 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:53.030
 then for even this video you're 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.590
 Anchors species are called lunch es 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:00.070
 for some baby visits or eggs 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.390
 that the strap passes and hooks here 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.229
 some club users thought that 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.380
 it was a function of bringing the car 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.530
 as for support but it's the 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.709
 boat system is a pity that we are 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.190
 in 2015 and they still oran this model 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.150
 from sudan do not bring isofix that the truth 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.000
 that would be very useful 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.790
 but I hope you liked it 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.569
 the video of how to refute the seats 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.569
 greetings to all
