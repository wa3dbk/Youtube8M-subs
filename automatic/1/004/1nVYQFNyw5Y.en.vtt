00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
was not trying to lose weight so I just

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.910

went<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.659> gym<00:01:06.900> just<00:01:07.170> because<00:01:07.500> she<00:01:07.710> would

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
went to the gym just because she would

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.730 
went to the gym just because she would
not<00:01:07.950> get<00:01:08.430> off<00:01:08.549> my<00:01:08.729> case<00:01:08.939> about<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.420> okay<00:01:09.740> so

not get off my case about it okay so

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.570 
not get off my case about it okay so
basically<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:12.450> made<00:01:13.049> her<00:01:13.320> happy<00:01:13.799> by<00:01:14.189> going<00:01:14.490> to

basically I made her happy by going to
the<00:01:14.790> gym<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.750> guess<00:01:16.049> she<00:01:16.259> figured<00:01:16.590> she<00:01:16.740> had

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
the gym so I guess she figured she had

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.580 
the gym so I guess she figured she had
to<00:01:17.070> make<00:01:17.220> me<00:01:17.490> happy<00:01:17.909> after<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.600> gym<00:01:18.840> because

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
to make me happy after the gym because

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.070 
to make me happy after the gym because
it<00:01:19.920> was<00:01:20.040> like<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.430> seafood<00:01:20.970> shot<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.840> front

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
it was like this seafood shot in front

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.160 
it was like this seafood shot in front
of<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.409> gym<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:23.670> exercise<00:01:24.360> for<00:01:24.630> an<00:01:24.689> hour<00:01:24.869> or

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
of the gym so we exercise for an hour or

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.280 
of the gym so we exercise for an hour or
two<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.530> then<00:01:25.710> she<00:01:25.950> take<00:01:26.189> me<00:01:26.369> out<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.670> eat<00:01:27.290> like

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
two and then she take me out to eat like

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.719 
two and then she take me out to eat like
that<00:01:28.350> kind<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.860> defeats<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.189> whole<00:01:29.369> purpose

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
that kind of defeats the whole purpose

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.539 
that kind of defeats the whole purpose
right<00:01:30.180> but<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.229> know<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.439> didn't<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.400> know<00:01:32.430> I
