 assembled just like the razer ie 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.110

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.350

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.950
 we have a custom interface on 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.430
 android icy 4.1.2 years everything is 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.520
 driven by a dual core processor with a 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.619
 gigabytes of 16 gigabyte memory and the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.750
 internal memory 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.640
 we have the classic quick functions 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.080
 settings that allow us to enable 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.820
 some functions during use 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.680
 daily in the sense this smartphone 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.800
 will learn where we live 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.120
 where we work so as to activate 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.100
 disable wifi when we are in 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.650
 close to home and all these things 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.290
 here as I said this smartphone 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.250
 currently no arrival in the 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.500
 Italian market 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.570
 shame because I find it really 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.640
 the engine is very interesting 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.640
