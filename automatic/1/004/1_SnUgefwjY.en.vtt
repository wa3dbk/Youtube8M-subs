00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.420
 Hello people welcome to a small 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.530
 yes also executive board should Paul video from me 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.389
 ordered it will be able to pack 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.259
 a hammer place go what he has in my opinion by no means so 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:15.959
 should be missing 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:20.509
 with the Omnia and with cancer gates and four ladies can do a lot 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:23.460
 So let's start directly 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.509
 we have 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.970
 we start oppressors we have 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.570
 m from a certain material that one can in the concrete everything individually from the 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.460
 server 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.820
 a bridge 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.230
 serve 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.710
 either three or five percent percent of the symmetric is further 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.450
 a sign stands 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.560
 I'm there Moritz Volz Thum was prescribed from the beginning 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.740
 I now place the sign on their way to the second row in 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.860
 Write square brackets and bridge 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.830
 the cities already rounds 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.160
 Bridge is certainly not all created for us 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
 we needed to see that nothing happened 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.820
 that's why it says that we should place a second test match on 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.730
 the other side 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.740
 Even the handlebars of the bridge can be adjusted when I turn on now 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.350
 single ball of these two players look 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.620
 Presstek with a tool or a board 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.090
 Reinhard flat hand 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.890
 the bridge will be removed 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.750
 everything between the two signs 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.539
 that will be very cool 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.179
 usually the whole thing floats around in the air when you go to Preußer 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:28.530
 Wants to connect example 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.270
 that's pretty easy and the runners are chic 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.370
 and is very convenient 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.810
 good percent we go on 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.810
 but then the gate open 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.610
 I'll do that now 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.610
 4 o below 3 continue 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.980
 szo 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.650
 Bern not only with the account 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.409
 Fill in Solingen 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.900
 down there 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.700
 because Meier's lower line up to the top to the top Russian 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.920
 and there was and continue to work 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.860
 SU 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.309
 there Bahia and explains the city chief 

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:14.669
 Position good car you do not get quiet 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:18.760
 that's why the warning sign and have that right here is not exactly it 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:22.599
 can take care of somewhere else write on the second serve Xing Klamandt 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:23.399
 equipment 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:25.709
 Stegner and goes Red APA 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.889
 late gate 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:31.519
 Valverde the SZ with a tool or the flat hand on it will be 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.119
 this 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:34.509
 and somehow off 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:37.389
 I could now put one on the second page and then one 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:39.349
 open and close from every page 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.069
 but it is practically constant 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.180
 HM 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.490
 the good old Ricky alternative to for apn 

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:50.019
 and how space 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.709
 what was that 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.519
 then we have the title of the houses, as we say 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.519
 still a third function the band i 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.069
 Yarbrough what does that stand for 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.069
 no idea brewer it is not tenable 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:08.129
 if I now see a right click like Imke optically join in the torch 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.979
 and be first by Trott 

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:11.339
 Achenbach 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:14.509
 says Kern 

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:17.939
 if I were you Ambacher fee to normal trott 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:22.120
 So practically a poet off this one is going to see blocks from the sign in 

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:23.339
 every direction 

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:26.619
 I guess you can also set life Contex everything 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:27.949
 and the off 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:30.199
 then I'll show you some more 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:31.419
 more 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.029
 funny Litti is good stuff 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:35.159
 and on 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:39.259
 NetApp around a wooden block or other Hermann Nemat Shafik 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.380
 Pappas cautioned the second line and typing MC 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.579
 1000 200 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:46.879
 he goes to the trigger 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:50.299
 on the third line, sample your English in the evening from a monster or 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.859
 Animal stand here will just be the Gruber issued over me mode 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:55.879
 the whole 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.099
 for that I am now worried with Web to the Shield pages 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.519
 with a switch 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.049
 Metal Belt use that of bands like the cool with cheeky action so 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:05.769
 Merten 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.140
 if you look at the whole thing with a look 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.489
 yes 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.089
 combines 

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:14.169
 I could do more now 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:17.169
 is he done fast Alex will cover Sahin like shit 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:19.849
 to me off 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:22.849
 technical Blink Blink 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.120
 and a little rest March Dogan 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.120
 Landau and that brings 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.860
 he stops when I connect the whole internet 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.479
 and the word abuse way 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.969
 and write life again MC 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:45.969
 Red dapd 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.360
 if I tie the whole thing 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.029
 look at it 

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:53.379
 I'm completely successful 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:55.960
 a little too much Amore Amore 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.960
 Incidentally, all has in turn 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:02.129
 Joking aside 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:04.080
 Euro 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.979
 there is still more at last 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:08.759
 jarmen 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:10.970
 Functions that are second to none 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.970
 everything is adjustable and this to the bridge Austrian 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.169
 The purchase will not stop at half the percent 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.169
 one of which materials the whole thing works 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.860
 and around 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.360
 trier 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.650

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.279
 it is really recommended 

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:35.609
 and Unverzagt at this point and then I say goodbye and it 

00:05:35.609 --> 00:05:38.809
 Place percent Steiner I still left some in the video shouting Bon 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.190
 concerning her 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.120
 Years of further orders such as an angry Cadenza unfortunately 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.339
 already exist 

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:52.199
 Alex can do that with five eggs or, for example, wireless connectors 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:54.490
 Connection city Gladstone 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.710

 for the joy of clothing chamber 

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:45.539
 only for demonstrations steadily 

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:51.830
 these few striking ones that I can be big or miscellaneous 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.080
 definitely 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.050
 Bushido to demonstration 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.210
 in fact

 if I carry a sign here now 

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:01.919

 all right 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.120
 that is to say for another sign to place 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.580
 that means we have to do that now that must be there just under it special shows 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.550
 you chocolate 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.219
