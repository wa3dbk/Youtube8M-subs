00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.750
 the market in value who can we put the national leather gloves 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:11.419
 because centaur 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:13.859
 when normally national 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:18.240
 and of ccm also proceeded to the adopted another corner because we also give 

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:20.130
 with four goals of ccm 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.189
 working 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.199
 I proceed here from the drawers 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.720
 little by little it went high 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.839
 for what 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.570
 to run specific recommendations from the experts 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.550
 I prefer to see the seriousness two days 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.550
 after two days we go down to the second 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.180
 in concord too 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.220
 I can not see who or where the body is 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.230
 It makes me very happy chanting here I would have 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.360
 starting from it 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.360
 requires 4 10% 2 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.150
 a hit 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.680
 5 of the subway 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.170
 while saying then 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.820
 we would know stopped 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.020
 to govern for this for the disabled not 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.450
 this is a necessity 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.720
 is a man who is healthy 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.870
 trips of more highlights during the two 3 4 and 2 depending on the sun 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.110
 100 strong soles about three four of the subsidiary little temperature all very 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.330
 cool in germany five centimeters less I'm not and I'll be the end already of and the 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.130
 process in pretoria we put the label for 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.130
 know if it is the national cocoa grow 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.710
 the fermented ccn 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.350
 or is that it also ended conventional that comes from farms that has not 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.520
 experienced has 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.450
 the eskenazi 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.450
 p without any process not without any technique 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.030
 sometimes I read 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.460
 sometimes they take it and from one they put it to the tendal they do not ferment it complement it 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.500
 we remove the cidh is that they practically have fenced 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:13.669
 and the other thing is the talent of the Roma that 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:15.149
 who do 

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:17.399
 So that 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:22.399
 that in fermenting and as I say there p the viewer who goes in the 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:25.600
 Winery is a bit to realize that you should not mix 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.519
 the cacao resists ccm 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.959
 but it is common after losing with treatment that they become ill 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.530
 and also that it is a sin 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.159
 all sm that comes from farms certified true because also there 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.799
 there are farmers who see in it is finished and sells 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.409
 in a plot that keeps it fumigating for example with 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.139
 with glyphosate fumigan with 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:53.299
 chelsea permethrin to control the insects then all of that we have 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.239
 us in mind the moment we put it 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.319
 both in the drawers and in the marquee and then to put it and in the 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.699
 Equal cellar to send it we send everything 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:05.699
 differences 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:30.030
