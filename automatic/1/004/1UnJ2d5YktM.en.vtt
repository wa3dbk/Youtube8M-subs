00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
leaving okay so if we're counting it

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.709 
leaving okay so if we're counting it
like<00:01:39.240> one<00:01:39.719> triplet<00:01:40.229> two<00:01:40.619> triplet<00:01:41.009> three<00:01:41.880> we're

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
like one triplet two triplet three we're

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:43.969 
like one triplet two triplet three we're
not<00:01:42.810> actually<00:01:42.899> playing<00:01:43.259> anything<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.829> that

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
not actually playing anything on that

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.160 
not actually playing anything on that
trip<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.969> triplet<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.600> that's<00:01:46.049> what

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
trip of the triplet and that's what

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.240 
trip of the triplet and that's what
we're<00:01:46.289> gonna<00:01:46.380> stick<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.890> little<00:01:47.070> left

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
we're gonna stick in the little left

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.560 
we're gonna stick in the little left
hand<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.490> mean<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.670> play<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:47.939> as<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.060> ghost<00:01:48.270> note

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
hand I mean to play that as a ghost note

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.910 
hand I mean to play that as a ghost note
so<00:01:48.780> if<00:01:48.869> we<00:01:48.990> just<00:01:49.110> look<00:01:49.259> at<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.439> hand<00:01:49.649> pattern

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
so if we just look at the hand pattern

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.330 
so if we just look at the hand pattern
it's<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.280> one<00:01:51.149> triplet<00:01:51.689> two<00:01:52.079> triplet<00:01:52.469> three

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
it's like one triplet two triplet three

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.499 
it's like one triplet two triplet three
triplet<00:01:53.759> four<00:01:54.570> triplet<00:01:55.219> five<00:01:56.219> triplet<00:01:57.030> six

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
triplet four triplet five triplet six

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.959 
triplet four triplet five triplet six

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
the track what I'm finding is it's

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.090 
the track what I'm finding is it's
almost<00:03:00.970> like<00:03:01.180> a<00:03:01.270> 4<00:03:01.570> bar<00:03:02.019> loop<00:03:02.290> going<00:03:02.800> on<00:03:02.950> in

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
almost like a 4 bar loop going on in

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.830 
almost like a 4 bar loop going on in
which<00:03:03.190> on<00:03:03.820> the<00:03:03.970> first<00:03:04.239> three<00:03:04.450> bars<00:03:04.630> you're

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
which on the first three bars you're

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.600 
which on the first three bars you're
just<00:03:04.959> hitting<00:03:05.080> the<00:03:05.170> kick<00:03:05.320> drum<00:03:05.500> on<00:03:05.560> beat<00:03:05.769> 1<00:03:06.010> but

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.820 
just hitting the kick drum on beat 1 but
then<00:03:06.760> on<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:06.970> fourth<00:03:07.360> bar<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:08.050> variation<00:03:08.739> that

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
then on the fourth bar a variation that

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.470 
then on the fourth bar a variation that
pops<00:03:09.070> up<00:03:09.220> quite<00:03:09.489> a<00:03:09.519> few<00:03:09.700> times<00:03:09.760> he's<00:03:10.150> putting<00:03:10.390> a

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
pops up quite a few times he's putting a

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.949 
pops up quite a few times he's putting a
kick<00:03:10.720> on<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:12.700> count<00:03:12.970> of<00:03:13.060> beat<00:03:13.269> 1<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:13.720> then<00:03:13.840> on

let's go sound like this okay and then
your<00:04:45.510> next<00:04:45.810> challenge<00:04:45.990> is<00:04:46.200> I'm<00:04:46.440> not<00:04:46.620> sure<00:04:46.830> you

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
your next challenge is I'm not sure you

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.620 
your next challenge is I'm not sure you
don't<00:04:47.400> have<00:04:47.610> to<00:04:47.730> necessarily<00:04:47.820> do<00:04:48.240> that<00:04:48.390> but<00:04:48.570> if

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
don't have to necessarily do that but if

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.260 
don't have to necessarily do that but if
you<00:04:48.690> get<00:04:48.840> your<00:04:48.960> left<00:04:49.140> hand<00:04:49.730> you<00:04:50.730> left<00:04:50.910> foot<00:04:51.120> so

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
you get your left hand you left foot so

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.730 
you get your left hand you left foot so
just<00:04:51.540> ticking<00:04:52.170> away<00:04:52.260> or<00:04:52.680> B's<00:04:52.890> 1<00:04:53.340> 2<00:04:53.730> 3<00:04:54.060> 4<00:04:54.510> 5<00:04:54.870> 6<00:04:55.290> 1<00:04:55.680> 2

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
just ticking away or B's 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:17.950 
just ticking away or B's 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2
3<00:04:56.100> 4<00:04:56.550> 5<00:04:57.330> 6

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.779 

that<00:05:18.960> is<00:05:19.110> pretty<00:05:19.349> much<00:05:19.500> it<00:05:19.560> or<00:05:20.280> what<00:05:20.669> I<00:05:20.699> think

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
that is pretty much it or what I think

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.219 
that is pretty much it or what I think
it<00:05:21.030> is<00:05:21.120> anyway<00:05:21.360> there<00:05:21.690> are<00:05:21.720> a<00:05:21.840> few<00:05:22.020> extra

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
it is anyway there are a few extra

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:23.839 
it is anyway there are a few extra
subtle<00:05:22.650> variations<00:05:23.129> with<00:05:23.250> the<00:05:23.310> kick<00:05:23.490> drum<00:05:23.520> I'm

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:23.849 
subtle variations with the kick drum I'm

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:25.129 
subtle variations with the kick drum I'm
sure<00:05:24.000> if<00:05:24.120> you<00:05:24.180> listen<00:05:24.509> to<00:05:24.569> the<00:05:24.659> track<00:05:24.870> you<00:05:24.900> can

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
sure if you listen to the track you can

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.990 
sure if you listen to the track you can
sort<00:05:25.319> of<00:05:25.349> plunk<00:05:25.590> nose<00:05:25.800> in<00:05:26.009> and<00:05:26.729> they<00:05:26.879> all

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
sort of plunk nose in and they all

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.339 
sort of plunk nose in and they all
