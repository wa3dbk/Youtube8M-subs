00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.819 

so<00:01:57.420> while<00:01:57.899> using<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.409> first<00:01:58.619> time<00:01:58.710> you

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
so while using it the first time you

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.319 
so while using it the first time you
pick<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.189> up<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.460> kind<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.729> feels<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.060> little<00:02:00.149> bit

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
pick it up it kind of feels a little bit

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.670 
pick it up it kind of feels a little bit
awkward<00:02:00.450> especially<00:02:00.930> if<00:02:01.290> you're<00:02:01.380> used<00:02:01.560> to

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
awkward especially if you're used to

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.940 
awkward especially if you're used to
using<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:02.009> normal<00:02:02.130> Mouse<00:02:02.780> and<00:02:03.780> one<00:02:04.770> thing

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
using a normal Mouse and one thing

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.999 
using a normal Mouse and one thing
that's<00:02:04.979> nice<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.549> because<00:02:06.860> you're<00:02:07.860> going<00:02:07.950> to

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
that's nice is because you're going to

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.130 
that's nice is because you're going to
be<00:02:08.069> using<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.429> at<00:02:08.520> different<00:02:08.670> angles<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.959> can

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
be using it at different angles you can

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.090 
be using it at different angles you can
set<00:02:10.440> which<00:02:10.649> direction<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.280> up<00:02:11.489> by<00:02:11.760> holding

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
set which direction is up by holding

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.820 
set which direction is up by holding
down<00:02:12.250> these<00:02:12.640> two<00:02:12.880> buttons<00:02:13.440> so<00:02:14.440> if<00:02:14.530> I<00:02:14.590> hold<00:02:14.740> down

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
down these two buttons so if I hold down

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.410 
down these two buttons so if I hold down
the<00:02:15.040> left<00:02:15.070> on<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.370> right<00:02:15.460> mouse<00:02:15.640> button<00:02:16.060> I<00:02:16.210> can

the left on the right mouse button I can

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.360 
the left on the right mouse button I can
set<00:02:16.690> this<00:02:17.110> direction<00:02:17.440> is<00:02:17.650> up<00:02:17.860> say<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.280> little

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
set this direction is up say a little

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.370 
set this direction is up say a little
bit<00:02:18.610> later<00:02:18.820> I'm<00:02:19.630> in<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.780> different<00:02:19.990> angle<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.350> can

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
bit later I'm in a different angle I can

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.920 
bit later I'm in a different angle I can
set<00:02:20.680> this<00:02:20.830> direction<00:02:21.190> is<00:02:21.430> up<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.880> little<00:02:22.750> bit<00:02:22.870> of

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
set this direction is up a little bit of

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.570 
set this direction is up a little bit of
customization<00:02:23.530> there<00:02:23.680> there's<00:02:24.160> no<00:02:24.280> software

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580

customization there there's no software
that<00:02:24.910> gets<00:02:25.060> installed<00:02:25.770> so<00:02:26.770> you're<00:02:27.370> kind<00:02:27.550> of

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
that gets installed so you're kind of

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.550 
that gets installed so you're kind of
limited<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.180> options<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.260> features

that<00:02:29.590> I've<00:02:29.950> just<00:02:29.980> shown<00:02:30.370> you<00:02:30.490> but<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:32.530> far

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
that I've just shown you but so far

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.460 
that I've just shown you but so far
after<00:02:33.670> a<00:02:33.910> few<00:02:34.120> days<00:02:34.240> of<00:02:34.450> use<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:35.110> trying<00:02:35.350> to

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
after a few days of use and trying to

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.360 
after a few days of use and trying to
replace<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:37.090> touchpad<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.890> company<00:02:39.160> claims

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
replace the touchpad the company claims

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.670 
replace the touchpad the company claims
you're<00:02:39.610> forty<00:02:39.970> percent<00:02:40.240> more<00:02:40.680> productive

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
you're forty percent more productive

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.760 
you're forty percent more productive
that's<00:02:41.980> based<00:02:42.190> on<00:02:42.370> a<00:02:42.670> study<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:44.560> will<00:02:44.680> look

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
that's based on a study that will look

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.460 
that's based on a study that will look
what<00:02:44.920> university<00:02:45.370> did<00:02:46.320> I<00:02:47.880> find<00:02:48.880> I'm<00:02:49.180> more<00:02:49.900> of<00:02:49.960> a

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
what university did I find I'm more of a

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.460 
what university did I find I'm more of a
mouse<00:02:50.650> person<00:02:51.130> so<00:02:51.460> I<00:02:51.880> guess<00:02:52.360> it'll<00:02:52.600> kind<00:02:52.780> of<00:02:52.960> go

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
mouse person so I guess it'll kind of go

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.280 
mouse person so I guess it'll kind of go
back<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:53.860> if<00:02:54.220> you're<00:02:54.400> really<00:02:55.290> comfortable

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
back to if you're really comfortable

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.900 
back to if you're really comfortable
with<00:02:56.740> the<00:02:56.830> touchpad<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:57.280> you<00:02:57.580> love<00:02:57.790> the

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
with the touchpad and you love the

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.730 
with the touchpad and you love the
touchpad<00:02:58.270> you<00:02:58.930> might<00:02:59.110> not<00:02:59.230> see<00:02:59.290> as<00:02:59.590> much

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
touchpad you might not see as much

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.340 
touchpad you might not see as much
productivity<00:03:00.280> gains<00:03:00.660> but<00:03:01.660> after<00:03:02.050> a<00:03:02.080> few<00:03:02.230> days

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
productivity gains but after a few days

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.470 
productivity gains but after a few days
of<00:03:02.650> playing<00:03:03.010> around<00:03:03.130> with<00:03:03.340> it<00:03:03.550> and<00:03:03.760> kind<00:03:04.420> of

awkwardness to get used to and it is

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.830 
awkwardness to get used to and it is
kind<00:04:57.840> of<00:04:57.900> pricey<00:04:58.080> for<00:04:58.290> a<00:04:58.530> mobile<00:04:58.770> mouse<00:04:59.040> at

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
6995 but not too expensive it's

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.270 
6995 but not too expensive it's
something<00:05:03.510> that<00:05:03.720> you<00:05:04.010> will<00:05:05.010> find<00:05:05.160> yourself

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
something that you will find yourself

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.720 
something that you will find yourself
using<00:05:05.660> quite<00:05:06.660> a<00:05:06.690> bit<00:05:06.980> so<00:05:07.980> again<00:05:08.310> that's<00:05:08.460> the

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730 
using quite a bit so again that's the
