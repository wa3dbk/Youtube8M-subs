 [Music] 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.150
 hello hello youtuber os this is the area 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.130
 universal and here I bring you a new 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.260
 video in which I show you what is the 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.080
 best website to download 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.000
 nintendo ds games sure many 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.369
 of you have ever wanted 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.320
 download some nintendo game by 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.720
 internet and you have gotten into a 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.029
 authentic berenjenal because when 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.190
 downloads the games many of them ni 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.170
 they are even in Spanish or they contain 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.940
 files and folders that you do not know if 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.910
 they belong or not to the game you want 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.070
 in addition to downloaded games 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.390
 come a few files that are 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.400
 necessary for the correct 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.710
 operation of the game but that 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.540
 we erase without thinking 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.700
 that will not influence the execution of 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.420
 game and they chafed everything we had 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.240
 provided 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.640
 in this situation I have decided to carry out 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.070
 this tutorial the page that I come to 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.720
 show you is completely different to 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.449
 any other download page for 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.820
 ds games on this page the games 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.950
 they are downloaded quickly and efficiently 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.900
 safe since all the games are 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.970
 free of viruses and they come in a single 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.190
 file in nds format 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.690
 This facilitates the process of 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.610
 download and it ends with the 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.180
 complications when introducing 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.550
 the game to the good microsd card os 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.470
 I'll show the page first thing we're going 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.540
 to do is go to our browser by 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.120
 defect that in my case is the google 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.250
 chrome and on top of the url 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.830
 we copy the link that I will leave in the 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.120

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.530

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.430

 both of nintendo ds and of game boy and 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.850
 nintendo 3ds one of the things that most 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.740
 He has drawn attention on this page is 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.110
 that you can find the game you want to 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.780

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.460
 this page allows you to search the game 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.459
 what you like through a system of 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.770
 labels the labels are very varied 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.380
 and they are in the central column of 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.380
 the page and also by categories in the 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.510
 right column of the page I'm going to 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.580

 I'm going to click on the label 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.540
 design 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.849
 [Music] 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.920
 after clicking on the desired label 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.019
 we go down a little on the page and 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.450
 we will find the games linked to 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.000
 that label in the case of the label 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.069
 design the linked games are ar 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.129
 academic and the new york times' cross 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.650
 words under each game are found 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:52.170

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.849
 download them we just click 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.430
 over the corresponding link 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.290
 we wait 25 seconds of advertising 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.450
 Atf link and click on jump 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.159
 advertising in this way we 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.630
 we will find the game to 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:07.240
 download it 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.310
 A note to highlight on the page is 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.170
 the fact that all games are 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.900
 uploaded to very good servers 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.320
 quality as they are mediafire deposit files 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.480
 or lose on these servers especially 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.670
 in the last two the games do not 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.970
 they almost never eliminate what facilitates 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.100
 more people can download the game 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.230
 I'm going to download a random game 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.190
 with you to show you that no 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.190
 they have no viruses 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.860
 the game that I downloaded is called 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:41.500
 ghost ghost detective trick below 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.690
 of the game we will have two links one 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.000
 has the game uploaded in depot files 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.880
 and the second one has the game uploaded to 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.860
 mediafire I recommend you always 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.840
 look at the two links to see what 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.060
 servers the game is uploaded and 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.910
 Download it from the fastest link 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.040
 in this case the mediafire link is 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.810
 the fastest so I recommend that 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.180
 Download the games from this 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.760
 server whenever it is available 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.579
 I did not download the game because I already 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.590
 I have once downloaded to the folder 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.840
 downloads we will have a file in 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.970
 nds format with the game that we have 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.639
 downloaded at this point 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.430
 you will have to pass the nds file of 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.100
 game to a microsd card and then 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.860
 insert the micro sd in your nintendo 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.620
 through a flash card these 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.810
 flash cards receive many names and 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.530
 They are very varied although the best known 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.389
 is the r4 you can acquire the r4 by 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.090
 internet or in points of sale 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:43.220
 specialized in the subject after putting the 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.620
 micro sd on the nintendo you go to 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.830
 secluded games you search the game 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.349
