third<00:03:08.220> one<00:03:08.490> is<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.960> half<00:03:09.960> step<00:03:09.990> up<00:03:11.840> back<00:03:12.840> down<00:03:12.870> a

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
third one is a half step up back down a

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.210 
third one is a half step up back down a
half<00:03:13.410> step<00:03:14.030> then<00:03:15.030> back<00:03:15.240> down<00:03:15.270> a<00:03:15.510> whole<00:03:15.840> step

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
half step then back down a whole step

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.710 
half step then back down a whole step
and<00:03:17.220> you<00:03:17.520> strum<00:03:17.820> both<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.210> strings<00:03:18.510> together

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
and you strum both the strings together

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:36.759 
and you strum both the strings together
at<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.290> same<00:03:19.560> time<00:03:19.860> as<00:03:20.160> you're<00:03:20.310> playing

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.259 

okay<00:03:37.769> so<00:03:37.830> that's<00:03:38.190> that<00:03:38.400> that's<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.879> basic

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
okay so that's that that's the basic

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:54.900 
okay so that's that that's the basic
foundation<00:03:39.780> of<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:40.019> one<00:03:40.170> more<00:03:40.290> time

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.479 

okay<00:03:55.910> then<00:03:56.209> I<00:03:56.330> go<00:03:56.480> up<00:03:56.569> to<00:03:56.599> the<00:03:56.930> D<00:03:57.200> chord<00:03:57.620> which

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
okay then I go up to the D chord which

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.520 
okay then I go up to the D chord which
on<00:03:58.670> the<00:03:58.790> neck<00:03:58.940> go<00:03:59.120> up<00:03:59.239> and<00:03:59.450> it's<00:03:59.599> one<00:03:59.900> two<00:04:00.140> three

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
on the neck go up and it's one two three

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.949 
on the neck go up and it's one two three
four<00:04:00.830> five<00:04:00.860> frets<00:04:01.400> up<00:04:01.610> and<00:04:01.879> the<00:04:02.390> root<00:04:02.569> note<00:04:02.780> is

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
four five frets up and the root note is

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:09.910 
four five frets up and the root note is
on<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:03.440> a<00:04:03.769> string<00:04:05.019> you<00:04:06.019> play<00:04:06.230> this<00:04:08.200> deep<00:04:09.200> barre

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
on the a string you play this deep barre

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.009 
on the a string you play this deep barre
chord<00:04:10.220> but<00:04:10.910> you're<00:04:11.090> only<00:04:11.150> playing<00:04:11.420> these<00:04:11.720> two

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
chord but you're only playing these two

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.400 
chord but you're only playing these two
strings<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:12.950> a<00:04:12.980> and<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:13.310> D<00:04:13.400> string<00:04:13.760> on<00:04:14.030> it<00:04:14.410> and

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
strings the a and the D string on it and

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.810 
strings the a and the D string on it and
you're<00:04:15.739> doing<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.040> same<00:04:16.250> thing<00:04:16.519> but<00:04:16.549> then

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
you're doing the same thing but then

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.629 
you're doing the same thing but then
with<00:04:17.000> your<00:04:17.120> pinkie<00:04:17.660> you<00:04:18.100> stretch<00:04:19.100> up<00:04:19.310> a<00:04:19.459> whole

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
with your pinkie you stretch up a whole

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.780 
with your pinkie you stretch up a whole
step<00:04:19.669> and<00:04:20.239> then<00:04:20.600> a<00:04:20.630> half<00:04:20.930> step<00:04:21.320> so<00:04:21.620> you<00:04:22.610> like

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
step and then a half step so you like

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:39.640 
step and then a half step so you like
this<00:04:37.180> okay<00:04:38.180> so<00:04:38.240> you<00:04:38.570> got<00:04:38.690> that<00:04:38.930> same<00:04:39.410> rhythm

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
this okay so you got that same rhythm

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.409 
this okay so you got that same rhythm
pattern<00:04:40.130> but<00:04:40.280> you're<00:04:40.430> just<00:04:40.669> barring<00:04:41.060> up<00:04:41.210> here

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
pattern but you're just barring up here

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:49.610 
pattern but you're just barring up here
on<00:04:41.570> the<00:04:41.690> D<00:04:41.870> then<00:04:42.620> goes<00:04:42.830> back<00:04:42.979> down<00:04:43.190> to<00:04:43.370> the<00:04:43.490> a

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:05:03.450 

and<00:04:50.620> down<00:04:50.830> to<00:04:50.980> the<00:04:51.040> e<00:04:54.030> into<00:04:55.030> the<00:04:55.120> D<00:05:02.460> then

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
and down to the e into the D then

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.910 
and down to the e into the D then
resolve<00:05:04.150> on<00:05:04.300> the<00:05:04.420> E<00:05:04.450> and<00:05:05.080> back<00:05:06.070> to<00:05:06.220> the<00:05:06.340> a

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
resolve on the E and back to the a

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.960 
resolve on the E and back to the a
oh<00:05:08.060> ok<00:05:09.200> so<00:05:10.200> that's<00:05:10.680> basically<00:05:10.950> the<00:05:11.370> rhythm<00:05:11.790> to

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
oh ok so that's basically the rhythm to

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.290 
oh ok so that's basically the rhythm to
it<00:05:12.000> and<00:05:12.270> how<00:05:12.630> you<00:05:12.960> do<00:05:13.200> the<00:05:13.320> finger<00:05:13.530> into<00:05:13.830> it

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
it and how you do the finger into it

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.540 
it and how you do the finger into it
it's<00:05:15.300> basically<00:05:15.630> what<00:05:15.870> they<00:05:15.990> call<00:05:16.200> a<00:05:16.550> 145

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
it's basically what they call a 145

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.670 
it's basically what they call a 145
progression<00:05:18.240> and<00:05:18.390> there<00:05:19.020> isn't<00:05:19.350> it's<00:05:19.470> called

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
progression and there isn't it's called

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.300 
progression and there isn't it's called
a<00:05:19.830> 145<00:05:20.820> progression<00:05:21.480> is<00:05:21.630> because<00:05:22.500> the<00:05:22.740> one<00:05:23.010> is

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
a 145 progression is because the one is

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.530 
a 145 progression is because the one is
the<00:05:23.550> root<00:05:23.730> note<00:05:23.970> which<00:05:24.210> is<00:05:24.390> a<00:05:25.310> the<00:05:26.310> four<00:05:26.790> is<00:05:27.030> the

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
the root note which is a the four is the

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.630 
the root note which is a the four is the
fourth<00:05:27.870> note<00:05:28.140> in<00:05:28.320> the<00:05:28.410> a<00:05:28.440> major<00:05:28.920> scale<00:05:29.130> which

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
fourth note in the a major scale which

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.940 
fourth note in the a major scale which
is<00:05:30.080> d<00:05:31.130> the<00:05:32.130> five<00:05:32.460> is<00:05:33.290> the<00:05:34.290> fifth<00:05:34.500> note<00:05:34.680> in<00:05:34.860> the

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
is d the five is the fifth note in the

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.300 
is d the five is the fifth note in the
major<00:05:35.160> scale<00:05:35.400> which<00:05:35.940> is<00:05:36.120> e<00:05:36.390> an<00:05:37.380> a<00:05:37.680> major<00:05:37.830> scale

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
major scale which is e an a major scale

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.450 
major scale which is e an a major scale
and<00:05:38.550> back<00:05:38.970> down<00:05:39.180> to<00:05:39.330> a<00:05:39.360> so<00:05:40.080> it's<00:05:40.230> a<00:05:40.290> 145<00:05:41.040> blues

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
and back down to a so it's a 145 blues

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.250 
and back down to a so it's a 145 blues
progression<00:05:42.090> that's<00:05:42.390> how<00:05:42.630> they<00:05:42.780> get<00:05:43.020> those

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
progression that's how they get those

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.500 
progression that's how they get those
terms<00:05:43.560> 145<00:05:44.400> is<00:05:44.610> all<00:05:44.790> based<00:05:45.000> on<00:05:45.180> the<00:05:45.360> major

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
terms 145 is all based on the major

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.410 
terms 145 is all based on the major
scale<00:05:45.890> anyway<00:05:46.890> one<00:05:47.610> more<00:05:47.670> time<00:05:47.790> I'll<00:05:48.150> show<00:05:48.360> you

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420 
scale anyway one more time I'll show you

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.960 
scale anyway one more time I'll show you
the<00:05:48.540> rhythm<00:05:48.810> from<00:05:49.380> back<00:05:49.590> here<00:05:49.860> and<00:05:50.070> hopefully

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
the rhythm from back here and hopefully

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.640 
the rhythm from back here and hopefully
you'll<00:05:51.330> remember<00:05:51.600> the<00:05:51.840> fingerings<00:05:52.260> on<00:05:52.410> how<00:05:52.590> to

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
you'll remember the fingerings on how to

00:05:52.650 --> 00:06:24.559 
you'll remember the fingerings on how to
do<00:05:52.830> it

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:24.569 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:26.879 

and<00:06:25.569> that's<00:06:25.780> it<00:06:26.050> and<00:06:26.080> I'll<00:06:26.229> do<00:06:26.380> another<00:06:26.500> video

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:26.889 
and that's it and I'll do another video

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:29.159 
and that's it and I'll do another video
to<00:06:27.250> on<00:06:27.430> some<00:06:27.639> other<00:06:27.849> types<00:06:28.240> of<00:06:28.449> blues<00:06:28.720> rhythms

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:29.169 
to on some other types of blues rhythms

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:31.020 
to on some other types of blues rhythms
but<00:06:29.380> that's<00:06:29.560> like<00:06:29.800> your<00:06:30.009> basic<00:06:30.280> blues<00:06:30.849> rhythm

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.030 
but that's like your basic blues rhythm

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.590 
but that's like your basic blues rhythm
all<00:06:31.509> right<00:06:31.630> take<00:06:31.840> care<00:06:31.900> bye
