00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
little bit more about the bracing and

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.080 
little bit more about the bracing and
you<00:01:29.690> know<00:01:29.810> classical<00:01:30.259> guitars<00:01:30.530> in<00:01:30.710> general

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
you know classical guitars in general

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.730 
you know classical guitars in general
classical<00:01:32.090> guitars<00:01:32.390> as<00:01:32.630> you<00:01:32.990> can<00:01:33.140> see<00:01:33.380> just<00:01:33.560> by

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
classical guitars as you can see just by

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.499 
classical guitars as you can see just by
looking<00:01:33.770> at<00:01:34.220> it<00:01:34.340> are<00:01:34.430> very<00:01:34.729> very<00:01:35.270> different

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
looking at it are very very different

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.060 
looking at it are very very different
looking<00:01:35.960> than<00:01:36.020> a<00:01:36.229> steel<00:01:36.530> string<00:01:36.740> guitar

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
looking than a steel string guitar

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.609 
looking than a steel string guitar
obviously<00:01:37.940> the<00:01:38.420> nylon<00:01:38.750> strings<00:01:39.050> is<00:01:39.200> a<00:01:39.229> huge

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
obviously the nylon strings is a huge

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.160 
obviously the nylon strings is a huge
huge<00:01:39.920> indicator<00:01:40.399> here<00:01:40.670> and<00:01:41.570> then<00:01:41.690> also<00:01:41.810> as<00:01:41.990> Tim

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
huge indicator here and then also as Tim

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.469 
huge indicator here and then also as Tim
mentioned<00:01:42.289> the<00:01:42.560> nut<00:01:42.800> width<00:01:43.070> is<00:01:43.280> is<00:01:44.030> much

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
mentioned the nut width is is much

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.940 
mentioned the nut width is is much
greater<00:01:44.720> than<00:01:44.899> that<00:01:45.260> of<00:01:45.320> a<00:01:45.470> steel<00:01:45.680> string

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
greater than that of a steel string

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.609 
greater than that of a steel string
guitar<00:01:46.220> and<00:01:46.840> basically<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:48.049> reason<00:01:48.200> why<00:01:48.560> is

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
guitar and basically the reason why is

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.920 
guitar and basically the reason why is
because<00:01:48.860> nylon<00:01:49.670> strings<00:01:50.000> have<00:01:50.210> a<00:01:50.240> much<00:01:50.630> larger

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
because nylon strings have a much larger

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.719 
because nylon strings have a much larger
vibrating<00:01:51.680> pattern<00:01:51.890> than<00:01:52.190> the<00:01:52.250> steel<00:01:52.460> string

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
vibrating pattern than the steel string

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.160 
vibrating pattern than the steel string
does<00:01:52.909> because<00:01:53.090> they're<00:01:53.240> under<00:01:53.479> less<00:01:53.690> tension

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
does because they're under less tension

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.219 
does because they're under less tension
so<00:01:55.010> you<00:01:55.400> need<00:01:55.610> that<00:01:56.000> room<00:01:56.240> up<00:01:56.479> here<00:01:56.750> not<00:01:57.080> only

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
so you need that room up here not only

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.450 
so you need that room up here not only
for<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.560> difficult<00:01:57.950> fingerings<00:01:58.340> of

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
for the difficult fingerings of

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.310 
for the difficult fingerings of
classical<00:01:58.850> guitar<00:01:59.119> but<00:01:59.420> also<00:01:59.780> so<00:01:59.930> the<00:02:00.049> strings

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
classical guitar but also so the strings

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.140 
classical guitar but also so the strings
can<00:02:00.530> move<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:00.979> not<00:02:01.310> bump<00:02:01.610> into<00:02:01.820> each<00:02:01.850> other

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
can move and not bump into each other

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.880 
can move and not bump into each other
and<00:02:02.360> there's<00:02:03.110> also<00:02:03.229> Tim<00:02:03.500> mentioned<00:02:03.680> the

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
and there's also Tim mentioned the

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.719 
and there's also Tim mentioned the
bracing<00:02:04.280> is<00:02:04.340> extremely<00:02:04.790> different<00:02:05.000> as<00:02:06.580> you<00:02:07.580> go

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
bracing is extremely different as you go

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.359 
bracing is extremely different as you go
from<00:02:07.880> steel<00:02:08.179> string<00:02:08.479> to<00:02:08.720> a<00:02:09.350> classical<00:02:10.130> or<00:02:10.280> a

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
from steel string to a classical or a

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.390 
from steel string to a classical or a
nylon<00:02:10.519> string<00:02:10.850> guitar<00:02:11.209> you<00:02:11.720> lose<00:02:11.989> about

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
nylon string guitar you lose about

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.280 
nylon string guitar you lose about
probably<00:02:13.400> 40<00:02:13.760> pounds<00:02:14.060> of<00:02:14.120> tension<00:02:14.330> so<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.049> top

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
probably 40 pounds of tension so the top

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.590 
probably 40 pounds of tension so the top
can<00:02:15.500> be<00:02:15.620> much<00:02:15.890> lighter<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.610> that<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.239> bracing

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
can be much lighter and that the bracing

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.360 
can be much lighter and that the bracing
on<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.750> classical<00:02:18.170> guitar<00:02:18.260> is<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.830> looks<00:02:19.220> like

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
on the classical guitar is it looks like

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.520 
on the classical guitar is it looks like
a<00:02:19.400> fan<00:02:19.700> that's<00:02:19.910> called<00:02:20.090> fan<00:02:20.330> bracing<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:21.230> what

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
a fan that's called fan bracing and what

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.650 
a fan that's called fan bracing and what
it<00:02:21.620> is<00:02:21.739> is<00:02:21.950> it's<00:02:22.190> it's<00:02:22.459> basically<00:02:22.670> five<00:02:23.269> or<00:02:23.450> six

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
it is is it's it's basically five or six

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.150 
it is is it's it's basically five or six
pieces<00:02:23.870> of<00:02:24.079> wood<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:24.260> extend<00:02:24.769> out<00:02:24.890> from<00:02:25.040> the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
pieces of wood that extend out from the

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.729 
pieces of wood that extend out from the
bridge<00:02:25.660> to<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.780> lower<00:02:26.959> bout<00:02:27.200> of<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.350> guitar

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
bridge to the lower bout of the guitar

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.600 
bridge to the lower bout of the guitar
and<00:02:29.230> much<00:02:30.230> less<00:02:30.500> bracing<00:02:31.040> on<00:02:31.130> a<00:02:31.160> classical

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
and much less bracing on a classical

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.130 
and much less bracing on a classical
guitar<00:02:31.880> than<00:02:32.060> on<00:02:32.209> steel<00:02:32.510> string<00:02:32.720> guitar<00:02:32.930> just

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
guitar than on steel string guitar just

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.890 
guitar than on steel string guitar just
due<00:02:33.350> to<00:02:33.380> that<00:02:33.680> just<00:02:34.519> just<00:02:35.000> as<00:02:35.299> it<00:02:35.450> dearly<00:02:35.720> as<00:02:35.870> a

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
due to that just just as it dearly as a

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.789 
due to that just just as it dearly as a
function<00:02:36.290> of<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.500> aid<00:02:36.650> having<00:02:37.010> less<00:02:37.190> tension

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
function of the aid having less tension

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.020 
function of the aid having less tension
some<00:02:39.799> of<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.010> other<00:02:40.160> obviously<00:02:40.640> it's<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:40.820> much

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
some of the other obviously it's a much

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.910 
some of the other obviously it's a much
darker<00:02:41.329> sound<00:02:41.840> because<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.320> strings<00:02:42.739> are<00:02:42.890> not

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
darker sound because the strings are not

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.090 
darker sound because the strings are not
under<00:02:43.370> that<00:02:43.519> tension<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.560> you<00:02:45.560> get<00:02:45.709> that<00:02:45.860> kind

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
under that tension and you get that kind

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.080 
under that tension and you get that kind
of<00:02:46.190> low<00:02:46.870> very<00:02:47.870> pretty<00:02:48.260> pretty<00:02:49.090> classical

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
on guitar one of the biggest things most

on guitar one of the biggest things most
people's<00:02:58.130> people<00:02:58.430> are<00:02:58.610> worried<00:02:58.850> about<00:02:58.910> is<00:02:59.090> is

it gonna hurt my fingers and it seems a

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.780 
it gonna hurt my fingers and it seems a
little<00:03:02.060> silly<00:03:02.330> but<00:03:02.690> people<00:03:02.990> will<00:03:03.170> use<00:03:03.830> nylon

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
little silly but people will use nylon

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.820 
little silly but people will use nylon
string<00:03:05.030> guitars<00:03:05.360> because<00:03:05.720> it's<00:03:06.230> less<00:03:06.440> tension

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
string guitars because it's less tension

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.080 
string guitars because it's less tension
it's<00:03:06.980> less<00:03:07.220> you<00:03:07.490> know<00:03:07.580> you<00:03:07.640> know<00:03:07.850> you<00:03:07.910> don't

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
it's less you know you know you don't

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.670 
it's less you know you know you don't
have<00:03:08.209> to<00:03:08.330> push<00:03:08.510> down<00:03:08.690> quite<00:03:09.050> as<00:03:09.200> hard<00:03:09.410> and<00:03:09.620> it

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
have to push down quite as hard and it

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.990 
have to push down quite as hard and it
doesn't<00:03:09.950> hurt<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.190> fingers<00:03:10.490> quite<00:03:10.670> as<00:03:10.819> much

doesn't hurt the fingers quite as much

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.600 
doesn't hurt the fingers quite as much
that's<00:03:11.780> a<00:03:11.930> plus<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.770> drawback<00:03:13.190> is<00:03:13.370> you've

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
that's a plus the drawback is you've

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.170 
that's a plus the drawback is you've
gotten<00:03:13.910> used<00:03:14.120> to<00:03:14.270> you<00:03:15.140> know<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:16.280> width<00:03:16.880> of<00:03:17.030> the

nylon string guitar and when you make
the<00:03:24.980> changeover<00:03:25.430> just<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.330> way<00:03:26.480> you<00:03:26.540> play<00:03:26.870> is

the changeover just the way you play is
going<00:03:27.170> to<00:03:27.230> be<00:03:27.290> slightly<00:03:27.560> different<00:03:27.739> but<00:03:28.459> you

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
going to be slightly different but you

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.580 
going to be slightly different but you
know<00:03:28.790> not<00:03:29.060> not<00:03:29.360> hugely<00:03:29.780> it's<00:03:30.050> okay<00:03:30.320> to<00:03:30.380> learn

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
know not not hugely it's okay to learn
