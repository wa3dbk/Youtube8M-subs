intermediate videos check them out we
got<00:00:18.100> those<00:00:18.250> too<00:00:18.550> but<00:00:19.119> this<00:00:19.210> is<00:00:19.390> this<00:00:19.630> could

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
got those too but this is this could

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.210 
got those too but this is this could
actually<00:00:20.020> be<00:00:20.199> geared<00:00:20.500> towards<00:00:20.740> any<00:00:20.859> style

jazz<00:00:24.040> this<00:00:25.030> is<00:00:25.210> I<00:00:25.390> learned<00:00:25.840> this<00:00:25.990> in<00:00:26.170> a<00:00:26.230> jazz

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.440 
jazz this is I learned this in a jazz

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.140 
jazz this is I learned this in a jazz
context<00:00:26.980> but<00:00:27.100> like<00:00:27.340> i<00:00:27.460> said<00:00:27.490> this<00:00:27.760> can<00:00:27.940> be<00:00:28.000> used

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
context but like i said this can be used

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.270 
context but like i said this can be used
for<00:00:28.360> anything<00:00:28.539> what<00:00:29.200> it<00:00:29.320> is<00:00:29.500> is<00:00:29.740> called<00:00:30.160> the

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:30.280 
for anything what it is is called the

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.519 
for anything what it is is called the
diminished<00:00:30.670> scale<00:00:30.940> and<00:00:31.180> it's<00:00:31.780> a<00:00:31.869> very<00:00:31.900> very

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
diminished scale and it's a very very

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.500 
diminished scale and it's a very very
cool<00:00:33.039> way<00:00:33.309> of<00:00:33.340> embellishing<00:00:33.910> a<00:00:34.090> diminished

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
cool way of embellishing a diminished

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.720 
cool way of embellishing a diminished
chord<00:00:34.750> and<00:00:34.899> there's<00:00:35.680> really<00:00:35.890> virtually

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
chord and there's really virtually

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.060 
chord and there's really virtually
endless<00:00:36.969> uses<00:00:37.390> for<00:00:37.750> the<00:00:37.840> scale<00:00:38.170> now<00:00:38.770> how<00:00:38.950> it

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
endless uses for the scale now how it

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.610 
endless uses for the scale now how it
works<00:00:39.310> in<00:00:39.610> theory<00:00:40.090> is<00:00:40.390> it<00:00:40.960> starts<00:00:41.320> with<00:00:41.560> a

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
works in theory is it starts with a

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.389 
works in theory is it starts with a
whole<00:00:41.890> step<00:00:42.190> and<00:00:42.870> then<00:00:43.870> a<00:00:43.930> half<00:00:44.140> step<00:00:44.410> and<00:00:45.160> then

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
whole step and then a half step and then

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.580 
whole step and then a half step and then
a<00:00:45.430> whole<00:00:45.670> step<00:00:45.940> half<00:00:46.270> step<00:00:46.329> whole<00:00:46.840> step<00:00:46.989> half

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
a whole step half step whole step half

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.170 
a whole step half step whole step half
step<00:00:47.649> forever<00:00:48.310> it<00:00:48.550> just<00:00:48.730> keeps<00:00:48.970> following

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
step forever it just keeps following

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.150 
step forever it just keeps following
that<00:00:49.480> pattern<00:00:49.690> so<00:00:50.410> take<00:00:50.620> a<00:00:50.649> look<00:00:50.890> at<00:00:51.040> the

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
that pattern so take a look at the

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.620 
that pattern so take a look at the
fingering<00:00:51.550> in<00:00:51.640> front<00:00:51.880> of<00:00:51.970> you<00:00:52.090> looks<00:00:52.390> a<00:00:52.510> little

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
fingering in front of you looks a little

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.049 
fingering in front of you looks a little
crazy<00:00:52.989> at<00:00:53.230> first<00:00:53.260> just<00:00:54.160> slowly<00:00:54.399> play<00:00:54.790> through

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
crazy at first just slowly play through

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:05.760 
crazy at first just slowly play through
it<00:01:03.449> notice<00:01:04.449> the<00:01:04.600> shift<00:01:04.869> in<00:01:05.019> the<00:01:05.049> position<00:01:05.590> on

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
it notice the shift in the position on

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:15.300 
it notice the shift in the position on
the<00:01:05.979> E<00:01:06.009> and<00:01:06.189> the<00:01:06.490> a<00:01:06.549> strings<00:01:14.100> it's<00:01:15.100> going<00:01:15.249> to

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
the E and the a strings it's going to

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.529 
the E and the a strings it's going to
feel<00:01:15.429> awkward<00:01:15.639> at<00:01:15.939> first<00:01:15.969> but<00:01:16.209> we'll<00:01:16.389> get<00:01:16.509> a

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
feel awkward at first but we'll get a

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:18.779 
feel awkward at first but we'll get a
lot<00:01:16.749> easier<00:01:16.959> over<00:01:17.319> time<00:01:17.350> now<00:01:18.249> how<00:01:18.399> the<00:01:18.459> scale

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
lot easier over time now how the scale

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:20.489 
lot easier over time now how the scale
is<00:01:18.969> used<00:01:18.999> obviously<00:01:19.659> over<00:01:19.869> diminished<00:01:20.229> chord

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:20.499 
is used obviously over diminished chord

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:22.789 
is used obviously over diminished chord
it<00:01:20.889> can<00:01:21.039> be<00:01:21.100> used<00:01:21.249> other<00:01:21.429> other<00:01:21.609> courts<00:01:22.029> too

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
it can be used other other courts too

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.940 
it can be used other other courts too
but<00:01:23.799> it<00:01:23.920> just<00:01:24.279> is<00:01:24.490> a<00:01:24.520> really<00:01:24.880> wacky<00:01:25.329> sounding

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
but it just is a really wacky sounding

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.879 
but it just is a really wacky sounding
scale<00:01:26.950> and<00:01:27.219> guys<00:01:28.090> who<00:01:28.299> have<00:01:28.420> used<00:01:28.569> this<00:01:28.889> John

00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:29.889 
scale and guys who have used this John

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:31.440 
scale and guys who have used this John
Coltrane<00:01:30.249> would<00:01:30.369> use<00:01:30.520> this<00:01:30.670> a<00:01:30.729> lot<00:01:30.850> eric

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
Coltrane would use this a lot eric

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.330 
Coltrane would use this a lot eric
dolphy<00:01:31.689> all<00:01:32.139> sorts<00:01:32.439> of<00:01:32.499> jazz<00:01:32.740> guys<00:01:33.009> but<00:01:33.310> I

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340

dolphy all sorts of jazz guys but I
don't<00:01:33.520> hear<00:01:33.670> this<00:01:33.849> scale<00:01:34.179> as<00:01:34.450> much<00:01:34.719> in<00:01:34.959> metal

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
don't hear this scale as much in metal

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:36.899 
don't hear this scale as much in metal
so<00:01:35.829> all<00:01:35.920> your<00:01:36.039> metal<00:01:36.249> players<00:01:36.459> out<00:01:36.670> there<00:01:36.700> I'd

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
so all your metal players out there I'd

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.849 
so all your metal players out there I'd
like<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.479> hear<00:01:37.959> you<00:01:38.049> guys<00:01:38.200> use<00:01:38.469> the<00:01:38.619> scale<00:01:38.799> a

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:38.859 
like to hear you guys use the scale a

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:41.069 
like to hear you guys use the scale a
little<00:01:39.130> bit<00:01:39.279> more<00:01:39.459> so<00:01:40.029> look<00:01:40.179> this<00:01:40.450> is<00:01:40.630> an<00:01:40.779> eight

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
little bit more so look this is an eight

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.050 
little bit more so look this is an eight
note<00:01:41.319> scale<00:01:41.380> as<00:01:41.950> opposed<00:01:42.279> to<00:01:42.429> major<00:01:42.639> scales

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
note scale as opposed to major scales

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.999 
note scale as opposed to major scales
which<00:01:43.299> are<00:01:43.450> seven<00:01:43.810> note<00:01:43.929> scale<00:01:43.959> and<00:01:44.649> what<00:01:44.979> that

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
which are seven note scale and what that

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.429 
which are seven note scale and what that
does<00:01:45.310> is<00:01:45.369> it<00:01:45.579> gives<00:01:45.909> us<00:01:46.119> perfect<00:01:47.079> symmetry

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
does is it gives us perfect symmetry

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.589 
does is it gives us perfect symmetry
with<00:01:47.770> rhythm<00:01:48.159> if<00:01:48.759> you<00:01:48.849> look<00:01:48.969> at<00:01:49.149> eight<00:01:49.329> notes

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:49.599 
with rhythm if you look at eight notes

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:51.510 
with rhythm if you look at eight notes
and<00:01:49.869> music<00:01:50.200> you<00:01:50.649> find<00:01:50.950> that<00:01:51.069> you<00:01:51.189> have<00:01:51.219> eight

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
and music you find that you have eight

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.609 
and music you find that you have eight
notes<00:01:51.819> per<00:01:52.359> measure<00:01:52.389> hence<00:01:52.959> the<00:01:53.109> term<00:01:53.349> eighth

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
notes per measure hence the term eighth

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.069 
notes per measure hence the term eighth
notes<00:01:53.889> now<00:01:54.579> say<00:01:55.119> if<00:01:55.179> you<00:01:55.299> have<00:01:55.389> eight<00:01:55.630> notes<00:01:55.869> in

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
notes now say if you have eight notes in

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.409 
notes now say if you have eight notes in
the<00:01:56.169> scale<00:01:56.469> it<00:01:56.799> perfectly<00:01:57.490> fits<00:01:57.849> into<00:01:58.179> a

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:58.419 
the scale it perfectly fits into a

00:01:58.419 --> 00:02:01.050 
the scale it perfectly fits into a
measure<00:01:58.719> of<00:01:58.840> four<00:01:59.229> four<00:01:59.560> time<00:01:59.799> so<00:02:00.729> take<00:02:01.029> a

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
measure of four four time so take a

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.050 
measure of four four time so take a
listen<00:02:01.270> to<00:02:01.450> this<00:02:01.539> and<00:02:01.899> count<00:02:02.709> with<00:02:02.950> me<00:02:03.159> one<00:02:03.880> and

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
listen to this and count with me one and

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.729 
listen to this and count with me one and
two<00:02:04.209> and<00:02:04.239> three<00:02:04.479> and<00:02:04.659> four<00:02:04.810> and<00:02:05.020> one<00:02:05.229> and<00:02:05.439> two

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:05.739 
two and three and four and one and two

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:07.379 
two and three and four and one and two
and<00:02:05.770> two<00:02:06.009> three<00:02:06.369> and<00:02:06.489> four<00:02:06.759> and<00:02:06.999> you'll<00:02:07.149> find

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:07.389 
and two three and four and you'll find

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:08.760 
and two three and four and you'll find
that<00:02:07.539> this<00:02:07.689> scale<00:02:07.959> is<00:02:07.989> going<00:02:08.080> to<00:02:08.229> be<00:02:08.319> perfectly

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
that this scale is going to be perfectly

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:29.830 
that this scale is going to be perfectly
symmetrical

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.210 

so<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:30.900> can<00:02:31.020> hear<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.440> rhythm<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.950> scale

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
so you can hear the rhythm of the scale

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.670 
so you can hear the rhythm of the scale
is<00:02:32.490> very<00:02:33.000> precise<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:33.780> fits<00:02:34.020> perfectly<00:02:34.500> in

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
is very precise and it fits perfectly in

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.710 
is very precise and it fits perfectly in
four-four<00:02:35.160> time<00:02:35.430> now<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.150> other<00:02:36.390> great<00:02:36.660> thing

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
four-four time now the other great thing

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.050 
four-four time now the other great thing
about<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.260> diminished<00:02:37.590> scale<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:38.340> repeats<00:02:38.760> in

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
about the diminished scale it repeats in

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.300 
about the diminished scale it repeats in
minor<00:02:39.420> thirds<00:02:39.810> in<00:02:40.440> other<00:02:40.560> words<00:02:40.770> whatever<00:02:41.070> you

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
minor thirds in other words whatever you

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.140 
minor thirds in other words whatever you
play<00:02:41.520> here<00:02:43.130> you<00:02:44.130> jump<00:02:44.400> up<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.640> minor<00:02:44.880> third

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
play here you jump up a minor third

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.760 
play here you jump up a minor third
which<00:02:45.390> is<00:02:45.510> three<00:02:45.780> frets<00:02:46.020> on<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.320> guitar<00:02:46.590> it

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
which is three frets on the guitar it

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.360 
which is three frets on the guitar it
can<00:02:46.890> be<00:02:46.980> played<00:02:47.190> here<00:02:47.370> again<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.130> on<00:02:50.220> and

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
can be played here again and so on and

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.120 
can be played here again and so on and
so<00:02:50.400> forth<00:02:53.810> it's<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.870> perfect<00:02:55.290> scale<00:02:55.620> for<00:02:56.010> that

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
so forth it's a perfect scale for that

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.580 
so forth it's a perfect scale for that
reason<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.550> because<00:02:56.670> it's<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.420> repeats<00:02:58.140> every

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
reason and because it's it repeats every

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.460 
reason and because it's it repeats every
three<00:02:59.040> frets<00:02:59.340> there's<00:03:00.090> only<00:03:00.300> three<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:00.960> these

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
three frets there's only three of these

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.860 
three frets there's only three of these
scales<00:03:01.830> which<00:03:02.760> makes<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.120> lot<00:03:03.210> easier<00:03:03.270> major

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
scales which makes it a lot easier major

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.350 
scales which makes it a lot easier major
scales<00:03:04.230> there's<00:03:04.500> 12<00:03:04.880> you<00:03:05.880> know<00:03:06.030> there's<00:03:06.300> only

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
scales there's 12 you know there's only

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.320 
scales there's 12 you know there's only
three<00:03:06.810> of<00:03:06.840> these<00:03:07.050> so<00:03:07.830> what<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:08.760> means<00:03:09.120> is<00:03:09.270> no

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
three of these so what that means is no

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.640 
three of these so what that means is no
matter<00:03:09.450> where<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:09.900> are<00:03:10.230> in<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.410> fretboard

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
matter where you are in the fretboard

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.260 
matter where you are in the fretboard
there's<00:03:11.070> one<00:03:11.250> of<00:03:11.340> these<00:03:11.460> close<00:03:11.730> by<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:12.180> you

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
there's one of these close by that you

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.880 
there's one of these close by that you
can<00:03:12.420> grab<00:03:12.630> that's<00:03:13.260> going<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.500> sound<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.770> little

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
can grab that's going to sound a little

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.280 
can grab that's going to sound a little
wacky<00:03:14.430> now<00:03:15.240> let<00:03:15.390> me<00:03:15.420> just<00:03:15.510> play<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.870> couple<00:03:16.080> my

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
wacky now let me just play a couple my

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.650 
wacky now let me just play a couple my
favorite<00:03:16.560> licks<00:03:16.740> using<00:03:17.040> this<00:03:17.160> and<00:03:17.540> check<00:03:18.540> it

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
favorite licks using this and check it

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:33.740 
favorite licks using this and check it
out<00:03:30.320> so<00:03:31.320> you<00:03:31.350> can<00:03:31.470> hear<00:03:31.790> very<00:03:32.790> very<00:03:33.330> very

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
out so you can hear very very very

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.780 
out so you can hear very very very
interesting<00:03:34.470> sounds<00:03:34.890> repeat<00:03:35.370> some<00:03:35.580> minor

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
interesting sounds repeat some minor

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.270 
interesting sounds repeat some minor
thirds<00:03:36.180> you<00:03:36.420> can<00:03:36.570> play<00:03:36.750> this<00:03:36.990> over<00:03:37.980> anything

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
thirds you can play this over anything

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.460 
thirds you can play this over anything
really<00:03:38.700> it<00:03:38.910> may<00:03:39.000> not<00:03:39.150> sound<00:03:39.420> that<00:03:39.660> great<00:03:39.900> but

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
really it may not sound that great but

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.890 
really it may not sound that great but
it<00:03:40.620> sounds<00:03:40.950> quirky<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:41.580> I<00:03:42.210> really<00:03:42.480> enjoy<00:03:42.750> the

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
it sounds quirky and I really enjoy the

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.390 
it sounds quirky and I really enjoy the
sound<00:03:43.110> of<00:03:43.230> it<00:03:43.320> so<00:03:43.770> again<00:03:43.980> that's<00:03:44.130> the

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
sound of it so again that's the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.140 
sound of it so again that's the
diminished<00:03:44.850> scale<00:03:45.209> thanks<00:03:45.990> for<00:03:46.110> watching
