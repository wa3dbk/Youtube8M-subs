00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
and it's two gigs so that's definitely a

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.630 
and it's two gigs so that's definitely a
decent<00:00:58.670> amount<00:00:59.290> to<00:01:00.290> put<00:01:00.890> music<00:01:00.980> on<00:01:01.370> and

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
transfer it over and it made it a little

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.740 
transfer it over and it made it a little
step-by-step<00:01:04.460> video<00:01:04.760> of<00:01:05.059> what<00:01:05.299> you<00:01:05.479> need<00:01:05.630> to
