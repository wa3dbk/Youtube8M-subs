here<00:02:27.420> you're<00:02:27.510> just<00:02:27.690> going<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.900> go<00:02:27.990> into

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
here you're just going to go into

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.390 
here you're just going to go into
Sceptile<00:02:29.520> uh<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:31.290> take<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.860> wild<00:02:32.190> charge

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
Sceptile uh to take the wild charge

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.010 
Sceptile uh to take the wild charge
however<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.300> doesn't<00:02:33.420> really<00:02:33.630> take<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:33.930> out

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
however it doesn't really take it out

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.270 
however it doesn't really take it out
well<00:02:34.220> so<00:02:35.220> I'm<00:02:35.550> thinking<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.970> myself<00:02:36.000> as<00:02:36.420> itself

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
well so I'm thinking to myself as itself

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.970 
well so I'm thinking to myself as itself
let's<00:02:38.280> just<00:02:38.520> oh<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:40.050> got<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.320> crit<00:02:40.650> thats<00:02:40.800> why<00:02:40.950> i

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
let's just oh I got a crit thats why i

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.260 
let's just oh I got a crit thats why i
didn't<00:02:41.220> take<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.580> well<00:02:41.760> well<00:02:42.120> that

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
didn't take you that well well that

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.560 
didn't take you that well well that
explains<00:02:42.600> it<00:02:43.110> so<00:02:43.470> anyway<00:02:43.740> I<00:02:43.770> was<00:02:44.070> like<00:02:44.190> so

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
explains it so anyway I was like so

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.100 
explains it so anyway I was like so
let's<00:02:45.570> just<00:02:46.220> stay<00:02:47.220> in<00:02:47.460> if<00:02:47.850> he<00:02:48.090> decides<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:48.810> kill

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
let's just stay in if he decides to kill

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.140 
let's just stay in if he decides to kill
me<00:02:49.290> that's<00:02:49.620> fine<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:50.130> know<00:02:50.160> if<00:02:50.460> not<00:02:50.670> maybe

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
me that's fine you know if not maybe

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.590 
me that's fine you know if not maybe
he's<00:02:51.390> choice<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:51.990> we<00:02:52.050> can<00:02:52.230> see<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:53.340> know

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
he's choice and we can see you know

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.930 
he's choice and we can see you know
what's<00:02:54.600> going<00:02:54.870> on<00:02:55.020> here<00:02:55.500> he<00:02:56.130> has<00:02:56.220> left<00:02:56.430> over<00:02:56.760> so

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
what's going on here he has left over so

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.050 
what's going on here he has left over so
so<00:02:57.180> that<00:02:57.420> probably<00:02:58.050> means<00:02:58.200> he's<00:02:58.650> like<00:02:58.830> I<00:02:59.160> don't

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
so that probably means he's like I don't

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.910 
so that probably means he's like I don't
know<00:03:00.270> like<00:03:00.330> sub<00:03:00.780> seed<00:03:01.050> with<00:03:01.230> two<00:03:01.350> attacks<00:03:01.680> may

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
know like sub seed with two attacks may

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.210 
know like sub seed with two attacks may
be<00:03:02.480> right<00:03:03.480> that<00:03:03.780> seems<00:03:04.140> like<00:03:04.350> a<00:03:04.410> logical<00:03:04.680> set

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
be right that seems like a logical set

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.340 
be right that seems like a logical set
right<00:03:05.460> so<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:06.390> go<00:03:06.690> out<00:03:06.720> into<00:03:06.960> bird<00:03:07.110> plane

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
right so I go out into bird plane

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.900 
right so I go out into bird plane
thinking<00:03:08.100> that<00:03:08.250> he<00:03:08.370> thinks<00:03:08.610> I'm<00:03:08.670> going<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.850> be

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
thinking that he thinks I'm going to be

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.720 
thinking that he thinks I'm going to be
scarf<00:03:09.300> so<00:03:09.570> like<00:03:09.900> hey<00:03:10.140> maybe<00:03:10.560> Hilda<00:03:11.130> switch<00:03:11.370> but

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
scarf so like hey maybe Hilda switch but

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:12.890 
scarf so like hey maybe Hilda switch but
no<00:03:11.850> he<00:03:12.030> doesn't<00:03:12.330> he's<00:03:12.420> can<00:03:12.570> go<00:03:12.660> for<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:12.810> in

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
no he doesn't he's can go for it in

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.120 
no he doesn't he's can go for it in
power<00:03:13.050> which<00:03:13.200> actually<00:03:13.350> cuz<00:03:13.590> that<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.770> be<00:03:13.860> fire

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
power which actually cuz that to be fire

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.510 
power which actually cuz that to be fire
because<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.810> can't<00:03:16.080> seed<00:03:16.830> things<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.400> are

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
because you can't seed things that are

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.320 
because you can't seed things that are
grass<00:03:17.760> so<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.630> need<00:03:18.780> fire<00:03:19.020> moves<00:03:19.490> to<00:03:20.490> take

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
grass so you need fire moves to take

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.460 
grass so you need fire moves to take
that<00:03:21.480> out<00:03:21.690> so<00:03:22.670> logic<00:03:23.780> gotta<00:03:24.780> go<00:03:24.930> out<00:03:25.020> and<00:03:25.140> Susan

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
that out so logic gotta go out and Susan

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.730 
that out so logic gotta go out and Susan
now<00:03:25.590> Susan<00:03:26.070> is<00:03:26.280> my<00:03:26.850> friend<00:03:27.150> my<00:03:28.020> friend<00:03:28.170> Susan

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
now Susan is my friend my friend Susan

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.790 
now Susan is my friend my friend Susan
is<00:03:29.220> going<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:29.850> roll<00:03:30.240> over<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.320> take<00:03:31.410> with<00:03:31.680> an

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
earthquake not even going to wait for it

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.580 
earthquake not even going to wait for it

would<00:06:08.580> have<00:06:08.610> been<00:06:08.759> better<00:06:08.909> because<00:06:09.599> like

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:10.729 
would have been better because like

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:13.369 
would have been better because like
assume<00:06:11.729> I<00:06:12.029> just<00:06:12.389> lived<00:06:12.599> a<00:06:12.689> size<00:06:12.870> shock<00:06:13.110> and

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:13.379 
assume I just lived a size shock and

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:17.420 
assume I just lived a size shock and
then<00:06:14.339> I<00:06:14.879> went<00:06:15.810> for<00:06:15.990> a<00:06:16.050> tebow<00:06:16.409> and<00:06:16.740> killed<00:06:17.039> the

then I went for a tebow and killed the
thing<00:06:17.849> the<00:06:18.719> sloping<00:06:19.139> and<00:06:19.490> then<00:06:20.490> he<00:06:20.580> went<00:06:20.669> to

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 
thing the sloping and then he went to

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:22.550 
thing the sloping and then he went to
San<00:06:20.939> Geno<00:06:21.240> and<00:06:21.509> I<00:06:21.659> failed<00:06:21.900> the<00:06:22.050> keel<00:06:22.289> and<00:06:22.319> then

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
San Geno and I failed the keel and then

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.059 
San Geno and I failed the keel and then
he<00:06:22.650> killed<00:06:22.830> me<00:06:22.949> with<00:06:23.009> a<00:06:23.099> tail<00:06:23.250> flap<00:06:23.779> then<00:06:25.069> he

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:26.069 
he killed me with a tail flap then he

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:31.430 
he killed me with a tail flap then he
would<00:06:26.310> have<00:06:26.550> just

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.470 

they're<00:06:31.680> killed<00:06:32.040> me<00:06:32.310> and<00:06:32.610> died<00:06:32.850> to<00:06:33.060> life<00:06:33.240> orb

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:33.480 
they're killed me and died to life orb

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.020 
they're killed me and died to life orb
or<00:06:33.980> fail<00:06:34.980> to<00:06:35.010> kill<00:06:35.280> me<00:06:35.460> and<00:06:35.520> I<00:06:35.610> would<00:06:35.730> have<00:06:35.820> won

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.030 
or fail to kill me and I would have won

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.460 
or fail to kill me and I would have won
so<00:06:36.360> I<00:06:36.390> the<00:06:36.600> way<00:06:36.810> the<00:06:36.990> ending<00:06:37.200> would<00:06:37.260> have<00:06:37.380> been

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:37.470 
so I the way the ending would have been

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.150 
so I the way the ending would have been
cooler<00:06:37.740> I<00:06:38.240> don't<00:06:39.240> know<00:06:39.330> you<00:06:39.720> can<00:06:39.870> go<00:06:40.560> away<00:06:41.010> now
