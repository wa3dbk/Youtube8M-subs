 people around the world is 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.940
 welcome to the opening of many 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.849
 avalanche boxes and to see if 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.370
 we managed to get lr I told you that the 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.730
 only two weapons that can come out comes 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.590
 being this and apart from those that 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.270
 they come out in the deployments that those 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.080
 they can always come out 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.540
 this weapon itself is bad and the other is 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.120
 half bad too but it's not so bad 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.720
 like the other 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:32.630
 I have both, but you already know that 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.390
 there are never enough left over but we are going to try to get 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.900
 to the avalanche opening 10 in 10 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.900
 small boxes 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.050
 and here we accelerate it 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.220
 as you will know before I do not have any 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.530
 still 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.370
 let's hope I do not do the eau and that I do not 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.370
 leave the er 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.670
 it's amazing that they come out duplicate not 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.480
 I only have one open 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.480
 nothing happens 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.700
 it's amazing that they are coming out 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.740
 duplicates navas I have two open no 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.119
 important 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.869
 everything can not be how to do this is 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.869
 amazing 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.460
 yosano does not come out repeated because it no longer 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.200
 you can go by 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.900
 because he had already put together a good 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.590
 number 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.630
 there is no serious this is incredible I have 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.410
 had to fill the action bar 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.710
 so that it does not come out repeating this absurd 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.710
 but good 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:56.520
 that is that dark but what madness 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.150
 I only have three covers and they come out 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.150
 repeated 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.640
 is not this 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.210
 this is amazing seriously this is 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.210
 amazing 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.720
 They have already left 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.720
 repeated absolutely all 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.690
 wow it is impossible to believe this 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.680
 I believe that it will not take balance in this 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.030
 chance 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.420
 I think this thing this work a 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.420
 moment 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.320
 little by little 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.710
 good, let's continue with the opening of 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:46.200
 boxes what happens as well as just 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.540
 accept many requests for this game 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.719
 and he started having problems with 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.170
 the mix is ​​art like 500 requests 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:55.530
 of 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.620
 and had earrings 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:04.980
 good arrived it seems to me 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.980
 4 I have six attempts 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.069
 you can not all be serious that I 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.069
 they come out repeated 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.069
 totally 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:23.220
 it's not that this is incredible seriously it is 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.220
 of the most incredible thing that has touched me 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:34.860
 2 missing 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.260
 with 160 boxes it's almost impossible to me 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.700
 have come out so many times repeated the good 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.590
 is that 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.590
 it's like he's appearing from me 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:49.620
 let's see if I'm lucky and 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.620
 well we know to be repeated 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.370
 and good does not follow it not been replicated 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.010
 it matters then I can not get 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.420
 spent because even though I love myself 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.739
 people closer I do not put gold 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.400
 so I was left wanting 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.890
 unfortunately I can not believe that no 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.610
 I managed not to go too repeated to the 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.680
 this seems exaggerated the beginning 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.519
 good joke is all for this video the 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.519
 come next
