00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.880
 you hi everybody knows and blue and 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.680
 today we find ourselves for the 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.290
 fourth episode of the top 10 tsonga 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.040
 titled childhood memories for those 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.930
 who will have understood 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.669
 today we will talk about manga and 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.529
 anime who rocked our childhood 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.970
 of course there are many of which 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.080
 I could speak but I will speak 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.840
 of my ten favorites 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.309
 it's gone dead ten olive and tom well 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.660
 that I'm not very fan of the animated 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.030
 and mangas focused on sport 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.070
 olivetans to score for one thing the 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.110
 incredible length of this land it is 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.449
 almost as long as your tone is low have 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.730
 not your penis I speak of your fast in 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.649
 your brain for thinking about this brief 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.750
 did you know that a Japanese student in 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.250
 physics did some calculations and he 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.250
 seems that the length of the land 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.160
 olive and tom is 18 km and olive 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.310
 course simply had to have 150 km / h 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.899
 incredible north 9 ranma 1/2 to what is it 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.990
 I loved the fun adventure 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.729
 drama transforms into an amphitheater in contact with 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.470
 cold water as well as his friend there who 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.030
 turned to pigs I'm 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.380
 certain that today if some 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.320
 of you had that power 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.910
 it will benefit in a perverse way so 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.039
 pig number 8 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.660
 beyblade although she animates from beyblade 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.670
 not really marked me apart from 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.009
 appearances of blue dragon quest was coming out 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.170
 of his top that I thought it was great 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.520
 Beyblade especially marked me for fashion 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.000
 who started it in the courses of 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.440
 recreation with the fighting of tops at 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.940
 I loved beating my opponents with 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.410
 tops I had traffic with a 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.569
 big brother noé seven 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.149
 digimon what do I love 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.649
 aegon evolutions i also love the game 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.750
 who was out on xbox 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.119
 it was really cool but do you know 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.520
 that 18 months went back to the spring of 2015 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.000
 with another old old hero this 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.789
 this time of 17 years short it is announced 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.450
 class number 6 grows hunter of 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.030
 kart wii 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.989
 this anime was for girls but 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.209
 in my defense 

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:09.340
 I loved these monsters out of cards 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.410
 that he had to capture and I'm sure 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.560
 I did not have the only boy looked at you 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.230
 this anime to you and to you and number 5 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.239
 yuyu hakusho what did I love 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.830
 adventures of yusuke shot at barra at 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.090
 start with training with the 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.780
 old granny it was cool 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.130
 and then my favorite tournament was 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.710
 really stylish the fights were 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.200
 really 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.090
 I liked just one thing to say 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.170
 alleged hunter x hunter fans 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.850
 if you have never seen or 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.650
 deliveries can not you 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.180
 pretend fans of hunter x hunter 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.890
 finally if but as it comes from the same 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.970
 author ie yoshihiro togashi 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.100
 is a problem 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.320
 short if you have not seen this guy from el 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.270
 at nimes or read the manga a wheel 4 the 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.130
 zodiac knights whether it's there 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.680
 nimes where the manga this test it is with 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.080
 its there the pegasus our hero ikki the 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.600
 phoenix that was just super 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.310
 strong shiryu the dragon who could 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.800
 to beat without the eyes for those who 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.990
 know the thin yoga that was doing its 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.270
 dances any stylus to do these 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.280
 Clash attacks true - and finally 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.140
 hot landreau med but chun and 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.240
 unfairly wrongly criticized 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.170
 why because potentially 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.450
 is much stronger than all the others 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.790
 they will master cosmo even better than 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.410
 it's just that he loses his fights because 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.580
 that it's a pacifism and I do not 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.980
 criticize not his way of fighting 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.930
 each the former number three pokemon 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.990
 frankly I'm sure a lot 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.650
 of you know the credits of 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.380
 season 1 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.420
 parker me anyway I know him and 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.610
 I could sing it for 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.330
 hours anyway so pokemon that 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.370
 What I preferred 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.360
 already at night what I find cool to 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.400
 the time 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.320
 then the cards to collect I 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.830
 still have a big package in my 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.840
 cellar 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.700
 after the cards to stick I do not know 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.130
 if many of you have known this 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.910
 pokemon book you can stick them 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.590
 stickers 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.270
 I had them almost all of them 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.000
 have all I do not know and finally well 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.800
 obviously the pokemon game at it was 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.540
 really cool because fights with 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.550
 others exchange pokemon with the 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.860
 cable inc it was the belle epoque 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.780
 the humor of yu gi oh to the limit what 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.760
 was no style and the manga too but I 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.750
 them much later and this mode of 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.520
 dueling in the yard of 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.260
 recreation it was also cool it was 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.940
 good memories especially when I was beating 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.470
 sacripant who used 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.480
 fake cards of egyptian god 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.760
 I'm sure I'm sure some 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.310
 of you still have them at home 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.290
 people still eat more than 400 500 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.330
 cards and less for me I play a 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.070
 deck of zombies and what do you 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.690
 you play mestelan comment I 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.190
 will see that number one who has 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.080
 obviously its place 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.449
 dragon ball because it must be said that 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.999
 dragon ball that marked us and that we 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:40.039
 still today it's a manga 1 to 

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:41.599
 Nîmes that lasts for years 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.520
 and frankly when we were little we 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:45.589
 dreamed of turning into super 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.689
 saiyan to be able to steal teleport 

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:49.759
 to make a case my mother we all lifted the 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:51.559
 hands when a lot did give 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.419
 me your strength for me to do a 

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:55.099
 kidal game a good one would not say it 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.990
 like that but brief you understand me 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.189
 and the games then on playstation 2 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.080
 budokai tenkaichi 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:01.669
 you really are the bells brief dragon ball 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.180
 it's really the best manga in 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.949
 my childhood 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.629
 in short, that's all for today it's 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.460
 a course episode and that held me to 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:09.560
 heart as usual secular and 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.089
 commented share subscribe you put 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.560
 a comment missing them that you 

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:14.509
 preferred when you were a kid and 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.749
 on this I tell you shaw rose from
