of the two in terms of thinness it's

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.010 
of the two in terms of thinness it's
definite<00:01:41.590> inner<00:01:41.940> now<00:01:42.940> this<00:01:43.270> could<00:01:43.420> because<00:01:43.780> of

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
definite inner now this could because of

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.870 
definite inner now this could because of
the<00:01:44.260> battery<00:01:44.590> life<00:01:45.010> which<00:01:45.520> I'll<00:01:45.670> go<00:01:45.790> over

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
the battery life which I'll go over

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.480 
the battery life which I'll go over
later<00:01:45.970> as<00:01:46.420> its<00:01:47.170> sony<00:01:47.500> has<00:01:47.740> been<00:01:47.980> compared<00:01:48.340> to

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
later as its sony has been compared to

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.970 
later as its sony has been compared to
it<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:48.820> also<00:01:49.030> well<00:01:49.570> no<00:01:49.780> LED<00:01:50.710> would<00:01:50.860> that

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
it and also well no LED would that

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.530 
it and also well no LED would that
should<00:01:51.130> be<00:01:51.190> Center<00:01:51.460> so<00:01:51.640> no<00:01:51.820> it<00:01:52.030> was<00:01:52.330> probably

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
should be Center so no it was probably

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.800 
should be Center so no it was probably
because<00:01:52.930> of<00:01:53.140> battery<00:01:53.440> size<00:01:53.620> I'm<00:01:53.980> guessing<00:01:54.810> now

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
because of battery size I'm guessing now

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.720 
because of battery size I'm guessing now

have different abilities so you do not

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.280 
have different abilities so you do not

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
and power of course so that's just

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:31.689 
typical form factor for the Nano far as

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:35.130 
typical form factor for the Nano far as
the<00:02:31.810> Sony<00:02:32.079> SmartWatch<00:02:32.470> goes<00:02:33.329> you<00:02:34.329> do<00:02:34.930> have<00:02:35.109> a

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
the Sony SmartWatch goes you do have a

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.500 
the Sony SmartWatch goes you do have a
proprietary<00:02:35.640> charger<00:02:36.640> as<00:02:36.939> I've<00:02:37.090> gone<00:02:37.209> over

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
proprietary charger as I've gone over

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.660 
proprietary charger as I've gone over
before<00:02:37.659> so<00:02:38.439> it<00:02:38.650> is<00:02:38.769> proprietary<00:02:39.010> charger<00:02:39.579> as

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
before so it is proprietary charger as

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.879 
before so it is proprietary charger as
well<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:40.150> that<00:02:40.870> is<00:02:41.019> right<00:02:41.230> here<00:02:41.500> underneath

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:41.889 
well and that is right here underneath

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:43.530 
well and that is right here underneath
the<00:02:42.069> clip<00:02:42.310> it'll<00:02:42.790> just<00:02:42.819> charge<00:02:43.269> us<00:02:43.389> right

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
the clip it'll just charge us right

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.809 
the clip it'll just charge us right
there<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.959> those<00:02:44.079> connection<00:02:44.469> points<00:02:44.819> it

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
there to those connection points it

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.259 
there to those connection points it
comes<00:02:45.969> with<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.269> rubberized<00:02:46.569> tip<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:48.269> that's

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
comes with the rubberized tip and that's

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.089 
comes with the rubberized tip and that's
gonna<00:02:49.510> be<00:02:49.689> the<00:02:49.840> basic<00:02:50.200> form<00:02:50.409> feature<00:02:50.650> nothing

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
gonna be the basic form feature nothing

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.640 
gonna be the basic form feature nothing
to<00:02:51.639> it<00:02:51.819> much<00:02:52.030> other<00:02:52.209> than<00:02:52.299> that<00:02:52.450> in<00:02:52.689> terms<00:02:53.349> of

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
to it much other than that in terms of

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.649 
to it much other than that in terms of
this<00:02:53.889> is<00:02:54.099> not<00:02:54.310> a<00:02:54.340> standalone<00:02:54.909> device<00:02:55.299> so<00:02:55.540> it

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:55.659 
this is not a standalone device so it

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.020 
this is not a standalone device so it
does<00:02:55.900> need<00:02:56.139> your<00:02:56.409> phone<00:02:56.709> to<00:02:57.129> do<00:02:57.310> that<00:02:57.519> refresh

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
does need your phone to do that refresh

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.530 
does need your phone to do that refresh
so<00:02:58.689> it<00:02:58.989> does<00:02:59.379> not<00:02:59.620> work<00:02:59.889> on<00:03:00.189> its<00:03:00.489> own<00:03:00.669> so<00:03:01.209> very

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
so it does not work on its own so very

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.819 
so it does not work on its own so very
important<00:03:01.840> thing<00:03:01.989> to<00:03:02.079> note<00:03:02.230> it<00:03:02.439> couldn't<00:03:02.680> even

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
important thing to note it couldn't even

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.610 
important thing to note it couldn't even
get<00:03:02.919> the<00:03:03.040> time<00:03:03.310> for<00:03:03.669> very<00:03:03.849> long<00:03:04.060> on<00:03:04.269> its<00:03:04.419> own<00:03:04.620> if

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
get the time for very long on its own if

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.920 
get the time for very long on its own if
i<00:03:05.799> zoom<00:03:06.069> out<00:03:06.189> basically<00:03:06.760> this<00:03:07.329> is<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.659> normal

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
i zoom out basically this is the normal

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.629 
i zoom out basically this is the normal
time<00:03:08.049> however<00:03:08.470> if<00:03:08.680> I<00:03:08.799> turn<00:03:09.010> my<00:03:09.129> Bluetooth<00:03:09.489> off

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:09.639 
time however if I turn my Bluetooth off

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.699 
time however if I turn my Bluetooth off
of<00:03:09.790> my<00:03:09.879> phone<00:03:10.150> it<00:03:10.930> tells<00:03:11.169> me<00:03:11.349> look<00:03:11.560> I'm

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
of my phone it tells me look I'm

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.390 
of my phone it tells me look I'm
unpaired<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:12.780> can<00:03:13.780> turn<00:03:13.959> it<00:03:14.079> off<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:14.590> then<00:03:14.650> it

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
unpaired I can turn it off and then it

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.699 
unpaired I can turn it off and then it
won't<00:03:15.579> it<00:03:16.540> won't<00:03:16.689> try<00:03:17.049> to<00:03:17.079> pair<00:03:17.379> and<00:03:17.560> it'll

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
won't it won't try to pair and it'll

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.800 
won't it won't try to pair and it'll
still<00:03:17.889> keep<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.129> time<00:03:18.340> for<00:03:19.150> anything<00:03:19.329> note<00:03:19.629> as

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
still keep the time for anything note as

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.140 
still keep the time for anything note as
it<00:03:19.840> goes<00:03:20.409> on<00:03:20.650> that<00:03:21.220> time<00:03:21.519> will<00:03:21.699> still<00:03:21.879> remain

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
it goes on that time will still remain

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.780 
it goes on that time will still remain
however<00:03:22.840> as<00:03:23.590> soon<00:03:23.739> as<00:03:23.859> you<00:03:23.919> try<00:03:24.099> to<00:03:24.190> pair<00:03:24.489> it'll

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
however as soon as you try to pair it'll

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.430 
however as soon as you try to pair it'll
realize<00:03:25.090> it's<00:03:25.389> not<00:03:25.510> paired<00:03:25.780> to<00:03:25.900> anything<00:03:26.229> and

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
realize it's not paired to anything and

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.189 
realize it's not paired to anything and
then<00:03:27.010> it<00:03:27.129> can't<00:03:27.310> tell<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.579> time<00:03:28.049> so<00:03:29.049> yeah

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:29.199 
then it can't tell the time so yeah

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:31.140 
then it can't tell the time so yeah
it'll<00:03:29.379> be<00:03:29.650> all<00:03:29.769> zeros<00:03:30.099> so<00:03:30.519> it<00:03:30.819> is<00:03:30.940> not<00:03:31.120> a

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
it'll be all zeros so it is not a

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.849 
it'll be all zeros so it is not a
standalone<00:03:31.659> device<00:03:32.079> you<00:03:32.260> do<00:03:32.440> need<00:03:32.620> a

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
standalone device you do need a

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.309 
standalone device you do need a
smartphone<00:03:33.400> with<00:03:33.849> bluetooth<00:03:34.209> in<00:03:34.989> order<00:03:35.199> to

told me and from my experience with it

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.429 
told me and from my experience with it
it<00:03:58.900> typically<00:03:59.680> will<00:03:59.949> last<00:04:00.220> less<00:04:00.519> than<00:04:00.579> a<00:04:00.849> day

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 
it typically will last less than a day

at most even on Apple's website they say

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.159 
at most even on Apple's website they say
a<00:04:05.590> full<00:04:05.859> day<00:04:06.010> usage<00:04:06.430> so<00:04:07.000> not<00:04:07.689> the<00:04:07.840> best<00:04:07.870> when<00:04:08.109> it

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.169 
a full day usage so not the best when it

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:09.479 
a full day usage so not the best when it
comes<00:04:08.199> to<00:04:08.409> battery<00:04:08.560> life<00:04:08.680> some<00:04:09.159> people<00:04:09.370> even

comes to battery life some people even

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:10.920 
comes to battery life some people even
say<00:04:09.609> it<00:04:09.819> only<00:04:09.909> lasts<00:04:10.180> about<00:04:10.329> four<00:04:10.629> hours

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930

getting<00:04:22.330> pretty<00:04:22.539> low<00:04:22.719> so<00:04:22.960> I'd<00:04:23.080> recommend

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
getting pretty low so I'd recommend

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.170 
getting pretty low so I'd recommend
charging<00:04:23.830> it<00:04:23.889> after<00:04:24.159> four<00:04:24.340> but<00:04:24.580> I've<00:04:24.700> lasted
