00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.060 
absolutely beautiful we have a picture
all<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.259> time<00:01:22.439> in<00:01:22.619> ask<00:01:22.770> us

take those pictures and say actually no

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.840 
take those pictures and say actually no
I<00:01:27.570> think<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.619> Apple<00:01:29.070> took<00:01:29.460> those<00:01:29.640> pictures

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
I think that Apple took those pictures

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.490 
I think that Apple took those pictures
because<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:30.390> also<00:01:30.509> have<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.869> hooked<00:01:30.960> up<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.200> our

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
Apple TV we use Apple TV for the movies

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.679 
Apple TV we use Apple TV for the movies
for<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.979> music<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.670> various<00:01:36.000> aspects<00:01:36.479> so
