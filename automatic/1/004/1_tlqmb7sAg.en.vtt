think<00:04:43.879> of<00:04:44.030> the<00:04:44.120> picks<00:04:44.300> and<00:04:44.419> bans<00:04:44.509> for<00:04:44.780> the<00:04:44.840> next

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
think of the picks and bans for the next

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.409 
think of the picks and bans for the next
game<00:04:45.259> what's<00:04:45.650> the<00:04:45.800> game<00:04:45.830> plan<00:04:46.009> Kevin<00:04:46.639> I<00:04:46.819> think

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
game what's the game plan Kevin I think

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.330 
game what's the game plan Kevin I think
it<00:04:47.539> is<00:04:47.569> extremely<00:04:48.289> hard<00:04:48.560> to<00:04:48.740> do<00:04:48.860> a<00:04:48.889> campaign

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
it is extremely hard to do a campaign

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.939 
it is extremely hard to do a campaign
against<00:04:49.580> phonetic<00:04:50.259> they<00:04:51.259> have<00:04:51.439> so<00:04:51.889> many

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949 
against phonetic they have so many

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:55.110 
against phonetic they have so many
tactics<00:04:52.819> so<00:04:53.060> many<00:04:53.300> possibilities<00:04:54.199> to<00:04:54.919> pick

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
tactics so many possibilities to pick

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.510 
tactics so many possibilities to pick
like<00:04:56.120> for<00:04:56.659> example<00:04:56.689> as<00:04:57.289> I<00:04:57.469> top<00:04:57.979> laner<00:04:58.189> for<00:04:58.430> me

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
like for example as I top laner for me

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.909 
like for example as I top laner for me
so<00:04:58.669> as<00:04:58.789> he<00:04:59.690> has<00:04:59.840> so<00:05:00.050> many<00:05:00.199> pics<00:05:00.560> to<00:05:00.740> pick

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
so as he has so many pics to pick

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.899 
so as he has so many pics to pick
against<00:05:01.610> anything<00:05:02.090> and<00:05:03.310> the<00:05:04.310> rest<00:05:04.490> is<00:05:04.729> pretty

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 
against anything and the rest is pretty

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:07.209 
against anything and the rest is pretty
packed<00:05:05.629> for<00:05:05.930> example<00:05:06.289> he<00:05:06.349> can<00:05:06.500> pick<00:05:06.680> re<00:05:06.919> if<00:05:07.069> he

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:07.219 
packed for example he can pick re if he

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:09.540 
packed for example he can pick re if he
wants<00:05:07.430> he<00:05:07.460> can<00:05:07.729> pick<00:05:07.940> whatever<00:05:08.120> he<00:05:08.449> wants<00:05:08.690> to

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
wants he can pick whatever he wants to

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.820 
wants he can pick whatever he wants to
yeah<00:05:10.550> so<00:05:10.909> the<00:05:11.509> band<00:05:11.780> face<00:05:11.990> is<00:05:12.169> just<00:05:12.379> basically

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
yeah so the band face is just basically

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.820 
yeah so the band face is just basically
if<00:05:13.039> aliens<00:05:13.460> has<00:05:13.610> to<00:05:13.729> do<00:05:13.819> is<00:05:13.969> a<00:05:14.050> band<00:05:15.050> that<00:05:15.349> they

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
if aliens has to do is a band that they

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.670 
if aliens has to do is a band that they
are<00:05:15.889> not<00:05:16.069> confident<00:05:16.550> against<00:05:17.330> so<00:05:17.900> maybe<00:05:18.379> when

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
are not confident against so maybe when

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.890 
are not confident against so maybe when
the<00:05:18.860> the<00:05:19.190> Sokka<00:05:19.669> maybe<00:05:20.000> we'll<00:05:20.210> see<00:05:20.509> something

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
the the Sokka maybe we'll see something

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.129 
the the Sokka maybe we'll see something
else<00:05:21.139> coming<00:05:21.770> out<00:05:21.919> so<00:05:22.610> um<00:05:22.940> I<00:05:23.360> think<00:05:23.509> they

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:24.139 
else coming out so um I think they

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:25.570 
else coming out so um I think they
should<00:05:24.319> just<00:05:24.349> go<00:05:24.680> for<00:05:24.889> what<00:05:25.069> they<00:05:25.189> don't<00:05:25.400> like

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
should just go for what they don't like

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.980 
should just go for what they don't like
to<00:05:25.699> play<00:05:25.879> against<00:05:26.180> and<00:05:26.419> that<00:05:26.599> would<00:05:26.719> be<00:05:26.750> the

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
to play against and that would be the

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.649 
to play against and that would be the
smartest<00:05:27.319> choice<00:05:27.770> for<00:05:27.979> them<00:05:28.099> tisha<00:05:28.819> one<00:05:29.479> thing

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:29.659 
smartest choice for them tisha one thing

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:32.080 
smartest choice for them tisha one thing
to<00:05:29.689> remember<00:05:29.960> is<00:05:30.650> yes<00:05:31.279> the<00:05:31.430> lions<00:05:31.669> lost<00:05:31.849> the

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
to remember is yes the lions lost the

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.059 
to remember is yes the lions lost the
game<00:05:32.240> but<00:05:32.360> it's<00:05:32.509> very<00:05:32.870> close<00:05:33.169> for<00:05:33.440> a<00:05:33.469> long<00:05:33.560> time

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:34.069 
game but it's very close for a long time

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:36.219 
game but it's very close for a long time
until<00:05:34.610> actually<00:05:35.210> I<00:05:35.419> believe<00:05:35.750> they<00:05:35.900> engaged

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
until actually I believe they engaged

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.010 
until actually I believe they engaged
onto<00:05:36.830> Vinglish<00:05:37.669> yellow<00:05:37.849> star<00:05:38.150> and<00:05:38.419> then<00:05:38.539> today

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
onto Vinglish yellow star and then today

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.170 
onto Vinglish yellow star and then today
I<00:05:39.050> turn<00:05:39.229> around<00:05:39.500> because<00:05:39.789> lines<00:05:40.789> were<00:05:40.909> split

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
I turn around because lines were split

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.540 
I turn around because lines were split
up<00:05:41.210> with<00:05:41.479> coral<00:05:41.750> positions<00:05:42.199> they<00:05:42.409> died<00:05:42.830> parent

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
up with coral positions they died parent

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.680 
up with coral positions they died parent
for<00:05:43.699> phonetic<00:05:44.089> and<00:05:44.180> then<00:05:44.300> from<00:05:44.479> there<00:05:44.599> on<00:05:44.659> I

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
for phonetic and then from there on I

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.869 
for phonetic and then from there on I
can<00:05:44.870> just<00:05:44.990> win<00:05:45.139> the<00:05:45.229> game<00:05:45.379> so<00:05:45.770> it<00:05:46.370> wasn't<00:05:46.669> a<00:05:46.699> bad

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:46.879 
can just win the game so it wasn't a bad

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:48.790 
can just win the game so it wasn't a bad
game<00:05:47.120> by<00:05:47.300> lions<00:05:47.659> and<00:05:47.870> obviously<00:05:48.289> the<00:05:48.379> comp<00:05:48.620> I

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
game by lions and obviously the comp I

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.920 
game by lions and obviously the comp I
four<00:05:49.310> lines<00:05:49.580> wasn't<00:05:49.879> horrible<00:05:50.210> we<00:05:50.629> saw<00:05:50.810> it

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
four lines wasn't horrible we saw it

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.200 
four lines wasn't horrible we saw it
played<00:05:51.199> yesterday<00:05:51.379> really<00:05:51.770> well<00:05:51.979> so<00:05:52.310> I<00:05:52.520> don't

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
played yesterday really well so I don't

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.550 
played yesterday really well so I don't
think<00:05:53.360> they<00:05:53.449> need<00:05:53.599> to<00:05:53.690> go<00:05:53.810> in<00:05:53.960> and<00:05:54.110> change<00:05:54.259> too

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
think they need to go in and change too

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.719 
think they need to go in and change too
many<00:05:54.770> things<00:05:54.919> in<00:05:55.129> the<00:05:55.219> Chams<00:05:55.430> licked

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
many things in the Chams licked

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.309 
many things in the Chams licked
obviously<00:05:56.270> they<00:05:56.330> need<00:05:56.479> to<00:05:56.539> be<00:05:56.659> careful<00:05:57.229> with

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:57.319 
obviously they need to be careful with

00:05:57.319 --> 00:05:59.019 
obviously they need to be careful with
the<00:05:57.500> carpet<00:05:57.889> speak<00:05:58.039> now<00:05:58.190> if<00:05:58.400> they<00:05:58.729> decide<00:05:59.000> to

00:05:59.019 --> 00:05:59.029 
the carpet speak now if they decide to

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:00.670 
the carpet speak now if they decide to
not<00:05:59.300> pants<00:05:59.539> Urraca<00:05:59.870> i<00:06:00.110> would<00:06:00.289> actually<00:06:00.379> think

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
not pants Urraca i would actually think

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.990 
not pants Urraca i would actually think
the<00:06:00.770> banner<00:06:01.009> ways<00:06:01.250> to<00:06:01.370> rocking<00:06:01.639> her<00:06:01.729> because

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
the banner ways to rocking her because

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.790 
the banner ways to rocking her because
she's<00:06:02.180> so<00:06:02.389> annoying<00:06:02.599> to<00:06:02.779> deal<00:06:02.810> with<00:06:03.110> and<00:06:03.319> she's

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
she's so annoying to deal with and she's

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.619 
she's so annoying to deal with and she's
kind<00:06:04.009> of<00:06:04.069> the<00:06:04.159> key<00:06:04.789> thing<00:06:05.000> in<00:06:05.120> this<00:06:05.210> in<00:06:05.449> this

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:05.629 
kind of the key thing in this in this

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:08.110 
kind of the key thing in this in this
setup<00:06:05.839> here<00:06:06.050> is<00:06:06.080> only<00:06:06.349> Gianna<00:06:06.680> and<00:06:06.979> kale<00:06:07.550> yes

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
setup here is only Gianna and kale yes

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.850 
setup here is only Gianna and kale yes
intervention<00:06:08.629> and<00:06:08.810> shields<00:06:09.169> you<00:06:09.620> don't<00:06:09.770> have

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
intervention and shields you don't have

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.140 
intervention and shields you don't have
to<00:06:09.919> do<00:06:10.039> of<00:06:10.129> the<00:06:10.250> hill<00:06:10.400> here<00:06:10.430> and<00:06:10.819> the<00:06:10.940> healing

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
to do of the hill here and the healing

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.369 
to do of the hill here and the healing
was<00:06:11.389> the<00:06:11.509> key<00:06:11.690> point<00:06:11.960> because<00:06:12.139> you<00:06:12.199> don't

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:12.379 
was the key point because you don't

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:13.719 
was the key point because you don't
bring<00:06:12.500> eight<00:06:12.620> nights<00:06:12.860> on<00:06:13.099> a<00:06:13.129> lion<00:06:13.370> side<00:06:13.550> with

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:13.729 
bring eight nights on a lion side with

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:15.129 
bring eight nights on a lion side with
the<00:06:13.849> Comte<00:06:14.180> rent<00:06:14.389> so<00:06:14.659> I<00:06:14.690> think<00:06:14.839> they<00:06:14.960> need<00:06:15.110> to

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:15.139 
the Comte rent so I think they need to

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.379 
the Comte rent so I think they need to
burn<00:06:15.349> away<00:06:15.560> the<00:06:16.009> Soraka<00:06:16.370> and<00:06:16.699> then<00:06:17.180> they<00:06:17.270> can

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:17.389 
burn away the Soraka and then they can

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:18.519 
burn away the Soraka and then they can
actually<00:06:17.509> just<00:06:17.750> fall<00:06:17.960> back<00:06:18.139> to<00:06:18.199> what<00:06:18.409> they

00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:18.529 
actually just fall back to what they

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:20.140 
actually just fall back to what they
were<00:06:18.560> picking<00:06:18.919> here<00:06:19.339> as<00:06:19.699> long<00:06:19.819> as<00:06:19.940> they<00:06:20.029> feel

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
were picking here as long as they feel

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.670 
were picking here as long as they feel
confident<00:06:20.659> enough<00:06:20.810> they<00:06:21.050> can<00:06:21.080> survive<00:06:21.469> the

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
confident enough they can survive the

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.709 
confident enough they can survive the
early<00:06:21.889> mid<00:06:22.039> game<00:06:22.219> so<00:06:22.969> the<00:06:23.180> main<00:06:23.330> thought<00:06:23.539> for

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:23.719 
early mid game so the main thought for

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:25.209 
early mid game so the main thought for
both<00:06:23.930> of<00:06:24.080> you<00:06:24.139> is<00:06:24.169> been<00:06:24.440> out<00:06:24.589> that's<00:06:24.770> rock<00:06:24.979> for

00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:25.219 
both of you is been out that's rock for

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:26.680 
both of you is been out that's rock for
lines<00:06:25.430> and<00:06:25.639> obviously<00:06:25.879> yesterday<00:06:26.240> we<00:06:26.360> did<00:06:26.539> see

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 
lines and obviously yesterday we did see

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.779 
lines and obviously yesterday we did see
that<00:06:26.719> they<00:06:27.020> can<00:06:27.199> come<00:06:27.409> back<00:06:27.589> from<00:06:27.770> a<00:06:27.830> deficit

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:28.789 
that they can come back from a deficit

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:30.430 
that they can come back from a deficit
and<00:06:28.940> take<00:06:29.389> the<00:06:29.509> whole<00:06:29.659> series<00:06:30.020> so<00:06:30.169> it'd<00:06:30.289> be

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440
