00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
kind of I necessarily lawn to walk

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.399 
kind of I necessarily lawn to walk
through<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.970> think

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
through I think

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.490 
through I think
given<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.460> Khafre<00:01:18.080> that<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.170> end<00:01:19.380> up

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
given that the Khafre that you end up

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.320 
given that the Khafre that you end up
saving<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.979> it's<00:01:20.700> weighted<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.000> trend

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
saving that it's weighted the trend

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.660 
saving that it's weighted the trend
again<00:01:22.229> even<00:01:22.799> if<00:01:22.890> there's<00:01:23.040> another<00:01:23.220> kafir<00:01:23.549> up

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
again even if there's another kafir up

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.130 
again even if there's another kafir up
here<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.150> can<00:01:24.270> access<00:01:24.450> for<00:01:24.720> bank<00:01:24.930> but

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
here that you can access for bank but

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.830 
here that you can access for bank but
even<00:01:25.440> if<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.770> save<00:01:26.040> at<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.970> you're<00:01:27.570> still

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
even if you save at it you're still

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.260 
even if you save at it you're still
going<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.110> end<00:01:28.140> up<00:01:28.640> right<00:01:29.640> down<00:01:29.850> there<00:01:30.119> at<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
going to end up right down there at the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.800 
going to end up right down there at the
bottom<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.780> map<00:01:31.610> kind<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.729> weird<00:01:32.940> honestly

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
bottom of the map kind of weird honestly

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.810 
bottom of the map kind of weird honestly
I<00:01:34.080> think<00:01:34.290> if<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.740> save<00:01:34.950> at<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.159> cafe<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.670> should

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
I think if you save at a cafe you should

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.889 
I think if you save at a cafe you should
appear<00:01:36.030> at<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.210> Khafre<00:01:38.690> so<00:01:39.690> we're<00:01:39.869> just

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
appear at that Khafre so we're just

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.359 
appear at that Khafre so we're just
gonna<00:01:40.110> go<00:01:40.320> west<00:01:40.740> from<00:01:41.130> Alberta<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:43.250> get<00:01:44.250> our

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
gonna go west from Alberta it's get our

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.240 
gonna go west from Alberta it's get our
fly<00:01:44.610> wings<00:01:44.850> hot<00:01:45.060> key<00:01:45.270> here<00:01:45.539> I<00:01:45.890> like<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.920> put

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
fly wings hot key here I like to put

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.859 
fly wings hot key here I like to put
them<00:01:48.289> in<00:01:49.289> J<00:01:49.940> and<00:01:51.050> we're<00:01:52.050> gonna<00:01:52.170> go<00:01:52.380> through<00:01:53.869> and

this<00:02:01.170> map<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.530> kind<00:02:01.679> of<00:02:01.830> oddly<00:02:02.039> designed<00:02:02.670> may

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
this map is kind of oddly designed may

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.460 
this map is kind of oddly designed may
look<00:02:03.300> like<00:02:03.390> we're<00:02:03.569> close<00:02:03.780> but<00:02:04.050> we're<00:02:04.200> really

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
look like we're close but we're really

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.620 
look like we're close but we're really
