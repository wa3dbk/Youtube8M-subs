ok so let's start
what<00:01:18.660> is<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:19.260> mode<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:21.420> mode<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:22.260> an

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
what is a mode and the mode is an

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.100 
what is a mode and the mode is an
arrangement<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.580> notes<00:01:24.120> from<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.320> major<00:01:25.800> scale

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
arrangement of notes from a major scale

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.890 
arrangement of notes from a major scale
in<00:01:28.110> addition<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.700> could<00:01:29.880> also<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> mode

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
in addition you could also have a mode

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.130 
in addition you could also have a mode
as<00:01:31.230> an<00:01:31.890> arrangement<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.670> notes<00:01:33.030> from<00:01:33.720> certain

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
as an arrangement of notes from certain

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.860 
as an arrangement of notes from certain
minor<00:01:34.440> scales<00:01:34.950> namely<00:01:35.700> harmonic<00:01:36.300> minor<00:01:36.540> and

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
minor scales namely harmonic minor and

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.260 
minor scales namely harmonic minor and
melodic<00:01:37.590> minor<00:01:37.830> but<00:01:38.490> for<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.850> particular

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
melodic minor but for this particular

lesson<00:01:39.870> pack<00:01:40.260> we're<00:01:40.770> going<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.190> be<00:01:41.340> talking

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
lesson pack we're going to be talking

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.250 
lesson pack we're going to be talking
about<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.690> major<00:01:42.900> scale<00:01:43.340> modes<00:01:44.900> okay<00:01:45.900> so<00:01:45.960> in

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
about the major scale modes okay so in

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.090 
about the major scale modes okay so in
western<00:01:46.710> music<00:01:47.420> scales<00:01:48.420> are<00:01:48.960> constructed<00:01:49.920> of

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
western music scales are constructed of

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.120 
western music scales are constructed of
intervals<00:01:50.850> or<00:01:51.120> so<00:01:51.480> note<00:01:51.720> spacings<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.680> whole

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
intervals or so note spacings of whole

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.820 
intervals or so note spacings of whole
step<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.670> half<00:01:53.730> step<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.720> guitar<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.800> the

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
step and half step and guitar is the

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.190 
step and half step and guitar is the
most<00:01:56.130> perfect<00:01:56.400> instrument<00:01:56.970> for<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.390> because

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
most perfect instrument for that because

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.520 
most perfect instrument for that because
between<00:01:58.440> each<00:01:58.880> fret<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.390> exactly<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.110> spacing

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
between each fret is exactly a spacing

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.810 
between each fret is exactly a spacing
of<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:02.040> half-step<00:02:02.640> if<00:02:03.650> you<00:02:04.650> want<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.040> for

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
of a half-step if you want it for

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.610 
of a half-step if you want it for
example<00:02:06.120> to<00:02:06.420> start<00:02:06.600> in<00:02:06.810> G<00:02:07.020> note<00:02:07.230> and<00:02:07.440> play<00:02:07.530> a

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
example to start in G note and play a

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.190 
example to start in G note and play a
whole<00:02:07.740> step<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.519> will<00:02:08.640> play<00:02:08.879> an<00:02:09.000> A<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.479> want

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
whole step you will play an A you want

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.330 
whole step you will play an A you want
to<00:02:10.289> play<00:02:10.440> an<00:02:10.560> half-step<00:02:11.069> you<00:02:11.909> play<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.480> G<00:02:12.989> sharp

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
to play an half-step you play a G sharp

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.100 
to play an half-step you play a G sharp
okay<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.580> this<00:02:14.879> this<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.180> this<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.569> perfect

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
okay and this this is this is perfect

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.750 
okay and this this is this is perfect
for<00:02:16.200> us<00:02:16.350> as<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.680> guitar<00:02:17.069> players<00:02:17.340> because

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
for us as a guitar players because

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.750 
for us as a guitar players because
clearly<00:02:18.390> see<00:02:18.960> how<00:02:19.620> our<00:02:19.830> scales<00:02:20.310> are<00:02:20.550> laid<00:02:20.730> out

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
clearly see how our scales are laid out

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.650 
clearly see how our scales are laid out
so<00:02:21.420> this

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
so this

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.140 
so this
a very<00:02:21.990> fundamental<00:02:22.320> first<00:02:23.040> part<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:24.120> let's

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
a very fundamental first part so let's

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.320 
a very fundamental first part so let's
move<00:02:24.540> on<00:02:24.720> okay<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:25.980> let's<00:02:26.340> start<00:02:26.640> with<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:27.030> G

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
move on okay so let's start with a G

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.690 
move on okay so let's start with a G
major<00:02:27.540> scale<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.830> am<00:02:28.950> going<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.340> show<00:02:29.640> you

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
major scale and I am going to show you

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.020 
major scale and I am going to show you
how<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.060> play<00:02:30.570> this<00:02:31.350> scale<00:02:31.700> ascending<00:02:32.700> but

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
how to play this scale ascending but

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.710 
how to play this scale ascending but
using<00:02:33.420> whole<00:02:33.660> steps<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.320> half<00:02:34.440> steps<00:02:35.540> okay

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
using whole steps and half steps okay

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.900 
using whole steps and half steps okay
so<00:02:36.930> in<00:02:37.110> order<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.410> play<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.710> G<00:02:38.010> major<00:02:38.220> scale

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
so in order to play a G major scale

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.910 
so in order to play a G major scale
you're<00:02:39.060> going<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.450> need<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.780> do<00:02:39.900> this<00:02:40.140> play<00:02:40.710> the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
you're going to need to do this play the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:48.470 
you're going to need to do this play the
root<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.340> G<00:02:44.720> move<00:02:45.720> up<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:45.990> whole<00:02:46.230> step<00:02:47.480> another

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
root a G move up a whole step another

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.830 
root a G move up a whole step another
whole<00:02:48.840> step<00:02:49.970> half<00:02:50.970> step<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:52.370> whole<00:02:53.370> step<00:02:53.840> a

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
whole step half step a whole step a

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.670 
whole step half step a whole step a
whole<00:02:55.350> step<00:02:55.850> a<00:02:56.850> whole<00:02:57.330> step<00:02:57.770> and<00:02:58.770> a<00:02:59.220> half<00:02:59.250> step

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
whole step a whole step and a half step

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:09.490 
whole step a whole step and a half step
that<00:03:01.680> is<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:01.890> G<00:03:02.250> Major<00:03:02.490> scale<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:03.180> one<00:03:03.450> octave

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.200 

okay<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:10.560> when<00:03:10.860> you<00:03:10.980> look<00:03:11.190> at<00:03:11.280> this<00:03:11.460> together

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
okay so when you look at this together

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.500 
okay so when you look at this together
you<00:03:12.390> got<00:03:12.630> whole<00:03:13.110> whole<00:03:13.740> half<00:03:14.250> whole<00:03:14.670> whole

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
you got whole whole half whole whole

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.160 
you got whole whole half whole whole
whole<00:03:15.990> half<00:03:16.560> steps<00:03:17.490> you<00:03:18.150> put<00:03:18.420> them<00:03:18.540> in<00:03:18.720> that

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
whole half steps you put them in that

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.880 
whole half steps you put them in that
exact<00:03:20.040> order<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:21.110> you're<00:03:22.110> going<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.440> get<00:03:22.680> a

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
exact order and you're going to get a

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.400 
exact order and you're going to get a
major<00:03:23.160> scale<00:03:23.550> this<00:03:24.270> is<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.510> G<00:03:24.810> major<00:03:25.050> scale

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
major scale this is a G major scale

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.040 
major scale this is a G major scale
because<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.890> first<00:03:26.340> note<00:03:26.640> we<00:03:27.240> started<00:03:27.660> on<00:03:27.780> is

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
because the first note we started on is

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.120 
because the first note we started on is
a<00:03:28.260> note<00:03:28.830> G<00:03:29.990> so<00:03:30.990> check<00:03:31.230> it<00:03:31.380> out<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:31.800> have

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
a note G so check it out you have

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.160 
a note G so check it out you have
actually<00:03:32.580> learned<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:33.060> first<00:03:33.330> mode<00:03:33.720> which<00:03:34.020> is

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
actually learned the first mode which is

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.070 
actually learned the first mode which is
called<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.770> Ionian<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.910> Ionian<00:03:36.510> mode<00:03:36.540> is

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
called the Ionian the Ionian mode is

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.440 
called the Ionian the Ionian mode is
just<00:03:37.110> another<00:03:37.709> name<00:03:38.070> for<00:03:38.100> a<00:03:38.490> regular<00:03:38.970> major

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
just another name for a regular major

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.650 
just another name for a regular major
scale<00:03:39.870> now<00:03:41.330> check<00:03:42.330> this<00:03:42.480> out<00:03:43.160> if<00:03:44.160> I<00:03:44.400> start<00:03:44.820> to

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
scale now check this out if I start to

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.710 
scale now check this out if I start to
play<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.230> same<00:03:47.010> exact<00:03:47.520> notes<00:03:47.880> we<00:03:48.180> just<00:03:48.420> played

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
play the same exact notes we just played

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.890 
play the same exact notes we just played
from<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:49.050> G<00:03:49.290> major<00:03:49.560> scale<00:03:50.100> but<00:03:51.090> starting<00:03:51.480> on<00:03:51.780> the

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
from a G major scale but starting on the

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.790 
from a G major scale but starting on the
second<00:03:52.380> degree

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
second degree

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.080 
second degree
the<00:03:53.459> a<00:03:53.540> remember<00:03:54.540> root<00:03:55.290> whole<00:03:55.830> step<00:03:56.250> was<00:03:56.910> our

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
the a remember root whole step was our

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.880 
the a remember root whole step was our
next<00:03:57.930> note<00:03:58.140> if<00:03:58.530> we<00:03:59.310> build<00:03:59.640> a<00:03:59.850> scale<00:04:00.890> starting

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
next note if we build a scale starting

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:08.180 
next note if we build a scale starting
on<00:04:01.950> a<00:04:02.610> note<00:04:03.540> using<00:04:04.170> same<00:04:04.830> exact<00:04:05.640> notes<00:04:06.450> as<00:04:07.190> the

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
on a note using same exact notes as the

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:16.990 
on a note using same exact notes as the
G<00:04:08.370> Major<00:04:08.610> scale

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.090 

you<00:04:18.000> are<00:04:18.150> actually<00:04:18.390> playing<00:04:18.780> in<00:04:19.110> a<00:04:19.260> Dorian

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
you are actually playing in a Dorian

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.060 
you are actually playing in a Dorian
mode<00:04:20.820> and<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.840> reason<00:04:22.170> this<00:04:22.290> scale<00:04:22.680> sounds

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
mode and the reason this scale sounds

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.880 
mode and the reason this scale sounds
differently<00:04:23.760> is<00:04:24.030> because<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.990> relationship

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
differently is because the relationship

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.320 
differently is because the relationship
of<00:04:26.100> the<00:04:26.610> intervals<00:04:28.400> going<00:04:29.400> back<00:04:29.610> to<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.090> note

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
of the intervals going back to the note

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.500 
of the intervals going back to the note
to<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.170> root<00:04:31.410> which<00:04:31.650> is<00:04:31.680> now<00:04:32.010> the<00:04:32.070> a<00:04:32.250> all<00:04:33.180> right

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
to the root which is now the a all right

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.260 
to the root which is now the a all right
so<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:33.960> a<00:04:33.990> Dorian<00:04:34.800> is<00:04:35.040> basically<00:04:35.850> a<00:04:36.000> different

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
so the a Dorian is basically a different

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.860 
so the a Dorian is basically a different
series<00:04:37.050> of<00:04:37.080> whole<00:04:37.530> steps<00:04:37.920> and<00:04:38.100> half<00:04:38.190> steps<00:04:38.870> now

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
series of whole steps and half steps now

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.810 
series of whole steps and half steps now
the<00:04:40.320> formula<00:04:40.890> goes<00:04:41.070> like<00:04:41.340> this<00:04:41.550> root<00:04:43.010> step<00:04:44.010> is

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
the formula goes like this root step is

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.400 
the formula goes like this root step is
that<00:04:45.360> is<00:04:46.350> that<00:04:46.830> is<00:04:47.460> that<00:04:47.640> a<00:04:48.270> step<00:04:49.170> down<00:04:49.800> step

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
that is that is that a step down step

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.700 
that is that is that a step down step
back<00:04:52.410> to<00:04:52.620> D<00:04:52.770> a<00:04:54.170> completely<00:04:55.170> different<00:04:55.500> scale

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
back to D a completely different scale

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.440 
back to D a completely different scale
right<00:04:55.980> now<00:04:56.040> that's<00:04:56.790> your<00:04:56.970> a<00:04:57.000> Dorian<00:04:57.600> mode<00:04:59.450> okay

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
right now that's your a Dorian mode okay

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.620 
right now that's your a Dorian mode okay
if<00:05:00.660> we<00:05:00.900> start<00:05:01.230> on<00:05:01.470> a<00:05:01.500> third<00:05:01.980> scale<00:05:02.550> degree<00:05:02.630> the

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
if we start on a third scale degree the

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.280 
if we start on a third scale degree the
B<00:05:03.900> and<00:05:04.620> we'll<00:05:05.070> play<00:05:05.250> another<00:05:05.550> series<00:05:06.300> of<00:05:06.540> half

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
B and we'll play another series of half

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.370 
B and we'll play another series of half
steps<00:05:07.470> and<00:05:07.800> whole<00:05:07.890> steps<00:05:08.780> going<00:05:09.780> up<00:05:10.020> to<00:05:10.230> the

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
steps and whole steps going up to the

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.080 
steps and whole steps going up to the
octave<00:05:10.800> you're<00:05:11.220> going<00:05:11.490> to<00:05:11.610> have<00:05:11.760> a<00:05:11.790> whole

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
octave you're going to have a whole

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.840 
octave you're going to have a whole
another<00:05:12.360> mode<00:05:12.720> that<00:05:13.020> is<00:05:13.170> going<00:05:13.500> to<00:05:13.680> be<00:05:13.890> called

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
another mode that is going to be called
