00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
windows I got the Kramer poster in that

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.940 
windows I got the Kramer poster in that
window<00:01:56.619> let<00:01:57.099> me<00:01:57.219> back<00:01:57.459> up<00:01:57.489> here<00:01:57.909> and<00:01:58.499> my<00:01:59.499> son

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
window let me back up here and my son

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.909 
window let me back up here and my son
actually<00:02:00.249> I<00:02:00.549> think<00:02:00.959> threw<00:02:01.959> a<00:02:02.020> snowball<00:02:02.109> they

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:02.919 
actually I think threw a snowball they

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:04.859 
actually I think threw a snowball they
had<00:02:03.039> a<00:02:03.069> rock<00:02:03.340> in<00:02:03.369> it<00:02:03.729> right<00:02:04.090> there<00:02:04.299> so<00:02:04.630> that

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
had a rock in it right there so that

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.109 
had a rock in it right there so that
window<00:02:05.739> is<00:02:05.799> taped<00:02:06.130> up<00:02:06.369> so<00:02:06.609> probably

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
window is taped up so probably

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.510 
window is taped up so probably
eventually<00:02:07.299> we'll<00:02:07.840> just<00:02:08.110> cover<00:02:09.009> that<00:02:09.160> window

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
eventually we'll just cover that window

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.210 
eventually we'll just cover that window
