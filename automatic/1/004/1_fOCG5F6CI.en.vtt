to get that tool didn't have it you know
try<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:35.940> fabricate<00:00:36.600> my<00:00:36.630> own<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:37.170> did<00:00:37.920> don't<00:00:38.309> have

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
try to fabricate my own I did don't have

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.510 
try to fabricate my own I did don't have
any<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.640> feel<00:00:38.850> like<00:00:38.969> angle<00:00:39.329> iron<00:00:40.190> you<00:00:41.190> know<00:00:41.340> and

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
any I feel like angle iron you know and

any I feel like angle iron you know and
I<00:00:41.670> have<00:00:41.760> bolts<00:00:42.059> but<00:00:42.300> no<00:00:43.020> angle<00:00:43.379> iron<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:45.020> I

I have bolts but no angle iron and I
tried<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.020> make<00:00:49.170> something<00:00:49.379> out<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.590> wood

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
tried to make something out of wood

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.000 
tried to make something out of wood
didn't<00:00:50.670> work<00:00:50.760> get<00:00:51.300> cracking<00:00:51.809> whatever<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
didn't work get cracking whatever the

didn't work get cracking whatever the
passenger<00:00:53.430> actually<00:00:53.789> took<00:00:53.940> wasn't<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.420> hard

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
passenger actually took wasn't that hard

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.920 
passenger actually took wasn't that hard

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
but the drivers was really hard mostly

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.639 
but the drivers was really hard mostly
in<00:00:57.989> fact<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.260> my<00:00:58.350> stupidity<00:00:58.820> but<00:01:00.649> yeah

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
in fact to my stupidity but yeah

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.080 
in fact to my stupidity but yeah
actually<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.250> know<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.399> picked<00:01:02.730> something<00:01:02.879> up

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
actually you know I picked something up

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.570 
actually you know I picked something up
from<00:01:03.619> Harbor<00:01:04.619> Freight<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:05.339> little<00:01:05.970> bit<00:01:06.090> ago<00:01:07.580> for

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
from Harbor Freight a little bit ago for

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.410 
from Harbor Freight a little bit ago for
this<00:01:09.080> it's<00:01:10.080> actually<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.590> crank<00:01:11.130> well<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.000> was

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
this it's actually a crank well I was

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.539 
this it's actually a crank well I was
amazing<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.960> crank<00:01:13.260> but<00:01:14.100> actually<00:01:14.460> was

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
amazing on the crank but actually was

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.370 
amazing on the crank but actually was
really<00:01:14.790> easy<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.060> get<00:01:15.210> off<00:01:15.360> maybe<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.200> should

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
really easy to get off maybe I should

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.960 
really easy to get off maybe I should
have<00:01:16.500> used<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.740> air<00:01:16.890> tool<00:01:17.159> for<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.549> but<00:01:17.790> just

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
have used the air tool for this but just

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.840 
have used the air tool for this but just
try<00:01:18.210> use<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> big<00:01:18.630> old<00:01:18.780> breaker<00:01:19.110> bar<00:01:19.850> but

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
try use a big old breaker bar but

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.760 
try use a big old breaker bar but
naturally<00:01:21.689> what<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.840> did<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.350> see<00:01:22.409> more<00:01:22.680> of

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
naturally what I did is I see more of

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.859 
naturally what I did is I see more of
just<00:01:22.920> jammed<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:23.700> underneath<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
just jammed it in underneath the

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.469 
just jammed it in underneath the
sprocket<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:26.040> make<00:01:26.520> sure<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.729> didn't<00:01:26.939> move<00:01:27.090> and

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
sprocket to make sure it didn't move and

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.130 
sprocket to make sure it didn't move and
then<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.530> know<00:01:28.650> just<00:01:29.720> wrench<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.840> from<00:01:31.020> there

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
then you know just wrench it from there

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.480 
then you know just wrench it from there
and<00:01:31.170> hopefully<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.799> hopefully<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.159> worked<00:01:32.340> but

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
and hopefully it hopefully it worked but

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.390 
and hopefully it hopefully it worked but
after<00:01:33.030> using<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:34.250> especially<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
after using this especially on the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.330 
after using this especially on the
driver's<00:01:35.729> side<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:36.630> toy<00:01:36.930> work<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:38.130> was

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
driver's side it toy work so that was

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.960 
driver's side it toy work so that was
nice<00:01:39.619> so<00:01:40.619> ya<00:01:40.770> got<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:41.340> thing<00:01:41.549> off<00:01:41.759> I'm<00:01:41.880> going

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
nice so ya got this thing off I'm going

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.539 
nice so ya got this thing off I'm going
to<00:01:42.030> try<00:01:42.210> get<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.479> backward<00:01:42.930> playoffs<00:01:43.399> next

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.010 

backing<00:01:47.549> plate<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.180> then<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.630> know<00:01:48.810> maybe

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
backing plate and then you know maybe

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.630 
backing plate and then you know maybe
the<00:01:49.229> dizzy<00:01:50.840> distributor<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.079> then<00:01:52.829> maybe<00:01:53.430> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
the dizzy distributor and then maybe the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.399 
the dizzy distributor and then maybe the
thermostat<00:01:54.299> Ritchie<00:01:54.630> right<00:01:54.780> there<00:01:55.020> I'm<00:01:55.259> gonna

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
thermostat Ritchie right there I'm gonna

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.410 
thermostat Ritchie right there I'm gonna
get<00:01:55.560> definitely<00:01:55.920> get<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.130> replaced<00:01:56.420> all

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
get definitely get that replaced all

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.909 
get definitely get that replaced all
right<00:01:58.909> progress
