00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:08.120
 hello everyone at the microphone zogan and you 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:11.370
 see the 10th edition of crazy experiences 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:15.000
 today in the transfer waiting for you holey 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:19.789
 crown flying mastodon and german 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.789
 bowling all ready then go 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.700
 winstorm pavement and half fallen 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.250
 Mouse is an unpleasant situation of real combat 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.300
 However, in our program, the Mouse and not 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.410
 such scrape fell on 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.690
 opposite side of the street already 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.500
 lined up small - caliber machine guns 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.080
 fluffy 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.210
 and waiting in the wings place over elder 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.070
 brother 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:53.440
 We decided to check whether the kids can 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.440
 disassemble the giant shooting him in the crown 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.730
 several hundred shots and we saw 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.370
 the result is grape seeds yet 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.160
 able to overcome the armor of one of 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.610
 the thickest selfish aggregates of ours 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.180
 games so if you go for a drive 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.640
 mouse 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.830
 be sure to wear a helmet before the fight 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:42.760
 in order to be prepared for such 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:46.600
 awkward moment on the main dish we have 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.650
 classics of the genre westfield master beer mouse 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.070
 and explosions bk 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.410
 Well, all right as you like the essence 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.750
 experiment just can cut off 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.720
 bombshell turret from a light tank 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.850
 change the trajectory of the fall of 200 tons 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.220
 monster or still physics in the world 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.330
 tanks read weight and and mouse flop 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.280
 feeling only a slight crunch 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.980
 after numerous attempts we never 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.450
 could accurately understand whether the tower affects 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.580
 Mausa or not so that the Koran will blow up 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.260
 too late in general could not 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.260
 synchronize the whole performance 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.870
 shake 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.610
 but they time for sorrow a little scratching 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.280
 turnips we remembered that on the map 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.410
 the lost city is the right place and 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.319
 the height from which the mouse will fall 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.519
 much less than on westfield which means 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.680
 it should be much easier to thoroughly 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.900
 by the explosion of the ammunition under the mouse we and 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.810
 could not affect his fall 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.120
 which means its mass is too big to 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.260
 notice the little things like flying into it 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.269
 the towers of the other tanks here are the fans 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.880
 Skye scientists have proved that when jumping 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:23.380
 maus on the enemy can be sure 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:26.709
 is that you will not be disturbed and on 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.160
 dessert today is cold gray fast and 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.810
 smashing german bowling 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.269
 we wondered how much 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.110
 tanks can be destroyed at once 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:41.170
 sides cooking method following 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.920
 one e50m pile of low-level tokens and 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.660
 descent to rdi rally 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.239
 We first build the engine pt 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.480
 then we drive the inventory to the hill 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:56.200
 her pinch of speed and voila damn not 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.690
 It turned out the first time it fell just 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.370
 two skittles remaining lightweight 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.950
 frightened able to resist 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.950
 we did not like this result at all 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.629
 staff under steam and lined them up 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.659
 in turn green red we 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:18.079
 pressed them against the wall of the house and then gave 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:21.419
 start on a pole and 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.160
 having flown with great speed e50m 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:27.919
 destroyed seven tanks 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.919
 however, this was not enough for us 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:49.160
 a little thought, we made castling 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:49.160
 E50 on a mx 50 b and again conducted the experiment 

00:04:57.739 --> 00:05:03.989
 eleven little nothing 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:08.429
 guilty toes burst from shaking 

00:05:03.989 --> 00:05:11.189
 land of a ram playing tanks be 

00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:13.679
 watchful never pile your side 

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:17.149
 around the building next to you otherwise 

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:19.860
 ram a x 50 b 

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:21.179
 Well, that came to an end 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.399
 release of our program 

00:05:21.179 --> 00:05:25.469
 before saying goodbye i remind 

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:27.929

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:30.300
 the next crazy experiences you get
