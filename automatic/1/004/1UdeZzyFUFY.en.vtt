all<00:00:47.399> sorts<00:00:47.609> of<00:00:47.879> artifacts<00:00:48.449> so<00:00:49.320> we<00:00:49.590> knew

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
all sorts of artifacts so we knew

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.049

immediately that they had found

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.029 
immediately that they had found
something<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.960> was<00:00:52.079> associated<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.949> know

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
something that was associated you know

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
came back and we investigated the hole

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.500 
came back and we investigated the hole
and<00:01:00.980> decided<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.309> was<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:03.210> interesting

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
and decided that it was so interesting

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.729 
and decided that it was so interesting
that<00:01:03.809> we<00:01:04.050> were<00:01:04.140> going<00:01:04.230> to<00:01:04.320> come<00:01:04.500> back<00:01:04.710> later

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
that we were going to come back later

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
that year and we spent parts of four

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.640 
that year and we spent parts of four
years<00:01:08.610> excavating<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.750> area<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.410> what

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
years excavating in this area and what

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.580 
years excavating in this area and what

depression<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.829> the<00:01:19.860> ground<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.759> don't<00:01:21.150> know

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
depression in the ground I don't know

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.760 
depression in the ground I don't know
what<00:01:21.450> caused<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.930> possibly<00:01:22.439> there<00:01:22.619> was<00:01:22.740> a

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
what caused it possibly there was a

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.499 
what caused it possibly there was a
large<00:01:22.950> tree<00:01:23.310> here<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.759> blew<00:01:23.939> down<00:01:24.119> and

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
large tree here that blew down and

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.620 
large tree here that blew down and
created<00:01:24.869> created<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.799> depression<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.430> the

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
created created the depression and the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.030

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
Washington's used it as a handy place to

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.710 
Washington's used it as a handy place to
throw<00:01:29.310> their<00:01:29.490> trash<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.420> 18th<00:01:30.659> century

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
throw their trash in the 18th century

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.630 
throw their trash in the 18th century
you<00:01:31.649> know<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.799> didn't<00:01:32.009> have<00:01:32.040> trash<00:01:32.340> trucks

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
you know you didn't have trash trucks

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.340 
you know you didn't have trash trucks
coming<00:01:32.939> around<00:01:33.149> to<00:01:33.420> take<00:01:33.600> away<00:01:33.810> your<00:01:33.990> refuse

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
coming around to take away your refuse

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.200 
coming around to take away your refuse

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
so you had to deal with it the best way

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.389 
so you had to deal with it the best way
you<00:01:36.270> could<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:37.079> typically<00:01:37.619> what<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.009> did<00:01:38.159> was

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
you could and typically what you did was

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.010 
you could and typically what you did was
you<00:01:38.430> deposited<00:01:39.149> you<00:01:39.600> know<00:01:39.689> sort<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.899> an

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
refuse we excavated here and found over

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.069 
refuse we excavated here and found over
that<00:01:51.810> over<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.229> course<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.649> time<00:01:52.710> over

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
that over the course of that time over

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.490 
that over the course of that time over
120,000<00:01:55.079> artifacts<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.850> then<00:01:57.149> another

120,000 artifacts and then another

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.010 
120,000 artifacts and then another
30,000<00:01:58.500> animal<00:01:59.280> bones<00:01:59.490> so<00:02:00.119> it's<00:02:00.420> still<00:02:00.659> one<00:02:00.990> of

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
30,000 animal bones so it's still one of

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.990 
30,000 animal bones so it's still one of
the<00:02:01.289> largest<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.100> most<00:02:02.159> important

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
the largest and most important

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.580 
the largest and most important
archaeological<00:02:03.149> deposits<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:04.380> we've

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
archaeological deposits that we've

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:19.630 
archaeological deposits that we've
excavated<00:02:04.859> here<00:02:05.280> at<00:02:05.369> my<00:02:05.460> burning

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.090 

so<00:02:20.640> this<00:02:21.270> actually<00:02:21.570> is<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.020> whole<00:02:22.440> this<00:02:22.950> is

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
so this actually is the whole this is

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.130 
so this actually is the whole this is
the<00:02:23.250> location<00:02:23.580> of<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.000> hole<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.450> was<00:02:24.570> dug<00:02:24.630> by

the location of the hole that was dug by

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.020 
the location of the hole that was dug by
the<00:02:25.710> grounds<00:02:26.130> crew<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.610> that's<00:02:26.730> where<00:02:26.910> those

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
the grounds crew and that's where those

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.660 
the grounds crew and that's where those
first<00:02:27.300> artifacts<00:02:27.810> came<00:02:28.170> from<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:29.310> we<00:02:29.460> came

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
first artifacts came from so we came

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.790 
first artifacts came from so we came
back<00:02:29.700> at<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.180> later<00:02:30.240> date<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.900> we<00:02:31.260> expanded

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
back at a later date and we expanded

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.700 
back at a later date and we expanded

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
this area and wound up opening an area

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.500 
this area and wound up opening an area
that's<00:02:34.860> about<00:02:35.040> 30<00:02:35.340> feet<00:02:35.610> by<00:02:35.910> 30<00:02:36.090> feet<00:02:36.240> across

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
that's about 30 feet by 30 feet across

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.650
