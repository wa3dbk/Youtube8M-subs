00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
game just personally I like it I like it

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.070 
game just personally I like it I like it
a<00:01:09.479> lot<00:01:09.710> it's<00:01:10.710> just<00:01:10.909> just<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:12.450> an<00:01:12.630> upgrade

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
a lot it's just just like an upgrade

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.080 
a lot it's just just like an upgrade
pistol<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.890> would<00:01:14.490> say<00:01:14.670> it's<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> mixture

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
pistol I would say it's a mixture

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.280 
pistol I would say it's a mixture
between<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.479> bow<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.720> arrow<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.960> pistol

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
between the bow and arrow in the pistol

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.149 
between the bow and arrow in the pistol
it<00:01:16.740> has<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.240> guess<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.080> firing<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
it has can I guess the the firing of the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.609 
it has can I guess the the firing of the
bow<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.460> arrow<00:01:20.520> but<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.420> has<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:22.140> shots<00:01:22.439> of

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
bow and arrow but it has the shots of

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.039 
bow and arrow but it has the shots of
the<00:01:22.710> pistol<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.580> that's<00:01:24.330> my<00:01:24.540> opinion<00:01:24.780> or<00:01:24.960> the

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
the pistol so that's my opinion or the

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.310 
the pistol so that's my opinion or the
bazooka<00:01:25.439> I'll<00:01:25.560> save<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.950> last<00:01:26.189> cuz<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.850> cant

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
bazooka I'll save to last cuz this cant

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.710 
bazooka I'll save to last cuz this cant
special<00:01:28.320> blunderbuss<00:01:29.210> thought<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.329> boss<00:01:30.479> is

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
special blunderbuss thought the boss is

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.429 
special blunderbuss thought the boss is
a<00:01:30.869> glorified<00:01:31.290> rifle<00:01:31.979> except<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.850> can<00:01:33.030> do<00:01:33.150> this

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
a glorified rifle except it can do this

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.670 
a glorified rifle except it can do this
yeah<00:01:34.439> don't<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.159> back<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.670> fire<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.570> not<00:01:36.900> far

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
yeah don't you back and fire is not far

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.940 
yeah don't you back and fire is not far
it's<00:01:37.860> not<00:01:38.009> as<00:01:38.159> high<00:01:38.369> as<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:39.030> rifle<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.740> think<00:01:40.740> it

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
it's not as high as the rifle I think it

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.380 
it's not as high as the rifle I think it
does<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.250> same<00:01:41.460> amount<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.700> damage<00:01:41.909> once

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
does the same amount of damage once

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.969 
does the same amount of damage once
again<00:01:42.600> all<00:01:42.780> these<00:01:42.899> weapons<00:01:43.259> should<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.590> semi

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
again all these weapons should a semi

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.960 
again all these weapons should a semi
damage<00:01:44.399> from<00:01:44.729> my<00:01:44.850> testing<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:46.430> on<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.759> next

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
damage from my testing so on the next

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.649 
damage from my testing so on the next
weapon<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.540> screwed<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.820> okay<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.210> ice<00:01:51.360> cream

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
weapon I screwed you okay the ice cream

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.200

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
is a cosmetic weapon so that basically

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.969 
is a cosmetic weapon so that basically
means<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:55.020> can't<00:01:55.350> hurt<00:01:55.560> people

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
means it can't hurt people

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.760 
means it can't hurt people
sounds<00:01:56.729> kind<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:56.939> stupid<00:01:57.180> yeah<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.439> kind<00:01:58.710> of

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
the look of the colors but maybe the

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.020 
the look of the colors but maybe the
cell<00:03:08.530> visit<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:09.010> check<00:03:09.160> yourselves<00:03:11.670> nope<00:03:12.700> so

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
cell visit to check yourselves nope so

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.900 
cell visit to check yourselves nope so
sounds<00:03:13.480> so<00:03:14.380> it's<00:03:14.620> basically<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.400> colors<00:03:15.730> with

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
sounds so it's basically the colors with

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.020 
sounds so it's basically the colors with
a<00:03:15.940> different<00:03:16.330> texture<00:03:16.930> now<00:03:17.890> the<00:03:17.950> fish<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:18.760> the

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
a different texture now the fish and the

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.660 
a different texture now the fish and the
banana<00:03:19.330> and<00:03:19.600> then<00:03:20.080> we'll<00:03:20.200> argue<00:03:20.380> on<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.740> next

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
banana and then we'll argue on the next

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.240 
banana and then we'll argue on the next
field<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.720> banana<00:03:23.050> and<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.410> fish<00:03:23.620> do<00:03:24.130> the

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
field the banana and the fish do the

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.860 
field the banana and the fish do the
same<00:03:24.459> exact<00:03:24.790> thing<00:03:24.880> they're<00:03:25.450> just<00:03:25.660> kind<00:03:25.840> of

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
same exact thing they're just kind of

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.440 
same exact thing they're just kind of
throwing<00:03:26.140> items<00:03:26.410> I<00:03:26.800> don't<00:03:27.520> think<00:03:27.940> they<00:03:28.090> do<00:03:28.150> as

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
throwing items I don't think they do as

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.360 
throwing items I don't think they do as
much<00:03:28.690> damage<00:03:28.720> as<00:03:29.470> you<00:03:29.530> would<00:03:29.740> expect<00:03:29.830> them<00:03:30.340> to

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
much damage as you would expect them to

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.270 
much damage as you would expect them to
though<00:03:30.730> and<00:03:31.510> I<00:03:31.600> think<00:03:31.660> these<00:03:32.500> are<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.950> weapons

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
though and I think these are the weapons

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.030 
though and I think these are the weapons
that<00:03:33.370> kind<00:03:34.270> of<00:03:34.360> don't<00:03:34.570> do<00:03:34.810> anything<00:03:35.080> they<00:03:35.740> kind

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
that kind of don't do anything they kind

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.910 
that kind of don't do anything they kind
