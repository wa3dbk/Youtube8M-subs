00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.820
 there she goes together with the other candidates 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.300
 the last exercises are done during the practical lessons 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.919
 to pass the exam later 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.939
 I admire driver's license to ensure that there are fewer road casualties 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.269
 I myself have a bit against standard is just the castle money and 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.180
 the box time and theory alone is easier 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.020
 could be better and maybe be selling 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.570
 hopefully it is not mandatory 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.650
 nevertheless driving instructor believes Jan polder is important which is also something 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.990
 practical experience 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.100
 Before the candidates go on the road with an examiner I am of course busy 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.690
 with vehicle control 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.990
 because then the club's policy starts with the correct handling of gas 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.890
 also go to sleep sometimes on time 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.500
 that has to look 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.809
 after that we naturally also go to the use of flashing light 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.469
 many similarities regarding of course a balance vehicle 

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:06.800
 but the young people too 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.800
 it was generally expected to be a lot faster 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.060
 they do not learn how to handle it properly 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.130
 lieke is ready for the exam 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.050
 but there is also a nervous one 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.610
 no not that I think it will work 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.260
 and then the time comes, however, for the final instructions for the exam 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.920
 that will belong to a number of things 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.920
 the name of a nice word the temp roosters 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.920
 and what matters is the services of the vehicle 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.350
 because I am not nervous we are not allowed to 9 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.310
 But Jan Pol goes to the field all goes well you saw the man 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.080
 made the time 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.060
 the region 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.490
 that there was a bit more rest and driving times 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.490
 and that is reflected in correct behavior that went well 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.620
 and then the result 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.700
 he comes to declare farmers 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.910
 the board 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.600
 year tracts of soil from an upset stomach an excellent he but 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.440
 municipality requires an investigation into possibilities
