band on the back of the bow tie and find
your<00:00:20.550> neck<00:00:20.760> size<00:00:21.199> typically<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.560> like<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.189> tie

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
your neck size typically I like the tie

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.189 
your neck size typically I like the tie
line<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.760> size<00:00:24.029> or<00:00:24.060> two<00:00:24.269> smaller<00:00:24.720> than<00:00:24.990> my

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
line a size or two smaller than my

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.560 
line a size or two smaller than my
actual<00:00:25.410> short<00:00:25.980> neck<00:00:26.220> size<00:00:26.490> because<00:00:27.240> then<00:00:27.420> your

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
actual short neck size because then your

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.450 
actual short neck size because then your
bow<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.960> little<00:00:28.260> bit<00:00:28.349> shorter<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.220> think

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
bow is a little bit shorter and I think

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.540 
bow is a little bit shorter and I think
that<00:00:29.609> looks<00:00:29.760> better<00:00:30.170> so<00:00:31.170> I'm<00:00:32.040> going<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.369> tie

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
that looks better so I'm going to tie

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.090 
that looks better so I'm going to tie
mine<00:00:32.759> at<00:00:32.969> 14<00:00:33.510> which<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.260> smallest<00:00:34.380> size<00:00:34.860> on

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
mine at 14 which is the smallest size on

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.319 
mine at 14 which is the smallest size on
this<00:00:35.219> boat<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:37.460> take<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.610> adjustable<00:00:39.149> length

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
this boat I take the adjustable length

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.280 
this boat I take the adjustable length
of<00:00:39.570> fabric<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.370> this<00:00:41.370> particular<00:00:42.329> bowtie<00:00:43.020> has

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
of fabric and this particular bowtie has

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.420 
of fabric and this particular bowtie has
a<00:00:43.320> hook<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.680> bar<00:00:43.829> closure<00:00:44.219> so<00:00:45.120> take<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.840> hook

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.610 

and<00:00:50.430> put<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.120> 14<00:00:52.850> then<00:00:54.170> put<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.260> bow<00:00:55.379> tie

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
and put it in 14 then put the bow tie

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.200 
and put it in 14 then put the bow tie
around<00:00:55.949> your<00:00:56.250> neck<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:58.789> set<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.059> it's

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
around your neck and set it so it's

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.899 
around your neck and set it so it's
about<00:01:00.300> even<00:01:01.070> then<00:01:03.949> bring<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.100> right<00:01:05.309> side<00:01:05.640> up

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
about even then bring the right side up

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.179 
about even then bring the right side up
a<00:01:07.310> little<00:01:08.310> bit<00:01:08.460> higher<00:01:08.729> than<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.450> left<00:01:09.630> side

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
a little bit higher than the left side

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.550 
a little bit higher than the left side
so<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.430> bottom<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> right<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.900> about

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
so that the bottom of the right is about

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.770 
so that the bottom of the right is about
where<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.189> left<00:01:14.400> starts<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.060> narrow<00:01:16.430> then

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
where the left starts to narrow then

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.410 
where the left starts to narrow then
take<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.930> left<00:01:18.960> side<00:01:19.729> bring<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.820> over<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
take the left side bring it over the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.940 
take the left side bring it over the
right<00:01:21.570> side<00:01:23.180> under<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.930> through<00:01:27.590> then<00:01:28.590> cinch

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
right side under and through then cinch

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.490 
right side under and through then cinch
it<00:01:29.130> tight<00:01:30.710> then<00:01:31.710> take<00:01:32.040> your<00:01:32.159> left<00:01:32.400> side<00:01:32.700> and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.950 

this<00:01:38.520> folded<00:01:39.000> part<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.330> going<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.570> be<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.780> body

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
this folded part is going to be the body

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.340 
this folded part is going to be the body
of<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.409> boat<00:01:40.939> that<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.600> long<00:01:42.810> right<00:01:43.049> side

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
the folded part together in front of the

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.859 
the folded part together in front of the
right<00:01:58.080> side<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.649> had<00:01:58.770> come<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.280> front<00:01:59.580> of<00:01:59.670> it

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.719 

once<00:02:03.869> you've<00:02:04.020> done<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.310> there<00:02:05.310> should<00:02:05.580> be<00:02:05.700> a

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
once you've done that there should be a

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:15.500 
once you've done that there should be a
hole<00:02:06.680> behind<00:02:08.330> that<00:02:09.330> not<00:02:13.519> take<00:02:14.519> the<00:02:15.060> part<00:02:15.300> thats

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
hole behind that not take the part thats

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.309 
hole behind that not take the part thats
hanging<00:02:15.690> in<00:02:15.930> front<00:02:16.069> keeping<00:02:17.069> it<00:02:17.370> flat<00:02:17.549> and

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
hanging in front keeping it flat and

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.289 
hanging in front keeping it flat and
picking<00:02:19.319> it<00:02:19.410> up<00:02:19.560> by<00:02:20.480> its<00:02:21.480> end<00:02:22.549> I'm<00:02:23.549> pushing<00:02:24.180> it

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
picking it up by its end I'm pushing it

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.289 
picking it up by its end I'm pushing it
through<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:25.140> hole<00:02:25.319> that<00:02:25.470> you've<00:02:25.650> made<00:02:26.299> this

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
through the hole that you've made this

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.910 
through the hole that you've made this
is<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.630> hardest<00:02:27.930> part<00:02:28.049> because<00:02:28.500> sometimes

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
is the hardest part because sometimes

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.309 
is the hardest part because sometimes
the<00:02:29.130> whole<00:02:29.310> it's<00:02:29.489> kind<00:02:29.700> of<00:02:29.760> hard<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.060> find<00:02:30.360> but

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
the whole it's kind of hard to find but

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.080 
the whole it's kind of hard to find but
once<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:31.799> get<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.069> through<00:02:32.280> your<00:02:32.310> basically

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
once you get it through your basically

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.550 
once you get it through your basically
there<00:02:35.390> but<00:02:36.390> now<00:02:36.510> that<00:02:36.630> it's<00:02:36.780> through<00:02:37.049> you<00:02:37.350> can

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
there but now that it's through you can

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.410 
there but now that it's through you can
let<00:02:37.709> go<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.230> pull<00:02:40.920> on<00:02:40.950> both<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.760> the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
let go and you pull on both of the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.960 
let go and you pull on both of the
doubled<00:02:42.720> over<00:02:42.989> sides<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:44.370> tighten<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.730> knot

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
doubled over sides to tighten the knot

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:55.800 
doubled over sides to tighten the knot
and<00:02:45.750> adjust<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.590> bowtie

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.540 

but<00:02:56.380> just<00:02:56.620> until<00:02:56.800> you<00:02:56.950> have<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.280> link<00:02:57.459> that

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
but just until you have the link that

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.990 
but just until you have the link that
you<00:02:57.790> want<00:02:58.060> and<00:02:59.069> the<00:03:00.069> symmetry<00:03:00.489> that<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:00.760> think

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
you want and the symmetry that you think

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.720 
you want and the symmetry that you think
will<00:03:01.090> exposed<00:03:03.599> and<00:03:04.599> then<00:03:05.340> is<00:03:06.340> how<00:03:06.489> you<00:03:06.550> tie<00:03:06.700> a

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
will exposed and then is how you tie a

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.940 
will exposed and then is how you tie a
bow<00:03:06.910> tie
