landscape now is that in full Sun it's
bright<00:01:15.830> red<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:16.640> then<00:01:16.760> again<00:01:16.940> when<00:01:17.060> you<00:01:17.120> take

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
bright red and then again when you take

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.570 
bright red and then again when you take
a<00:01:17.300> look<00:01:17.480> at<00:01:17.630> it<00:01:17.750> in<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:17.960> shade<00:01:18.200> area<00:01:18.890> its<00:01:19.220> part

of<00:01:40.100> squirrels<00:01:40.490> a<00:01:40.970> lot<00:01:41.780> of<00:01:41.900> butterflies<00:01:42.200> it's

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
of squirrels a lot of butterflies it's

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.700 
of squirrels a lot of butterflies it's
it's<00:01:43.160> really<00:01:43.430> quite<00:01:43.700> quite<00:01:44.180> nice<00:01:44.360> we<00:01:44.990> know<00:01:45.170> and

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
it's really quite quite nice we know and

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.110 
it's really quite quite nice we know and
I<00:01:45.800> know<00:01:45.920> there's<00:01:46.100> so<00:01:46.220> many<00:01:46.310> different<00:01:46.790> kind<00:01:47.000> of

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
I know there's so many different kind of

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.000 
I know there's so many different kind of
levels<00:01:47.630> here<00:01:47.720> you<00:01:48.110> even<00:01:48.380> have<00:01:48.530> stepa<00:01:48.770> Bulls

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
levels here you even have stepa Bulls

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.560 
levels here you even have stepa Bulls
around<00:01:49.130> your<00:01:49.400> stairs<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:49.970> inside<00:01:50.390> the

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
around your stairs and inside the

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.510 
around your stairs and inside the
staircases<00:01:51.020> right<00:01:51.590> we<00:01:51.800> developed<00:01:52.280> that<00:01:52.430> with

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
staircases right we developed that with

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.010 
staircases right we developed that with
the<00:01:52.610> landscaper<00:01:53.090> so<00:01:53.330> we<00:01:53.420> could<00:01:53.570> put<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.810> step

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
the landscaper so we could put the step

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.270 
the landscaper so we could put the step
bubbles<00:01:54.320> right<00:01:54.530> inside<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:55.010> stairs

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
bubbles right inside the stairs

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.160 
bubbles right inside the stairs
themselves<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.000> as<00:01:56.030> you<00:01:56.270> come<00:01:56.510> up<00:01:56.540> you<00:01:56.840> can<00:01:57.020> see

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
themselves so as you come up you can see

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.420 
themselves so as you come up you can see
the<00:01:57.290> plants<00:01:57.590> themselves<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:58.220> you're<00:01:58.310> not

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
the plants themselves and you're not

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.100 
the plants themselves and you're not
walking<00:01:58.640> on<00:01:58.940> them<00:01:59.120> and<00:01:59.660> then<00:01:59.780> we<00:01:59.900> actually

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
walking on them and then we actually

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.560 
walking on them and then we actually
built<00:02:00.620> in<00:02:00.800> a<00:02:00.890> living<00:02:01.340> staircase<00:02:01.970> with<00:02:02.450> the

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
built in a living staircase with the

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.450 
built in a living staircase with the
step<00:02:02.780> of<00:02:02.900> bulls<00:02:03.080> creeping<00:02:03.500> up<00:02:03.680> and<00:02:03.890> over<00:02:04.280> each

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
step of bulls creeping up and over each

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.160 
step of bulls creeping up and over each
little<00:02:04.910> Hill<00:02:05.120> so<00:02:05.540> that<00:02:05.690> way<00:02:05.810> you<00:02:05.870> can<00:02:06.020> walk

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
little Hill so that way you can walk

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
little Hill so that way you can walk
right<00:02:06.350> on<00:02:06.410> them

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
right on them

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.040 
right on them
so<00:02:07.520> step<00:02:07.730> apple<00:02:08.000> is<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.239> type<00:02:08.509> of<00:02:08.539> plants<00:02:08.989> you

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
so step apple is the type of plants you

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.330 
so step apple is the type of plants you
have<00:02:09.110> something<00:02:09.619> for<00:02:09.769> every<00:02:10.039> kind<00:02:10.220> of

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
have something for every kind of

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.759 
have something for every kind of
category<00:02:10.970> versus<00:02:11.629> sun<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.500> shade<00:02:12.530> and

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
category versus sun and shade and

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.399 
category versus sun and shade and
drought<00:02:13.459> and<00:02:13.849> wet<00:02:14.090> right<00:02:14.750> right<00:02:15.110> we<00:02:15.290> have

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:15.409 
drought and wet right right we have

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:17.770 
drought and wet right right we have
everything<00:02:15.800> whatever<00:02:16.700> a<00:02:16.940> landscape<00:02:17.599> would

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
everything whatever a landscape would

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.540 
everything whatever a landscape would
have<00:02:17.989> to<00:02:18.170> have<00:02:18.349> in<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:18.830> our<00:02:18.950> plants<00:02:19.370> that<00:02:19.430> we

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
have to have in it our plants that we

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.730 
have to have in it our plants that we
try<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.819> try<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.450> find<00:02:20.750> with<00:02:21.080> their<00:02:21.200> attributes

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
try to try to find with their attributes

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.680 
try to try to find with their attributes
so<00:02:22.340> if<00:02:22.460> you<00:02:22.550> have<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:22.700> hill<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.240> you<00:02:23.300> have<00:02:23.660> a

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
so if you have a hill and you have a

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.110 
so if you have a hill and you have a
slope<00:02:24.200> that<00:02:24.380> you<00:02:24.500> need<00:02:24.710> to<00:02:24.890> plant<00:02:25.130> you<00:02:25.730> can<00:02:25.910> use

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
slope that you need to plant you can use

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.630 
slope that you need to plant you can use
our<00:02:26.360> play

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
our play

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.550 
our play
and<00:02:26.940> it'll<00:02:27.120> hold<00:02:27.360> actually<00:02:27.780> in<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:27.960> bark<00:02:28.170> okay

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
and it'll hold actually in the bark okay

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.949 
and it'll hold actually in the bark okay
and<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.370> know<00:02:29.430> this<00:02:29.940> kind<00:02:30.120> of<00:02:30.210> landscape<00:02:30.480> to

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
and I know this kind of landscape to

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.180 
and I know this kind of landscape to
next<00:02:31.290> year<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.500> can<00:02:31.620> have<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.740> little<00:02:31.920> bit<00:02:32.010> less

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
next year you can have a little bit less

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.370 
next year you can have a little bit less
maintenance<00:02:32.550> because<00:02:33.270> they're<00:02:34.050> a<00:02:34.080> little<00:02:34.230> bit

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
maintenance because they're a little bit

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.770 
maintenance because they're a little bit
more<00:02:34.470> drought<00:02:35.370> tolerant<00:02:36.000> they<00:02:36.270> definitely

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
more drought tolerant they definitely

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.380 
more drought tolerant they definitely
definitely<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:37.530> won't<00:02:37.770> have<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.069> mow<00:02:38.220> ah<00:02:38.490> the

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
definitely I won't have to mow ah the

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.050 
definitely I won't have to mow ah the
watering<00:02:39.810> will<00:02:39.930> be<00:02:40.050> quite<00:02:40.380> less<00:02:40.680> because<00:02:41.280> for

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
watering will be quite less because for

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.130 
watering will be quite less because for
example<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.480> elfin<00:02:42.750> time<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.020> we're

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
example the elfin time that we're

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.960 
example the elfin time that we're
standing<00:02:43.290> on<00:02:43.590> is<00:02:43.800> a<00:02:43.830> drought<00:02:44.220> tolerant<00:02:44.730> plant

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
standing on is a drought tolerant plant

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.230 
standing on is a drought tolerant plant
it's<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.660> low<00:02:45.870> watering<00:02:46.380> plant<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.640> we<00:02:48.120> have

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
it's a low watering plant so the we have

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.720 
it's a low watering plant so the we have
very<00:02:48.480> low<00:02:48.690> emitter<00:02:49.160> sprinklers<00:02:50.160> on<00:02:50.310> the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
very low emitter sprinklers on the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.580 
very low emitter sprinklers on the
system<00:02:51.090> so<00:02:51.570> it<00:02:51.660> takes<00:02:51.840> very<00:02:52.020> little<00:02:52.380> water

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
system so it takes very little water

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.010 
system so it takes very little water
which<00:02:52.890> is<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:53.280> cool<00:02:53.610> for<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.940> environment<00:02:54.510> so

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
which is so cool for the environment so

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.449 
which is so cool for the environment so
everything<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:55.650> we're<00:02:55.800> doing<00:02:55.950> is<00:02:56.190> we

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
everything that we're doing is we

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.550 
everything that we're doing is we
created<00:02:56.819> a<00:02:56.910> very<00:02:57.150> nice<00:02:57.870> little<00:02:58.290> ecosystem

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
created a very nice little ecosystem

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.250 
created a very nice little ecosystem
right<00:02:59.100> in<00:02:59.220> our<00:02:59.310> front<00:02:59.400> yard<00:02:59.580> and<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.930> know<00:03:00.989> that
