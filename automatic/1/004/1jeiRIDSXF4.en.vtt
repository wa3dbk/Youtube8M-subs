00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.430
 Welcome to a new tutorial 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.710
 digital.com photographer where we are going to 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.919
 see what is not more than a small 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.470
 trick to work with typography 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.270
 but that's a little trick that you 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.430
 It can save a lot of work and 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.320
 facilitate the task 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.840
 if you are going to make a poster 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.750
 Christmas greeting or composite 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.140
 of a model in what it consists 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.480
 good to change the typography of a 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.320
 label we have here with the name 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.179
 of the actress let's select everything 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.640
 by the way if you want to select everything 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:57.030
 one way the simplest way to 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.460
 select a label that is already 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.670
 fact is to put on top of him and do 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.909
 Double click on the icon that 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.590
 mark that that's a good text field 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.390
 we have it all selected 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.659
 normally to change the typography 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.350
 we come here 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:18.409
 we unfold the window and choose another 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.899
 letter and we see if we like it or not and 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.630
 we repeat the operation and 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:27.880
 we get to see another letter and so 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:32.240
 successively but the truth is that this 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:35.689
 way to proceed is a bit slow a 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.429
 little tedious that's why there is a way that 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.829
 is the one that I will teach you to do it 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:41.509
 It is as simple as 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.810
 next the first thing we have to 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:47.299
 to do is to select the letter on 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.209
 label and so we come for example 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.909
 on top of this that corresponds to natalia 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:55.250
 we double click on the tf and we are already 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.989
 has selected everything with that 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.929
 selected we do once only 

00:01:56.989 --> 00:02:01.789
 once click on the little window that 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:06.230
 shows us the typography that we are 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:09.800
 using click is already put 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:12.380
 highlighted and now or with the keys 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.460
 of arrow or with the mouse wheel 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.250
 we can move and as we do 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:23.570
 you see the letters are changing is the 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:27.410
 fastest way to choose a letter and 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:30.410
 to try without it being tedious and 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.570
 suppose we like this typeface 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.880
 Well, we already have it and now from 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.270
 here we can even adjust by having 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.930
 here 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.410
 the label to the dimensions that we 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.350
 look like they are right for the 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.900
 name or typesetting in 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.820
 concrete that we are using this is 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.820
 the trick so simple
