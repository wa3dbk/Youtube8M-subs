00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629 
haven't been around fully to explore it

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.530 
haven't been around fully to explore it
fully<00:03:22.870> because<00:03:23.140> just<00:03:23.650> literally<00:03:24.040> come<00:03:24.220> out

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
buckers made its return as well so that

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.720 
buckers made its return as well so that
will<00:03:29.140> hopefully<00:03:29.319> solve<00:03:29.980> all<00:03:30.220> the

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
will hopefully solve all the

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
because it's just ridiculous it looks

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.950 
because it's just ridiculous it looks
like<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:33.380> safe<00:04:34.070> spot<00:04:34.340> is<00:04:34.460> just<00:04:35.270> inside<00:04:35.660> of

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
like the safe spot is just inside of

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.810 
like the safe spot is just inside of
Lumbridge<00:04:36.320> castle<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:36.890> entrance<00:04:37.310> seems

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
Lumbridge castle the entrance seems

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.050 
Lumbridge castle the entrance seems
anything<00:04:38.150> outside<00:04:38.419> that<00:04:38.480> can<00:04:38.750> be<00:04:38.870> attacked

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
anything outside that can be attacked

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.060 
anything outside that can be attacked
well<00:04:41.060> so<00:04:41.240> there<00:04:41.390> seems<00:04:41.540> to<00:04:41.690> be<00:04:41.780> a<00:04:42.070> little

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
well so there seems to be a little

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.230 
well so there seems to be a little
circle<00:04:43.400> thing<00:04:43.430> that<00:04:43.610> appears<00:04:43.820> around<00:04:44.060> you
