00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:10.170
 another video of me this time I show 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:12.179
 you could stay like 16.13 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.320
 whole works but unfortunately only on 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:19.619
 the four devices with the new exploit 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.359
 well here on the ipod her 613 and that 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.550
 First of all, we invite ourselves 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.140
 currently down to rescue and that is 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.289
 null point 9.15 three you find the link 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.390
 of course as my video description 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:39.420
 and then we click on extras 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:46.730
 and on select ips convertible then you invite 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:50.100
 Download the os 6.0 for your device 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.500
 You can either do that on tt.com 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.820
 or felix brand so the left 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.789
 you can find in the video description 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.039
 if we look at the all 6.0 file 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.620
 downloaded for our device 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.399
 Let's click on it and click 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.159
 to open 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.280
 So that's very important that you 6.0 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.260
 selects so then we get the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.680
 message that successfully detected 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:19.200
 was and click on ok and we put 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:23.060
 on Beck and on jailbreak the short 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.060
 moment until the kernel is patched 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.010
 and then we just click 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.900
 on next must do the next 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.240
 the device to be brought into the cinemas for 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.360
 We both hold for ten seconds 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.409
 pressed and then we leave 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.080
 press the power button and just press 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:52.830
 still the home button for 15 seconds 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:58.020
 I'll do this once 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:02:00.630
 7 8 9 10 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.979
 it did not work out at 7 seconds 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.170
 approximately, the screen should be black 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:21.630
 become 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:26.040
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.800
 10 13 15 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.440
 we already see retro works that is 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.170
 We have it successfully in the depot 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.900
 Mode brought I give you a tip 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.000
 to the orientation where you both feel 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.230
 must press about seven 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.209
 seconds, the screen should be black 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.410
 if that is not the case today 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.019
 the woman so long until having been 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.900
 turns black and then just again 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.650
 three seconds longer 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.400
 so is the ipod in matrix murder and in 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.750
 further we are advised 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:00.329
 that this is a dish derrick and what 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.950
 means that means when the ipod goes out 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.109
 because battery is empty or if we have the 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.980
 have fully identified, we must 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:10.470
 always boot like this 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.739
 We have to do that now, too 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.390
 this is easy and click on Beck 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:19.380
 and since we must again select ips 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.530
 click on the panel and again the 16.0 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.170
 Choose a file 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.359
 Let's go back to ok and just fine 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.790
 so now we wait until the first 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:32.890
 ipod is finished 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.900
 that lasts at the moment 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.370
 I play with it a bit before 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.370
 you're not waiting so long 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.510
 so that has now almost ten minutes 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:58.160
 Lasted in the finished is again 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:00.530
 to see the apple and what we have now 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.340
 still have to do is the device offenders 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.530
 to the ground 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.450
 theoretically we could wait until now 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.310
 it is built ready or we build the 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.040
 directly but that does not matter I do that 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.660
 ever direct and in it already 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.850
 is prepared we bring that easy 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.170
 again directly into the dfu mode and 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.109
 only get ten seconds both 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.450
 keys pressed or 15 seconds only 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:32.210
 still the power button only the 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:40.490
 homebutton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and 1 2 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:42.860
 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.970
 we see redsnow already working that 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:53.690
 means we have succeeded 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:57.500
 hammer out now, we can already see 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:59.540
 the pineapple that means we have so 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.419
 are already successfully doing so already 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:06.200
 stands then that means with redsnow 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:09.669
 templates ready and we just have to 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.669
 do something on the ipod 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.290
 after the ipod had finished 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:20.770
 we lockscreen we just do it 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:20.770
 do not unlock like that 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.310
 Ok, now try again 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:46.970
 and then we have to go again 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:49.370
 see steering wheel a bit happening there 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:52.130
 we have it there for you we can 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.690
 just click on it and then 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:58.850
 When we are asked we are sounding 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:06:00.830
 Of course, click on user and done 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.470
 We will see the study start page 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:06.340
 That means we have our device 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:10.760
 successfully broken 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:12.950
 so that's it from me so I 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.350
 Hope you liked it new now 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.240
 if you can follow me on twitter 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.450

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:24.520
