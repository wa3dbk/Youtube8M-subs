 the difference of leaving school 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.720
 open it for us and start 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.160
 explain here publicly what is the 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.349
 claim of them and ccoo which is what 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.180
 then plan the government of the 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.760
 city ​​from the educational portfolio as

 technique 35 since when are you tomás 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.340
 taking this school and we had 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.989
 assembly yesterday at 3 o'clock in the afternoon 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.550
 Finished vote on two shifts and 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.190
 well since that time I was like 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.480
 school to see if you can explain me 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.670
 because there are several contradictions and what 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.440
 is what they intend to change what is it 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.870
 that you have above all put the 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.110
 accent in the evening shift that is 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.140
 from 18 45 onwards now now 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.480
 it's a whole night from 1845 to eleven 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.489
 at night how would this shift be if 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.210
 you get to carry forward this change 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.920
 curricular from 1645 to eleven of the 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.100
 night like today have fellow 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.200
 computing that they changed the plan of 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.240
 study and then in beni more more hours 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.520
 In a more skated tone the question is in which 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.250
 would affect you this in 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.520
 principle me that I am in fifth year 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.980
 affection I am with the old plan of the 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.350
 that if it would affect what would affect 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.790
 they would be affected basically in environment che 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.930
 what we are protesting the 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.729
 next topic there are many people who 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.700
 works with natura night and that does not have 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.590
 the ability to come to study 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.840
 already working then you have to choose 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.970
 between work or study we what 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.530
 we are saying it is perfect we do not 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.320
 we are against not adding 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.250
 hours what we are saying is 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.110
 let's find a way for the 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.270
 companions of the night shift that today 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.090
 they take less time to complete 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.950
 the load now since they are missing but from 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.259
 other ways adding one more year or 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.750
 Seeing the way to study subjects 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.670
 example literature civic education a 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.020
 distance and came to render endings or 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.430
 practical work being that this is 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.200
 a technical school 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.399
 this is a single technique well contame me 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.310
 you then what he was telling me 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.350
 not just off camera in relation to 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.729
 for example what other type of impact 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.360
 I would have this curricular change 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.370
 good with respect only the turn 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.530
 vespertino if not to the titles but 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.530
 also to the subjects to be a school 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.209
 technical we have very information 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.610
 specific to the career that we 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:27.450
 we study and this curriculum change 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.280
 It influences a lot since the careers of 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.090
 matters that are specific to the 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.530
 career that in this case is automotive 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:39.050
 it would reduce the information that we 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.660
 we get to compress the in matters 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.489
 and add subjects of general interest or 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.190
 be that this would be somehow 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.959
 reads when the characteristic and the value 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.420
 typical and characteristic aggregate in 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.150
 clear technical school that is the idea that 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.040
 proposes the government of the city ​​in the 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.330
 change of curricula what is the 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.489
 your decision will continue to take 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.040
 school for an indefinite time 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.510
 spend at least indeterminate time 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.920
 until we receive an answer or 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.480
 let's have the meeting with the minister in 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.190
 what good can we hire that is 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.260
 is working so that this is not 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.569
 applies well thanks guys we stay 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.910
 here with the image of these students that 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.220
 are taking the school remember 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.769
 they are planning planning shots 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.110
 stepped patricia de roberto this 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.079
 means 5 schools in the day of 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.329
 today they are taken from tomorrow 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.829
 he says they would be adding 10 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.019
 more and the idea is that for the day 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:33.260
 Wednesday there are more than 30 schools 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.720
 taken here in the federal capital well 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.459
 the work with the claim of the students and 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.330
 students of technical schools in the 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.640
 good city
