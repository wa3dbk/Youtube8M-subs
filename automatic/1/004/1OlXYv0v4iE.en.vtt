 Hello dear, I want to meet you today 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.340
 introduce our maxi cosi and also 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.710
 one of the most practical purchases the 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.559
 we did for the day 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.130
 winter our maxi cosi 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.260
 sleeping bag we have this maxi cosi 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.539
 Here's the maxi cosi of this fix 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.490
 amt is currently taking over the camerawork 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:29.099
 and yes and now in the transitional period 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.040
 or since the transitional period and then to 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.440
 winter, of course, we have considered 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.440
 what do we do what do we buy for you 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.440
 footmuff and then have us directly for 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.420
 the maxi cosi footmuff decided that 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.000
 foot then we have kindly from 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.579
 baby article de provided 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.930
 get cost and unconditionally so 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.510
 I do not have a video now 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.399
 But I think that's about it 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.219
 product really very good and therefore 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.039
 I'll show you quickly and see 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:03.270
 the maxi cosi with the seat as from 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:06.479
 or just with this footmuff so me 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:13.170
 take him because he is the whole time 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:18.390
 Tripod crazy in any case we have 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:21.000
 have the maxi cosi coffee black 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.430
 we borrowed from gc in austria 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.470
 together with the isofix station 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.530
 I can only really do that every mom 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.509
 recommend it is super handy and we 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.400
 I have the donia pram there I can 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.570
 you again the video in the infobox 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.240
 to link 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.700
 and you can also do that as a stop and go 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.430
 system use for the maxi cosi and 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:46.560
 just in time as if he was no longer 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.869
 wanted to lie in this baby carrier and 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.320
 did not fit in well, though 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.390
 Although they find just a little bit somehow 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.430
 we were too small when we were 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.979
 shopping for example the maxi cosi 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.799
 one should not use the child too 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.930
 long in the maxi-cosi but leave at 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.530
 shopping super-practical with the isofix 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:11.670
 station maxi cosi worked out on the 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.430
 stroller on it and super and what me 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.219
 also very good 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.900
 was just then the beanbag 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:17.500
 if you do not worry about them 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.810
 had to 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.819
 what to wear or to have 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.489
 no ski suit or something to wear 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.920
 but that foot said that was just 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.390
 always in the maxi-cosi inside and I show 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.390
 you look like that with kai 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.300
 this is how the sleeping bag looks like with a child 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.280
 So, as you can see , it really does capture 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.510
 fabric has maxi fabric in longer 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.910
 cosi perfect and is now called eight months 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.660
 and still fits in it will 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.220
 Slowly but it still works 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.230
 and right here has one 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.240
 zipper and also here 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.220
 I would have liked that one 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.200
 you can lose the upper part 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.850
 but unfortunately not being there of course 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.440
 again is practical who can 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.510
 you do not lose it and you can do that 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.070
 nicely make out bottom flaps 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.250
 So if it was somehow that way 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.530
 I open it up quickly and like you 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.680
 You can see every child is completely normal 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.670
 buckle down here, too 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:25.690
 lash down the strap 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:29.250
 and here it is just the head part and he 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.250
 is really very warm 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:38.590
 we'll give it to you see you again 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.440
 sleeping bag and now again without a child 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.300
 that's what the whole thing looks like without a child 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.680
 have already formed so fuzz here 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.600
 because we really do have the sleeping bag 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.070
 have been in use for a long time and 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.070
 wraps constantly 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.420
 As you can see, there are also here 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.080
 at maxi cosi the two 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.720
 Settings just after the 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.780
 wedge is already big, we have the quote 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.950
 above 1 was missing and you can do that here 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:10.810
 also to hear together like that 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:13.840
 with the help of these things as accurate and as 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:17.739
 you see, it just fits everything 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.630
 perfect so it really is in it 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.000
 i the biggest advantage thats easy 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:28.780
 perfectly matched to the maxi cosi 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:32.050
 and then it works out that way and 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.270
 This is what the assembly of this looks like 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.620
 Footmuff is also ultralight like it 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.710
 I show you now also completely 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:42.520
 fast and you actually only do it 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.650
 The following one either threads one 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.440
 below 1 or above hangs just 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:50.130
 on how tall your child is 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:56.490
 us is threaded above then once 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:05:02.390
 that here only once through this and 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:04.520
 next to make that through this and 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.590
 ready set go 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.840
 All in all, I can really do this 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.630
 footmuff and by the way at all on the 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.000
 maxi cosi gabriel fix highly recommend before 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:18.060
 all in combination with the isofix 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.950
 traction granted to it with the help of this 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:24.570
 isofix adapter things installed in the car 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.140
 and you really only have to 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.990
 a clip cen and snap out again and 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:32.460
 that really has a lot of life for me 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.230
 if i get on my child i would 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.230
 definitely do it again 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:42.210
 it is very cheap to rent 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:44.250
 believe 30 euros for the maxi cosi and 30 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.700
 euro for the isofix we paid 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.380
 at mdc in austria you have to 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.370
 I can just ask 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.080
 very recommended 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.340
 I do not want the video at all 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.380
 unnecessarily lengthen 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:00.580
 and if you still have questions about that 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:02.320
 I would like to ask you and yes we 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.430
 were really very very very very 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.650
 satisfied 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:09.610
 the only thing I think about now 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:11.919
 If I have a baby, what would I do 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:16.360
 a hot summer or a hot one 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:18.190
 summerday no, so a baby what im 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.990
 I would be born this summer 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.120
 Maybe some summer 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.760
 purchase for the maxi cosi because 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.070
 especially in black beard it very much 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.900
 warm in the summer 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.090
 the summer in the kaff the world came 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.000
 luckily was not so extreme and 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.979
 even if the child is a few weeks 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.080
 old one is then not synonymous permanently 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:40.930
 on the way but just when she has a few 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.700
 months older perhaps since summer 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.889
 I do not have any personal reference at this time 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.300
 I will experience but I believe 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:48.250
 when we have a child seat at the 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.710
 In any case, he will buy larger ones for me 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.120
 to buy yes keep entertained 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.370
 I say goodbye I hope so 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.870
 video was interesting for you and me 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.870
 say thank you for seeing me
