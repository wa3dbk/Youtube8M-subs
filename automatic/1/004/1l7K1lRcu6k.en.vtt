00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:06.279
 for 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.910
 and ever wondered what the 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.950
 motivation or how we motivate ourselves 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.720
 motivate more money or do what 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.420
 we want if you had to choose between 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.320
 the work of your dreams and earn more 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.320
 money that I would choose 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.579
 I was happy 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:33.910
 the work of my dreams create more 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.450
 money 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.450
 that makes you happy 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.699
 according to scientists it seems that what 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.059
 that we thought about motivation maybe 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.010
 not as tight as we thought but 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.250
 Let's start by talking about what is 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.250
 motivation 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.170
 the motivation is the result of several 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.359
 mechanisms that occur in our brain 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.909
 but that can basically be summarized 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.800
 in two large groups those who have to 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:02.750
 see with rewards and those that have to 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.030
 see with pleasure and everything is 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.710
 related to two neurotransmitters the 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.720
 first is the dopamine that is generated 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.869
 when we imagine ourselves getting something 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.909
 for example if I want to go on vacation 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.560
 thinking about it generates me dopamine and my 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.869
 brain gets going to get 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.090
 what makes me feel good when 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:23.770
 I get it segregates again the same 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.770
 dopamine level and I feel satisfied 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.900
 I imagine that when you are working 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.930
 that's going to lower my level of 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.909
 serotonin has I'm going to feel bad about 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.780
 that I will start working for not 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.780
 feel like this 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.770
 and understand how these work 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.200
 two big engines is going to be essential 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.590
 to discover how beings are motivated 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.590
 humans 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.310
 the study showed that those who 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:53.710
 they concentrated on their ideal work 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.750
 ended up sending fewer resumes and 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.820
 getting fewer employment opportunities 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.649
 that's because if you think about the 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.539
 objective as it has already achieved 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.060
 brain codifies it as finished task 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:07.610
 and considers that it does not require more energy 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.830
 In addition, the results showed that 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.900
 focus only on the positive prepared 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.599
 less to the students for 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.970
 setbacks and they got discouraged with 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.770
 greater ease in exchange people 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.640
 that focused on the process and the 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.680
 steps 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.280
 they sent more résumés and got 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.280
 better results 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.820
 curious effect is the ceriani effect that 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.800
 it tells us that our brain is 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.270
 scheduled to complete the tasks 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.770
 even the smallest 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.480
 this is the cause that we have the 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.460
 need to finish is not all that 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.290
 we have on the plate that's why it's so 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.650
 important in a diet put little 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.650
 food 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.970
 this effect is the cause of that 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.190
 unpleasant feeling of knowing that 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.709
 we have something pending sometimes we 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.170
 distracts and other makes us follow up 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.099
 that we have not finished what 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.099
 we had pending 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.980
 one of the most widespread ideas is that 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.960
 money is a great motivator but you 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.170
 what do you think motivates more money or 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.060
 do what you want 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.980
 Studies show us that 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.319
 people we are less motivated by the 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.750
 money and more for what we like 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.730
 that makes us feel autonomous and capable 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.770
 it's more the tests done demonstrate 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.900
 that the more economic reward 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.750
 less creativity they develop 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.270
 people in conclusion despite what 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.270
 it could seem obvious or think only about the 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.880
 objective nor think only positively nor 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.590
 think only about the rewards or just 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.080
 they had your attitude seems to be enough 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.300
 to achieve our goals for 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.310
 achieve our goals also we 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.250
 we have to focus on the process in the 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.170
 steps to follow and also keep in mind 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.239
 everything that can go wrong since we 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.580
 prepare better to carry out everything 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.819
 what we need to get that 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.080
 that we want then what would be the formula 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.030
 masterful of motivation 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.920
 the goal has to be clear and 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.500
 specific so that our mind will 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.720
 generate the necessary dopamine so that the 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.360
 brain wants more and gets going 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.340
 to get the target also 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.500
 can pose negatively 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.510
 in this way lowers serotonin and 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.790
 our brain starts up to 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.560
 make up for this decline is important 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.330
 Focus on the process in this way 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.489
 we designed the necessary steps to 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.680
 reach it and also focus on what 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.260
 can go wrong in this way we can 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.910
 mentally prepare for it both the 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.430
 objective as the process should be 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.990
 challenging stimulants but neither 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.450
 too far apart in time 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.000
 too difficult because if not 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.830
 we get the intermediate steps 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.800
 our brain will not generate dopamine 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.020
 what we need and we will be frustrated by 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.240
 that is important to set goals or steps 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.250
 intermediates since they allow you to maintain 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.190
 dopamine levels or reward 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.290
 high on the road and remember 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.090
 reward you for all your successes 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.670
 that will make the stay 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.080
 high serotonin levels 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:02.370
 especially when you do something heavy 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.370
 tired or bored
