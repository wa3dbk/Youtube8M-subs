others were there the planned oil is our
life<00:00:15.199> now<00:00:16.199> in<00:00:16.350> mustard<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:16.980> with<00:00:17.699> some<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:17.940> the

life now in mustard you with some of the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.870 
life now in mustard you with some of the
dessert<00:00:18.449> which<00:00:18.660> we<00:00:18.840> have<00:00:18.960> done<00:00:19.490> the<00:00:20.490> pungency

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
dessert which we have done the pungency

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.849 
dessert which we have done the pungency
will<00:00:21.240> be<00:00:21.420> added<00:00:21.720> because<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.140> pungent<00:00:22.590> meal

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
will be added because the pungent meal

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.330 
will be added because the pungent meal
is<00:00:23.189> not<00:00:23.630> digested<00:00:24.630> by<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.840> poultry<00:00:25.439> house<00:00:25.590> so

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
is not digested by the poultry house so

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.910 
is not digested by the poultry house so
the<00:00:26.550> huge<00:00:26.849> load<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.480> mustard<00:00:27.960> meal<00:00:28.260> which<00:00:28.890> is

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
the huge load of mustard meal which is

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.250 
the huge load of mustard meal which is
very<00:00:29.220> rich<00:00:29.460> in<00:00:29.490> proteins<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.689> not<00:00:30.960> being

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
very rich in proteins is not being

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260 
very rich in proteins is not being
efficiently<00:00:31.890> utilized<00:00:32.309> either<00:00:32.640> for<00:00:32.940> poetry

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
efficiently utilized either for poetry

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.760 
efficiently utilized either for poetry
and<00:00:33.390> cattle<00:00:33.750> also<00:00:34.050> done<00:00:34.200> lightly<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
and cattle also done lightly to the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.430 
and cattle also done lightly to the
bitter<00:00:35.070> taste<00:00:35.340> or<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.730> can<00:00:35.880> only<00:00:36.059> dance<00:00:36.600> so

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
bitter taste or you can only dance so

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.350 
bitter taste or you can only dance so
one<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.010> things<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.399> we<00:00:38.850> are<00:00:38.969> going<00:00:39.210> to

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
one of the things that we are going to

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.630 
one of the things that we are going to
do<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.530> second<00:00:40.950> generation<00:00:41.010> of

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
do is in the second generation of

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.150 
do is in the second generation of
hybrids<00:00:42.120> we<00:00:42.750> are<00:00:42.870> going<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.350> remove<00:00:43.620> pungency

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
hybrids we are going to remove pungency

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.430 
hybrids we are going to remove pungency
so<00:00:44.879> there<00:00:45.030> will<00:00:45.090> be<00:00:45.149> lot<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.480> bland<00:00:45.870> mustard

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
so there will be lot of bland mustard

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.220 
so there will be lot of bland mustard
oil<00:00:46.559> available<00:00:47.329> the<00:00:48.329> other<00:00:48.539> thing<00:00:48.899> which<00:00:49.079> has

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
oil available the other thing which has

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.709 
oil available the other thing which has
been<00:00:49.260> done<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.730> bring<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.239> quality<00:00:51.690> even

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
been done is to bring the quality even

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.100 
been done is to bring the quality even
better<00:00:52.199> than<00:00:52.469> olive<00:00:52.770> oil<00:00:53.039> olive<00:00:53.850> oil<00:00:54.180> has<00:00:54.449> 18

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
better than olive oil olive oil has 18

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.840 
better than olive oil olive oil has 18
one<00:00:55.320> fraction<00:00:55.949> which<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.190> considered<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.760> be

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
one fraction which is considered to be

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.540 
one fraction which is considered to be
very<00:00:56.969> important<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.600> some<00:00:57.809> 82<00:00:58.440> but<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.190> has<00:00:59.340> no

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
very important and some 82 but it has no

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.049 
very important and some 82 but it has no
18<00:00:59.910> 3<00:01:00.149> or<00:01:00.359> omega-3<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.949> omega-3<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> very

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
18 3 or omega-3 so omega-3 is a very

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.939 
18 3 or omega-3 so omega-3 is a very
important<00:01:03.570> health<00:01:03.780> related<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.470> fraction

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
important health related the fraction

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.010 
important health related the fraction
which<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.519> naturally<00:01:06.090> present<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.630> mustard

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
which is naturally present in mustard

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.440 
which is naturally present in mustard
that<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.439> haven't<00:01:07.710> done<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.760> already<00:01:08.970> they<00:01:09.420> are

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
that we haven't done it already they are

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.750 
that we haven't done it already they are
invested<00:01:10.049> but<00:01:10.560> by<00:01:10.890> changing<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.520> other

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
invested but by changing the other

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.120 
invested but by changing the other
fractions<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.600> keeping<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.320> omega-3

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
fractions and keeping the omega-3

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.420 
fractions and keeping the omega-3
fraction<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.790> think<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.540> would<00:01:15.720> be<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:17.250> best

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
fraction I think it would be the best

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.609 
fraction I think it would be the best
health<00:01:18.119> oil

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
health oil

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.940 
health oil
and<00:01:20.549> because<00:01:21.359> mustard<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:21.990> rolling<00:01:22.380> five<00:01:22.649> six

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
and because mustard is rolling five six

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.139 
and because mustard is rolling five six
million<00:01:23.159> hectares<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.909> land<00:01:24.179> so<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.679> will<00:01:25.890> mean

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
million hectares of land so it will mean

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:32.450 
million hectares of land so it will mean
quality<00:01:27.149> oil<00:01:27.479> quality<00:01:28.079> meal<00:01:28.819> so<00:01:30.890> I<00:01:31.890> think

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
quality oil quality meal so I think

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.370 
quality oil quality meal so I think
whatever<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.270> have<00:01:33.390> done<00:01:33.600> done<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> little<00:01:34.109> bit

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
whatever we have done done a little bit

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.059 
whatever we have done done a little bit
will<00:01:34.859> lead<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.340> major<00:01:35.750> changes<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.959> in<00:01:37.920> the

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:38.069 
will lead to major changes in in the

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:41.059 
will lead to major changes in in the
dietary<00:01:38.429> situation<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.360> also<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.929> the<00:01:40.170> cattle

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:41.069 
dietary situation and also in the cattle

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:43.490 
dietary situation and also in the cattle
and<00:01:41.250> poultry<00:01:41.429> industry<00:01:42.359> us<00:01:42.539> because<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
and poultry industry us because the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.380 
and poultry industry us because the
price<00:01:43.709> also<00:01:44.069> it<00:01:44.159> will<00:01:44.250> be<00:01:44.399> far<00:01:44.640> cheaper<00:01:44.819> per

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
price also it will be far cheaper per

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.380 
price also it will be far cheaper per
than<00:01:45.689> olive<00:01:46.229> oil<00:01:46.380> well<00:01:47.039> you<00:01:47.850> know<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.240> don't

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
than olive oil well you know I don't

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.240 
than olive oil well you know I don't
know<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.990> will<00:01:49.200> be<00:01:49.319> certainly<00:01:49.530> far<00:01:50.009> cheaper

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
know it will be certainly far cheaper

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.399 
know it will be certainly far cheaper
than<00:01:50.399> olive<00:01:50.850> oil<00:01:51.119> which<00:01:51.299> has<00:01:51.420> become<00:01:51.659> but<00:01:52.380> you

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
than olive oil which has become but you

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:59.240 
than olive oil which has become but you
can<00:01:52.679> expensive<00:01:54.649> sort<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.770> item<00:01:56.719> so<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:58.250> don't

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
can expensive sort of item so I don't

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.520 
can expensive sort of item so I don't
believe<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.849> prices<00:02:00.360> will<00:02:00.750> rise<00:02:00.959> so<00:02:01.319> much

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
believe that prices will rise so much

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.779 
believe that prices will rise so much
for<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:03.709> and<00:02:04.709> that<00:02:04.950> income<00:02:05.310> then<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.640> only

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
for this and that income then you only

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.719
