and<00:04:29.409> cut<00:04:30.069> it<00:04:30.189> off<00:04:30.340> because<00:04:30.550> it<00:04:30.759> did<00:04:30.939> take<00:04:31.210> quite

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
and cut it off because it did take quite

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.080 
and cut it off because it did take quite
a<00:04:31.479> while<00:04:31.689> but<00:04:32.379> once<00:04:32.800> your<00:04:33.009> note<00:04:33.219> that<00:04:33.520> I<00:04:33.759> made

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
a while but once your note that I made

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.790 
a while but once your note that I made
should<00:04:34.300> just<00:04:34.509> automatically<00:04:35.139> be<00:04:35.439> in<00:04:35.499> here

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
should just automatically be in here

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.779 
should just automatically be in here
already

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
already

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:39.510 
already
I<00:04:36.819> forgot<00:04:37.419> what<00:04:37.599> number<00:04:37.870> it<00:04:37.960> is<00:04:38.050> but<00:04:38.379> yeah<00:04:39.370> it's

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
I forgot what number it is but yeah it's

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.659 
I forgot what number it is but yeah it's
in<00:04:39.639> here<00:04:39.789> so<00:04:40.779> once<00:04:41.349> that's<00:04:41.560> in<00:04:41.830> there<00:04:42.249> go<00:04:42.639> ahead

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
in here so once that's in there go ahead

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.879 
in here so once that's in there go ahead
and<00:04:43.029> you<00:04:43.479> can<00:04:43.659> minimize<00:04:43.990> this<00:04:44.379> for<00:04:44.590> now<00:04:44.680> and

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
and you can minimize this for now and

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.350 
and you can minimize this for now and
don't<00:04:45.490> forget<00:04:45.939> to<00:04:46.300> move<00:04:46.509> your<00:04:46.569> arm<00:04:47.460> um<00:04:48.460> once

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
don't forget to move your arm um once

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.629 
don't forget to move your arm um once
you<00:04:49.479> download<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:50.020> profile<00:04:50.529> to<00:04:51.039> move<00:04:51.249> it<00:04:51.430> into

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
you download the profile to move it into

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:54.119 
you download the profile to move it into
your<00:04:51.879> profile<00:04:52.360> area<00:04:52.779> so<00:04:53.740> once<00:04:53.889> you<00:04:53.979> download

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:54.129 
your profile area so once you download

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:55.709 
your profile area so once you download
it<00:04:54.370> it's<00:04:54.580> going<00:04:54.669> to<00:04:54.729> be<00:04:54.819> in<00:04:54.909> a<00:04:54.999> wooden<00:04:55.270> rar<00:04:55.479> file

00:04:55.709 --> 00:04:55.719

00:04:57.809 --> 00:04:57.819 
so just extract it like I was talking

00:04:57.819 --> 00:04:59.939 
so just extract it like I was talking
about<00:04:57.879> before<00:04:58.120> and<00:04:58.539> it<00:04:59.469> should<00:04:59.710> be<00:04:59.830> up<00:04:59.919> here

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
about before and it should be up here

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.580 
about before and it should be up here
and<00:05:00.370> it's<00:05:01.180> right<00:05:01.389> here<00:05:01.629> and<00:05:01.779> then<00:05:02.199> just<00:05:02.469> go

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
and it's right here and then just go

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.019 
and it's right here and then just go
ahead<00:05:02.680> and<00:05:03.069> go<00:05:03.310> to<00:05:03.639> x4<00:05:04.029> 360<00:05:04.810> go<00:05:05.770> to<00:05:05.830> UM<00:05:06.400> your

00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:07.029 
ahead and go to x4 360 go to UM your

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:09.209 
ahead and go to x4 360 go to UM your
content<00:05:07.479> folder<00:05:07.870> which<00:05:08.259> just<00:05:08.800> click<00:05:09.039> on<00:05:09.189> that

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:09.219 
content folder which just click on that

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:12.420 
content folder which just click on that
so<00:05:09.610> it<00:05:09.759> pops<00:05:09.939> up<00:05:10.150> right<00:05:10.330> there<00:05:10.509> and<00:05:10.860> go<00:05:11.860> to<00:05:11.889> the

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
so it pops up right there and go to the

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.670 
so it pops up right there and go to the

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
folder it's in right here and drag it in

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.240 
folder it's in right here and drag it in
on<00:05:15.539> this<00:05:16.539> end<00:05:16.779> is<00:05:16.900> the<00:05:16.990> ones<00:05:17.199> rather<00:05:17.439> white

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250
