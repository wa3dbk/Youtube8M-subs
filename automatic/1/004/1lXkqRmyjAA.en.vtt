cancer it was at that point that that
her<00:00:54.949> oncologist<00:00:55.760> suggested<00:00:56.360> that<00:00:56.570> we<00:00:56.690> may

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
her oncologist suggested that we may

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.960 
her oncologist suggested that we may
have<00:00:57.110> Lynch<00:00:57.409> syndrome<00:00:57.650> so<00:00:58.519> it<00:00:58.580> was<00:00:58.729> the<00:00:58.820> first

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
have Lynch syndrome so it was the first

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.310 
have Lynch syndrome so it was the first
time<00:00:59.150> we<00:00:59.300> ever<00:00:59.330> heard<00:00:59.659> anything<00:00:59.960> like<00:01:00.140> this

time we ever heard anything like this

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.939

and<00:01:01.040> so<00:01:01.909> we<00:01:02.150> were<00:01:02.239> kind<00:01:02.510> of<00:01:02.600> like<00:01:03.080> okay<00:01:03.650> well

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
and so we were kind of like okay well

and so we were kind of like okay well
what's<00:01:04.190> the<00:01:04.339> next<00:01:04.460> step<00:01:04.760> and<00:01:05.180> there<00:01:05.630> wasn't

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780

more<00:01:34.939> like<00:01:35.210> we're<00:01:35.630> still<00:01:36.079> going<00:01:36.200> to<00:01:36.320> get

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
more like we're still going to get

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.510 
more like we're still going to get
cancer<00:01:38.289> so<00:01:39.289> then<00:01:39.439> I<00:01:39.469> started<00:01:39.920> getting<00:01:40.039> worried

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
should I be getting colonoscopies and I

should I be getting colonoscopies and I
finally<00:01:47.359> at<00:01:47.600> 23<00:01:48.109> I<00:01:48.469> decided<00:01:48.829> you<00:01:49.009> know<00:01:49.280> it's

find the mutation for my family I wanted
to<00:02:02.149> know<00:02:02.270> if<00:02:02.390> I<00:02:02.479> had<00:02:02.719> it<00:02:02.899> because<00:02:03.079> I<00:02:03.200> didn't

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
to know if I had it because I didn't

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.349 
to know if I had it because I didn't
want<00:02:03.499> to<00:02:03.649> continue<00:02:04.070> these<00:02:04.189> colonoscopies<00:02:05.060> if

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:05.359 
want to continue these colonoscopies if

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:08.950 
want to continue these colonoscopies if
I<00:02:05.509> didn't<00:02:05.780> need<00:02:05.960> to<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:08.270> then<00:02:08.780> the

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
I didn't need to and and then the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.630 
I didn't need to and and then the
genetic<00:02:09.289> counselor<00:02:09.649> was<00:02:09.770> like<00:02:09.920> well<00:02:10.130> we<00:02:10.429> can't

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
genetic counselor was like well we can't

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.880 
genetic counselor was like well we can't
really<00:02:10.789> use<00:02:11.060> you<00:02:11.270> as<00:02:11.510> a<00:02:11.540> subject<00:02:12.170> this<00:02:12.590> is<00:02:12.710> like

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
really use you as a subject this is like

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.040 
really use you as a subject this is like
really<00:02:13.130> just<00:02:13.700> like<00:02:13.819> no<00:02:13.940> we<00:02:14.120> have<00:02:14.300> to<00:02:14.480> it's<00:02:14.660> it's

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
really just like no we have to it's it's

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.530 
really just like no we have to it's it's
more<00:02:15.200> informative<00:02:15.620> if<00:02:16.040> I<00:02:16.460> used<00:02:16.700> someone<00:02:17.060> who's

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
more informative if I used someone who's

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.200 
more informative if I used someone who's
had<00:02:17.750> cancer<00:02:17.960> and<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:19.880> of<00:02:19.970> course

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
had cancer and and so of course

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.520 
had cancer and and so of course
immediately<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.660> thought<00:02:20.960> you<00:02:21.200> know<00:02:21.290> thought

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
immediately I thought you know thought

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.040 
immediately I thought you know thought
of<00:02:21.650> my<00:02:21.800> dad

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
of my dad

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.160 
of my dad
he<00:02:23.340> had<00:02:24.340> already<00:02:24.460> started<00:02:24.610> cancer<00:02:25.210> twice<00:02:25.750> and

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
he had already started cancer twice and

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.810 
he had already started cancer twice and
there<00:02:26.500> was<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.220> know<00:02:27.340> they<00:02:27.460> needed<00:02:27.610> his

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
there was and you know they needed his

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.060 
there was and you know they needed his
tumors<00:02:28.210> to<00:02:28.540> test<00:02:28.750> for<00:02:29.020> IHC<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:30.040> MSI<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.910> so

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
tumors to test for IHC and MSI and so

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.860 
tumors to test for IHC and MSI and so
they<00:02:33.070> did<00:02:33.310> that<00:02:33.490> I<00:02:33.790> wasn't<00:02:34.210> prepared<00:02:34.480> for<00:02:34.600> like

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
they did that I wasn't prepared for like

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.570 
they did that I wasn't prepared for like
how<00:02:35.020> long<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:35.380> was<00:02:35.440> going<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.680> take<00:02:35.890> to<00:02:36.370> find

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
how long it was going to take to find

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.280 
how long it was going to take to find
the<00:02:36.670> mutation<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.210> it<00:02:37.330> ended<00:02:37.510> up<00:02:37.600> taking<00:02:37.780> nine

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
the mutation and it ended up taking nine

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.900 
the mutation and it ended up taking nine
months<00:02:39.810> for<00:02:41.010> them<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.220> find<00:02:42.430> my<00:02:42.670> dad's

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
months for them to find my dad's

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.330 
months for them to find my dad's
mutation<00:02:43.650> because<00:02:44.650> they<00:02:44.740> had<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:45.010> find<00:02:45.190> the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
mutation because they had to find the

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.130 
mutation because they had to find the
tumors<00:02:45.730> from<00:02:45.910> 12<00:02:46.240> years<00:02:46.450> ago<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:46.870> they<00:02:46.930> had<00:02:47.050> to

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
tumors from 12 years ago and they had to

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.100 
tumors from 12 years ago and they had to
do<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.380> testing<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:49.660> know<00:02:49.750> they<00:02:49.900> started

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
do the testing and you know they started

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.420 
do the testing and you know they started
off<00:02:50.200> with<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.440> cheapest<00:02:50.800> and<00:02:50.950> easiest<00:02:51.040> they

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
off with the cheapest and easiest they

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.520 
off with the cheapest and easiest they
think<00:02:51.580> genetic<00:02:51.880> tests<00:02:52.060> first<00:02:52.300> and<00:02:52.660> they

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
think genetic tests first and they

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.660 
think genetic tests first and they
couldn't<00:02:53.740> find<00:02:53.920> anything<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:54.340> I<00:02:54.460> think

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
couldn't find anything and I think

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.040 
couldn't find anything and I think
finally<00:02:55.030> they<00:02:55.150> use<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.420> comprehensive

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
finally they use the comprehensive

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.110 
finally they use the comprehensive
analysis<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:57.010> find<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.250> mutation<00:02:57.520> and<00:02:57.850> we<00:02:58.000> had

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
analysis to find the mutation and we had

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.980 
analysis to find the mutation and we had
a<00:02:58.150> large<00:02:58.360> deletion<00:02:58.960> and<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.230> msh2<00:02:59.590> gene<00:03:00.130> and

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
a large deletion and the msh2 gene and

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.940 
a large deletion and the msh2 gene and
when<00:03:01.990> we<00:03:02.110> got<00:03:02.200> that<00:03:02.380> when<00:03:02.560> I<00:03:02.590> got<00:03:02.800> those

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
when we got that when I got those

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.680 
when we got that when I got those
results<00:03:03.130> and<00:03:03.580> my<00:03:03.670> dad<00:03:03.850> did<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:04.270> know<00:03:04.390> I<00:03:04.540> was

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
results and my dad did you know I was

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.720 
results and my dad did you know I was
finally<00:03:04.900> relieved<00:03:05.860> that<00:03:06.160> they<00:03:06.490> found

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
finally relieved that they found

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.560 
finally relieved that they found
something<00:03:08.220> conclusive<00:03:09.220> that<00:03:09.880> we<00:03:09.970> did<00:03:10.180> have<00:03:10.360> it

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
something conclusive that we did have it

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.320 
something conclusive that we did have it
and<00:03:10.900> that<00:03:11.860> now<00:03:12.100> that<00:03:12.310> we<00:03:12.400> can<00:03:12.580> do<00:03:12.790> something

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
and that now that we can do something

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.400 
and that now that we can do something
about<00:03:13.780> it

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
about it

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.400 
about it
and<00:03:15.340> so<00:03:15.580> after<00:03:15.820> that<00:03:15.850> my<00:03:16.690> genetic<00:03:17.020> counselor

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
and so after that my genetic counselor

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.020 
and so after that my genetic counselor
called<00:03:17.650> me<00:03:17.800> and<00:03:18.250> she's<00:03:18.520> like<00:03:18.550> when<00:03:18.790> do<00:03:18.940> you

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
called me and she's like when do you

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.730 
called me and she's like when do you
want<00:03:19.180> to<00:03:19.300> get<00:03:19.420> tested<00:03:19.870> because<00:03:20.080> we<00:03:20.380> have<00:03:20.560> you

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
want to get tested because we have you

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.500 
want to get tested because we have you
know<00:03:20.830> have<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.130> mutation<00:03:21.610> results<00:03:22.030> and

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
know have the mutation results and

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.820 
know have the mutation results and
everything<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:22.960> I<00:03:23.050> was<00:03:23.140> like<00:03:23.230> as<00:03:23.560> soon<00:03:23.710> as

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
everything and I was like as soon as

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.640 
everything and I was like as soon as
possible<00:03:24.310> and<00:03:24.960> so<00:03:26.850> I<00:03:27.850> think<00:03:28.209> I<00:03:28.390> came<00:03:28.630> in<00:03:28.810> if<00:03:28.959> you

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
possible and so I think I came in if you

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.470 
possible and so I think I came in if you
may<00:03:30.010> first<00:03:30.250> I<00:03:30.459> think<00:03:30.520> I<00:03:30.790> remember<00:03:30.850> those<00:03:31.270> days

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
may first I think I remember those days

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.460 
may first I think I remember those days
May<00:03:32.080> 1st<00:03:32.290> 2008<00:03:32.890> I<00:03:33.100> got<00:03:33.580> my<00:03:33.730> blood<00:03:33.970> drawn<00:03:34.209> and<00:03:34.630> I

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
May 1st 2008 I got my blood drawn and I

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.320 
May 1st 2008 I got my blood drawn and I
think<00:03:36.010> I<00:03:36.070> got<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.280> results<00:03:36.610> within<00:03:36.970> a<00:03:37.150> couple

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
think I got the results within a couple

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.990 
think I got the results within a couple
weeks<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:38.500> day<00:03:38.950> of<00:03:39.900> was<00:03:40.900> May<00:03:41.290> 23rd<00:03:42.070> 2008<00:03:42.730> I<00:03:42.850> got

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
weeks the day of was May 23rd 2008 I got

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.750 
weeks the day of was May 23rd 2008 I got
my<00:03:43.120> results<00:03:43.300> and<00:03:44.080> so<00:03:44.470> she<00:03:44.620> told<00:03:44.890> me<00:03:45.040> that<00:03:45.730> I

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
my results and so she told me that I

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.500 
my results and so she told me that I
tested<00:03:45.940> positive<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:46.989> I<00:03:47.080> was<00:03:47.200> like<00:03:48.030> great<00:03:49.030> ok

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
tested positive and I was like great ok

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.210 
tested positive and I was like great ok
what<00:03:50.470> to<00:03:50.620> do<00:03:50.739> now

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
what to do now
