00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
the finish I can't tell which one is

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
completely honest with you I actually

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.319 
completely honest with you I actually
like<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.440> better<00:00:58.680> than<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:58.980> I<00:01:00.770> now

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
like this I better than that I now

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.840 
like this I better than that I now
difference<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:04.640> this<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:07.280> $38<00:01:08.280> jig<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.700> this

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
difference is this is a $38 jig and this

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.140 
difference is this is a $38 jig and this
is<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.090> $6<00:01:10.020> jig<00:01:10.290> that's<00:01:10.619> right<00:01:10.920> your<00:01:11.159> six

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
is a $6 jig that's right your six

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.929 
is a $6 jig that's right your six
dollars<00:01:13.369> six<00:01:14.369> bucks

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
dollars six bucks

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.330 
dollars six bucks
I've<00:01:15.689> got<00:01:16.140> hooks<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.680> cost<00:01:16.920> more<00:01:17.100> than<00:01:17.220> this

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
I've got hooks that cost more than this

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.289 
I've got hooks that cost more than this
jig<00:01:18.619> but<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:20.009> question<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.549> will<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.090> perform

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
jig but the question is will it perform

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.230 
jig but the question is will it perform
and<00:01:21.720> will<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.960> produce<00:01:22.520> based<00:01:23.520> on<00:01:23.729> what<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.060> can

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
and will it produce based on what I can

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.050 
and will it produce based on what I can
tell<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:25.140> will<00:01:25.409> actually<00:01:26.310> will<00:01:26.520> probably<00:01:26.909> be

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
tell it will actually will probably be

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.719 
tell it will actually will probably be
almost<00:01:27.299> identical<00:01:27.799> these<00:01:28.799> jigs<00:01:29.100> kind<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.579> have

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
almost identical these jigs kind of have

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.010 
almost identical these jigs kind of have
sort<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:32.030> spiraling<00:01:33.030> spinning<00:01:33.570> drop<00:01:33.840> I

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
sort of a a spiraling spinning drop I

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.260 
sort of a a spiraling spinning drop I
mean<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.310> kind<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.400> does<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> wicked<00:01:36.119> little

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
mean it kind of does a wicked little

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.660 
mean it kind of does a wicked little
spin<00:01:36.600> while<00:01:36.990> it's<00:01:37.140> dropping<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.740> that's<00:01:38.369> I

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
spin while it's dropping and that's I

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.880 
spin while it's dropping and that's I
don't<00:01:39.659> know<00:01:39.750> probably<00:01:40.409> why<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.590> has<00:01:40.710> such

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
don't know probably why it has such

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.399 
don't know probably why it has such
reflective<00:01:41.369> tape<00:01:41.689> but<00:01:42.689> when<00:01:43.170> you're<00:01:43.290> working

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
reflective tape but when you're working

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.649 
reflective tape but when you're working
it<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:44.070> has<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.640> weird<00:01:46.610> like<00:01:47.610> quick<00:01:48.299> jerking

it it has a weird like quick jerking
kind<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.899> motion<00:01:51.229> dancing<00:01:52.229> around<00:01:52.439> like<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.220> big

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
kind of motion dancing around like a big
