00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.380 
flexible arm with a diamond plate head
the<00:00:28.600> actual<00:00:29.160> neck<00:00:30.160> here<00:00:30.490> is<00:00:30.670> about<00:00:30.880> 6<00:00:31.210> inches

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
the actual neck here is about 6 inches

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.060 
the actual neck here is about 6 inches
from<00:00:31.630> about<00:00:31.900> top<00:00:32.140> of<00:00:32.230> this<00:00:32.289> plate<00:00:32.590> to<00:00:32.770> the<00:00:32.859> back

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
from about top of this plate to the back

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.840 
from about top of this plate to the back
of<00:00:33.219> this<00:00:33.340> crap

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
of this crap

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.450 
of this crap
diamond<00:00:34.809> plate<00:00:34.839> here<00:00:35.319> so<00:00:35.800> you<00:00:35.859> got<00:00:35.979> about<00:00:36.100> a<00:00:36.159> 6

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
diamond plate here so you got about a 6

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.770 
diamond plate here so you got about a 6
inch<00:00:36.780> aluminum<00:00:37.780> right<00:00:38.109> arm<00:00:38.409> and<00:00:38.679> see<00:00:38.890> there

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
inch aluminum right arm and see there

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.049 
inch aluminum right arm and see there
plastic<00:00:40.780> coating<00:00:41.260> the<00:00:41.949> idea<00:00:42.280> of<00:00:42.399> this<00:00:42.519> base<00:00:42.729> is

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
plastic coating the idea of this base is

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.020 
plastic coating the idea of this base is
simply<00:00:43.749> to<00:00:44.019> slot<00:00:44.409> this<00:00:44.679> into<00:00:45.219> one<00:00:45.579> of<00:00:45.699> your<00:00:45.819> cup

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
simply to slot this into one of your cup

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.750 
simply to slot this into one of your cup
holders<00:00:46.389> in<00:00:46.539> your<00:00:46.690> vehicle<00:00:47.019> so<00:00:47.859> as<00:00:48.249> you<00:00:48.519> put<00:00:48.699> it

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
holders in your vehicle so as you put it

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.099 
holders in your vehicle so as you put it
into<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.030> cup<00:00:49.359> holder<00:00:49.719> it<00:00:49.839> would<00:00:49.960> just

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:50.109 
into the cup holder it would just

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:52.709 
into the cup holder it would just
squeeze<00:00:50.920> those<00:00:51.129> fins<00:00:51.519> in<00:00:51.969> because<00:00:52.600> they're

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
squeeze those fins in because they're

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.319 
squeeze those fins in because they're
flexible<00:00:52.959> thin<00:00:53.859> just<00:00:54.489> squeeze<00:00:54.909> them<00:00:54.999> into<00:00:55.149> the

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
flexible thin just squeeze them into the

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.469 
flexible thin just squeeze them into the
cup<00:00:55.479> water<00:00:55.719> you<00:00:56.170> have<00:00:56.530> the<00:00:56.949> option<00:00:57.760> of<00:00:57.819> slicing

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:58.479 
cup water you have the option of slicing

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:00.719 
cup water you have the option of slicing
down<00:00:58.870> these<00:00:59.109> fins<00:00:59.739> here<00:00:59.979> just<00:01:00.219> to<00:01:00.339> make<00:01:00.489> them<00:01:00.670> a

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:00.729 
down these fins here just to make them a

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:02.789 
down these fins here just to make them a
bit<00:01:00.879> thinner<00:01:01.149> if<00:01:01.600> your<00:01:01.809> cup<00:01:01.989> holders<00:01:02.409> just<00:01:02.709> a

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:02.799 
bit thinner if your cup holders just a

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:05.280 
bit thinner if your cup holders just a
little<00:01:03.039> bit<00:01:03.129> smaller<00:01:03.459> than<00:01:04.019> required<00:01:05.019> to<00:01:05.199> get

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
little bit smaller than required to get

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.980 
little bit smaller than required to get
this<00:01:05.409> in<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:06.670> that's<00:01:07.120> pretty<00:01:07.420> much<00:01:07.600> how<00:01:07.840> this

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
this in but that's pretty much how this

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.440 
this in but that's pretty much how this
works<00:01:08.260> the<00:01:08.920> diamond<00:01:09.430> plate<00:01:09.640> head<00:01:09.940> on<00:01:10.240> the

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
works the diamond plate head on the

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.600 
works the diamond plate head on the
other<00:01:10.600> hand<00:01:10.900> and<00:01:11.500> mounts<00:01:11.920> directly<00:01:12.310> to<00:01:12.520> the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
other hand and mounts directly to the

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.180 
other hand and mounts directly to the
back<00:01:12.820> of<00:01:13.060> many<00:01:13.690> of<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:13.840> ramp<00:01:14.050> rails<00:01:14.410> here<00:01:15.070> I've

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
back of many of the ramp rails here I've

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.500 
back of many of the ramp rails here I've
got<00:01:15.310> a<00:01:15.340> new<00:01:15.550> beam<00:01:15.760> you<00:01:15.850> can<00:01:15.910> see<00:01:16.150> it<00:01:16.330> has<00:01:16.480> a

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
got a new beam you can see it has a

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.080 
got a new beam you can see it has a
diamond<00:01:16.810> plate<00:01:17.200> here<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.610> hardware<00:01:19.000> to

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
diamond plate here the hardware to

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.610 
diamond plate here the hardware to
connect<00:01:19.420> these<00:01:19.540> two<00:01:19.840> is<00:01:19.960> included<00:01:20.440> with<00:01:20.530> the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
connect these two is included with the

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.440 
connect these two is included with the
krail<00:01:20.860> not<00:01:21.400> with<00:01:21.580> this<00:01:21.730> base<00:01:21.970> this<00:01:22.000> base

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
krail not with this base this base

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.600 
krail not with this base this base
doesn't<00:01:22.720> come<00:01:22.990> with<00:01:23.110> any<00:01:23.170> hardware<00:01:23.650> and<00:01:24.460> then

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
doesn't come with any hardware and then

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:25.890 
doesn't come with any hardware and then
that<00:01:24.820> just<00:01:25.000> connects<00:01:25.270> onto<00:01:25.510> that<00:01:25.600> diamond

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
that just connects onto that diamond

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.350 
that just connects onto that diamond
plate<00:01:26.110> there<00:01:26.350> and<00:01:26.590> now<00:01:26.770> you<00:01:26.830> have<00:01:27.160> a<00:01:27.460> flexible

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
plate there and now you have a flexible

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.280 
plate there and now you have a flexible
arm<00:01:29.310> mounting<00:01:30.310> system<00:01:30.670> for<00:01:30.850> your<00:01:31.420> Garmin<00:01:32.110> GPS

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290

or<00:01:32.770> any<00:01:32.950> GPS<00:01:33.870> for<00:01:34.870> your<00:01:34.960> vehicle<00:01:35.260> so<00:01:35.530> you<00:01:35.560> don't

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
or any GPS for your vehicle so you don't

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.920 
or any GPS for your vehicle so you don't
have<00:01:36.130> to<00:01:36.250> do<00:01:36.430> suction<00:01:36.880> cup<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.090> windshield<00:01:37.450> or

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
have to do suction cup to windshield or

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.600 
have to do suction cup to windshield or
bolt<00:01:38.200> down<00:01:38.380> somewhere<00:01:38.800> you<00:01:38.920> can<00:01:39.040> just<00:01:39.190> pop

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
bolt down somewhere you can just pop

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.030
