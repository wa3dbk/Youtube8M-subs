top of their traditional LCD display you

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.920 
top of their traditional LCD display you
can<00:00:16.289> see<00:00:16.789> just<00:00:17.789> going<00:00:18.060> through<00:00:18.240> here<00:00:18.420> there's

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
can see just going through here there's

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.110 
can see just going through here there's
obviously<00:00:19.439> custom<00:00:19.830> interface<00:00:20.160> on<00:00:20.400> top

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:23.120 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.580 

all<00:00:23.750> your<00:00:23.900> same<00:00:24.110> apps<00:00:24.380> if<00:00:24.560> I<00:00:24.650> can<00:00:24.770> get<00:00:24.860> into<00:00:25.220> the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
all your same apps if I can get into the

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.890 
all your same apps if I can get into the
gallery<00:00:27.590> here<00:00:27.890> we<00:00:28.010> can<00:00:28.160> get<00:00:28.580> a<00:00:28.610> look<00:00:28.760> at<00:00:28.970> some

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
gallery here we can get a look at some

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.620 
gallery here we can get a look at some
of<00:00:29.990> this<00:00:30.370> so<00:00:31.370> a<00:00:31.730> cool<00:00:32.150> thing<00:00:32.300> about<00:00:32.450> the

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
of this so a cool thing about the

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.570 
of this so a cool thing about the
exhibits<00:00:33.110> play<00:00:33.290> is<00:00:34.070> that<00:00:34.130> it's<00:00:36.220> really<00:00:37.220> good

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:37.580 
exhibits play is that it's really good

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.210 
exhibits play is that it's really good
sensitivity<00:00:37.940> to<00:00:38.270> touch<00:00:38.420> and<00:00:38.990> so<00:00:39.230> you<00:00:39.290> can<00:00:39.620> high

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
sensitivity to touch and so you can high

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.650 
sensitivity to touch and so you can high
response<00:00:40.610> time<00:00:40.790> so<00:00:40.820> you<00:00:41.030> can<00:00:41.120> actually<00:00:41.390> scroll

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
response time so you can actually scroll

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.140 
response time so you can actually scroll
through<00:00:41.870> the<00:00:41.960> video<00:00:42.200> and<00:00:42.760> you<00:00:43.760> see<00:00:43.940> it<00:00:44.059> goes

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
through the video and you see it goes

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.490 
through the video and you see it goes
through<00:00:44.360> the<00:00:44.450> video<00:00:44.660> really<00:00:45.050> quickly<00:00:45.350> there's

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
through the video really quickly there's

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.700 
through the video really quickly there's
a<00:00:45.530> 1.5<00:00:45.980> gigahertz<00:00:46.280> processor<00:00:46.580> in<00:00:47.180> here

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
a 1.5 gigahertz processor in here

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.960 
a 1.5 gigahertz processor in here
quad-core<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:49.280> as<00:00:49.400> soon<00:00:49.550> as<00:00:49.640> you<00:00:49.700> get<00:00:49.790> to<00:00:49.910> the

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
quad-core and as soon as you get to the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:50.860 
quad-core and as soon as you get to the
point<00:00:50.090> of<00:00:50.210> that<00:00:50.330> you<00:00:50.420> want<00:00:50.570> to<00:00:50.630> take<00:00:50.750> your

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
point of that you want to take your

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.240 
point of that you want to take your
finger<00:00:50.989> off<00:00:51.140> it<00:00:51.559> resumed<00:00:51.800> its<00:00:51.860> playback

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
finger off it resumed its playback

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.130 
finger off it resumed its playback
almost<00:00:52.580> instantly<00:00:52.970> and<00:00:53.120> that's<00:00:53.270> the

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
almost instantly and that's the

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.990 
almost instantly and that's the
combination<00:00:54.350> of<00:00:54.770> the<00:00:54.860> processor<00:00:55.460> and<00:00:55.820> the

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
combination of the processor and the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.240 
combination of the processor and the
screen<00:00:56.330> response<00:00:56.720> time<00:00:56.960> so<00:00:57.589> this<00:00:57.739> model<00:00:57.980> is

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
screen response time so this model is

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.549 
screen response time so this model is
currently<00:00:58.970> available<00:00:59.120> in<00:00:59.510> Japan<00:00:59.839> it's<00:01:00.050> the<00:01:00.170> sh

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
currently available in Japan it's the sh

yeah<00:01:32.950> this<00:01:33.950> also<00:01:34.160> again<00:01:34.580> it's<00:01:34.790> using<00:01:35.030> that

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
yeah this also again it's using that

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:42.430 
yeah this also again it's using that
user<00:01:35.450> display<00:01:35.690> technology<00:01:40.480> and<00:01:41.480> battery<00:01:42.290> like

user display technology and battery like

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.630 
user display technology and battery like
they<00:01:42.530> said<00:01:42.680> last<00:01:42.950> what<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.160> two<00:01:43.280> days<00:01:43.460> on<00:01:43.610> a

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
they said last what the two days on a

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.290 
they said last what the two days on a
single<00:01:43.790> charge

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
single charge

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.320 
single charge
that's<00:01:44.570> 11<00:01:45.260> hours<00:01:45.710> of<00:01:45.890> video<00:01:46.400> playback<00:01:46.670> as

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
that's 11 hours of video playback as

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.870 
that's 11 hours of video playback as
well<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:48.430> demonstrate<00:01:49.430> with<00:01:49.520> my<00:01:49.610> smartphone

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
well and demonstrate with my smartphone

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.640 
well and demonstrate with my smartphone
with<00:01:50.120> this<00:01:50.240> screen<00:01:50.480> technology<00:01:50.960> also<00:01:51.110> has<00:01:51.470> the

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
with this screen technology also has the

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.590 
with this screen technology also has the
capability<00:01:51.770> of<00:01:52.610> holding<00:01:52.820> an<00:01:53.030> image<00:01:53.360> either

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
capability of holding an image either

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.270 
capability of holding an image either
when<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:53.870> power<00:01:54.140> is<00:01:54.290> completely<00:01:54.890> off<00:01:55.010> so<00:01:55.160> you

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
when the power is completely off so you

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.940 
when the power is completely off so you
can<00:01:55.400> have<00:01:55.550> an<00:01:55.640> image<00:01:55.790> on<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.000> screen<00:01:56.120> any

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
can have an image on the screen any

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.090 
can have an image on the screen any
theoretically<00:01:57.950> and<00:01:59.500> Howard's<00:02:00.500> are<00:02:00.650> involved

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
theoretically and Howard's are involved

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.440 
theoretically and Howard's are involved
and<00:02:01.220> that<00:02:01.280> image<00:02:01.670> has<00:02:01.700> been<00:02:01.880> a<00:02:01.970> study<00:02:02.180> on<00:02:02.300> the

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
and that image has been a study on the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.600 
and that image has been a study on the
screen<00:02:05.260> so<00:02:06.260> that's<00:02:06.380> look<00:02:06.950> at<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.160> big<00:02:07.370> those

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
screen so that's look at the big those

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.600 
screen so that's look at the big those
screens<00:02:08.000> on<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.690> new<00:02:08.950> Sharp<00:02:09.950> Aquos<00:02:10.130> phones
