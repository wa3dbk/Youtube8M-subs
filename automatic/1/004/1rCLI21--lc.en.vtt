00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.230
 very good friend we are back here 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.939
 in the garage we are going to talk about the 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:21.130
 audi r8 this beauty that we have 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.320
 here once again is the third time that 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.680
 we bring from the right side to the garage 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.590
 but it 's one of those cars that you're going 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.439
 looking for a pretext to ask 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.989
 the people who send us 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.269
 Obviously you want to drive a car like that 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.120
 every day however there is a good 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:42.210
 pretext for what 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.910
 we have asked for this car audi which is the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.550
 new gearbox the audi r8 is 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.800
 the engine version of dies as they can 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.020
 see here 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.260
 before I had a transmission 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.420
 auto manual let's say called r tronic de 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.760
 six speeds and now we have the 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.580
 electronic equivalent to the volkswagen 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.170
 of that double clutch shaft with seven 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.920
 speeds and that offers you much more 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:12.280
 softness better economy and better 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.250
 performance to this car 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.800
 because audi created that car not because 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:22.010
 now he made this super car 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.440
 audi is a brand that 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.320
 for a long time since recently more than 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.430
 20 years 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:33.520
 struggled to open space in the world 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.600
 of premium vehicles in mexico its 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.600
 image was always what they 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.110
 they always wanted it to be but in 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.360
 europe was not like that in europe people with 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.450
 a little bit older does not see audi from 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.690
 the same way that mercedes benz wv what 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.880
 see a step below 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.370
 the brand has conquered that space and 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.400
 the young Europeans already put someone 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.730
 in its levels and one of the great 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:07.010
 marketing efforts of audi was 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:10.440
 the r8 the audi owns the lamborghini 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.450
 if volkswagen in the volkswagen group is 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.250
 audio owner and therefore the group 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.439
 Volkswagen owns the lamborghini but 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.510
 in practical terms in terms of 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:24.239
 distribution of functions and so on 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.519
 audi is the owner of lamborghini before 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.670
 that the morgue is Volkswagen's 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.790
 Audio 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:35.980
 so they decided to make a 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:38.950
 supercar using the platform of 12 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.800
 one of the most successful brands and more 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.239
 recognized manufacturers of super cars 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.700
 of the world that is precisely the 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.700
 Italian lamborghini then took 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.850
 that base they took over the whole heart 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.410
 the v10 engine that is here is an engine 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.959
 central because central is in the 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.480
 Central rear is between the two axles 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.610
 and in the engines that are always or 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.739
 above the front axle forward or 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.930
 behind the butt in the case in 911 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.160
 for example, that is freaky, this is a 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.320
 central engine car now 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.790
 if the lamborghini is known for its 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:17.490
 madness for his excessive pantomime for a 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.030
 huge noise for cars with a design 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.240
 provocative et cetera indeed until the 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.560
 names do not make them are names of bulls 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.350
 aventador etcetera 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.080
 all that kind of stuff from lamborghini is 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.710
 it's madness and audi is not that then 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:38.520
 they had to give an audi tone to 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:40.320
 super car and they created the r8 i think that 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.100
 they were perfect, I think the only 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.800
 madness of the r8 is is a genius 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.170
 aesthetics thought by the team commanded 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.620
 by walter da silva at that moment 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.770
 is this strip of a different color to the 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.650
 rest of the body what is normal in 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.960
 any other car is that everything was 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.630
 red but imagine that this 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.180
 let's paint red the car will lose 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.990
 a lot of personality this side fringe 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.640
 happened to be this has its functions if 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.830
 has the function for example here of 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.489
 Engine cooling air intakes 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:20.760
 they are functional but what I mean 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:24.570
 is this panel specifically here in 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:27.360
 carbon fiber needed a 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.580
 well I do not say I needed but I think 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.570
 that they created a different color and that 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.900
 gave a lot of air a lot of life to the 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.900
 r8 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.810
 but it's a super car that is very audio 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.720
 in many aspects to begin with it does not have 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.699
 only rear-wheel drive if you drive 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.729
 of the r8 out alone on the wheels 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:53.430
 later like most of the super 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.889
 cars the handling would be much more difficult 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.889
 because it's a car with an engine of 10 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:01.470
 cylinders that version at least 525 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:03.690
 horses there is one and another plus that has 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:07.169
 even 550 horses but this version 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.360
 with its 525 horses and traction in 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.449
 rear wheels would be much more 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.660
 complicated to drive if someone does not 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:18.570
 would have put the all-wheel drive 42 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.750
 with it the car plus a box 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:24.350
 automatic in the specific case of this 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:28.139
 with it the car is already much more 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:31.350
 quiet this is a super car that is 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:33.449
 you can use as a journal car if you have 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:37.790
 phenomenal acceleration capacity to 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:40.520
 we gave us 4.9 seconds from 0 to 100 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:44.030
 magnificent does not have a very good 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.710
 braking capacity too and has 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.530
 all the answers you expect to have 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.600
 a big car the noise of the engine that 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.600
 they will listen in a little while more also 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:57.710
 it's equivalent to a super car but 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:01.510
 out of that is a very good car for 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:04.190
 two people even becomes comfortable 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:07.610
 not the car if it has a level of 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:10.460
 comfort that is not found in the 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:14.090
 Most of the super cars cars 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:16.940
 also has something else more rational than 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.430
 others outperform others this car does not 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.890
 it demands to walk checking it all the time 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.200
 do not buy in ferrari the ferrari is 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.630
 known for a week of pleasure for 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.940
 three details 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.560
 I bought myself lamborghini which is from the 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.330
 same brand and you're going to have to be 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.520
 checking the car fixing things 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.730
 taking it to adjust changing tires 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:40.670
 This is not a car that buys it if 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:42.940
 you use like any normal car and 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:45.710
 ready but it has a striking design 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:49.400
 It has spectacular power in a 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:53.720
 sensational handling in short is a super 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:56.300
 If the car with super cars madness 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.160
 but with much easier handling 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.100
 now 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:04.160
 let's go to a cut and back I'm going to 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.960
 show some little details of the r8 that 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.360
 make this car even more 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:11.060
 special not only positive side 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.190
 also some of the negative side as well 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:16.420
 do not leave right now we come back with 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.420
 more here in the garage
