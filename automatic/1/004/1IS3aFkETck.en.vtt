which is at fairs gonna go for the ice
beam<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:55.739> i<00:00:55.770> predicted<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.430> attack<00:00:56.850> i<00:00:56.879> really

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
beam but i predicted the attack i really

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.430 
beam but i predicted the attack i really
thought<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.570> would<00:00:57.750> go<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:58.020> like<00:00:58.079> you'd<00:00:58.230> rack

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
thought it would go for like you'd rack

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.439 
thought it would go for like you'd rack
on<00:00:58.590> me<00:00:58.680> or<00:00:58.920> something<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.910> i<00:00:59.940> decided<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.329> go

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
on me or something so i decided to go

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.580 
on me or something so i decided to go
for<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.629> sucker<00:01:00.840> punch<00:01:00.930> i<00:01:01.199> ended<00:01:01.440> up<00:01:01.530> doing

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
for the sucker punch i ended up doing

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.560 
for the sucker punch i ended up doing
more<00:01:01.920> than<00:01:02.100> forty<00:01:02.340> percent<00:01:02.609> damn<00:01:02.879> forty-five

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
more than forty percent damn forty-five

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.750 
more than forty percent damn forty-five
percent<00:01:03.750> damage<00:01:04.140> which<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.589> great<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.100> even<00:01:05.700> a

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
percent damage which is great and even a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.070 
percent damage which is great and even a
little<00:01:05.880> bit<00:01:06.000> more<00:01:06.270> because<00:01:06.420> he's<00:01:06.689> holding<00:01:07.020> a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
little bit more because he's holding a

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.500 
little bit more because he's holding a
lifework<00:01:07.729> now<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.939> second<00:01:09.240> turn<00:01:09.360> I

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
lifework now on the second turn I

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.390 
lifework now on the second turn I
thought<00:01:09.810> he<00:01:10.080> was<00:01:10.200> definitely<00:01:10.860> not<00:01:11.250> gonna

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
thought he was definitely not gonna

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.700 
thought he was definitely not gonna
attack<00:01:11.520> me<00:01:11.729> because<00:01:11.970> he<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.930> saw<00:01:13.200> me<00:01:13.229> using

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
attack me because he just saw me using

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.170 
attack me because he just saw me using
zuckerberg<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.520> you'll<00:01:14.640> definitely<00:01:15.060> go<00:01:15.150> for

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
zuckerberg so you'll definitely go for

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.480 
zuckerberg so you'll definitely go for
like<00:01:15.390> every<00:01:15.720> cover<00:01:16.170> carmine<00:01:17.040> or<00:01:17.280> maybe<00:01:17.400> a

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
like every cover carmine or maybe a

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.060 
like every cover carmine or maybe a
switch<00:01:17.790> out<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.060> don't<00:01:18.270> know<00:01:18.740> so<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.799> just<00:01:19.920> had<00:01:20.009> to
