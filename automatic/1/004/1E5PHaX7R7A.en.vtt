use<00:01:01.390> is<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:01.750> actual<00:01:02.260> XR<00:01:02.920> 10<00:01:03.280> crawler<00:01:03.910> bass<00:01:04.330> as

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.020 
use is the actual XR 10 crawler bass as

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.950 
use is the actual XR 10 crawler bass as
its<00:01:05.440> platform<00:01:06.070> so<00:01:07.000> this<00:01:07.240> is<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.509> vision<00:01:07.840> board

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
its platform so this is the vision board

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.850 
its platform so this is the vision board
or<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.979> is<00:01:12.250> the<00:01:12.460> axial<00:01:13.240> crawler<00:01:13.619> this<00:01:14.619> the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
or this is the axial crawler this the

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.430 
or this is the axial crawler this the
the<00:01:15.670> video<00:01:15.820> shows<00:01:16.180> you<00:01:16.210> how<00:01:16.330> to<00:01:16.479> make<00:01:17.290> this

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
the video shows you how to make this

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.350 
the video shows you how to make this
waterproof<00:01:18.070> so<00:01:18.340> you<00:01:18.759> can<00:01:18.910> actually<00:01:19.060> drive

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
waterproof so you can actually drive

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.210 
waterproof so you can actually drive
this<00:01:19.570> underwater<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.860> first<00:01:24.009> thing<00:01:24.130> you

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
this underwater so the first thing you

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.969 
this underwater so the first thing you
need<00:01:24.369> is<00:01:24.430> an<00:01:24.790> AM<00:01:25.210> radio<00:01:25.240> and<00:01:25.930> this<00:01:26.740> is<00:01:26.860> the

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.160 

and<00:04:00.410> just<00:04:00.980> make<00:04:01.190> sure<00:04:01.220> that<00:04:01.430> that's<00:04:02.170> touching

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
and just make sure that that's touching

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.440 
and just make sure that that's touching
all<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.590> surfaces<00:04:03.980> so<00:04:04.250> when<00:04:04.489> the<00:04:04.640> cap<00:04:05.180> comes

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
all the surfaces so when the cap comes

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.830 
all the surfaces so when the cap comes
on<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:05.780> body<00:04:06.280> it's<00:04:07.280> in<00:04:08.090> contact<00:04:08.540> with<00:04:08.720> the

can put that servo arm back on and

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.480 
can put that servo arm back on and
you've<00:05:21.200> pretty<00:05:21.350> much<00:05:21.470> done<00:05:21.590> you<00:05:22.070> used<00:05:22.280> to<00:05:22.400> have

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
you've pretty much done you used to have

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.570 
you've pretty much done you used to have
to<00:05:22.550> wipe<00:05:23.210> off<00:05:23.419> extra<00:05:23.960> grease<00:05:27.130> it's<00:05:28.130> the<00:05:28.340> test

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
to wipe off extra grease it's the test

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.940 
to wipe off extra grease it's the test
