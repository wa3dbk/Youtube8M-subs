00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:14.370
 hello everyone I sang with you and it's 43 to 43 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.100
 part of the mancraft mechanism in this part 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.260
 I will show you as I promised 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.320
 ultra compact comfort door 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.390
 2 on the 2nd floor is more comfortable than that 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.279
 we built in the previous series or won 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.740
 it also costs a more compact scheme 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.100
 nemo pits unfortunately and to such not 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.050
 I thought it was a great scheme and 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.469
 almighty opposite 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.410
 I started watching his channel not so long ago 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:45.450
 is this man an Englishman well or 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.079
 America flax sit as if not shyu in 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.860
 overall his channel is called family 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.440
 maykravt 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.239
 I think the link I will leave in the description you 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.309
 You can look out for something there, but in general 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.640
 he is American and powerful I will say first 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.000
 turn 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:05.250
 so watching his video is very hard 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.110
 very incomprehensible there how to build everything but 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.659
 it is based on 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.820
 he has such videos you know where 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.430
 he is building let's say the same door for 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.340
 minute that is the video lasts exactly one minute 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.530
 not minute 0 1 exactly minute and in minutes 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.630
 he quickly all the doors ready in general 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.869
 over such a short tutorial and her 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.310
 I built a person in general 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.860
 of course at all 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.670
 respect what mechanisms came up 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.590
 four piston doors for example four 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.100
 four here look i have gone in 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.610
 door 3 by 3 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.729
 which I myself built without what as without 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.329
 anyone's guide honestly in general and right there 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:55.890
 used sand and if not sand and 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:02:00.649
 something else will be something like this 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.649
 here actually and 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.580
 here this block it will always be in any 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.840
 three for three doors will remain here 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:14.010
 this block is incomprehensible here I prefer 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:17.190
 sand so therefore i use sand but 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.670
 he came up with a scheme that is 3 by 3 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.220
 a door 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.680
 really the one here is this middle block he 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.410
 somehow the porsche left is pushing it 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.030
 takes too for himself also he came up 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.310
 four to four doors 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.310
 which is generally just hard 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.709
 and also he came up with a bunch of piston 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.850
 elevators and not only them but as already 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:44.519
 I understood the practice of piston lifts for me 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:48.269
 sick theme whether it is mine mine 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:52.019
 something i have piston pistons me 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.090
 I push the waist design of many there he 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.600
 I watched the video service cool cool 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.830
 the elevator works for me there somewhere to read 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.050
 him 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.510
 patch this video and for some reason I donâ€™t 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.880
 It may be too new 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.510
 version of minecraft and you too can 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.090
 such 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.709
 this is such an elevator does not work well in general yes 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.380
 why you have deviated from the topic 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.500
 let's start building the door here 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:24.769
 so that's what we put the model 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:24.769
 wall 6 by 6 here is your 6 by 3 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:32.160
 so break the door for the door shorter 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:38.269
 Generally place and set as usual hidden 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.269
 piston doors here like this 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:47.500
 blocks here and make the roof 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:49.420
 also somehow and just wider already means 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.940
 what we need to do we need to dig 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.330
 Here is a hole from the pistons and the last to 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.760
 piston and do like this hold 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.300
 spend a diet here your fakin here 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.910
 torch and set to rehearse delay on 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.150
 3 as far as I remember that I am already under 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:10.300
 bushes here block and put here here 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.290
 Redstone This block is powered by 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.940
 redstone 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.530
 that it is powered by a unit which 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.010
 powered by repeater which 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.440
 powered by a torch in total 10 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.770
 parties do the same 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.410
 Well , from any side you absolutely 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.100
 decide which one I have here with one 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:35.919
 the parties here are different at all 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:41.229
 we put a redstone block over the torch 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:45.220
 repeater and so here that is the letter and 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:47.140
 yes not a letter well, I do not know Tetris 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.780
 there is such a figure 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:56.560
 Well, in general, everything is ready everything works 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:05:00.430
 just standing here this wrong put 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:04.180
 here in general we put the lever and all 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:08.410
 It should work, I just Krivorukov 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:10.500
 nothing works somewhere in something i 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.240
 wrong 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.950
 vicar Peter on four delay clear 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.920
 I am clearly sorry 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:21.620
 So yes it works but we like 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.420
 glad to connect and front so a 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.380
 came up with a light 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.940
 very light such a connection scheme 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:33.950
 very easy and simple in general so here 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:37.240
 just go to redstone with this one 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:41.840
 hand we lead redstone hiding you 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:44.570
 lured and in general what is here with us 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.420
 lever let's say I prefer here 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:51.020
 the treatment is a block higher then everything 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:54.620
 here is redstone here and peter and so 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.960
 here he goes in general here are the tanks here 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.640
 We connect repeaters so that the scheme does not 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.730
 the torch will not turn on the chip 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:06.230
 work here and so in general all 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:09.230
 closed the door we have the door running us 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:14.090
 ready now I have three such Tver 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:17.540
 Need to overcome this not on high in general 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:20.300
 thank you all for watching it was 43 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.640
 part of the minecraft mechanism subscribe 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.830
 we like to put videos on the channel 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:30.380
 write comments and questions 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:33.430
