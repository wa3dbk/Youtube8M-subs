00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.210 
having trouble using it and I'm a tech
artist<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:21.960> thought<00:00:22.230> well<00:00:22.470> it'd<00:00:22.560> be<00:00:22.650> simple

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
artist so I thought well it'd be simple

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.269 
artist so I thought well it'd be simple
for<00:00:23.340> me<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.490> set<00:00:23.640> up<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.480> wasn't<00:00:24.660> easy<00:00:24.920> so<00:00:25.920> I

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
for me to set up and it wasn't easy so I

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.890 
for me to set up and it wasn't easy so I
decided<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.730> do<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:27.000> video<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.570> do<00:00:27.689> this

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
decided to do this video to do this

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.460 
decided to do this video to do this
video<00:00:28.429> if<00:00:29.429> people<00:00:29.670> get<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.849> back<00:00:30.090> here<00:00:30.599> you'll

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
video if people get the back here you'll

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.000 
video if people get the back here you'll
notice<00:00:33.410> on<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.530> outputs<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.309> here<00:00:36.920> on<00:00:37.920> the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
notice on the outputs of here on the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.760 
notice on the outputs of here on the
back<00:00:38.160> side<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.520> control<00:00:38.940> one<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.379> have<00:00:40.379> two

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
back side of that control one I have two

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.799 
back side of that control one I have two
cables<00:00:41.340> going<00:00:41.850> out<00:00:42.860> from<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.399> out<00:00:44.600> one<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
cables going out from the out one and

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.440 
cables going out from the out one and
two<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:47.550> reason<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.000> because<00:00:48.120> it's

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
two the reason that is is because it's

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.869 
two the reason that is is because it's
required<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.960> need<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.340> if<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.489> look<00:00:50.670> at<00:00:50.760> this

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
required you need it if you look at this

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:51.529 
required you need it if you look at this
object

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
object

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.110 
object
look<00:00:52.320> at<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.469> pedal<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.640> can<00:00:53.760> see<00:00:53.850> there's

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
look at this pedal you can see there's

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.520 
look at this pedal you can see there's
no<00:00:54.239> other<00:00:54.420> way<00:00:54.660> it's<00:00:54.960> connected<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
no other way it's connected to the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.529 
no other way it's connected to the
computer<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.969> way<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.420> actually

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
computer so the way that is actually

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.130 
computer so the way that is actually
relaying<00:00:58.520> its<00:00:59.520> information<00:01:00.210> over<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
relaying its information over the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.270 
relaying its information over the
computer<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.399> both<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.239> these<00:01:03.690> at<00:01:03.930> home

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
computer is that both of these at home

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.520 
computer is that both of these at home
or<00:01:05.280> up<00:01:05.430> into<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.729> back<00:01:05.960> one<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.049> them<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.350> gonna

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
or up into the back one of them is gonna

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.649 
or up into the back one of them is gonna
be<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.740> throughput<00:01:08.189> from<00:01:08.280> your<00:01:08.460> guitar<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
be a throughput from your guitar and the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.280 
be a throughput from your guitar and the
other<00:01:09.810> one<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.140> actually<00:01:10.439> sending<00:01:11.900> data<00:01:12.900> to

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
other one is actually sending data to

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.289 
other one is actually sending data to
the<00:01:14.010> computer<00:01:14.220> how's<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.790> doing<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.090> well

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
the computer how's it doing that well

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.590 
the computer how's it doing that well
these<00:01:15.780> two<00:01:15.960> cords<00:01:16.259> are<00:01:16.680> gonna<00:01:16.890> go<00:01:17.040> out<00:01:17.600> into

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
these two cords are gonna go out into

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.359 
these two cords are gonna go out into
your<00:01:18.810> sound<00:01:19.200> card<00:01:19.380> here<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.070> if<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.189> look<00:01:20.220> nice

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
your sound card here so if you look nice

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.260 
your sound card here so if you look nice
on<00:01:20.580> card<00:01:21.140> see<00:01:22.140> they<00:01:22.259> have<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:23.040> patch<00:01:23.250> one<00:01:24.060> and

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
on card see they have the patch one and

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.710 
on card see they have the patch one and
two<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.930> one<00:01:25.220> of<00:01:26.220> these<00:01:26.540> recessions<00:01:27.540> when<00:01:27.630> we

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
two and one of these recessions when we

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.039 
two and one of these recessions when we
turn<00:01:27.990> down<00:01:28.259> all<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.680> way<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:29.159> volume<00:01:30.049> because

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
turn down all the way in volume because

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.280 
turn down all the way in volume because
it's<00:01:31.799> actually<00:01:31.950> just<00:01:32.250> using<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:33.290> electrical

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
it's actually just using the electrical

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.609 
it's actually just using the electrical
signal<00:01:34.680> it's<00:01:35.009> not<00:01:35.130> actually<00:01:35.369> using<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.670> audio

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
signal it's not actually using the audio

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.569 
signal it's not actually using the audio
for<00:01:37.759> processing<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:39.840> functions<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
for processing the functions of the

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.289 
for processing the functions of the
spell<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.470> it's<00:01:43.470> acquired<00:01:44.060> it's<00:01:45.060> not<00:01:45.210> an

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
spell so it's acquired it's not an

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.440 
spell so it's acquired it's not an
option<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.899> have<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.229> have<00:01:46.610> both<00:01:47.610> these<00:01:47.939> cords

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
option you have to have both these cords

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.200 
option you have to have both these cords
going<00:01:49.229> out<00:01:49.820> from<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:51.210> control<00:01:52.140> one<00:01:52.909> rig<00:01:53.909> pedal

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
going out from a control one rig pedal

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.850

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
in either one of these it doesn't matter

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.540 
in either one of these it doesn't matter
as<00:02:12.080> long<00:02:12.650> as<00:02:12.680> you<00:02:13.220> have<00:02:14.349> this<00:02:15.349> channel<00:02:15.769> chosen

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
as long as you have this channel chosen

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.309 
as long as you have this channel chosen
correctly<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.660> you<00:02:17.750> can<00:02:17.870> kind<00:02:18.019> of<00:02:18.050> futz<00:02:18.260> with

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
correctly and you can kind of futz with

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.619 
correctly and you can kind of futz with
that<00:02:18.560> once<00:02:18.769> you<00:02:18.920> have<00:02:19.099> this<00:02:19.370> set<00:02:19.640> up<00:02:19.790> correctly

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
that once you have this set up correctly

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.350 
that once you have this set up correctly
both<00:02:21.110> these<00:02:21.319> chords<00:02:21.800> into<00:02:22.129> the<00:02:22.459> pedal<00:02:22.610> they'll

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
both these chords into the pedal they'll

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.820 
both these chords into the pedal they'll
be<00:02:23.450> easier<00:02:23.780> for<00:02:23.840> you<00:02:24.019> because<00:02:24.200> you'll<00:02:24.440> get<00:02:24.769> a

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
be easier for you because you'll get a

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.710 
be easier for you because you'll get a
sound<00:02:25.069> coming<00:02:25.370> out<00:02:25.519> and<00:02:25.640> you<00:02:25.730> may<00:02:26.390> be<00:02:26.450> able<00:02:26.569> to

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
sound coming out and you may be able to

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.110 
sound coming out and you may be able to
figure<00:02:26.810> out<00:02:26.930> what's<00:02:27.080> going<00:02:27.230> on<00:02:27.349> so<00:02:27.980> again<00:02:28.160> this

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
figure out what's going on so again this

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.830 
figure out what's going on so again this
is<00:02:29.269> the<00:02:29.390> control<00:02:30.019> rig<00:02:30.290> one<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:31.629> that's<00:02:32.629> how

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
is the control rig one and that's how

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.110 
is the control rig one and that's how
you<00:02:32.900> set<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.200> up<00:02:33.410> now<00:02:33.769> if<00:02:34.099> I<00:02:34.220> go<00:02:34.400> over<00:02:34.849> to<00:02:34.879> the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
you set it up now if I go over to the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.710 
you set it up now if I go over to the
computer<00:02:35.510> side<00:02:36.019> let<00:02:36.410> me<00:02:36.470> pause<00:02:36.680> versa<00:02:37.720> okay

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
computer side let me pause versa okay

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.420 
computer side let me pause versa okay
now<00:02:38.959> with<00:02:39.110> that<00:02:39.319> on<00:02:40.660> you<00:02:41.660> need<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:41.900> turn<00:02:42.170> on<00:02:42.430> rig

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
now with that on you need to turn on rig

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:52.539 
now with that on you need to turn on rig
control<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:47.829> then<00:02:48.829> up<00:02:49.099> here<00:02:51.190> whichever<00:02:52.190> one

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
control and then up here whichever one

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.949 
control and then up here whichever one
you<00:02:53.390> are<00:02:53.420> not<00:02:53.569> using<00:02:54.110> it<00:02:54.410> so<00:02:54.440> if<00:02:54.920> I'm<00:02:55.099> my

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
you are not using it so if I'm my

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.059 
you are not using it so if I'm my
guitars<00:02:56.959> being<00:02:57.170> piped<00:02:57.379> through<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.860> left

guitars being piped through the left

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.360 
guitars being piped through the left
channel

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
channel

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.520 
channel
let<00:02:58.730> us<00:02:58.849> choose<00:02:59.120> election<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:01.239> when<00:03:02.239> I<00:03:02.780> go

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
let us choose election and when I go

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.300 
let us choose election and when I go
down<00:03:03.739> here<00:03:03.769> to<00:03:04.489> activate<00:03:06.010> make<00:03:07.010> sure<00:03:07.190> that's

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
down here to activate make sure that's

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.309 
down here to activate make sure that's
on<00:03:07.720> so<00:03:08.720> now<00:03:08.840> when<00:03:09.140> I<00:03:09.170> use<00:03:09.410> my<00:03:09.440> pedal<00:03:11.110> she'd<00:03:12.110> get

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
on so now when I use my pedal she'd get

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.730 
on so now when I use my pedal she'd get
some<00:03:12.620> kind<00:03:12.950> of<00:03:13.040> outskirts

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.910 

there<00:03:17.280> we<00:03:17.370> go<00:03:17.520> we're<00:03:18.290> turning<00:03:19.290> that<00:03:19.410> control

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
there we go we're turning that control

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.450 
there we go we're turning that control
rig<00:03:20.160> on<00:03:21.770> they<00:03:22.770> can<00:03:22.950> see<00:03:24.080> see<00:03:25.080> right<00:03:25.320> here<00:03:25.530> when

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
rig on they can see see right here when

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.420 
rig on they can see see right here when
I<00:03:26.520> push<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.880> pedal<00:03:27.240> pedals<00:03:28.200> working<00:03:28.680> all

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
I push the pedal pedals working all

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.040 
I push the pedal pedals working all
these<00:03:29.610> at<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.880> fact<00:03:30.060> if<00:03:30.330> I<00:03:30.420> program<00:03:30.870> these

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
these at the fact if I program these

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:38.570 
these at the fact if I program these
other<00:03:31.260> pedals<00:03:32.190> down<00:03:32.370> here<00:03:37.310> they<00:03:38.310> had<00:03:38.430> those

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
other pedals down here they had those

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.130 
other pedals down here they had those
programs<00:03:39.000> I<00:03:39.210> get<00:03:39.360> to<00:03:39.420> turn<00:03:39.510> to<00:03:39.660> go<00:03:39.780> down<00:03:39.810> so

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
programs I get to turn to go down so

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.970 
programs I get to turn to go down so
there<00:03:40.260> you<00:03:40.320> go<00:03:41.660> so<00:03:42.660> those<00:03:42.810> two<00:03:42.930> cables<00:03:43.380> on<00:03:43.860> the

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
there you go so those two cables on the

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.800 
there you go so those two cables on the
back<00:03:44.130> really<00:03:44.460> important<00:03:44.880> but<00:03:45.450> then<00:03:45.600> there's<00:03:45.750> a

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
back really important but then there's a

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.720 
back really important but then there's a
couple<00:03:45.990> of<00:03:46.320> settings<00:03:46.800> here<00:03:47.130> again<00:03:47.400> I'll<00:03:47.580> go

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
couple of settings here again I'll go

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.690 
couple of settings here again I'll go
over<00:03:47.850> which<00:03:48.720> is<00:03:48.930> rig<00:03:49.500> control<00:03:49.860> two<00:03:50.010> needs<00:03:50.610> to

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
over which is rig control two needs to

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.680 
over which is rig control two needs to
be<00:03:50.850> on<00:03:51.000> I<00:03:52.160> mean<00:03:53.160> that<00:03:53.280> Rick<00:03:53.430> Patrol<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:54.540> Rick

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
be on I mean that Rick Patrol the Rick

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.460 
be on I mean that Rick Patrol the Rick
control<00:03:54.930> one<00:03:55.140> needs<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.100> be<00:03:56.190> set<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.550> on<00:03:56.580> and

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
control one needs to be set to on and

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.400 
control one needs to be set to on and
then<00:03:58.470> over<00:03:59.040> here<00:03:59.750> whichever<00:04:00.750> channel<00:04:01.110> that

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
then over here whichever channel that

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.120 
then over here whichever channel that
you're<00:04:01.530> not<00:04:01.830> using<00:04:02.310> for<00:04:03.590> the<00:04:04.590> rig<00:04:04.770> control

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
you're not using for the rig control

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.380 
you're not using for the rig control
meaning<00:04:05.430> that<00:04:05.640> you're<00:04:05.850> just<00:04:06.030> typing<00:04:06.150> your

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
meaning that you're just typing your

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.720 
meaning that you're just typing your
guitar<00:04:06.660> through<00:04:06.870> I<00:04:06.900> guess<00:04:07.380> it's<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.650> left<00:04:07.890> so

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
guitar through I guess it's the left so

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.670 
guitar through I guess it's the left so
under<00:04:09.000> channel<00:04:09.240> I've<00:04:09.690> turned<00:04:09.960> on<00:04:10.080> left<00:04:10.350> and

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
under channel I've turned on left and

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.520 
under channel I've turned on left and
then<00:04:11.100> I've<00:04:11.250> activated<00:04:11.670> rig<00:04:12.390> control<00:04:12.750> now<00:04:13.440> if

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
then I've activated rig control now if

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.960 
then I've activated rig control now if
you<00:04:13.620> don't<00:04:13.770> see<00:04:13.950> that<00:04:13.980> it's<00:04:14.400> probably<00:04:14.610> because

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
you don't see that it's probably because

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.410 
you don't see that it's probably because
you<00:04:15.210> haven't<00:04:15.420> turned<00:04:16.430> this<00:04:17.430> on<00:04:17.670> so<00:04:18.180> you<00:04:18.270> can

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
you haven't turned this on so you can

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.860 
you haven't turned this on so you can
see<00:04:18.450> if<00:04:18.750> I<00:04:18.870> switch<00:04:19.170> this<00:04:19.410> to<00:04:19.620> off<00:04:20.390> do<00:04:21.390> you<00:04:21.750> see

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
see if I switch this to off do you see

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.530 
see if I switch this to off do you see
how<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.140> disappears<00:04:22.560> right<00:04:23.040> there<00:04:23.280> and<00:04:23.970> you

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
how that disappears right there and you

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.260 
how that disappears right there and you
can<00:04:24.690> get<00:04:24.870> that<00:04:25.110> to<00:04:25.290> come<00:04:25.320> back<00:04:25.940> right<00:04:26.940> here

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
can get that to come back right here

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.320 
can get that to come back right here
going<00:04:27.480> to<00:04:27.890> on<00:04:28.890> Boop<00:04:29.490> there<00:04:29.850> it<00:04:29.970> is
