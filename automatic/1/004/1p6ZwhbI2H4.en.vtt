00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 very good kids that you are 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.339
 the class that we are going to take in this 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.259
 episode for the next 23 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.570
 episodes of rottweiler sniper because 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.690
 because I need 50 casualties without accessories 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.930
 and no advantages in the tse to get me out 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.500
 two camouflage 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:20.890
 and continue with the challenge both versions 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.430
 the character 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.660
 50 casualties are not too much a pain in the ass 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.970
 because he had not used the 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.400
 Rapid creator is not essential either 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.169
 play with advantage I put them for 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.610
 fill in the gaps and because if you notice 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.710
 act with advantage but neither 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.560
 excessively I do not have agile hands 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.200
 I have hardness and dexterity 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.430
 but agile hands what I do the most 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.810
 of less but as I do not have it 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:49.000
 unlocked by the level that I am then 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.020
 almost that it does not influence me so much hardness and 13 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.970
 the only thing I'm going to miss but 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:56.110
 neither 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:58.880
 essential to play with him 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.490
 with the sniper 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.820
 it helps you if it helps you I'm not going to tell you 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.949
 not 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.479
 but there is no need as the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.280
 presides 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:13.340
 because if not drained fast in a 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.719
 warfare mode 3 that if you play without that if 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.050
 you do not wear that to play you can not 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:19.970
 click here 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.770
 of water save your advantages 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.500
 that does not influence so much where is the 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.370
 champion 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.230
 the men thank you 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.060
 That man called me gave me a couple of franks 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.060
 I hunt and I hope it does not happen again 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.380
 is touching me lately to the lobby 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.150
 what is it that I shit I shit mixed 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.740
 cago 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.390
 I'm not liking the birds that I 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.090
 You're playing because it's my turn 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.690
 much much much it does not suit me a c4 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.340
 at this moment who marker 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.540
 kate market and u2 with the ballista no me 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.820
 They give you a bad hill that you are that does not have 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.410
 logic none yes I think it 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.700
 pay in marking you with the ballista 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.570
 that distance has to choose me brand 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.640
 the end of the conversation 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.270
 is that we go like that is to receive more 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.890
 may the list 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.540
 if I have more bath and I will have to 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.250
 frame potosÃ­ have less valuable 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.040
 you have to go wrong that simple 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.040
 because it kills me they have a cost killed 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.100
 the game is not marking go 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.470
 departure game night marking cow 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:32.440
 my mother I will not kill today I will kill him 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.650
 If you want very well 23 with the sea 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.280
 the map above all 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.280
 filtering 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.580
 there is an enemy that submitted for it 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.970
 I do not want to count on you with me 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.970
 neither 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.530
 we miss the pancakes trying 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.530
 unless they throw me c4 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.620
 when a penalty also missed her 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:03.000
 less 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.920
 I am your collateral 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.880
 not only 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.730
 if there are triple losses the collateral 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.610
 look could carry a double right 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.430
 low 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.200
 in fact a triple 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.500
 so if so collateral hug of 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.500
 profile 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.680
 without more without the Koran 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:34.080
 we are not going to give the game seems 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:36.150
 aa a aa- and when you see so many people 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.220
 question is who shot first at 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.670
 this one that comes here and now something if 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.670
 it is a weapon 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:47.270
 and now s 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:50.330
 to this if I had given 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.190
 one of the things that greatly influences 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.180
 get a clip or not take it out on a 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.180
 who killed first 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.650
 look another double low medal and that 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.470
 the medals of the double low that the 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.060
 very fast do not be like the medals of 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.680
 double low of advanced warfare that 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.530
 you have to get a collateral that mother 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.430
 mine who put those challenges the turn 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.079
 the nougat 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.539
 because the challenges to get everything out 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.259
 camouflage navas keep you from what 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:27.259
 put cloth 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.569
 has won the game is won and at 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:38.939
 final has traced me 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:41.429
 and a little bit more at the beginning of dying and 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:43.639
 die and now I only die and die 

00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:43.639
 we will die 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.589
 Even if I die, I'll play 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.930
 and all the mess 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.280
 but something like a triple 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.280
 for me not 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:08.949
 if it is not going to add now yes 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:16.140
 almost 25 go down almost half 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:20.210
 what we need from the 50 that 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.210
 we need to get us out 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.190
 the two challenges of collage 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.980
 today I believe that the truth or me and the cinema do not 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.750
 That's wrong 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.750
 we are going to move the ones that we carry 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.180
 from the text 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:46.070
 the progress that we take from that we 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:49.510
 will be missing then 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.580
 for 30-31 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.230
 promote the one that we have of double low and 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.970
 to see if we have not done a distant shot and 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:58.170
 the distant ones are not like in the 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:00.260
 advance wars farc that are a leftover 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:04.380
 we go 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:08.220
 is what I like is what it is 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:11.670
 how to see create a progress class 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.510
 far shot zero we call 19 low then 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.139
 They are those who have not done now 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.849
 in this game 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.110
 and the low doubles we already have 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:20.520
 you practically see that we have 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:22.659
 four of five so the bloodthirsty 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.199
 none so only the shots are left 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:28.689
 distant and bloodthirsty in what 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:30.069
 really, it's going to cost us between 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:32.949
 quotes what we're going to have to go over 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:36.009
 looking to get what the rest that is 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:38.020
 here is not everything with playing without 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:39.819
 advantages without accessories and doubles 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.469
 low this falls only what is going to 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:43.389
 cost what we're going to have to go 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:45.310
 looking is going to be the bloodthirsty and is going to 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:46.509
 be the distant throws medals not 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.830
 aspects of playing again and hacker 

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:49.120
 because we have had two games 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.039
 followed two episodes in a row and 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.249
 hackers and I do not like you already know that no 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:55.589
 I like it 

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:57.959
 repeat maps in episodes so 

00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:59.549
 let's find another game new people 

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:01.319
 down the description as you always have 

00:06:59.549 --> 00:07:02.699
 my twitter my tweet the list of 

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:05.369
 reproduction with the whole episode my 

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:07.679
 shirt page my twitter I think 

00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:09.449
 I 've already said that and checked the one 

00:07:07.679 --> 00:07:11.099
 had a lot of things and there will be no more 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:13.619
 in the next episode of rockwell 

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:16.469
 sniper road to go to be rule we have left 

00:07:13.619 --> 00:07:17.069
 little to finish I use it all and 

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:19.609
 until next time 

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:19.609
 bye
