you

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.260 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.400 

the<00:00:14.830> painting<00:00:15.310> is<00:00:15.520> the<00:00:16.330> triumph<00:00:16.960> of<00:00:17.110> valor

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
the painting is the triumph of valor

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.740 
the painting is the triumph of valor
over<00:00:17.770> time<00:00:18.010> by<00:00:18.280> japanese<00:00:18.820> 30th<00:00:19.390> alone<00:00:21.750> our

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
over time by japanese 30th alone our

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.690 
over time by japanese 30th alone our
main<00:00:23.020> reason<00:00:23.500> for<00:00:23.529> treating<00:00:23.860> it<00:00:24.160> was<00:00:24.340> because

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:24.700 
main reason for treating it was because

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.060 
main reason for treating it was because
the<00:00:24.970> stretcher<00:00:25.779> wasn't<00:00:26.200> wasn't<00:00:26.560> working

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
the stretcher wasn't wasn't working

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.570 
the stretcher wasn't wasn't working
properly<00:00:27.310> and<00:00:27.730> we<00:00:28.660> needed<00:00:28.810> to<00:00:29.220> retention<00:00:30.220> it

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
properly and we needed to retention it

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.400 
properly and we needed to retention it
so<00:00:30.760> it<00:00:30.880> looked<00:00:31.090> more<00:00:31.150> like<00:00:31.300> fresco<00:00:31.900> painting

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
so it looked more like fresco painting

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.200 
so it looked more like fresco painting
putting<00:00:33.100> your<00:00:33.250> stretcher<00:00:33.699> on<00:00:33.790> it<00:00:33.970> with<00:00:34.120> the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
putting your stretcher on it with the

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.810 
putting your stretcher on it with the
help<00:00:34.390> of<00:00:34.510> our<00:00:34.690> colleague<00:00:35.140> from<00:00:35.290> Italy<00:00:35.860> then

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
help of our colleague from Italy then

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.570 
help of our colleague from Italy then
the<00:00:37.300> other<00:00:37.480> aspect<00:00:37.989> of<00:00:38.110> it<00:00:38.230> was<00:00:38.410> to<00:00:38.680> cleaning

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
the other aspect of it was to cleaning

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.100 
the other aspect of it was to cleaning
it<00:00:39.699> and<00:00:39.730> clean<00:00:40.120> it<00:00:40.150> just<00:00:40.480> where<00:00:40.660> the<00:00:40.840> swipe

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
it and clean it just where the swipe

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.439 
it and clean it just where the swipe
some<00:00:41.320> distilled<00:00:41.680> water<00:00:41.980> and<00:00:42.460> remove<00:00:42.850> the<00:00:43.180> /

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:43.449 
some distilled water and remove the /

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.479 
some distilled water and remove the /
paint<00:00:43.720> which<00:00:43.930> was<00:00:44.110> also<00:00:44.260> soluble<00:00:44.890> in<00:00:45.190> that

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
paint which was also soluble in that

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.479 
paint which was also soluble in that
because<00:00:45.730> it<00:00:45.879> preserves<00:00:46.000> watercolor<00:00:46.960> phone<00:00:47.489> so

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
because it preserves watercolor phone so

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.430 
because it preserves watercolor phone so
we<00:00:48.519> clean<00:00:48.879> service<00:00:49.570> and<00:00:49.780> cleaned<00:00:50.019> off<00:00:50.199> the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
we clean service and cleaned off the

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.920 
we clean service and cleaned off the
discolored<00:00:51.040> or<00:00:51.129> free<00:00:51.370> touchings<00:00:51.850> now<00:00:52.600> we're

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
discolored or free touchings now we're

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.729 
discolored or free touchings now we're
in<00:00:53.050> the<00:00:53.080> process<00:00:53.320> of<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:55.030> painting<00:00:55.690> which<00:00:55.960> or

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
in the process of in painting which or

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.520 
in the process of in painting which or
retouching<00:00:57.370> so<00:00:57.629> what<00:00:58.629> we're<00:00:58.809> doing<00:00:58.839> is<00:00:59.320> we're

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
retouching so what we're doing is we're

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.860 
retouching so what we're doing is we're
in<00:00:59.739> painting<00:01:00.220> this<00:01:00.339> area<00:01:00.760> awesome<00:01:01.449> you<00:01:01.720> can

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
in painting this area awesome you can

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.910 
in painting this area awesome you can
see<00:01:02.110> that<00:01:02.830> it's<00:01:03.190> relatively<00:01:04.470> relatively<00:01:05.470> even

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
see that it's relatively relatively even

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.190 
see that it's relatively relatively even
now<00:01:06.130> here<00:01:06.610> you<00:01:07.150> can<00:01:07.240> see<00:01:07.299> on<00:01:07.600> the<00:01:07.720> photograph

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
now here you can see on the photograph

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.380 
now here you can see on the photograph
before<00:01:08.680> there<00:01:09.070> were<00:01:09.159> a<00:01:09.190> bunch<00:01:09.850> of<00:01:10.000> losses

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
before there were a bunch of losses

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.030 
before there were a bunch of losses
around<00:01:10.659> here<00:01:10.990> and<00:01:11.140> when<00:01:11.440> you<00:01:11.560> look<00:01:11.740> closely

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
around here and when you look closely

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.590 
around here and when you look closely
it's<00:01:13.000> it's<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:15.490> know<00:01:15.640> resolve<00:01:16.030> but<00:01:16.420> ferd

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
it's it's you know resolve but ferd

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.090 
it's it's you know resolve but ferd
really<00:01:19.600> close<00:01:19.810> examination<00:01:20.020> you'll<00:01:20.710> see<00:01:20.920> that

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
really close examination you'll see that

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.230 
really close examination you'll see that
that's<00:01:21.550> there's<00:01:21.940> actually<00:01:22.180> a

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
that's there's actually a

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.150 
that's there's actually a
differentiation<00:01:22.900> in<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.290> brushstrokes<00:01:23.830> and

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
differentiation in the brushstrokes and

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.640 
differentiation in the brushstrokes and
and<00:01:24.730> in<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:24.940> surface<00:01:25.180> structure<00:01:25.810> so<00:01:26.410> you<00:01:26.470> can

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
and in the surface structure so you can

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.680 
and in the surface structure so you can
actually<00:01:26.770> tell<00:01:27.130> that<00:01:27.340> it's<00:01:27.490> a<00:01:27.610> restored<00:01:28.360> area

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
actually tell that it's a restored area

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.530 
actually tell that it's a restored area
rather<00:01:28.930> than<00:01:29.080> or<00:01:29.350> rather<00:01:29.980> than<00:01:30.280> a<00:01:30.490> an<00:01:30.910> original

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
rather than or rather than a an original

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.930 
rather than or rather than a an original
area<00:01:31.870> you<00:01:32.860> know<00:01:32.950> some<00:01:33.220> restorers<00:01:33.700> use

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
area you know some restorers use

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:40.530 
area you know some restorers use
traditional<00:01:35.220> traditional<00:01:36.220> paints<00:01:38.400> but<00:01:39.540> they

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
traditional traditional paints but they

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.560 
traditional traditional paints but they
might<00:01:40.720> work<00:01:40.930> with<00:01:41.850> oils<00:01:42.850> where<00:01:43.180> they<00:01:43.300> drain

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
might work with oils where they drain

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.650 
might work with oils where they drain
out<00:01:43.750> some<00:01:44.020> of<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.200> medium<00:01:45.120> beginner<00:01:46.120> grinding

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
out some of the medium beginner grinding

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.810 
out some of the medium beginner grinding
your<00:01:46.780> own<00:01:46.960> pigments<00:01:47.710> on<00:01:47.860> a<00:01:47.890> project<00:01:48.640> of<00:01:48.760> this

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
your own pigments on a project of this

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.870 
your own pigments on a project of this
scale<00:01:49.180> is<00:01:49.240> a<00:01:49.480> pretty<00:01:49.750> arduous

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
scale is a pretty arduous

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.380 
scale is a pretty arduous
prospers<00:01:52.880> oh<00:01:54.520> so<00:01:55.520> you<00:01:55.579> start<00:01:56.090> with<00:01:56.240> these

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
prospers oh so you start with these

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.880 
prospers oh so you start with these
little<00:01:56.570> small<00:01:56.990> damages<00:01:57.979> and<00:01:59.469> turn<00:02:00.469> them<00:02:00.679> back

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
little small damages and turn them back

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.279 
little small damages and turn them back
water<00:02:01.670> color<00:02:01.909> changes<00:02:02.299> color<00:02:02.539> as<00:02:02.689> it<00:02:02.810> dries<00:02:03.049> so

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
water color changes color as it dries so

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.380 
water color changes color as it dries so
you<00:02:03.409> have<00:02:03.560> to<00:02:03.710> sort<00:02:03.890> of<00:02:04.009> normally<00:02:04.909> try<00:02:05.149> it<00:02:05.210> out

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
you have to sort of normally try it out

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.959 
you have to sort of normally try it out
a<00:02:05.420> couple<00:02:05.659> of<00:02:05.869> times<00:02:06.109> to<00:02:06.350> get<00:02:06.469> it<00:02:06.530> right<00:02:06.969> and

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
a couple of times to get it right and

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:09.669 
a couple of times to get it right and
then<00:02:08.119> you<00:02:08.209> paint<00:02:08.390> basically<00:02:09.229> we're<00:02:09.349> painting

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
then you paint basically we're painting

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.350 
then you paint basically we're painting
with<00:02:09.830> tiny<00:02:10.099> tiny<00:02:10.459> brush<00:02:10.789> strokes<00:02:13.120> so<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.269> you

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
with tiny tiny brush strokes so that you

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.880 
with tiny tiny brush strokes so that you
get<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.540> sort<00:02:14.780> of<00:02:14.810> differentiation<00:02:15.500> between

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
get a sort of differentiation between

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.240 
get a sort of differentiation between
the<00:02:16.160> original<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:17.690> restoration<00:02:18.250> and

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
the original and the restoration and

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.729 
the original and the restoration and
we're<00:02:19.400> also<00:02:19.489> trying<00:02:19.849> to<00:02:20.000> just<00:02:20.660> pain<00:02:21.049> on<00:02:21.349> the

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
we're also trying to just pain on the

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.809 
we're also trying to just pain on the
damage<00:02:22.190> not<00:02:22.430> pain<00:02:22.700> at<00:02:22.910> all<00:02:23.090> on<00:02:23.299> the<00:02:23.450> original

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
damage not pain at all on the original

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.110 
damage not pain at all on the original
you<00:02:25.819> know<00:02:25.940> it's<00:02:26.150> using<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:26.870> lot<00:02:26.989> of<00:02:27.019> ochres<00:02:27.650> and

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
you know it's using a lot of ochres and

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.509 
you know it's using a lot of ochres and
Siena's<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:29.540> numbers<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:30.739> things<00:02:31.190> on<00:02:31.400> this

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
Siena's and numbers and things on this

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.970 
Siena's and numbers and things on this
painting<00:02:32.060> so<00:02:32.299> it's<00:02:33.290> kind<00:02:33.500> of<00:02:33.530> nice<00:02:33.739> because

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
painting so it's kind of nice because

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.470 
painting so it's kind of nice because
it's<00:02:34.220> a<00:02:34.310> relatively<00:02:34.670> straightforward

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
it's a relatively straightforward

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.390 
it's a relatively straightforward
palette<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:37.430> work<00:02:37.610> with<00:02:37.910> and

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.220 

and<00:02:41.849> it's<00:02:42.180> kind<00:02:42.239> of<00:02:42.420> forgiving<00:02:42.900> as<00:02:43.019> well

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
and it's kind of forgiving as well

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.809 
and it's kind of forgiving as well
because<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.799> service<00:02:44.040> of<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.370> painter

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
because the service of the painter

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.429 
because the service of the painter
because<00:02:44.909> it's<00:02:45.180> sort<00:02:45.360> of<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:46.140> know<00:02:46.230> it's<00:02:46.379> a

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:46.439 
because it's sort of a you know it's a

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:48.170 
because it's sort of a you know it's a
plaster<00:02:46.890> surface<00:02:47.340> it's<00:02:47.549> quite<00:02:47.790> it's<00:02:48.090> quite

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
plaster surface it's quite it's quite

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.770 
plaster surface it's quite it's quite
forgiving<00:02:48.840> it's<00:02:48.989> like<00:02:50.420> there's<00:02:51.420> quite<00:02:51.629> a<00:02:51.659> lot

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
forgiving it's like there's quite a lot

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.289 
forgiving it's like there's quite a lot
of<00:02:51.890> variation<00:02:52.890> across<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:53.310> surface<00:02:53.579> so<00:02:54.060> that

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
of variation across the surface so that

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.210 
of variation across the surface so that
also<00:02:54.989> helps<00:02:55.409> you<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.620> work<00:02:55.799> relatively

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
also helps you to work relatively

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.809 
also helps you to work relatively
quickly<00:02:56.640> so<00:02:57.180> I'm<00:02:57.299> optimistic<00:02:58.640> round<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.790> back

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
quickly so I'm optimistic round the back

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.460 
quickly so I'm optimistic round the back
here<00:03:00.209> you<00:03:00.299> see<00:03:00.450> this<00:03:00.599> sort<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:00.840> gray<00:03:01.140> lines

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
here you see this sort of gray lines

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.110 
here you see this sort of gray lines
here<00:03:01.859> that's<00:03:02.099> where<00:03:02.400> that's<00:03:02.640> a<00:03:02.730> really

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
here that's where that's a really

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.750 
here that's where that's a really
indentation<00:03:03.840> where<00:03:04.079> the<00:03:04.799> contours<00:03:05.549> of<00:03:05.700> the

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
indentation where the contours of the

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.160 
indentation where the contours of the
figure<00:03:06.120> was<00:03:06.269> drawn<00:03:06.510> in<00:03:06.659> and<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:06.870> can<00:03:06.989> see<00:03:07.140> I

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
figure was drawn in and you can see I

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.259 
figure was drawn in and you can see I
know<00:03:07.319> this<00:03:07.500> is<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.709> nice<00:03:08.099> change<00:03:08.579> here<00:03:09.030> where

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
know this is a nice change here where

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.800 
know this is a nice change here where
his<00:03:09.390> leg<00:03:09.629> was<00:03:09.840> actually<00:03:10.230> this<00:03:10.379> leg<00:03:10.650> was<00:03:10.980> once

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
his leg was actually this leg was once

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.839 
his leg was actually this leg was once
conceived<00:03:12.810> further<00:03:13.200> back<00:03:13.379> but<00:03:14.370> he<00:03:14.459> decided

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
conceived further back but he decided

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.759 
conceived further back but he decided
that<00:03:15.060> he<00:03:15.269> would<00:03:15.389> paint<00:03:15.629> it<00:03:15.870> pulled<00:03:16.470> up<00:03:16.620> a

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
that he would paint it pulled up a

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.440 
that he would paint it pulled up a
little<00:03:16.980> bit<00:03:17.099> further<00:03:17.250> forward<00:03:17.609> and<00:03:17.849> in<00:03:17.940> fact<00:03:18.180> I

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
little bit further forward and in fact I

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.000 
little bit further forward and in fact I
think<00:03:18.930> he's<00:03:19.170> actually<00:03:19.319> done<00:03:19.620> that<00:03:19.680> in<00:03:19.950> the

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
think he's actually done that in the

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.140 
think he's actually done that in the
drawing<00:03:20.310> stage<00:03:20.579> because<00:03:20.819> you've<00:03:20.970> got<00:03:21.090> a

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
drawing stage because you've got a

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.849 
drawing stage because you've got a
contour<00:03:21.629> here<00:03:21.659> but<00:03:22.379> then<00:03:22.530> you've<00:03:22.650> got<00:03:22.769> this

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
contour here but then you've got this

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.839 
contour here but then you've got this
other<00:03:23.090> correction<00:03:24.090> here<00:03:25.250> and<00:03:26.250> that's<00:03:26.549> another

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
other correction here and that's another

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.030 
other correction here and that's another
thing<00:03:27.120> that<00:03:27.299> type<00:03:27.510> of<00:03:27.540> change<00:03:27.989> kind<00:03:28.620> of<00:03:28.709> speaks

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
thing that type of change kind of speaks

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.149 
thing that type of change kind of speaks
to<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.720> jump<00:03:31.170> at<00:03:31.290> ease<00:03:31.439> that<00:03:31.739> because<00:03:31.980> it's

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
to the to jump at ease that because it's

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.550 
to the to jump at ease that because it's
really<00:03:32.310> an<00:03:32.519> artist<00:03:32.909> really<00:03:33.470> thinking<00:03:34.470> about

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
really an artist really thinking about

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.190 
really an artist really thinking about
improving<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.489> design<00:03:35.849> and<00:03:36.180> often<00:03:36.930> if<00:03:37.049> it's

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
improving a design and often if it's

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.750 
improving a design and often if it's
somebody<00:03:37.439> just<00:03:37.769> working<00:03:38.250> from<00:03:38.280> somebody

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
somebody just working from somebody

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.429 
somebody just working from somebody
else's<00:03:39.060> designed<00:03:39.450> they'll<00:03:39.720> they'll<00:03:40.049> do<00:03:40.409> that

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:40.439 
else's designed they'll they'll do that

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:43.009 
else's designed they'll they'll do that
pretty<00:03:40.739> slavishly<00:03:41.599> another<00:03:42.599> thing<00:03:42.840> you<00:03:42.930> can

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
pretty slavishly another thing you can

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.720 
pretty slavishly another thing you can
see<00:03:43.230> here<00:03:43.470> is<00:03:43.620> this<00:03:43.799> is<00:03:43.950> probably<00:03:44.220> one<00:03:44.549> of<00:03:44.579> the

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
see here is this is probably one of the

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.800 
see here is this is probably one of the
jihad<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.810> which<00:03:46.199> is<00:03:46.379> which<00:03:46.590> of<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:47.510> gelato<00:03:48.510> is

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
jihad to which is which of the gelato is

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.240 
jihad to which is which of the gelato is
what<00:03:48.989> an<00:03:49.109> artist<00:03:49.290> have<00:03:49.620> painted<00:03:49.949> a<00:03:50.040> day

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
what an artist have painted a day

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.710 
what an artist have painted a day
because<00:03:50.519> obviously<00:03:50.669> the<00:03:50.910> fresco<00:03:51.329> has<00:03:51.449> to<00:03:51.629> be

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
because obviously the fresco has to be

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.189 
because obviously the fresco has to be
painted<00:03:52.109> in<00:03:52.199> wet<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:52.970> so<00:03:53.970> they<00:03:54.120> plaster<00:03:54.840> up<00:03:54.989> an

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
painted in wet and so they plaster up an

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:58.759 
painted in wet and so they plaster up an
area<00:03:55.410> for<00:03:55.859> one<00:03:56.310> day<00:03:56.579> and<00:03:56.879> then<00:03:57.599> paint<00:03:58.199> into<00:03:58.650> it

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
area for one day and then paint into it

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.180 
area for one day and then paint into it
and<00:03:59.690> then<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:01.169> next<00:04:01.319> day<00:04:01.530> they'll<00:04:01.799> plaster

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
and then the next day they'll plaster

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.920 
and then the next day they'll plaster
off<00:04:02.310> a<00:04:02.340> subsequent<00:04:02.940> area<00:04:03.269> I'm<00:04:03.419> painting<00:04:03.659> to

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
off a subsequent area I'm painting to

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.569 
off a subsequent area I'm painting to
that<00:04:04.109> and<00:04:04.650> what<00:04:04.799> you<00:04:04.829> can<00:04:05.010> see<00:04:05.040> is<00:04:05.280> you<00:04:05.400> see<00:04:05.430> a

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
that and what you can see is you see a

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.129 
that and what you can see is you see a
difference<00:04:05.760> in<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.180> surface<00:04:06.419> structure<00:04:07.049> and

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
difference in the surface structure and

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.020 
difference in the surface structure and
a<00:04:07.199> slight<00:04:07.440> rich<00:04:07.769> going<00:04:08.220> around<00:04:08.459> here<00:04:08.819> and

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
a slight rich going around here and

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.890 
a slight rich going around here and
that's<00:04:09.599> the<00:04:09.840> edges<00:04:10.260> of<00:04:10.290> one<00:04:10.590> of<00:04:10.739> those<00:04:10.889> day

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
that's the edges of one of those day

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.580 
that's the edges of one of those day
areas<00:04:12.900> that<00:04:13.229> would<00:04:13.349> have<00:04:13.440> been<00:04:13.530> painted<00:04:15.590> but

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
areas that would have been painted but

damages<00:04:49.479> that<00:04:49.509> leap<00:04:49.960> out<00:04:50.169> of<00:04:50.199> them<00:04:50.590> where

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
damages that leap out of them where

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.070 
damages that leap out of them where
they're<00:04:51.610> not<00:04:51.729> really<00:04:51.909> disturbing<00:04:52.569> but<00:04:52.930> what

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
they're not really disturbing but what

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.779 
they're not really disturbing but what
you<00:04:53.199> get<00:04:53.409> is<00:04:53.560> when<00:04:53.710> you<00:04:53.830> do<00:04:53.979> the<00:04:54.099> strap<00:04:54.430> or<00:04:54.639> when

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
you get is when you do the strap or when

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:56.760 
you get is when you do the strap or when
you<00:04:55.000> take<00:04:55.210> off<00:04:55.389> the<00:04:55.599> very<00:04:55.870> sort<00:04:56.439> of<00:04:56.469> top

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
you take off the very sort of top

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.369 
you take off the very sort of top
millimeter<00:04:57.550> or<00:04:57.759> so<00:04:57.789> of<00:04:58.090> the<00:04:58.240> painting<00:04:58.719> and<00:04:59.199> it

00:04:59.369 --> 00:04:59.379 
millimeter or so of the painting and it

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:01.559 
millimeter or so of the painting and it
leaves<00:04:59.590> the<00:04:59.860> synovia<00:05:00.490> and<00:05:00.819> leads<00:05:01.389> the

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:01.569 
leaves the synovia and leads the

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:04.020 
leaves the synovia and leads the
indentations<00:05:02.409> whether<00:05:02.740> where<00:05:03.189> the<00:05:03.400> drastic

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
indentations whether where the drastic

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.029 
indentations whether where the drastic
ship<00:05:04.240> has<00:05:04.389> inscribed<00:05:04.659> into<00:05:05.110> the<00:05:05.289> webmaster

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
ship has inscribed into the webmaster

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.580 
ship has inscribed into the webmaster
and<00:05:06.460> so<00:05:06.729> we<00:05:06.819> kind<00:05:07.060> of<00:05:07.120> left<00:05:07.300> a<00:05:07.479> lot<00:05:07.659> for<00:05:08.379> a

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
and so we kind of left a lot for a

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.740 
and so we kind of left a lot for a
restorative<00:05:09.490> to<00:05:09.969> go<00:05:10.750> on<00:05:10.990> and<00:05:12.360> you<00:05:13.360> know<00:05:13.479> clean

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
restorative to go on and you know clean

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.320 
restorative to go on and you know clean
color<00:05:14.279> drawing<00:05:15.279> and

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
color drawing and

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.779 
color drawing and
forms<00:05:17.229> and<00:05:17.500> so<00:05:19.409> it<00:05:20.409> was<00:05:20.710> actually<00:05:20.919> restored<00:05:21.520> by

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
forms and so it was actually restored by

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:25.619 
forms and so it was actually restored by
restoring<00:05:22.720> in<00:05:23.199> the<00:05:23.949> early<00:05:24.460> 1950s<00:05:25.000> I<00:05:25.330> believe

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:25.629 
restoring in the early 1950s I believe

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:28.559 
restoring in the early 1950s I believe
who<00:05:26.229> had<00:05:26.500> also<00:05:26.830> worked<00:05:27.009> on<00:05:27.280> laid<00:05:28.060> out<00:05:28.240> last
