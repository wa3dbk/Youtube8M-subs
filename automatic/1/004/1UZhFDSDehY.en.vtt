and coarse you will need to hold the
iron<00:01:58.729> in<00:01:58.909> the<00:01:59.299> hair<00:01:59.510> for<00:01:59.720> longer<00:02:00.110> to<00:02:00.260> get<00:02:00.380> the

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
iron in the hair for longer to get the

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.289 
iron in the hair for longer to get the
heat<00:02:00.619> to<00:02:00.740> penetrate<00:02:00.890> through<00:02:01.400> and<00:02:01.820> if<00:02:02.180> you're

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
heat to penetrate through and if you're

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:03.789 
heat to penetrate through and if you're
here<00:02:02.420> is<00:02:02.479> fine<00:02:02.720> or<00:02:02.930> sensitized<00:02:03.470> or<00:02:03.619> fragile

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
here is fine or sensitized or fragile

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.800 
here is fine or sensitized or fragile
you'll<00:02:04.549> leave<00:02:04.790> it<00:02:04.909> in<00:02:05.030> their<00:02:05.180> hair<00:02:05.390> for<00:02:05.630> a<00:02:05.659> lot

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
you'll leave it in their hair for a lot

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.149 
you'll leave it in their hair for a lot
less<00:02:05.960> time<00:02:06.229> because<00:02:06.530> you'll<00:02:06.650> get<00:02:06.740> a<00:02:06.799> crisper

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
less time because you'll get a crisper

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.539 
less time because you'll get a crisper
resolved<00:02:07.549> and<00:02:07.670> then<00:02:08.179> you<00:02:08.269> simply<00:02:08.920> relax<00:02:09.920> that

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
resolved and then you simply relax that

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.699 
resolved and then you simply relax that
and<00:02:10.820> let<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.180> hair<00:02:11.360> come<00:02:11.570> off<00:02:11.780> what<00:02:12.620> you're

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
and let the hair come off what you're

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.190 
and let the hair come off what you're
going<00:02:12.830> to<00:02:12.890> end<00:02:13.040> up<00:02:13.190> with<00:02:13.459> is<00:02:13.670> an<00:02:14.200> s-shaped

hand you're going to come up and over
your<00:02:39.260> head<00:02:39.590> so<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.160> barrel<00:02:40.459> of<00:02:40.519> the<00:02:40.670> ions

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
your head so the barrel of the ions

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.400 
your head so the barrel of the ions
pointing<00:02:41.329> straight<00:02:41.480> down<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:42.079> thing<00:02:42.260> about

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
pointing straight down the thing about

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.250 
pointing straight down the thing about
this<00:02:42.560> is<00:02:42.620> if<00:02:42.920> you<00:02:43.160> if<00:02:43.400> your<00:02:44.150> hands<00:02:44.840> over<00:02:44.989> here

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
this is if you if your hands over here

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.590 
this is if you if your hands over here
like<00:02:45.410> this<00:02:45.560> it's<00:02:45.769> very<00:02:46.130> hard<00:02:46.489> to<00:02:46.850> get<00:02:47.329> the<00:02:47.480> iron

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
like this it's very hard to get the iron

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.210 
like this it's very hard to get the iron
to<00:02:47.810> burn<00:02:47.989> your<00:02:48.170> face<00:02:48.320> unless<00:02:48.620> you're<00:02:49.010> super

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
to burn your face unless you're super

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.400 
to burn your face unless you're super
flexible<00:02:49.549> so<00:02:50.360> it's<00:02:50.480> just<00:02:50.630> a<00:02:50.750> sort<00:02:50.930> of<00:02:50.959> a<00:02:51.049> safety

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
flexible so it's just a sort of a safety

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.930 
flexible so it's just a sort of a safety
thing<00:02:51.440> and<00:02:51.829> it<00:02:52.010> makes<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.760> whole

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
thing and it makes the whole

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.490 
thing and it makes the whole
coordination<00:02:53.600> of<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.780> technique<00:02:54.170> that<00:02:54.350> much

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
coordination of the technique that much

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.520 
coordination of the technique that much
easier<00:02:54.709> now<00:02:55.519> here's<00:02:55.700> a<00:02:55.760> hot<00:02:55.850> tip<00:02:56.200> this<00:02:57.200> first

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
easier now here's a hot tip this first

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.770 
easier now here's a hot tip this first
part<00:02:57.890> of<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.910> curl<00:02:59.150> where<00:02:59.390> it<00:02:59.480> wraps<00:02:59.660> around

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
part of the curl where it wraps around

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.150 
part of the curl where it wraps around
the<00:02:59.989> iron<00:03:00.230> for<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.440> very<00:03:00.620> first<00:03:00.799> time<00:03:00.980> you

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
the iron for the very first time you

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.330 
the iron for the very first time you
want<00:03:01.459> to<00:03:01.519> keep<00:03:01.639> that<00:03:01.910> as<00:03:02.090> narrow<00:03:02.600> as<00:03:02.750> possible

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
want to keep that as narrow as possible

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.510 
want to keep that as narrow as possible
that

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
that

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.820 
that
helps<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:04.940> shape<00:03:05.480> to<00:03:05.870> sit<00:03:06.080> in<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.440> more<00:03:06.650> earth

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
helps the shape to sit in a more earth

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.550 
helps the shape to sit in a more earth
shaped<00:03:07.550> wave<00:03:07.880> rather<00:03:08.570> than<00:03:08.780> bunching<00:03:09.230> up<00:03:09.350> from

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
shaped wave rather than bunching up from

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.930 
shaped wave rather than bunching up from
the<00:03:09.680> head<00:03:09.860> and<00:03:10.010> becoming<00:03:10.280> a<00:03:10.430> ringlet<00:03:10.790> and

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
the head and becoming a ringlet and

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.430 
the head and becoming a ringlet and
giving<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:11.210> a<00:03:11.240> lot<00:03:11.450> of<00:03:11.540> volume<00:03:11.720> or<00:03:11.990> a<00:03:12.050> bump<00:03:12.290> in

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
giving you a lot of volume or a bump in

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.990 
giving you a lot of volume or a bump in
the<00:03:12.470> hair<00:03:12.710> so<00:03:13.010> I'm<00:03:13.100> going<00:03:13.280> to<00:03:13.340> go<00:03:13.460> around<00:03:13.580> and

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
the hair so I'm going to go around and

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.630 
the hair so I'm going to go around and
do<00:03:14.210> about<00:03:14.480> 10<00:03:15.290> or<00:03:15.440> 12<00:03:15.470> sections<00:03:16.190> around<00:03:16.340> the

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
do about 10 or 12 sections around the

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.040 
do about 10 or 12 sections around the
head<00:03:16.820> and<00:03:16.850> when<00:03:17.420> I<00:03:17.450> get<00:03:17.660> round<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:17.990> other

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
head and when I get round to the other

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.660 
head and when I get round to the other
side<00:03:18.470> i'm<00:03:18.620> going<00:03:18.680> to<00:03:18.830> show<00:03:19.040> you<00:03:19.070> how<00:03:19.220> easy<00:03:19.340> it

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
side i'm going to show you how easy it

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.010 
side i'm going to show you how easy it
is<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:19.820> do<00:03:20.060> yourself<00:03:20.450> because<00:03:20.750> i'm<00:03:20.840> going<00:03:20.960> to

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
is to do yourself because i'm going to

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.930 
is to do yourself because i'm going to
get<00:03:21.110> Sean<00:03:21.350> to<00:03:21.380> do<00:03:21.590> it<00:03:21.740> itself<00:03:22.010> so<00:03:22.670> how<00:03:22.880> many

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
get Sean to do it itself so how many

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.330 
get Sean to do it itself so how many
times<00:03:23.360> have<00:03:23.540> you<00:03:23.570> ever<00:03:23.900> said<00:03:24.290> look<00:03:24.980> that's<00:03:25.190> all

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
times have you ever said look that's all

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.160 
times have you ever said look that's all
good<00:03:25.490> and<00:03:25.520> well<00:03:25.640> for<00:03:25.940> you<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.150> do<00:03:26.300> but<00:03:26.720> I<00:03:26.870> can

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
good and well for you to do but I can
