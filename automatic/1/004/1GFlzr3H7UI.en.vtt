00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:07.589
 hello my dear decoupage prostrate and 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.330
 here I made my prince and what i am 2 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.769
 more I look at him so he more to me 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.049
 don't like something i feel intuitively 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.940
 composition did wrong 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:21.560
 It's good that I saved the files in a format 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.779
 soar no here we have all the layers 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:29.390
 are present separately well and try 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:37.230
 check our file by the golden section 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:38.910
 open here it is our file and find 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.920
 golden ratio 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:47.640
 here it is and impose as a layer 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:52.949
 add layer move selected 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:58.100
 the area he has allocated with us of course his 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.100
 impose on our print 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:06.119
 we will cut off on allocation because it to us 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:08.689
 white field do not need to prune here 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.540
 let's see it seems to me that something 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:16.530
 need to raise our jug ​​and put it 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.710
 to the point of the golden section and here probably 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.020
 also we something later 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:27.810
 move well and look at the layers 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.869
 jug here it is a rectangular selection 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.869
 areas 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:38.240
 You can choose to take a little more to have 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.070
 guaranteed to cut nothing 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.460
 moving 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:47.430
 so and move our our seen rather on 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.409
 a joke of tires here I want a golden point 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.729
 put these two sections 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:58.630
 grapes so to speak seems to me 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:03.430
 such or no neck grape tests 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:07.270
 and I want to move a little too 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:12.090
 this dosochu cheese here we have this layer 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:15.910
 see here here's a little hole got up 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:21.670
 selection of a rectangular area too with 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:25.000
 in stock select moving highlighted 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:32.950
 to the authorities and move it 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:36.390
 it will be too much here that's probably the 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.390
 I will put a grape 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:46.890
 he is still promoted can do it 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:50.349
 press shift key more and 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.690
 we increase a little bit because he 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:57.480
 us in the foreground may be in terms of 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:02.680
 more but like this 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.819
 Likely and we will save a file in a format 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.690
 jeeppeg 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:13.590
 we already have this file i will add 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:18.609
 one choose the format jpeg and 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.739
 save but no we need to remove first 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:24.910
 the golden ratio why is it below twin 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:27.760
 here I have this layer on which 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:32.850
 I have the golden section of it 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.850
 cleaning up now you can save 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.090
 choose jpeg format 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:46.019
 we already have such a file so 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.019
 add one at the end and save 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.980
 combine 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.200
 Well, just in case, keep it in 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.780
 format 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:04:00.190
 our top no ie pdn 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:06.819
 Save and because suddenly something else I 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:10.610
 get together and do so shut down 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:19.930
 legs we have this file here we have it 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:23.560
 one now we put side by side 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:26.150
 open it with another program 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:38.540
 let's say microsoft office picture 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:41.110
 manager in size and this is our file 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.110
 changed 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:50.870
 so well, let's see here we see of course we 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.250
 see the difference so this we are now 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.810
 smaller do the same of course 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.600
 new drawing we look much 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.720
 more interesting we have here appeared clearly 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.160
 pronounced slow diagonal 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.669
 which is our static drawing 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.850
 lends some such slow motion 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:14.200
 the leaves there are slightly swaying such 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:16.090
 hot afternoon calm and 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:20.000
 pacification 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:22.940
 we are not in a hurry 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.220
 al, we certainly did not work I I 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:29.750
 clearly visible but here it is right clearly 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:31.310
 viewing look around yes and here we see 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.010
 how it is generally important to check 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.020
 created by us collages using 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:40.150
 the golden section is all done very 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:43.150
 just don't forget about it 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.150
 success
