00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
ankle and it was extremely painful and i

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.610 
ankle and it was extremely painful and i
was<00:03:05.430> on<00:03:05.549> crutches<00:03:05.760> for<00:03:06.000> around<00:03:06.540> three<00:03:07.440> days

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
was on crutches for around three days

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.990 
was on crutches for around three days
had<00:03:07.859> to<00:03:07.920> go<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.190> doctor<00:03:08.519> and<00:03:08.640> everything

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
had to go to the doctor and everything

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.059 
had to go to the doctor and everything
so<00:03:09.239> that<00:03:09.269> scout<00:03:09.870> is<00:03:10.049> when<00:03:10.200> you<00:03:10.290> have<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.709> buildup

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
so that scout is when you have a buildup

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.009 
so that scout is when you have a buildup
of<00:03:11.190> uric<00:03:11.489> acid<00:03:11.940> so<00:03:12.359> i'm<00:03:12.420> not<00:03:12.450> sure<00:03:12.600> if<00:03:12.840> that<00:03:12.870> was

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
of uric acid so i'm not sure if that was

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.390 
of uric acid so i'm not sure if that was
related<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.470> Bob<00:03:13.650> walk<00:03:13.890> but<00:03:14.069> I<00:03:14.130> wouldn't<00:03:14.370> be

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
related to Bob walk but I wouldn't be

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.020 
related to Bob walk but I wouldn't be
surprised<00:03:14.819> so<00:03:15.569> that's<00:03:16.319> kind<00:03:16.500> of<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.790> that<00:03:17.790> the

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
surprised so that's kind of a that the

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.490 
surprised so that's kind of a that the
what<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:18.750> ended<00:03:18.959> up<00:03:19.049> having<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.319> deal<00:03:19.470> with

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.020 
what I ended up having to deal with
afterwards<00:03:20.040> but<00:03:20.190> it<00:03:20.340> was<00:03:20.430> still<00:03:20.579> worth<00:03:20.730> it<00:03:20.910> and

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
afterwards but it was still worth it and

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.220 
afterwards but it was still worth it and
