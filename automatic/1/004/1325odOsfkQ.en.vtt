actually chose Super Saiyan God the red
form<00:01:05.420> because<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.600> had<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:06.990> entirely<00:01:07.500> really

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
form because I had it entirely really

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.160 
form because I had it entirely really
seen<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.729> new<00:01:08.880> form<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.450> didn't<00:01:09.750> think<00:01:09.840> must<00:01:10.049> be

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
seen the new form I didn't think must be

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.039 
seen the new form I didn't think must be
that<00:01:10.290> good<00:01:10.530> but<00:01:11.490> now<00:01:11.700> what<00:01:12.150> I've<00:01:12.299> seen<00:01:12.659> I

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
that good but now what I've seen I

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.410 
that good but now what I've seen I
actually<00:01:13.799> really<00:01:14.460> really<00:01:14.610> like<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.119> way<00:01:15.150> it

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
actually really really like the way it

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.679 
actually really really like the way it
looks<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.750> Goku<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.909> still<00:01:17.909> kind<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.210> wish<00:01:18.390> that

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
looks on Goku I still kind of wish that

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.560 
looks on Goku I still kind of wish that
his<00:01:18.930> hair<00:01:19.170> would<00:01:19.320> gone<00:01:19.500> up<00:01:19.680> with<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> red<00:01:20.570> but

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
his hair would gone up with the red but

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.719 
his hair would gone up with the red but
I<00:01:21.810> thought<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.650> blue<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.159> shading<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.580> blue

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
I thought the blue the shading of blue

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.039 
I thought the blue the shading of blue
is<00:01:23.820> gonna<00:01:23.970> be<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> little<00:01:24.240> bit<00:01:24.360> darker<00:01:24.720> but<00:01:24.900> I

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
is gonna be a little bit darker but I

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.080 
is gonna be a little bit darker but I
guess<00:01:25.290> cuz<00:01:25.530> really<00:01:25.979> light<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.580> Oracles

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
guess cuz really light and the Oracles

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.120 
guess cuz really light and the Oracles
with<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:28.020> not<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.530> mention<00:01:28.710> his

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
with it and and not to mention his

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.249 
with it and and not to mention his
clothes<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.729> think<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.060> really<00:01:30.090> matches<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
clothes I think it really matches the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.929 
clothes I think it really matches the
color<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.710> closing<00:01:32.189> just<00:01:32.310> like<00:01:32.490> overall

kind of like a is an expansion on Super

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.170 
kind of like a is an expansion on Super

Saiyan<00:03:49.930> um<00:03:50.250> but<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.400> whole<00:03:51.549> form<00:03:51.910> is<00:03:52.030> all<00:03:52.180> very

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
Saiyan um but the whole form is all very

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.119 
Saiyan um but the whole form is all very
confusing<00:03:52.569> but<00:03:53.079> imma<00:03:53.230> get<00:03:53.500> to<00:03:53.680> off<00:03:53.799> track<00:03:54.099> I

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
confusing but imma get to off track I

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:55.770 
confusing but imma get to off track I
think<00:03:54.609> that's<00:03:54.790> just<00:03:54.879> a<00:03:55.000> much<00:03:55.180> better<00:03:55.389> design

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
think that's just a much better design

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.960 
think that's just a much better design
here<00:03:56.260> would<00:03:56.889> be<00:03:56.919> Super<00:03:57.519> Saiyan<00:03:57.730> God<00:03:57.910> Super

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
here would be Super Saiyan God Super

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.530 
here would be Super Saiyan God Super
saying<00:03:58.629> terrible<00:03:58.930> name<00:03:59.199> but<00:03:59.500> um<00:04:00.299> yeah<00:04:01.299> I<00:04:01.329> mean

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
saying terrible name but um yeah I mean

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.640 
saying terrible name but um yeah I mean
it's<00:04:01.720> just<00:04:01.750> I<00:04:01.989> think<00:04:02.049> it's<00:04:02.349> a<00:04:02.410> much<00:04:02.620> better

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
it's just I think it's a much better

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.319 
it's just I think it's a much better
design<00:04:03.370> in<00:04:03.609> it<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:04.799> way<00:04:05.799> it<00:04:06.069> is<00:04:06.400> achieved

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
design in it the way it is achieved

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:08.970 
design in it the way it is achieved
makes<00:04:07.720> more<00:04:07.959> sense<00:04:08.199> and<00:04:08.349> Super<00:04:08.620> Saiyan<00:04:08.859> God

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.589 
makes more sense and Super Saiyan God
Super<00:04:09.040> saying<00:04:09.519> guy<00:04:09.699> never<00:04:09.970> really<00:04:10.180> made<00:04:10.299> sense

ever experienced anes but that's besides

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.219 
ever experienced anes but that's besides
the<00:04:22.210> plan<00:04:22.390> i<00:04:22.419> just<00:04:22.599> think<00:04:22.750> this<00:04:22.810> is<00:04:22.960> a<00:04:23.020> much

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
the plan i just think this is a much

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.710 
the plan i just think this is a much
better<00:04:23.260> design<00:04:23.860> on<00:04:24.159> it<00:04:24.490> looks<00:04:24.849> very

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
better design on it looks very

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.260 
better design on it looks very
a<00:04:26.110> powerful<00:04:26.890> super<00:04:27.400> saiyan<00:04:27.670> god<00:04:27.760> never<00:04:28.060> looked

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
a powerful super saiyan god never looked

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.080 
a powerful super saiyan god never looked
extremely<00:04:28.570> powerful<00:04:29.280> to<00:04:30.280> me<00:04:30.310> but<00:04:30.640> that's

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
extremely powerful to me but that's

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.850 
extremely powerful to me but that's
really<00:04:31.240> all<00:04:31.360> I<00:04:31.510> have<00:04:31.540> to<00:04:31.870> say<00:04:31.900> about<00:04:32.110> it<00:04:32.410> I<00:04:32.650> just

really all I have to say about it I just

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:33.720 
really all I have to say about it I just

hope that there's some sort of
electricity<00:04:34.120> with<00:04:34.480> it<00:04:34.630> but<00:04:35.170> it<00:04:35.470> being<00:04:35.800> a<00:04:35.860> super
