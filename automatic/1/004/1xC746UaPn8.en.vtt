00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
consumer I put in my width times my

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.780 
consumer I put in my width times my
length<00:04:35.970> of<00:04:36.150> my<00:04:36.470> existing<00:04:37.470> screens<00:04:37.860> so<00:04:38.670> that

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
length of my existing screens so that

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.910 
length of my existing screens so that
they<00:04:38.910> would<00:04:39.030> be<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.240> same<00:04:39.270> size<00:04:39.690> I<00:04:40.080> gave<00:04:40.740> them

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
they would be the same size I gave them

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.040 
they would be the same size I gave them
the<00:04:41.100> measurement<00:04:41.580> for<00:04:41.850> a<00:04:41.910> crossbar<00:04:42.570> right

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
the measurement for a crossbar right

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.410 
the measurement for a crossbar right
here<00:04:43.230> I<00:04:43.260> just<00:04:43.320> split<00:04:43.680> it<00:04:43.770> in<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:43.920> middle<00:04:44.130> and

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
here I just split it in the middle and

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.070 
here I just split it in the middle and
then<00:04:45.420> I<00:04:45.510> got<00:04:45.660> to<00:04:45.780> give<00:04:45.960> them<00:04:46.170> a<00:04:46.460> frame

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
then I got to give them a frame

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.630 
then I got to give them a frame
dimension<00:04:49.080> and<00:04:49.230> style<00:04:49.710> and<00:04:50.310> I<00:04:50.400> basically

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
dimension and style and I basically

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.850 
dimension and style and I basically
picked<00:04:51.180> the<00:04:51.330> same<00:04:51.570> style<00:04:51.990> of<00:04:52.170> dimension<00:04:52.590> of<00:04:52.710> my

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
picked the same style of dimension of my

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.670 
picked the same style of dimension of my
screens<00:04:53.190> because<00:04:53.730> I<00:04:53.820> knew<00:04:53.970> they<00:04:54.120> would<00:04:54.300> fit<00:04:54.680> to

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
screens because I knew they would fit to

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.980 
screens because I knew they would fit to
mount<00:04:55.950> these<00:04:56.190> things<00:04:56.550> I<00:04:56.880> got<00:04:57.480> these<00:04:57.660> little

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990

they're<00:05:00.960> Marvin<00:05:01.410> energy<00:05:01.770> panel<00:05:02.070> clips<00:05:02.310> and

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
they're Marvin energy panel clips and

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.550 
they're Marvin energy panel clips and
that's<00:05:02.730> how<00:05:02.850> I<00:05:02.880> how<00:05:03.480> I<00:05:03.510> fold<00:05:03.870> my<00:05:03.930> screens<00:05:04.350> in

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
that's how I how I fold my screens in
