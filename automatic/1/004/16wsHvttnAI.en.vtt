00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
agent stone in order to achieve a good

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.539 
agent stone in order to achieve a good
skating<00:01:22.080> technique<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.770> know<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.310> didn't

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
skating technique you know you didn't

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.969 
skating technique you know you didn't
get<00:01:23.880> better<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.299> skating<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.869> it's<00:01:25.080> my<00:01:25.590> house

get better in skating so it's my house

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.859 
get better in skating so it's my house
it's<00:01:26.310> kind<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.820> like<00:01:27.000> an<00:01:27.479> out-of-body

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
it's kind of like an out-of-body

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.780 
it's kind of like an out-of-body
experience<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.950> then<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.220> winds<00:01:29.460> its

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
experience and then that winds its

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.940 
experience and then that winds its

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
feel inside you know and I think it and

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.340 
feel inside you know and I think it and
I<00:04:43.080> think<00:04:43.140> that<00:04:43.890> if<00:04:44.010> we<00:04:44.040> think<00:04:44.460> with<00:04:45.180> logic<00:04:45.720> and

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
I think that if we think with logic and

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.830 
I think that if we think with logic and
not<00:04:46.800> with<00:04:46.980> our<00:04:47.130> emotion<00:04:47.730> if<00:04:48.180> we<00:04:48.360> think<00:04:48.570> with

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
not with our emotion if we think with

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.730 
not with our emotion if we think with
our<00:04:48.870> logic<00:04:49.440> and<00:04:49.830> not<00:04:50.220> with<00:04:50.400> our<00:04:50.550> emotions<00:04:50.850> then

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
our logic and not with our emotions then

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.860 
our logic and not with our emotions then
we<00:04:52.740> for<00:04:53.730> the<00:04:53.820> most<00:04:54.030> part<00:04:54.270> will<00:04:54.450> come<00:04:54.630> to<00:04:54.780> the

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
we for the most part will come to the

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.750 
we for the most part will come to the
same<00:04:55.080> conclusion<00:04:55.710> which<00:04:55.920> is<00:04:56.100> that<00:04:56.280> we<00:04:56.460> are<00:04:56.610> all

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
same conclusion which is that we are all

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.360 
same conclusion which is that we are all
one<00:04:57.000> that<00:04:57.780> we<00:04:57.990> are<00:04:58.080> all<00:04:58.290> one<00:04:58.500> species<00:04:58.890> we're
