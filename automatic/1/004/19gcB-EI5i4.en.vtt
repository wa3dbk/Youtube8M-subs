00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.630
 When there are bulldogs in my house I feel 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.570
 very protected 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.570

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.769
 they had been in vain 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:59.159

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.409
 jolie and sophie loved to spend 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.060
 time under the fig tree and they both knew 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:09.620
 that the best children are in the branches 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.560
 highest 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.629
 in that fateful day without thinking twice 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.480
 Jolie climbed the fig tree to look for her 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.950
 favorite fruit 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.780
 but he found something quite more 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.920
 dangerous 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.810

 easily killed the two dam 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.400
 fear I try to get off the tree 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.400
 but in a hurry he slipped and fell 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.290
 the girls tried to return to the farm 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.010
 as fast as they could but the cougar 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.020

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.390
 jolie's father and tomás heard screaming at 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.120
 the girls and he was running to investigate 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.460
 thinking that some other good bug 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.100
 it can be a viper for that 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.620
 as he approached tomás he noticed that 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.290
 It was not a snake and when it came it saw 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.750
 a morocho miraculously he was still 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.490
 alive but quite hurt and it was then 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.260
 that Tom saw a dead cougar about 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.360
 meters away 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.620
 Tomás picked up a dark-haired man and took him to the 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.080
 farm 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:37.370
 He looked after him for 10 days until he 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:40.270
 recovered after the attack morocho se 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.080

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.830
 morocho has a special place in 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.550
 our hearts for being our 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.630

 morocho in his farm 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.180
 and then you need a scope with a lot 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:09.540
 space to run need activity 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.910
 to be stimulated is a dog 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.960
 intense this dog was bred to 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.580
 protect families and hunt wild boars 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.010
 the pleasure of the bulldog should be smooth to the 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.540
 Touch a brushing once a week is 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.520
 enough to keep your 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:26.130
 white and short mantle is pretty 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.050
 practical to take care of but remember that 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.960
 the bulldog is one of the breeds of fur 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.720
 short that will probably leave them hairs 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.780
 very small whites on all the clothes and 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:40.080
 all furniture will need a 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.610
 very powerful vacuum to remove the 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.770
 Bulldog does not usually have the problems of 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.560
 typical health of large breeds but 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.450
 pay attention to bulldogs as well 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.270
 that Dalmatians are prone to suffer 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:53.000
 deafness related to the pigment is 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.070
 caused by a hereditary anomaly 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.440
 then 10% of these dogs are solar 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:01.080
 and in general it is the case of many dogs 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.540
 whites this is because there is a 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.000
 association between the lack of pigment and 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:09.130
 deafness 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.960
 and melanin is necessary during the 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.960
 development of the nerves to populate 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.630
 properly to the ear if there are not 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.150
 nerve cells not pigmented 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:22.270
 continue their course and the 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.250
 nervous deafness ernest eyes can 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.930
 be trained but they need a lot 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.479
 exercise and mental stimulation for 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.880
 all Argentines develop well 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:33.100
 they are determined and they have a lot of will 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.850
 so you have to be more 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:38.590
 determined and have more will than them 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:41.160
 although the bulldog can be a great dog 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.160
 of family 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.659
 when they tend to like warm weather 

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:46.909
 and you need large spaces to 

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:49.069
 exploring in general is healthy but 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:51.440
 suffers from deafness you only need the 

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:52.879
 brushed once a week the 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.069
 early and frequent training is 

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:57.909
 essential the ideal bulldog for a family 

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:57.909
 with experience
