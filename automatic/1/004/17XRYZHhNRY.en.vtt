00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:24.509 
because in their natural habitat

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:26.450 
because in their natural habitat
students<00:00:24.989> will<00:00:25.140> be<00:00:25.259> very<00:00:25.529> high<00:00:25.770> up<00:00:26.009> off<00:00:26.250> the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.260 
students will be very high up off the
ground<00:00:26.669> and<00:00:28.430> they<00:00:29.430> don't<00:00:29.640> necessarily<00:00:29.820> need

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
ground and they don't necessarily need

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.030 
ground and they don't necessarily need
as<00:00:30.390> much<00:00:31.489> space<00:00:32.489> as<00:00:33.230> with<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.380> width<00:00:34.620> as<00:00:34.890> they

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
as much space as with the width as they

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.980 
as much space as with the width as they
do<00:00:35.160> height<00:00:35.399> because<00:00:35.820> again<00:00:36.750> they'll<00:00:36.900> be

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:36.990 
do height because again they'll be

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.380 
do height because again they'll be
climbing<00:00:37.200> up<00:00:37.560> and<00:00:37.710> down<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.370> their<00:00:39.210> natural

basically any stores you know I I pretty
much<00:01:45.600> don't<00:01:45.900> use<00:01:46.170> real<00:01:46.950> ones<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.369> think<00:01:47.430> it's

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
much don't use real ones I think it's

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.270 
much don't use real ones I think it's
you<00:01:47.970> know<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.450> got<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:49.439> end<00:01:49.560> up<00:01:49.650> more<00:01:50.070> and

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.839 
have real plants in your terrarium then
don't<00:02:10.439> mix<00:02:10.679> them<00:02:10.860> with<00:02:11.009> fake<00:02:11.250> ones<00:02:11.519> because

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
don't mix them with fake ones because

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.929 
don't mix them with fake ones because
the<00:02:11.969> chameleons<00:02:12.389> will<00:02:12.510> get<00:02:12.629> mixed<00:02:12.989> up<00:02:13.109> on

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:13.939 
the chameleons will get mixed up on

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:16.040 
the chameleons will get mixed up on
which<00:02:14.939> ones<00:02:15.150> they<00:02:15.299> can<00:02:15.359> and

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
which ones they can and

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.940 
which ones they can and
eat<00:02:16.880> and<00:02:18.260> always<00:02:19.260> remember<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.590> if<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:19.830> have

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
eat and always remember that if you have

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.820 
eat and always remember that if you have
any<00:02:20.160> fake<00:02:20.490> plants<00:02:21.030> in<00:02:21.240> your<00:02:21.810> terrarium<00:02:22.500> make

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
any fake plants in your terrarium make

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.500 
any fake plants in your terrarium make
sure<00:02:22.950> they're<00:02:23.100> non-toxic<00:02:23.610> because<00:02:24.390> the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
sure they're non-toxic because the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.610 
sure they're non-toxic because the
chameleons<00:02:24.960> may<00:02:25.890> start<00:02:26.490> chewing<00:02:26.730> on<00:02:26.970> them<00:02:27.150> and

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
chameleons may start chewing on them and

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.840 
chameleons may start chewing on them and
ingest<00:02:28.620> some<00:02:28.710> of<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.100> if<00:02:29.190> it's<00:02:29.340> toxic

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
ingest some of that and if it's toxic

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.040 
ingest some of that and if it's toxic
that<00:02:30.000> could<00:02:30.180> be<00:02:30.590> pretty<00:02:31.590> bad<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:33.480> then<00:02:33.630> also<00:02:33.840> I

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
that could be pretty bad and then also I

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.990 
that could be pretty bad and then also I
have<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.260> bunch<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.100> stuff<00:02:35.220> on<00:02:35.340> mclamb<00:02:35.670> I'm<00:02:35.820> like

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
have a bunch of stuff on mclamb I'm like

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.910 
have a bunch of stuff on mclamb I'm like
he's<00:02:36.420> smaller<00:02:36.750> so<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:36.960> don't<00:02:37.110> have<00:02:37.200> too<00:02:37.800> much

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
he's smaller so I don't have too much

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.560 
he's smaller so I don't have too much
bigger<00:02:38.280> stuff<00:02:38.580> but<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:38.760> have<00:02:38.910> like<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.060> one<00:02:39.360> big

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
bigger stuff but I have like a one big

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.830 
bigger stuff but I have like a one big
brand<00:02:39.840> right<00:02:39.960> here<00:02:40.170> I've<00:02:40.260> seen<00:02:40.440> shoelaces<00:02:40.920> um

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
brand right here I've seen shoelaces um

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.540 
brand right here I've seen shoelaces um
he<00:02:42.840> sometimes<00:02:43.290> climbs<00:02:43.590> on<00:02:43.770> this<00:02:43.920> mesh<00:02:44.250> right

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
he sometimes climbs on this mesh right

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.360 
he sometimes climbs on this mesh right
up<00:02:44.730> here<00:02:45.170> um<00:02:46.910> but<00:02:48.860> generally<00:02:49.860> you<00:02:49.920> can<00:02:50.100> put

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
up here um but generally you can put

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.970 
up here um but generally you can put
almost<00:02:50.700> anything<00:02:51.270> in<00:02:51.660> there<00:02:51.930> from<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.650> climb

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
almost anything in there from the climb

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.650 
almost anything in there from the climb
on<00:02:53.190> up<00:02:53.220> shoelaces<00:02:53.790> don't<00:02:54.120> make<00:02:54.210> it<00:02:54.330> look<00:02:54.450> too

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
on up shoelaces don't make it look too

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.610 
on up shoelaces don't make it look too
you<00:02:55.260> know<00:02:55.380> unrealistic<00:02:56.250> um<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:58.260> know<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.410> can

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
you know unrealistic um you know you can

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.560 
you know unrealistic um you know you can
take<00:02:58.860> some<00:02:59.250> branches<00:02:59.640> from<00:02:59.730> outside<00:03:00.150> remember

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
take some branches from outside remember

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.270 
take some branches from outside remember
to<00:03:00.660> boil<00:03:00.930> them<00:03:01.200> or<00:03:01.350> bake<00:03:01.560> them<00:03:01.770> firstly<00:03:02.160> all

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
to boil them or bake them firstly all

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
to boil them or bake them firstly all
the<00:03:02.450> germs<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.720> stuff<00:03:03.960> off<00:03:04.140> of<00:03:04.380> them<00:03:04.560> first

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
the germs and stuff off of them first

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.610 
the germs and stuff off of them first
generally<00:03:06.300> I<00:03:06.360> don't<00:03:06.540> tend<00:03:06.990> I<00:03:07.230> don't<00:03:07.410> tend<00:03:07.560> to

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
generally I don't tend I don't tend to

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.520 
generally I don't tend I don't tend to
do<00:03:07.770> that<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:07.920> just<00:03:08.010> go<00:03:08.280> get<00:03:08.790> them<00:03:08.910> food<00:03:09.060> stores

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
do that I just go get them food stores

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.630 
do that I just go get them food stores
but<00:03:10.530> um<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:11.100> know<00:03:11.190> if<00:03:11.250> you're<00:03:11.400> going<00:03:11.490> to<00:03:11.580> do

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
but um you know if you're going to do

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.730 
but um you know if you're going to do
that<00:03:11.790> make<00:03:12.030> sure<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.300> bake<00:03:12.600> them<00:03:12.960> or<00:03:13.260> boil<00:03:13.530> and

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
that make sure you bake them or boil and

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:20.300 
that make sure you bake them or boil and
I<00:03:13.980> recommend<00:03:14.190> baking<00:03:14.700> um<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:17.040> then<00:03:17.790> also<00:03:19.310> the

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
I recommend baking um and then also the

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.610 
I recommend baking um and then also the
substrate<00:03:21.120> um<00:03:21.870> you'll<00:03:22.110> see<00:03:22.170> right<00:03:22.410> here<00:03:22.560> I

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
substrate um you'll see right here I

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.350 
substrate um you'll see right here I
have<00:03:22.739> kinda<00:03:23.160> like<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.310> mulch<00:03:23.610> down<00:03:23.970> here<00:03:24.209> and<00:03:24.330> a

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
have kinda like a mulch down here and a

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.470 
have kinda like a mulch down here and a
bunch<00:03:24.480> of<00:03:24.660> shells<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:25.650> stuff<00:03:26.209> generally<00:03:27.209> in

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
bunch of shells and stuff generally in

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.640 
bunch of shells and stuff generally in
other<00:03:27.690> videos<00:03:28.080> I'll<00:03:28.290> tell<00:03:28.560> you<00:03:28.739> don't<00:03:30.650> don't

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
other videos I'll tell you don't don't

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.800 
other videos I'll tell you don't don't
use<00:03:31.920> substrate<00:03:32.670> like<00:03:32.820> that<00:03:33.000> because<00:03:33.540> if

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
use substrate like that because if

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.900 
use substrate like that because if
you're<00:03:33.959> feeding<00:03:34.170> your<00:03:34.320> chameleon<00:03:35.310> crickets

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
you're feeding your chameleon crickets

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.880 
you're feeding your chameleon crickets
or<00:03:36.060> other<00:03:36.270> bugs<00:03:36.660> off<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:36.989> ground<00:03:37.290> they<00:03:37.709> may<00:03:37.830> be

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
or other bugs off the ground they may be

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.100 
or other bugs off the ground they may be
crawling<00:03:38.280> on<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.459> ground<00:03:38.489> and<00:03:39.120> when<00:03:39.450> the

crawling on the ground and when the

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.840 
crawling on the ground and when the
chameleon<00:03:40.800> sticks<00:03:41.070> out<00:03:41.190> its<00:03:41.310> tongue<00:03:41.550> to<00:03:41.580> get

chameleon sticks out its tongue to get

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.060 
chameleon sticks out its tongue to get
it<00:03:41.970> get<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.660> bug<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:43.140> may<00:03:43.350> ingest<00:03:43.770> some<00:03:43.980> of

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
it get the bug you may ingest some of

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.120 
it get the bug you may ingest some of
the<00:03:44.160> wood<00:03:44.430> or<00:03:44.700> this<00:03:45.000> mulch<00:03:45.330> and<00:03:45.720> it'll<00:03:46.500> mess<00:03:46.920> up

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
the wood or this mulch and it'll mess up

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.640 
the wood or this mulch and it'll mess up
his<00:03:47.220> digestive<00:03:47.760> system<00:03:48.150> um<00:03:49.110> I<00:03:49.170> don't<00:03:49.470> really

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
his digestive system um I don't really

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.229 
his digestive system um I don't really
have<00:03:49.890> to<00:03:50.010> worry<00:03:50.220> about<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:50.670> because<00:03:50.880> I<00:03:51.060> use

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
have to worry about that because I use

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.790 
have to worry about that because I use
this<00:03:51.420> feeder<00:03:51.690> right<00:03:51.900> here<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.380> feed<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:52.709> we'll

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
this feeder right here to feed and we'll

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.160 
this feeder right here to feed and we'll
talk<00:03:52.980> about<00:03:53.100> this<00:03:53.280> in<00:03:53.459> a<00:03:53.550> different<00:03:53.790> video<00:03:54.170> so

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
talk about this in a different video so

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.050 
talk about this in a different video so
you<00:03:55.230> know<00:03:55.470> I<00:03:55.500> can<00:03:55.800> put<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.459> know<00:03:56.489> mulch<00:03:56.850> and

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
you know I can put you know mulch and

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.280 
you know I can put you know mulch and
stuff<00:03:57.209> down<00:03:57.390> here<00:03:57.630> sometimes<00:03:57.930> I'll<00:03:58.230> even

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
stuff down here sometimes I'll even

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.050 
stuff down here sometimes I'll even
climb<00:03:58.709> down<00:03:58.950> here<00:04:00.560> you<00:04:01.560> know<00:04:01.739> but<00:04:02.070> if<00:04:02.340> you're

of during or out of a bowl and then also

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.820 
of during or out of a bowl and then also
another<00:04:57.270> dripping<00:04:57.750> system<00:04:58.139> you<00:04:58.290> can<00:04:58.500> get<00:04:58.650> them

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
another dripping system you can get them

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.060 
another dripping system you can get them
for<00:04:59.040> ten<00:04:59.400> fifteen<00:04:59.580> dollars<00:05:00.030> at<00:05:00.150> a<00:05:00.180> store<00:05:00.540> um

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
for ten fifteen dollars at a store um

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.740 
for ten fifteen dollars at a store um
but<00:05:02.070> if<00:05:02.400> you<00:05:02.550> have<00:05:02.669> a<00:05:02.700> mesh<00:05:03.000> top<00:05:03.360> like<00:05:03.600> this

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
but if you have a mesh top like this

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.210 
but if you have a mesh top like this
something<00:05:04.020> works<00:05:04.350> much<00:05:04.620> better<00:05:04.650> and<00:05:05.130> it's

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
something works much better and it's

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.400 
something works much better and it's
cheaper<00:05:05.669> is<00:05:05.850> just<00:05:06.450> put<00:05:06.600> a<00:05:06.630> few<00:05:06.810> ice<00:05:06.990> cubes<00:05:07.020> on

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
cheaper is just put a few ice cubes on

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.080 
cheaper is just put a few ice cubes on
the<00:05:07.470> top<00:05:07.680> and<00:05:07.950> they'll<00:05:08.100> melt<00:05:08.370> and<00:05:08.790> the<00:05:08.910> water

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
the top and they'll melt and the water

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.629 
the top and they'll melt and the water
will<00:05:09.300> drip<00:05:09.510> through<00:05:09.720> here<00:05:09.990> and<00:05:10.110> just<00:05:10.639> drip

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
will drip through here and just drip

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:12.890 
will drip through here and just drip
down<00:05:11.760> onto<00:05:12.000> the<00:05:12.060> leaves<00:05:12.240> and<00:05:12.360> you<00:05:12.389> can<00:05:12.450> lick<00:05:12.750> on

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
down onto the leaves and you can lick on

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.710 
down onto the leaves and you can lick on
that<00:05:13.080> but<00:05:14.010> that<00:05:14.160> does<00:05:14.430> not<00:05:14.460> replace<00:05:15.120> misting

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
that but that does not replace misting

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.060 
that but that does not replace misting
twice<00:05:15.960> a<00:05:15.990> day<00:05:16.229> misting<00:05:16.590> twice<00:05:16.770> a<00:05:16.800> day<00:05:17.010> should

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
twice a day misting twice a day should

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.280 
twice a day misting twice a day should
always<00:05:17.370> always<00:05:17.760> occur<00:05:18.720> and<00:05:18.960> should<00:05:19.080> always

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
always always occur and should always

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.310 
always always occur and should always

have a dripping system the dripping

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.650 
have a dripping system the dripping
system<00:05:22.620> does<00:05:22.740> have<00:05:22.860> to<00:05:22.950> be<00:05:23.039> 24/7<00:05:23.610> but<00:05:24.030> you<00:05:24.510> know

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
system does have to be 24/7 but you know

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.810 
system does have to be 24/7 but you know
has<00:05:25.590> to<00:05:25.740> be<00:05:25.830> some<00:05:26.190> a<00:05:26.460> few<00:05:26.789> hours<00:05:27.150> of<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:27.389> day<00:05:27.570> um
