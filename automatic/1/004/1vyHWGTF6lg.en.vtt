personally think is a groundbreaking

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.160 
personally think is a groundbreaking
invention<00:01:13.860> have<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.760> got<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.030> because<00:01:15.170> it's

invention have you got it because it's

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.020 
invention have you got it because it's
called<00:01:16.530> grind<00:01:16.950> breaking<00:01:17.400> jumps<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.820> vanilla

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
called grind breaking jumps in vanilla

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.390 
called grind breaking jumps in vanilla
minecraft<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.530> call<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.920> groundbreaking

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
minecraft and I call it a groundbreaking

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.130 
minecraft and I call it a groundbreaking
invention<00:01:22.909> and<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:23.939> really<00:01:24.659> think<00:01:24.810> these<00:01:24.990> jokes

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
invention and I really think these jokes

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.950 
invention and I really think these jokes
are<00:01:25.320> funny<00:01:25.439> around<00:01:25.770> here<00:01:26.009> okay<00:01:26.729> okay<00:01:27.030> that's<00:01:27.150> a

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
are funny around here okay okay that's a

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.620 
are funny around here okay okay that's a
pretty<00:01:28.110> bad<00:01:28.380> joke<00:01:28.560> no<00:01:29.400> but<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.970> called<00:01:30.299> a

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
pretty bad joke no but this is called a

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.780 
pretty bad joke no but this is called a
ground<00:01:30.930> breaking<00:01:31.290> ground<00:01:32.220> making<00:01:32.579> your

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
ground breaking ground making your

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.310 
ground breaking ground making your
ground<00:01:33.000> breaking<00:01:33.509> jumps<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:34.020> vanilla

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
ground breaking jumps in vanilla

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.800 
ground breaking jumps in vanilla
minecraft<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.549> basically<00:01:35.909> whenever<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.420> jump

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
minecraft so basically whenever you jump

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.289 
minecraft so basically whenever you jump
the<00:01:36.900> ground<00:01:37.229> breaks<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.590> little<00:01:37.650> bit<00:01:37.829> more<00:01:38.299> so

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
the ground breaks a little bit more so

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.630 
the ground breaks a little bit more so
if<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.869> go<00:01:39.990> up<00:01:40.110> here<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.500> could<00:01:40.920> see<00:01:41.100> all<00:01:41.340> three

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
if I go up here you could see all three

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.499 
if I go up here you could see all three
stages<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.299> one<00:01:42.810> two<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.520> three<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.759> then

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
stages of it one two and three and then

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.600 
stages of it one two and three and then
you<00:01:45.600> fall<00:01:45.780> down<00:01:45.899> on<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.110> hole<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.500> let<00:01:47.399> me<00:01:47.490> go

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
you fall down on that hole so let me go

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.399 
you fall down on that hole so let me go
ahead<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.000> show<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.299> how<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.659> build<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.140> with

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
ahead and show you how to build it with

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.830 
ahead and show you how to build it with
this<00:01:49.560> redstone<00:01:50.210> I'm<00:01:51.210> pretty<00:01:51.479> sure<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.780> could

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
this redstone I'm pretty sure you could

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.840 
this redstone I'm pretty sure you could
do<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.170> lot<00:01:52.470> more<00:01:52.770> compact<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:53.670> did

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
do this a lot more compact I just did

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.300 
do this a lot more compact I just did
this<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.119> show<00:01:54.420> off<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.899> invention<00:01:55.439> not<00:01:55.799> for

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
this to show off the invention not for

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.020 
this to show off the invention not for
it<00:01:57.090> being<00:01:57.450> compact<00:01:57.829> so<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:59.159> course<00:01:59.369> as<00:01:59.790> usual

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
it being compact so of course as usual

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.289 
it being compact so of course as usual
this<00:02:00.689> leads<00:02:00.960> first<00:02:01.740> into<00:02:02.310> command<00:02:02.729> block<00:02:03.000> with

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
this leads first into command block with

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.649 
this leads first into command block with
a<00:02:03.329> test<00:02:03.840> for<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.500> whenever<00:02:04.860> you

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
a test for so whenever you

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.680 
a test for so whenever you
to<00:02:05.780> this<00:02:06.079> area<00:02:06.409> right<00:02:06.829> over<00:02:06.950> here<00:02:07.539> which<00:02:08.539> is

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
to this area right over here which is

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.600 
to this area right over here which is
basically<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.440> peak<00:02:09.649> of<00:02:09.800> your<00:02:09.979> jump<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.519> then

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
basically the peak of your jump and then

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.780 
basically the peak of your jump and then
you<00:02:10.700> fall<00:02:10.879> in<00:02:10.970> hit<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.090> ground<00:02:12.220> it<00:02:13.220> activates

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
you fall in hit the ground it activates

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.130 
you fall in hit the ground it activates
a<00:02:14.890> comparator<00:02:15.890> which<00:02:16.069> accepted<00:02:16.610> this<00:02:17.140> little

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
a comparator which accepted this little

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.289 
a comparator which accepted this little
device<00:02:18.319> over<00:02:18.709> here<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:18.950> guess<00:02:19.160> which<00:02:20.060> is

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
device over here I guess which is

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.900 
device over here I guess which is
basically<00:02:20.870> each<00:02:21.170> set<00:02:21.410> blocks<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:22.069> destroy<00:02:22.430> the

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
basically each set blocks to destroy the

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.869 
basically each set blocks to destroy the
previous<00:02:23.269> blocks<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.900> set<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.260> new<00:02:24.440> ones

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
previous blocks and set the new ones

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.360 
previous blocks and set the new ones
which<00:02:25.879> leads<00:02:26.360> into<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:27.110> piston<00:02:27.680> which<00:02:27.860> question

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
which leads into a piston which question

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.119 
which leads into a piston which question
pushes<00:02:28.819> this<00:02:29.030> block<00:02:29.299> over<00:02:29.540> here<00:02:29.680> that<00:02:30.680> turns

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
pushes this block over here that turns

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.300 
pushes this block over here that turns
off<00:02:31.489> this<00:02:31.940> device<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:32.690> turns<00:02:33.650> this<00:02:33.950> one<00:02:34.160> on

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
off this device and turns this one on

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.000 
off this device and turns this one on
and<00:02:34.640> then<00:02:35.450> it's<00:02:35.720> basically<00:02:35.870> repeating<00:02:36.620> only

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
and then it's basically repeating only

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.589 
and then it's basically repeating only
this<00:02:37.190> is<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.459> second<00:02:37.790> stage<00:02:37.970> so<00:02:38.329> sync

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
this is the second stage so sync

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.229 
this is the second stage so sync
different<00:02:38.930> set<00:02:39.140> block<00:02:39.349> commands<00:02:40.030> let's<00:02:41.030> see

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
different set block commands let's see

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.350 
different set block commands let's see
there's<00:02:41.450> more<00:02:41.690> of<00:02:41.870> them<00:02:42.049> because<00:02:42.260> more<00:02:42.860> break

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
there's more of them because more break

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.330 
there's more of them because more break
there<00:02:44.360> are<00:02:44.569> also<00:02:44.810> over<00:02:45.440> here<00:02:45.590> these<00:02:46.099> are<00:02:46.310> the

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
there are also over here these are the

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.490 
there are also over here these are the
ones<00:02:46.430> yeah<00:02:46.730> their<00:02:46.940> place<00:02:47.180> on<00:02:47.390> commands<00:02:47.750> this

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
ones yeah their place on commands this

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.550 
ones yeah their place on commands this
one's<00:02:48.709> not<00:02:48.799> one<00:02:49.040> I<00:02:49.160> think<00:02:49.220> it's<00:02:49.459> this<00:02:49.549> one<00:02:49.700> too

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
one's not one I think it's this one too

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.259 
one's not one I think it's this one too
just<00:02:51.560> add<00:02:51.769> a<00:02:51.799> little<00:02:51.829> bit<00:02:51.980> more<00:02:52.069> ambience<00:02:52.940> or

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
just add a little bit more ambience or

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.309 
just add a little bit more ambience or
whatever<00:02:53.569> you<00:02:53.629> want<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.930> call<00:02:54.049> that

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
whatever you want to call that

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.500 
whatever you want to call that
but<00:02:55.220> then<00:02:55.370> that<00:02:55.489> hooks<00:02:55.790> up<00:02:55.910> into<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.299> third

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
but then that hooks up into the third

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.289 
but then that hooks up into the third
one<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.049> the<00:02:57.140> final<00:02:57.980> one<00:02:58.310> which<00:02:58.519> breaks<00:02:58.970> most

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
one and the final one which breaks most

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.800 
one and the final one which breaks most
of<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.510> blocks<00:02:59.750> plays<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:01.569> would<00:03:02.569> break

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
of the blocks plays the would break

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.259 
of the blocks plays the would break
