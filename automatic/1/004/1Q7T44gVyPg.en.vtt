to day so once again I borrowed
something<00:00:21.090> from<00:00:21.180> my<00:00:21.330> buddy<00:00:21.510> at<00:00:21.630> TLD<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.740> time

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:23.009 
something from my buddy at TLD this time

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.970 
something from my buddy at TLD this time
it's<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.400> iPad<00:00:24.359> Mini<00:00:24.630> with<00:00:24.810> Retina<00:00:24.839> display

it's the iPad Mini with Retina display

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.679 
it's the iPad Mini with Retina display
now<00:00:26.250> what's<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.640> thing<00:00:26.820> all<00:00:27.060> about<00:00:27.330> well

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
now what's this thing all about well

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.109 
now what's this thing all about well
it's<00:00:27.810> got<00:00:27.929> the<00:00:28.080> new<00:00:28.199> a7<00:00:28.710> processor<00:00:29.119> dual-core

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
it's got the new a7 processor dual-core

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.730 
it's got the new a7 processor dual-core
processors<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.749> really<00:00:30.990> kicks<00:00:31.259> ass

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
processors it really kicks ass

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.080 
processors it really kicks ass
it's<00:00:31.949> supposed<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.189> be<00:00:32.279> really<00:00:32.400> optimized<00:00:32.910> -

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
it's supposed to be really optimized -

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.610 
it's supposed to be really optimized -
even<00:00:33.300> better<00:00:33.450> than<00:00:33.690> some<00:00:33.930> quad-core

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
even better than some quad-core

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.440 
even better than some quad-core
processors<00:00:35.220> now<00:00:35.430> really<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.300> only

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
processors now really the only

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.030 
processors now really the only
difference<00:00:36.690> though<00:00:37.050> between<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.770> one<00:00:38.010> and

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
difference though between this one and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.100 
difference though between this one and
the<00:00:38.460> one<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.610> we<00:00:38.789> unboxed<00:00:39.300> last<00:00:39.539> week<00:00:39.840> is

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
the one that we unboxed last week is

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.170 
the one that we unboxed last week is
pretty<00:00:40.500> much<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.010> screen<00:00:41.309> size<00:00:41.550> they're<00:00:41.879> kind

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
pretty much the screen size they're kind

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.229 
pretty much the screen size they're kind
of<00:00:42.300> reversed<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:43.289> one's<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.680> 7.9<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.940> other

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
of reversed this one's a 7.9 the other

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.740 
of reversed this one's a 7.9 the other
was<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.250> 9.7<00:00:47.250> all<00:00:47.850> pretty<00:00:48.239> much<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.449> same

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
was the 9.7 all pretty much the same

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.229 
was the 9.7 all pretty much the same
features<00:00:49.170> except<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.920> 64<00:00:50.730> gigabyte

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
features except this is the 64 gigabyte

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.990 
features except this is the 64 gigabyte
verizon<00:00:51.960> model<00:00:52.320> that's<00:00:52.500> right<00:00:52.680> 64<00:00:53.370> gigabytes

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
verizon model that's right 64 gigabytes

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.420 
verizon model that's right 64 gigabytes
it's<00:00:54.660> still<00:00:55.260> got<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.649> know<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.890> 1<00:00:56.070> gigabyte

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
it's still got you know the 1 gigabyte

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.680 
it's still got you know the 1 gigabyte
of<00:00:56.579> memory<00:00:56.609> in<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.149> everything<00:00:57.480> else<00:00:57.570> that

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
of memory in it and everything else that

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.509 
of memory in it and everything else that
the<00:00:57.840> other<00:00:57.989> one<00:00:58.109> had<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:58.829> actually<00:00:59.250> clock

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
the other one had it's actually clock

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.090 
the other one had it's actually clock
just<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.969> daily<00:01:00.359> weeny<00:01:01.079> bit<00:01:01.289> slower<00:01:01.559> I've<00:01:01.800> heard

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
just a daily weeny bit slower I've heard

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.549 
just a daily weeny bit slower I've heard
but<00:01:02.579> essentially<00:01:03.090> pretty<00:01:03.359> much<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.809> same<00:01:04.019> so

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
but essentially pretty much the same so

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.290 
but essentially pretty much the same so
with<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.860> said<00:01:05.129> though<00:01:05.339> let's<00:01:05.610> jump<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.120> and

precision cuts hey they were supposed to
be<00:01:38.280> more<00:01:38.430> even<00:01:38.610> precision<00:01:39.030> than<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.300> doggone

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
be more even precision than that doggone

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.670 
be more even precision than that doggone
it<00:01:39.930> put<00:01:40.050> alright<00:01:40.230> here<00:01:40.410> we<00:01:40.440> go
