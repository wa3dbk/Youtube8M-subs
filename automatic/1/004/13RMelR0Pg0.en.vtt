soil like this nothing complicated prior

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.030 
soil like this nothing complicated prior
to<00:01:25.650> planting<00:01:26.869> also<00:01:27.869> if<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.259> have<00:01:28.470> some<00:01:28.740> aged

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
of compost that you maybe have made

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.380 
of compost that you maybe have made
yourself<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> good<00:01:35.700> time<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.119> add<00:01:36.240> it

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
yourself this is a good time to add it

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.109 
yourself this is a good time to add it
to<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.630> soil<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.229> basically<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.280> usually<00:01:38.909> add

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
to the soil and basically I usually add

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.200 
to the soil and basically I usually add
about<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.509> third<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:41.189> total<00:01:41.579> volume<00:01:41.729> in

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
about a third of the total volume in

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.770 
about a third of the total volume in
compost<00:01:43.850> very<00:01:44.850> important<00:01:45.420> whenever<00:01:45.570> you

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
compost very important whenever you

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.440 
compost very important whenever you
plant<00:01:46.079> anything<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:47.310> loosen<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.850> soil<00:01:48.060> around

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
plant anything to loosen the soil around

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.969 
plant anything to loosen the soil around
the<00:01:48.659> plant<00:01:48.960> because<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.950> roots<00:01:50.189> need<00:01:50.490> air<00:01:51.979> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
the plant because the roots need air the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.130 
the plant because the roots need air the
fall<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.520> great<00:01:53.640> time<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.390> plant<00:01:54.509> peonies

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
fall is a great time to plant peonies

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.260 
fall is a great time to plant peonies
that<00:01:55.170> way<00:01:55.590> it's<00:01:55.770> cool<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.460> roots<00:01:56.670> can<00:01:56.909> settle

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
that way it's cool the roots can settle

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.050 
that way it's cool the roots can settle
in<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.619> top<00:01:58.829> growth<00:01:59.189> won't<00:01:59.399> be<00:01:59.579> forced

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
in and the top growth won't be forced

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.170 
in and the top growth won't be forced
unnaturally<00:02:01.049> by<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.229> hot<00:02:01.500> day<00:02:01.829> I'm<00:02:02.490> loosening

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
unnaturally by a hot day I'm loosening

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.709 
unnaturally by a hot day I'm loosening
the<00:02:03.360> soil<00:02:03.600> about<00:02:03.960> four<00:02:04.350> inches<00:02:05.540> larger<00:02:06.540> than

make with planting peonies is planting
them<00:02:34.440> too<00:02:34.650> deep<00:02:34.970> what<00:02:35.970> will<00:02:36.150> happen<00:02:36.600> if<00:02:36.750> you

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
to flower in bloom heavily so you have

an important part of growing peonies is

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.070 
an important part of growing peonies is
to<00:03:47.580> make<00:03:47.730> sure<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:47.970> you're<00:03:48.269> removing<00:03:48.690> dead
