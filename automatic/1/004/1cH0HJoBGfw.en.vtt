00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
unleash everything on high-explosive

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.440 
unleash everything on high-explosive
shells<00:05:33.130> come<00:05:33.730> on<00:05:33.960> come<00:05:34.960> on<00:05:35.050> yes<00:05:35.410> so<00:05:35.890> we<00:05:36.010> look

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
and that's the eighth kill

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.220 
and that's the eighth kill
I'm<00:05:40.180> sure<00:05:40.360> quite<00:05:40.570> worried<00:05:40.780> there<00:05:40.990> that<00:05:41.170> it

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.230 
I'm sure quite worried there that it

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.090 
I'm sure quite worried there that it
might<00:05:41.380> have<00:05:41.470> been<00:05:41.560> one<00:05:41.710> of<00:05:41.740> those<00:05:41.920> things

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
might have been one of those things

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.500 
might have been one of those things
where<00:05:42.250> it<00:05:42.310> drops<00:05:42.490> the<00:05:42.640> bonds<00:05:42.910> is<00:05:43.030> coming<00:05:43.360> down

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
where it drops the bonds is coming down

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.320 
where it drops the bonds is coming down
but<00:05:43.840> I<00:05:44.160> was<00:05:45.160> lucky<00:05:45.280> maybe<00:05:45.730> it<00:05:45.880> already<00:05:46.000> dropped

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
but I was lucky maybe it already dropped

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.870 
but I was lucky maybe it already dropped
them<00:05:46.920> and<00:05:47.920> pretty<00:05:48.190> much<00:05:48.310> nothing<00:05:48.490> happens

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
them and pretty much nothing happens

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.970 
them and pretty much nothing happens
that<00:05:49.060> we<00:05:49.240> just<00:05:49.390> go<00:05:49.540> and<00:05:49.630> cafe<00:05:49.930> I<00:05:50.170> could<00:05:50.770> sit<00:05:50.920> on

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:50.980 
that we just go and cafe I could sit on

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.720 
that we just go and cafe I could sit on
the<00:05:51.100> point

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.700 

and<00:05:54.360> that<00:05:54.450> was<00:05:54.570> it<00:05:54.720> there's<00:05:54.900> only<00:05:55.140> one<00:05:55.560> other

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
and that was it there's only one other

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.050 
and that was it there's only one other
player<00:05:56.010> but<00:05:56.250> I<00:05:56.280> don't<00:05:56.460> see<00:05:56.640> in<00:05:56.700> the<00:05:56.820> rest<00:05:56.970> of

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.150 
player but I don't see in the rest of
the<00:05:57.150> game<00:05:57.470> so<00:05:58.470> I'm<00:05:58.530> probably<00:05:58.650> is<00:05:58.860> gonna<00:05:58.980> do<00:05:59.130> a

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
the game so I'm probably is gonna do a

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.740 
the game so I'm probably is gonna do a
jump<00:05:59.400> cut<00:05:59.520> now<00:05:59.730> I<00:05:59.970> should<00:06:00.240> note<00:06:00.270> I'll<00:06:00.570> do<00:06:00.720> a

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
jump cut now I should note I'll do a

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.330 
jump cut now I should note I'll do a
fast-forward<00:06:01.350> that<00:06:01.650> way<00:06:01.800> or<00:06:01.890> sure<00:06:02.010> I<00:06:02.040> didn't

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
fast-forward that way or sure I didn't

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.280 
fast-forward that way or sure I didn't
died<00:06:02.630> that<00:06:03.630> made<00:06:03.750> me<00:06:03.840> feel<00:06:03.990> even<00:06:04.080> better

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.290 
died that made me feel even better

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.350 
died that made me feel even better
except<00:06:04.650> for<00:06:04.800> eight<00:06:04.980> kills<00:06:05.340> and<00:06:05.610> I<00:06:05.820> think<00:06:06.060> three

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
except for eight kills and I think three

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.230 
except for eight kills and I think three
assists<00:06:06.860> this<00:06:07.860> is<00:06:08.070> slowly<00:06:08.340> no<00:06:08.700> late

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
assists this is slowly no late

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.420 
assists this is slowly no late
forces<00:06:09.840> I've<00:06:10.170> got<00:06:10.380> one<00:06:10.560> assist<00:06:10.890> at<00:06:11.280> the

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.400 
beginning in this air tank I just cut it
out<00:06:14.010> though<00:06:14.250> except<00:06:15.240> it<00:06:15.420> wasn't<00:06:15.690> worried<00:06:16.020> I

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410 
out though except it wasn't worried I

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:17.780
