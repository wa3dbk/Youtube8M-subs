to kill and that's

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.699 
to kill and that's
by<00:02:13.510> it<00:02:13.569> so<00:02:13.780> fast<00:02:14.080> if<00:02:14.260> you<00:02:14.319> can<00:02:14.410> tell<00:02:14.560> by<00:02:14.680> all

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
by it so fast if you can tell by all

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.530 
by it so fast if you can tell by all

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
these red dots and I would actually

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.119 
these red dots and I would actually
recommend<00:02:16.629> turning<00:02:17.080> your<00:02:17.319> auto<00:02:17.500> retaliate

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
recommend turning your auto retaliate

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.710 
recommend turning your auto retaliate
off<00:02:18.310> because<00:02:18.700> they<00:02:18.879> do<00:02:18.940> attack<00:02:19.150> you<00:02:19.510> quite

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
off because they do attack you quite

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.869 
off because they do attack you quite
frequently<00:02:20.110> they<00:02:20.800> do<00:02:20.860> auto<00:02:21.129> attack<00:02:21.489> you<00:02:21.670> which

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
frequently they do auto attack you which

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.220 
frequently they do auto attack you which
could<00:02:22.090> cause<00:02:22.269> you<00:02:22.450> just<00:02:22.599> like<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.870> right<00:02:22.989> there

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
could cause you just like it right there

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.990 
could cause you just like it right there
to<00:02:23.920> get<00:02:24.010> away<00:02:24.220> from<00:02:24.280> your<00:02:24.459> loot<00:02:24.640> so<00:02:24.849> if<00:02:24.940> you

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
to get away from your loot so if you

it<00:02:31.900> for<00:02:31.989> about<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.290> minute<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.739> already<00:02:32.860> have

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
it for about a minute and already have

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.979 
it for about a minute and already have
this<00:02:33.220> many<00:02:33.400> horns<00:02:33.640> so<00:02:33.910> it's<00:02:34.209> very<00:02:34.540> very<00:02:34.780> fast

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
this many horns so it's very very fast

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.690 
this many horns so it's very very fast
especially<00:02:35.319> because<00:02:35.800> these<00:02:35.980> black<00:02:36.220> unicorns

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
especially because these black unicorns

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.089 
especially because these black unicorns
have<00:02:36.819> such<00:02:37.120> low<00:02:37.330> HP<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:37.930> I'll<00:02:38.709> be<00:02:38.860> right<00:02:38.980> back

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
have such low HP and I'll be right back

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.620 
have such low HP and I'll be right back
once<00:02:39.430> i<00:02:39.519> have<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:39.670> full<00:02:39.849> inventory<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.480> then

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
once i have a full inventory and then

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.000 
once i have a full inventory and then
we'll<00:02:40.780> calculate<00:02:41.049> how<00:02:41.410> much<00:02:41.530> money<00:02:41.769> per<00:02:41.920> hour

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
we'll calculate how much money per hour

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.640 
we'll calculate how much money per hour
we're<00:02:42.250> making<00:02:42.519> and<00:02:43.420> you<00:02:44.140> might<00:02:44.290> run<00:02:44.410> into<00:02:44.470> a

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
we're making and you might run into a

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.229 
we're making and you might run into a
slight<00:02:44.920> problem<00:02:45.129> as<00:02:45.400> i<00:02:45.610> have<00:02:45.790> while<00:02:46.030> killing

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
slight problem as i have while killing

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.580 
slight problem as i have while killing
these<00:02:46.390> things<00:02:46.630> is<00:02:46.840> they<00:02:46.989> almost<00:02:47.140> do<00:02:47.440> not

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
these things is they almost do not

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.470 
these things is they almost do not
respond<00:02:47.980> fast<00:02:48.250> enough<00:02:48.400> there<00:02:49.030> are<00:02:49.180> four<00:02:49.390> to

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
respond fast enough there are four to

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.180 
respond fast enough there are four to
five<00:02:49.630> black<00:02:49.870> unicorns<00:02:50.380> in<00:02:50.500> this<00:02:50.680> area<00:02:51.010> and

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
five black unicorns in this area and

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.650 
five black unicorns in this area and
they<00:02:51.250> almost<00:02:51.430> don't<00:02:51.730> respond<00:02:52.120> fast<00:02:52.390> enough<00:02:52.510> so

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
they almost don't respond fast enough so

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.120 
they almost don't respond fast enough so
we're<00:02:53.260> going<00:02:53.349> to<00:02:53.440> check<00:02:53.590> out<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:53.829> relic<00:02:54.069> of

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
unicorn I have to kill and the only

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.339 
unicorn I have to kill and the only
problem<00:03:06.370> is<00:03:06.430> I<00:03:06.489> am<00:03:06.700> running<00:03:06.880> into<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.510> the

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
problem is I am running into the the

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.170 
problem is I am running into the the
problem<00:03:08.769> of<00:03:08.860> I<00:03:09.069> can<00:03:09.190> only<00:03:09.310> attack<00:03:09.579> one<00:03:09.849> at<00:03:09.970> once

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
problem of I can only attack one at once

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.430 
problem of I can only attack one at once
so<00:03:10.390> I<00:03:10.420> would<00:03:10.630> recommend<00:03:10.660> turning<00:03:11.230> your

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
so I would recommend turning your

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.170 
so I would recommend turning your
multi-way<00:03:11.860> combat<00:03:12.280> on<00:03:12.370> that<00:03:12.579> way<00:03:12.700> can<00:03:12.760> attack

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
multi-way combat on that way can attack

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.910 
multi-way combat on that way can attack
multiple<00:03:13.420> of<00:03:13.690> these<00:03:13.750> unicorns<00:03:14.200> at<00:03:14.500> once<00:03:14.709> and

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
multiple of these unicorns at once and

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.770 
multiple of these unicorns at once and
that<00:03:15.790> is<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.030> last<00:03:16.060> one<00:03:16.420> I<00:03:16.450> believe<00:03:16.690> my

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
that is the last one I believe my

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.240 
that is the last one I believe my
unicorn<00:03:17.170> horn<00:03:17.349> is<00:03:17.470> over<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:17.739> my<00:03:17.799> left<00:03:17.829> and

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
unicorn horn is over to my left and

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.800 
unicorn horn is over to my left and
we're<00:03:18.970> going<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.120> tell<00:03:19.269> you<00:03:19.359> back<00:03:19.480> real<00:03:19.780> fast

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
we're going to tell you back real fast

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.990 
we're going to tell you back real fast
that<00:03:20.200> took<00:03:20.500> me<00:03:20.620> exactly<00:03:20.980> five<00:03:21.280> minutes<00:03:21.489> and<00:03:21.700> 30

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
that took me exactly five minutes and 30

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.400 
that took me exactly five minutes and 30
seconds<00:03:22.389> but<00:03:22.510> we're<00:03:22.630> going<00:03:22.720> to<00:03:22.810> add<00:03:22.989> it<00:03:23.200> all

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
seconds but we're going to add it all

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.979 
seconds but we're going to add it all
the<00:03:23.769> way<00:03:23.859> up<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.010> six<00:03:24.459> minutes<00:03:24.609> for<00:03:25.209> I<00:03:25.720> believe

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
the way up to six minutes for I believe

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.080 
the way up to six minutes for I believe
the<00:03:26.410> total<00:03:26.769> time<00:03:27.220> it<00:03:27.400> took<00:03:27.549> to<00:03:27.609> do<00:03:27.910> that

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
the total time it took to do that

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.090 
the total time it took to do that
because<00:03:28.209> taking<00:03:29.079> the<00:03:29.170> time<00:03:29.380> into<00:03:29.650> account<00:03:29.920> of

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
because taking the time into account of

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.949 
because taking the time into account of
running<00:03:30.670> back<00:03:30.819> there<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.299> then<00:03:31.389> quickly

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
running back there and then quickly

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.620 
running back there and then quickly
banking<00:03:32.470> back<00:03:32.650> here<00:03:32.950> so<00:03:33.160> that's<00:03:33.700> exactly<00:03:34.120> 10

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
banking back here so that's exactly 10

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.910 
banking back here so that's exactly 10
inventories<00:03:35.230> we're<00:03:35.350> going<00:03:35.470> to<00:03:35.530> say<00:03:35.739> and

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
inventories we're going to say and

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.680 
inventories we're going to say and
that's<00:03:36.040> going<00:03:36.310> full<00:03:36.549> floor<00:03:36.880> skies<00:03:37.239> so<00:03:37.480> 10

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
that's going full floor skies so 10

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.990 
that's going full floor skies so 10
inventories<00:03:38.260> per<00:03:38.470> hour<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:38.950> I<00:03:39.549> think<00:03:39.880> this

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
inventories per hour and I think this

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.849 
inventories per hour and I think this
could<00:03:40.239> be<00:03:40.389> a<00:03:40.420> 1<00:03:40.840> mil<00:03:41.049> plus<00:03:41.200> money-making<00:03:41.739> per

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
could be a 1 mil plus money-making per

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:42.780 
could be a 1 mil plus money-making per
hour<00:03:41.950> we're<00:03:42.160> going<00:03:42.190> to<00:03:42.340> price<00:03:42.489> check<00:03:42.700> this

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
but it does already look like there's

but it does already look like there's
less<00:04:28.480> unicorns<00:04:29.020> in<00:04:29.140> a<00:04:29.260> spot<00:04:29.530> but<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:29.920> farther

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
you go down there are a few more so the

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.410 
you go down there are a few more so the
only<00:04:32.710> yellow<00:04:33.460> dots<00:04:33.700> you'll<00:04:33.940> see<00:04:34.120> in<00:04:34.300> these

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420
