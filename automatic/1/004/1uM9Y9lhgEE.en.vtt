00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
so it would give them a little bit of a

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.920 
so it would give them a little bit of a
head<00:01:26.100> start<00:01:26.130> if<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.270> true<00:01:27.299> which<00:01:27.810> of

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
stage now I for one was fairly surprised

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.600 
stage now I for one was fairly surprised
when<00:01:33.840> Microsoft<00:01:34.350> did<00:01:34.560> not<00:01:34.860> announce<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
when Microsoft did not announce the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.210 
when Microsoft did not announce the
release<00:01:35.759> date<00:01:36.150> for<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.659> Xbox<00:01:37.049> one<00:01:37.290> during

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
release date for the Xbox one during

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.460 
release date for the Xbox one during
their<00:01:38.400> conference<00:01:39.060> at<00:01:39.329> Gamescom<00:01:40.170> and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
their conference at Gamescom and

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.710 
their conference at Gamescom and
especially<00:01:41.130> since<00:01:41.579> they<00:01:41.790> had<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.240> keynote

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
especially since they had a keynote

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.499 
especially since they had a keynote
speech<00:01:42.750> from<00:01:43.439> phil<00:01:43.829> spencer<00:01:44.310> as<00:01:44.700> well<00:01:44.880> i<00:01:45.090> was

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
speech from phil spencer as well i was

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.200 
speech from phil spencer as well i was
fully<00:01:45.689> expecting<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:46.530> release<00:01:46.829> date<00:01:46.860> reveal<00:01:47.430> so

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
fully expecting a release date reveal so

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.819 
fully expecting a release date reveal so
it's<00:01:48.450> entirely<00:01:48.899> possible<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.530> they<00:01:49.770> were

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
it's entirely possible that they were

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.280 
it's entirely possible that they were
waiting<00:01:50.100> for<00:01:50.399> sony<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.210> revealed<00:01:51.540> every<00:01:51.930> state

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
waiting for sony to revealed every state

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.800 
waiting for sony to revealed every state
so<00:01:52.920> they<00:01:53.130> could<00:01:53.490> try<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.119> get<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.420> job<00:01:54.630> from

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
so they could try and get the job from

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.590 
so they could try and get the job from
them<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> little<00:01:55.290> bit<00:01:55.610> now<00:01:56.610> obviously<00:01:56.759> they<00:01:57.420> did

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
them a little bit now obviously they did

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.929 
them a little bit now obviously they did
release<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.049> xbox<00:01:58.380> 360<00:01:58.920> before<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.369> ps3

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
release the xbox 360 before the ps3

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.959 
release the xbox 360 before the ps3
which<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.210> could<00:02:00.390> arguably<00:02:00.990> say<00:02:01.579> gave<00:02:02.579> them<00:02:02.850> a

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
which you could arguably say gave them a

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.569 
which you could arguably say gave them a
some<00:02:03.560> advantage<00:02:04.560> in<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:04.920> particular

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
some advantage in that particular

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.089 
some advantage in that particular
