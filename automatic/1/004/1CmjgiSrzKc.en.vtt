most expensive player in this squad 89
pace<00:03:08.440> which<00:03:08.980> is<00:03:09.130> obviously<00:03:09.400> very<00:03:09.460> very<00:03:09.850> good

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
pace which is obviously very very good

92<00:03:10.990> dribbling<00:03:11.500> not<00:03:11.740> much<00:03:11.890> of<00:03:12.010> a<00:03:12.040> shot<00:03:12.280> on<00:03:12.370> him

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.490 
92 dribbling not much of a shot on him
really<00:03:13.330> unless<00:03:13.750> he<00:03:13.930> probably<00:03:14.110> got<00:03:14.290> like<00:03:14.440> a

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
really unless he probably got like a

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.930 
really unless he probably got like a
team<00:03:14.740> the<00:03:14.890> season<00:03:15.250> which<00:03:15.370> was<00:03:15.490> a<00:03:15.520> lot<00:03:15.790> higher

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
team the season which was a lot higher

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.760 
team the season which was a lot higher
rated<00:03:16.390> so<00:03:16.720> I<00:03:16.780> wouldn't<00:03:17.020> recommend<00:03:17.230> shooting

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
rated so I wouldn't recommend shooting

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.250

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
too much with unless is obvious but

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.960 
too much with unless is obvious but

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
my opinion of pretty much every squad on

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.260 
my opinion of pretty much every squad on
the<00:03:59.080> left<00:03:59.709> hand<00:03:59.860> side<00:03:59.980> we<00:04:00.250> to<00:04:00.430> have<00:04:00.670> a<00:04:00.730> very

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
the left hand side we to have a very

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.340 
the left hand side we to have a very
good<00:04:01.450> player<00:04:01.630> and<00:04:01.780> something<00:04:02.050> I'm<00:04:02.170> not<00:04:02.290> used

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
good player and something I'm not used

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.220 
good player and something I'm not used
as<00:04:02.770> i<00:04:03.280> said<00:04:03.459> before<00:04:03.780> actually<00:04:04.780> very<00:04:04.930> very<00:04:04.959> good

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
as i said before actually very very good

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.979 
as i said before actually very very good
and<00:04:05.380> that<00:04:05.500> can<00:04:05.709> be<00:04:05.740> Benzema<00:04:06.310> lacks<00:04:07.120> a<00:04:07.330> yard<00:04:07.810> of

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
and that can be Benzema lacks a yard of

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.110 
and that can be Benzema lacks a yard of
pace<00:04:08.260> in<00:04:08.590> my<00:04:08.830> opinion<00:04:09.160> so<00:04:09.400> if<00:04:09.489> you<00:04:09.610> can<00:04:09.940> afford

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
pace in my opinion so if you can afford

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.780 
pace in my opinion so if you can afford
i<00:04:10.510> think<00:04:10.840> he's<00:04:10.989> got<00:04:11.020> a<00:04:11.170> second<00:04:11.530> informal<00:04:11.950> 86<00:04:12.550> it

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
i think he's got a second informal 86 it

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.750 
i think he's got a second informal 86 it
would<00:04:13.270> be<00:04:13.420> a<00:04:13.450> real<00:04:14.140> upgrade<00:04:14.650> I<00:04:14.890> just<00:04:15.340> needed<00:04:15.580> to

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
would be a real upgrade I just needed to

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.460 
would be a real upgrade I just needed to
have<00:04:15.880> sort<00:04:16.060> of<00:04:16.090> a<00:04:16.209> few<00:04:16.390> more<00:04:16.480> pace<00:04:16.750> and<00:04:17.020> it

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
have sort of a few more pace and it

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.229 
have sort of a few more pace and it
would<00:04:17.590> then<00:04:17.739> sort<00:04:18.160> of<00:04:18.220> let<00:04:18.489> you<00:04:18.580> use<00:04:18.940> his<00:04:19.060> good

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
would then sort of let you use his good

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.969 
would then sort of let you use his good
finishing<00:04:19.660> these<00:04:19.780> got<00:04:20.049> is<00:04:20.200> dribbling<00:04:20.530> fairly

in this game I still can defend but I

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:52.570 
in this game I still can defend but I
found<00:04:51.710> a<00:04:51.770> lot<00:04:51.889> of<00:04:51.919> the<00:04:52.009> games<00:04:52.129> I<00:04:52.340> was<00:04:52.430> letting

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
found a lot of the games I was letting

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.010 
found a lot of the games I was letting
in<00:04:52.729> three<00:04:53.030> goals<00:04:53.270> it's<00:04:53.509> going<00:04:53.720> to<00:04:53.780> make<00:04:53.870> the

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
in three goals it's going to make the

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.930 
in three goals it's going to make the
extra<00:04:54.289> time<00:04:54.470> I<00:04:54.740> was<00:04:54.919> ended<00:04:55.190> up<00:04:55.280> win<00:04:55.550> the<00:04:55.729> games

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
extra time I was ended up win the games

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.670 
extra time I was ended up win the games
but<00:04:56.479> I've<00:04:56.599> felt<00:04:56.840> that<00:04:56.960> way<00:04:57.020> if<00:04:57.139> I'd<00:04:57.319> have<00:04:57.500> had<00:04:57.530> a

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
but I've felt that way if I'd have had a

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.950 
but I've felt that way if I'd have had a
fall<00:04:58.009> back<00:04:58.219> against<00:04:58.699> the<00:04:58.879> same<00:04:59.090> perp<00:04:59.360> opponent

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
fall back against the same perp opponent

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.559 
fall back against the same perp opponent
I<00:05:00.080> would<00:05:00.469> probably<00:05:00.560> one<00:05:00.860> easier<00:05:01.270> if<00:05:02.270> you<00:05:02.419> can

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:02.569 
I would probably one easier if you can

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
extremely good Hernandez probably being

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.149 
extremely good Hernandez probably being
the<00:05:56.300> better<00:05:56.509> one<00:05:56.750> of<00:05:56.870> the<00:05:56.990> pair<00:05:57.229> Benzema's

00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:58.159 
the better one of the pair Benzema's

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:00.249 
the better one of the pair Benzema's
definitely<00:05:58.520> more<00:05:58.669> clinical<00:05:59.300> and<00:05:59.479> but<00:05:59.960> as<00:06:00.139> I

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:00.259 
definitely more clinical and but as I

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:01.749 
definitely more clinical and but as I
said<00:06:00.319> before<00:06:00.469> he<00:06:00.740> does<00:06:00.919> like<00:06:01.099> a<00:06:01.129> little<00:06:01.580> bit<00:06:01.699> of

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 
said before he does like a little bit of

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:03.850 
said before he does like a little bit of
pace<00:06:02.000> and<00:06:02.270> that<00:06:02.509> amanda<00:06:03.139> soares<00:06:03.319> a<00:06:03.500> lot

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
pace and that amanda soares a lot

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:04.990 
pace and that amanda soares a lot
quicker<00:06:04.099> I<00:06:04.250> think<00:06:04.430> you<00:06:04.490> must<00:06:04.610> have<00:06:04.729> a<00:06:04.819> lot<00:06:04.940> of

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
quicker I think you must have a lot of

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.999 
quicker I think you must have a lot of
air<00:06:05.120> acceleration<00:06:05.750> on<00:06:05.870> sound<00:06:06.080> like<00:06:06.169> that<00:06:06.379> but

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:07.009 
air acceleration on sound like that but

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:08.709 
air acceleration on sound like that but
if<00:06:07.099> you've<00:06:07.219> got<00:06:07.340> vents<00:06:07.550> Emma<00:06:07.759> second<00:06:08.150> inform<00:06:08.539> I

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:08.719 
if you've got vents Emma second inform I

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:10.689 
if you've got vents Emma second inform I
think<00:06:08.960> you'll<00:06:09.050> be<00:06:09.169> a<00:06:09.199> lot<00:06:09.500> better<00:06:09.710> they're

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:10.699 
think you'll be a lot better they're

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:12.309 
think you'll be a lot better they're
extra<00:06:11.029> stats<00:06:11.270> make<00:06:11.509> a<00:06:11.539> big<00:06:11.719> difference<00:06:11.930> the

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:12.319
