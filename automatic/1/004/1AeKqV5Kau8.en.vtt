I like to do it at high tide that's the

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:19.149 
I like to do it at high tide that's the
best<00:05:16.440> time<00:05:16.650> the<00:05:16.889> tires<00:05:17.099> got<00:05:17.400> quite<00:05:17.639> low<00:05:17.849> now

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:19.159 
best time the tires got quite low now

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:23.689 
best time the tires got quite low now
we'll<00:05:20.159> see<00:05:20.340> how<00:05:20.400> I<00:05:20.460> go<00:05:21.620> easy<00:05:22.620> to<00:05:22.889> spot<00:05:23.370> I<00:05:23.430> like

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
we'll see how I go easy to spot I like

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:28.339 
we'll see how I go easy to spot I like
to<00:05:23.849> go<00:05:24.000> and<00:05:24.860> shallow<00:05:25.860> bit<00:05:26.159> low<00:05:26.280> tide<00:05:27.199> seems<00:05:28.199> to

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349 
to go and shallow bit low tide seems to

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:29.870 
to go and shallow bit low tide seems to
be<00:05:28.470> more<00:05:28.680> consistent<00:05:29.070> with<00:05:29.340> the<00:05:29.520> shallower

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
be more consistent with the shallower

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.510 
be more consistent with the shallower
water<00:05:30.500> birds<00:05:31.500> are<00:05:31.710> behind<00:05:31.979> that<00:05:32.070> because<00:05:32.400> the

water birds are behind that because the

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.990 
water birds are behind that because the
fish<00:05:32.699> and<00:05:32.849> chip<00:05:33.000> shops<00:05:33.270> next<00:05:33.570> door<00:05:34.729> the<00:05:35.729> trap

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
fish and chip shops next door the trap

00:05:36.000 --> 00:06:02.030

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.090 

squishing<00:06:03.040> me<00:06:03.130> to<00:06:03.190> bread<00:06:03.460> up<00:06:03.610> tracking

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100
