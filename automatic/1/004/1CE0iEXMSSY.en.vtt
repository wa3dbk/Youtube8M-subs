00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
a method of downgrading that the dev

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.420 
a method of downgrading that the dev
team<00:01:06.900> does<00:01:07.110> make<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.650> will<00:01:07.950> be<00:01:08.100> able<00:01:08.220> to

mean in many cases the dev team does
release<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> downgrade<00:01:12.030> later<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.510> when<00:01:12.750> there

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
release a downgrade later on when there

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.870 
release a downgrade later on when there
is<00:01:12.960> no<00:01:13.140> jailbreak<00:01:13.380> but<00:01:14.100> many<00:01:14.310> people<00:01:14.670> do<00:01:14.850> not

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
is no jailbreak but many people do not

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.300 
is no jailbreak but many people do not

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
have their sh sh blobs so it's very

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.300 
have their sh sh blobs so it's very
important<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.180> do<00:01:18.420> save<00:01:18.810> them<00:01:19.080> now<00:01:20.040> only

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
important that you do save them now only

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.640 
important that you do save them now only
one<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> five<00:01:21.240> exploits<00:01:21.780> used<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.259> evasion

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
one of the five exploits used in evasion

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.649 
one of the five exploits used in evasion
has<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.100> far<00:01:23.369> been<00:01:23.430> patched<00:01:23.820> which<00:01:24.210> gives<00:01:24.509> me

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
has so far been patched which gives me

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.510 
has so far been patched which gives me
some<00:01:24.869> hope<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.350> pontu<00:01:25.799> g<00:01:26.009> did<00:01:26.250> say<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
some hope and pontu g did say the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.960 
some hope and pontu g did say the
following

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
following

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.660 
following
basically<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:28.170> one<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.680> five<00:01:28.890> exploits<00:01:29.460> is

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
basically if one of the five exploits is

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.359 
basically if one of the five exploits is
patched<00:01:29.970> evasion<00:01:30.840> will<00:01:31.020> not<00:01:31.290> work<00:01:31.619> now<00:01:32.189> if

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
patched evasion will not work now if

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.460 
patched evasion will not work now if
many<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.790> them<00:01:32.939> are<00:01:33.150> left<00:01:33.390> on<00:01:33.630> patch<00:01:33.840> then<00:01:34.200> it's

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
many of them are left on patch then it's

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.899 
many of them are left on patch then it's
possible<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:34.979> we<00:01:35.100> could<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.490> jailbreak

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
possible that we could have a jailbreak

fairly<00:01:36.360> soon<00:01:36.740> unfortunately<00:01:37.740> apple<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.280> not

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
fairly soon unfortunately apple is not

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.640 
fairly soon unfortunately apple is not

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
around in high OS so they will probably

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.149 
around in high OS so they will probably
patch<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.229> we'll<00:01:43.320> have<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.560> wait<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.770> long

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
patch a and we'll have to wait a long

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
time for a jailbreak unfortunately but

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.319 
time for a jailbreak unfortunately but
he<00:01:46.770> did<00:01:46.950> say<00:01:47.159> he<00:01:47.369> will<00:01:47.549> not<00:01:47.579> give<00:01:48.030> up<00:01:48.149> he'll

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
he did say he will not give up he'll

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.060 
he did say he will not give up he'll
start<00:01:48.630> from<00:01:48.780> scratch<00:01:49.020> if<00:01:49.320> he<00:01:49.439> does<00:01:49.649> have<00:01:49.860> to

start from scratch if he does have to
well<00:01:50.790> that's<00:01:51.090> my<00:01:51.360> update<00:01:51.509> for<00:01:51.930> all<00:01:52.079> the

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
well that's my update for all the

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.380 
well that's my update for all the
jailbreakers<00:01:52.829> out<00:01:53.009> there<00:01:53.220> basically<00:01:53.700> do<00:01:54.119> not

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
jailbreakers out there basically do not

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.120 
jailbreakers out there basically do not
update<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.200> upcoming<00:01:55.560> firmware

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
update to the upcoming firmware

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.429 
update to the upcoming firmware
inevitably<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.180> will<00:01:57.479> remove<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.020> evasion

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
inevitably it will remove the evasion

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.050 
inevitably it will remove the evasion
jailbreak<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.310> you'll<00:01:59.430> be<00:01:59.549> stuck<00:01:59.850> playing
