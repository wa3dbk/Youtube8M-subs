00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
all for this a few cool patterns to

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.240 
all for this a few cool patterns to
collect<00:02:34.820> but<00:02:35.820> it<00:02:36.690> works<00:02:36.930> like<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.709> you<00:02:38.100> just

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
collect but it works like this you just

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.310 
collect but it works like this you just
fold<00:02:38.519> it<00:02:38.670> over<00:02:38.760> like<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.840> can<00:02:39.989> fold<00:02:40.170> it

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
fold it over like this you can fold it

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.860 
fold it over like this you can fold it
over<00:02:40.380> whichever<00:02:40.769> way<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.070> want<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.580> cat<00:02:42.510> side

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
over whichever way you want the cat side

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.350 
over whichever way you want the cat side
or<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.320> green<00:02:43.530> side<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:45.260> then<00:02:46.260> all<00:02:46.560> you<00:02:46.860> do<00:02:47.040> is

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
or the green side and then all you do is

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.259 
or the green side and then all you do is
thread<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.510> through<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.900> hole<00:02:49.110> here<00:02:49.760> like<00:02:50.760> so

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
thread it through the hole here like so

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.490 
thread it through the hole here like so
and<00:02:52.550> you<00:02:53.550> have<00:02:53.819> a<00:02:54.060> throw<00:02:54.480> on<00:02:54.660> any<00:02:54.900> go<00:02:55.110> outside

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
and you have a throw on any go outside

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.229 
and you have a throw on any go outside
and<00:02:55.830> you<00:02:56.130> throw<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:56.790> it<00:02:56.880> goes<00:02:57.030> pretty

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
and you throw that and it goes pretty

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.100 
and you throw that and it goes pretty
far<00:02:57.510> as<00:02:57.690> well<00:02:57.900> trust<00:02:58.230> me<00:02:58.319> on<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.680> one<00:02:59.989> so<00:03:00.989> yeah
