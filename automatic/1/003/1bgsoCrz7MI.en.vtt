00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.990
 disease this graffiti 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.259
 let's go here we go in diaries about saving 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.259
 as 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:19.870

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.870
 they put to the test 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.750
 one overflow we're missing here and we're going to 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.750

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:36.010

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.010
 error without problem 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.819
 and they close them and open the counter strike 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.470
 now we go to each option where as 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:03:00.020
 seraphim and see from here to here 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.560
 good project once having the cam 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:08.420
 we can change the colors of the in 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:11.030
 is going to put employment opens now it's going 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.180
 showing a new game what it is for 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.180
 0 meter fast so because demand comes 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.450
 on the way to the purely 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.450
 original 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:28.670
 we are a little because he was a boy 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.670
 that this will not happen 

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:49.210
 10 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:54.210
 because this traficamos perform that 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.210
 go more or less like that it depends on the graffiti 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.790
 it depends on how you do it as well as how 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.110
 with things but if you do well the 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:07.409
 quality arias time to start 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.409
 and good 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.450
