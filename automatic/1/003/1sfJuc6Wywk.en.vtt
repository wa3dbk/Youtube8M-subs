is<00:01:16.710> going<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.159> Russia<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:18.110> we<00:01:19.110> have<00:01:19.229> put<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.680> a

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
is going to Russia so we have put in a

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.670 
is going to Russia so we have put in a
voltage<00:01:20.400> converter<00:01:20.700> into<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.299> bottom<00:01:21.689> they

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
voltage converter into the bottom they

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.440 
voltage converter into the bottom they
convert<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.040> voltage<00:01:23.280> over<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.150> think

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
convert the voltage over to the I think

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.210 
convert the voltage over to the I think
it's<00:01:24.630> 240<00:01:25.229> there

from shaking the machine if they shake

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.020 
from shaking the machine if they shake
it<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.470> game<00:01:46.680> shuts<00:01:47.009> down<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.520> they<00:01:47.610> lose<00:01:47.790> the

shape<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.840> cleaned<00:01:52.170> all<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.409> connectors<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
shape we cleaned all the connectors the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.580 
shape we cleaned all the connectors the
edge<00:01:53.280> connectors<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.930> volume<00:01:55.290> pot

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
edge connectors on that the volume pot

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.740 
edge connectors on that the volume pot
so<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.640> can<00:01:56.790> turn<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.090> volume<00:01:57.210> up<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.600> down

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
so you can turn the volume up and down

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.810 
so you can turn the volume up and down
it's<00:01:58.409> nice<00:01:58.649> because<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.159> can<00:01:59.189> actually<00:01:59.460> reach

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
it's nice because you can actually reach

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.219 
it's nice because you can actually reach
