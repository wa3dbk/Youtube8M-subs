00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.709
 the c class is the most important model 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.779
 Mercedes benz worldwide have been over

 matching the c-class t-model 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.210
 the world premiere does not catch on 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.399
 one of the international automobiles 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.500
 or in a large metropolis of these 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:30.770
 world place but in the mercedes-factory in 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.770
 Bremen 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:37.470
 bremen is our competence center for 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.680
 we have the c-class here from bremen 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.110
 The launch is permitted by limousine 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.010
 from here we coordinate our in 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.770
 sum four production sites bremen 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:53.460
 South Africa Tuscaloosa in America and in 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.320
 waging the t model of the c class is running 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.239
 but only here in bremen 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.100
 from the bank when joining the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.440
 Body come latest process 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.110
 optimized painting technology for use 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.820
 also contributes to the high proportion 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.730
 in that the energy consumption per 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.100
 Vehicle over production during production 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.320
 We were able to reduce 30 percent 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.909
 the journalists present have after 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.909
 asked her first impression 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.600
 i'm a t-model fan and chic anyway 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.900
 elegant I would say great 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.850
 line guidance and incredibly practical 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.909
 thinking position out of you really nice 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.800
 Combinations 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.240
 the luggage space is indeed just a bit 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.920
 got bigger with me personally 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.409
 like but they still come 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.950
 better clear variability that is 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.420
 available 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.009
 I can drive with four people to 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.000
 Example laminate shopping or something 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.580
 leave overrun 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.420
 that makes for me in the combination of high 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.160
 Usability and city ​​guide fantastic 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.470
 as with the limousine, there are also 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.659
 t model a sporty variant with 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.659
 stars cooler and second diesel 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.759
 versions the classic front the 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.520
 redesign of interieur is great 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.530
 that much tidier a lot more breezy away 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.890
 I think with the whole club deserts 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.720
 just nice to them says the new combinatorial what 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.760
 a premium manufacturer 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.310
 high quality materials determine that 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.209
 ambiente also functionality is a 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.209
 big topic 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.100
 a very big one again 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.160
 trunk space which many families with 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:37.230
 Children is important is just easy to 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:41.080
 operate by pressing the button 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.810
 three-part rest completely variable flaps 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.210
 can be big or big depending on me 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.560
 I want to insert a piece of luggage 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:53.230
 Elegant foot kick open the loading door 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.760
 like sesam open and you can use it 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.710
 without settling my luggage invite 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.080
 By consistent lightweight construction alone 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.640
 the body will be 50 kilograms 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.520
 weight saved and through 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.990
 highly efficient engines up to 20 percent 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.480
 less fuel consumed 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.180
 Fuel saving champion here is the c 300 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.500
 bluetec diesel hybrid with one 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.790
 average standard consumption of 3.8 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.790
 liters at 100 kilometers 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.590
 the c class has a special one 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.420
 meaning she is always the one 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.209
 series has been the largest 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.579
 stückzahl volume and thus have to 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.620
 spend a lot of effort here 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.260
 to secure this position we want 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.980
 continue massively with the c-class 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.840
 grow the planned plug in hybrid will 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.819
 certainly also contribute to that 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.819
 to continue the success of the c class
