00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:21.050
 Is a railroad crossing facility it provided at the intersection of line and the road 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:28.789
 It is a natural story, but in fact there was a very unknown past at the railroad crossing 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:31.410
 Do you know that there is a long way before the crossing ? First class second class third class 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:39.540
 It is divided into the fourth kind 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:44.190
 The first type is a level crossing with an alarm circuit breaker and the second type is driven by a circuit breaker. 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.380
 The third kind is the crossing of the alarm only. The fourth kind is 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.100
 clothes 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:54.940
 Please 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:01:01.930
 Well, let's go back to the main topic. In order to talk about it, we will go back to the railway opening 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:10.990
 Japan's construction of a railway was an unknown world never done before 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:11.590
 It 's like when you start a guitar that you've never said so, so ask for foreign cooperation 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.930
 The 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:21.140
 Japan chooses a country to cooperate with 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:27.230
 It 's like when you choose a guitar in a musical instrument store 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:34.950
 So is the other this exchange Akita and the fixed country 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:41.579
 At that time Britain developed a high-level locomotive and trained as the world's strongest country 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:49.799
 It's first railway large open country and the world was riding in the 4 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:50.880
 With the cooperation of the United Kingdom, it was officially opened on October 4 in 1872. 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.940
 Te of Zenzai 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:59.200
 Key 3 worth Valley Sekine railway in the United Kingdom 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:05.200
 Then there are steam locomotives and small diesel cars 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:08.709
 While I'm running, I changed a little to this railway 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:14.709
 There is a level crossing so it's about this 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:19.220
 When this railroad crossing train is coming in the measures to be first to Sen'nami blockade 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:26.630
 Train signal is made on whether the over and after such sequester the brain dew side 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:31.580
 Something that to fire the dyed train to N signal blue The railroad crossing is often used in the UK for a long time 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:39.210
 The type of level crossing you are not forgetting that you 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:47.760
 So the story of Japan 's railway opening agrees with the story of British railway crossing and railway improvement 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:50.790
 Japan is railways that Japan made this by having Britain cooperate 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:56.790
 It was this level crossing at the time of opening 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:59.200
 The speed of sl at that time may have been achieved just because I bought it 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.010
 But this story too white 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:08.020
 It is too much not cormorants Baka' is too small 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:12.310
 Has been used since the time of the railway opened Speaking of that can be seen 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:20.710
 Of course manual was used in combination with the photo number 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:24.860
 Bet premiere gut at the clerk of the railroad crossing is a wooden British people at that time the train of train driver in Japanese 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:33.620
 Will much had each other to signal using the 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:35.660
 However, this level crossing was not so long, and in 1894 the Sanyo Railway Kobe Hiroshima building 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.290
 In the wake of the appearance 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:42.800
 4 The era of high-speed trains has begun 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:49.400
 But if you work like that at a level crossing 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:55.650
 Since leading the train of delay or it will in this time is not came to a railroad crossing, such as the now 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:59.370
 This level crossing is when the Japanese railway opened, and it is a Japanese acculty 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:06.000
 It is no exaggeration to say that the level crossing that supported a 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:07.709
 However, it is forgotten that everyone can not confirm the existence without a document 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.300
 It is had 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.500
 When everyone to use the railroad crossing 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.500
 Remember this thing
