00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.049
 It's eh? 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.690
 s Ingredients are pork roe meat that I can not rely on 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:19.630
 is not it 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.890
 English pork rose meat uses a picture block and various children are in full swing 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.699
 I will handle it 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.150
 Today I am getting pork belly slices from where I can get a mouth anywhere 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:32.620
 Prepared 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.949
 That's right 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:36.220
 It's vegetables 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.920
 It was a film festival. 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.860
 It was yellowish 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.540
 After the peppers I fear the appetite of these three primary colors 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.010
 From 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.789
 I have put these three principles of vegetables and would like to make this 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:55.850
 I think 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.110
 It is not possible to rely on opposition meat pot meat 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.620
 It's cabbage 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.990
 After spring onion 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.300
 so 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.909
 It is garlic It is Nishimatsu garlic at a later meeting 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.460
 Better than 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.660
 after 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.910
 It is neglected. This is the case in the case that fermented that thing 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:15.820
 is not it 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.260
 mc Heikorou even if there is no rule if this rule does not enter 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.780
 Because it is easy 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.290
 If there is this, it means that the flavor is good 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.020
 Finally it is garlic, but garlic is also provided 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.170
 I think so 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.420
 You can do it this week without using garlic 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.320
 Then it is the next seasoning 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.030
 Food is very high 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.970
 a little 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.960
 I will say some more 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.960
 It is airfit pea plate bowl 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.729
 Overwhelming 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.310
 Half natural time 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.200
 Opposition this is alcohol 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.630
 Finally it is a little to do that used in that home to make the time 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.140
 As water will come out more and more, it will be condensed and condensed 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.569
 To 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.889
 To stab taste is going 

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.709
 Kunikoe himself 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:12.899
