 Accident sometimes directly with it 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.120
 Let's start with the APA SG Selters 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.610
 is it really lets her child through one 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.240
 talk about this bar our 40 SP Settings here plan one 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.270
 Quick access to things the wi-fi brightness 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.250
 and be processed in the evening to make free 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.850
 and others 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.340
 while up and change the brightness 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.340
 Processes can be stopped here 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.340

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.480
 other things 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.050
 it can even be too 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.700
 we continue with 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.910
 barrel 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.860
 benefit 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.190
 this effect 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.180
 as a Bayer, none is necessarily important 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.900
 but I think so 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.200
 she makes the operating system 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.340
 but a small effect already 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.610
 essential 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.470
 acceptable 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.290
 Enter supervisor 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.360
 just trigger beautiful effects 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.360
 take this perfect 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.270
 that's what they look like 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.070
 Jochen Schnecker watch 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.070
 Put me too much 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.820
 Mehmet lists 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.780
 How does it look like? 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.780
 or there are costs 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:13.109
 I want game could do little 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:16.759
 Divers I prefer quiet because you do not have to 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.339
 Horner is holding there are different hidden 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:25.539
 us-major continues with Cretz Klokow 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:27.659
 Rick Looker possible through 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:31.159
 the EEX on the homescreen and place where you want what was called world 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.329
 I can do it 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.329
 confirm here 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:40.360
 what we do what we normal children are not possible we know 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.589
 You can do more in series just like that 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:45.959
 Worms with quince loose 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.749

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:51.749
 the earthquakes Rottmann nobody 7 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.289
 Murder slightly more next app age 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:57.679
 that would be driven here 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:58.949
 Muth play Cie 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:01.359
 finally one 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.059
 and here is the fatigue 

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:05.389
 adjust 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.959
 by what actions at the moment all at the moment 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.880
 open network in multitasking 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.119
 Anholt 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:19.579
 The rest you normally have to press Mahler off the ground has become her 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.839
 the sound on a diet that seems in the minus 

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:24.789
 one is finished 

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:27.789
 and that is currently - IV I have more now 

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:30.379
 Remo Peachey 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:31.620

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.969
 by a long time all expanders rolled out of the band EM July casting I should do 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:40.229
 Brigitte Bunk Bathen 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.919
 Remund way in front of us 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:43.789
 Konz 

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:45.949
 want to watch 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.389
 everything ended 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.709
 very practical for me 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.229
 Runkel we want to continue with 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:57.399
 the last 11 I have been very important experience so far 

00:03:57.399 --> 00:03:58.739
 Danger 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.759
 and that would be 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:03.319
 Lauk info 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.009
 Logan here forgives Taliban here 

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:09.279

 it all fit Hanover where it is Mel Gibson 

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:19.649
 This list can also be applied to workers through things you can do 

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:20.939
 are still important 

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:23.270
 her husband is only recognizing bad 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.690
 maybe the opportunity may come from Investor Christian and others 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:30.419

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:39.520
 Oh no 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.779
 so far, it is practically round 

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:45.870
 because it completes low after the Dow a lot 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:52.620
 at my favorites myself 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.110
 with a quick break 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.460
 the second time comes and until next time with 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.940
