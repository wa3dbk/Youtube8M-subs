00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.500
 hello to all and welcome carrasso new tutorial that will be dedicated 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.420
 to use a pile of the actress mo'nique cage of French formations 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.910
 which we see apply we just have to find out in the 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.109
 latest features that have been added ap 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.830
 abb we have the opportunity to ask to add some relatively mixed 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:25.759
 to the consciences 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.710
 but we can also control some points of the track with the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.369
 then poses a priori sanaa ap ​​no interest except that when we end up 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.520
 with very complex characters 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.570
 of the type the model scrolls and well we realize that for expressions 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.300
 facial especially we need this stuff 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.490
 so here I am trying to be brief 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.180
 I write but it's very simple it would be armed there just for the needs 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.450
 of the demonstration that it is more visible 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.620
 the echo euros simply 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.120
 selected a number of weeks 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.250
 on lowland 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.010
 fujii push it back ohlins it will better see the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.359
 demonstration he creates a building that I divided in five hours 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.990
 so not in the first step and I'm going 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.990
 add to change their investments to the sphere 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.430
 So here I am not changing the amount of investment costs 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 just post it here 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.880
 the us mandelieu of stupidity there I said to myself 'I'm afraid of challenges like 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.359
 sedative but had already 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:27.229
 so we select but if we go into hard mode for them if his accomplices 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.510
 and displaced 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.510
 we realize that it's already 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.420
 So that's the first second stage attack 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.910
 we will select one of the points 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.430
 of the building 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.430
 to return the custom cursor points 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.550
 to add 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.130
 a frame 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.470
 and also she is standing 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.900
 I will be duplicated this frame 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.570
 I'm going to send it on the focused electricity the demonstration for 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.630
 a little bit more interesting 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.700
 a bit of my beauty what I created 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.700
 so apparently the tax 130 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:13.649
 we select matisse we will modify 11 points added reinforcements 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:15.209
 armature 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.209
 always has his world 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:20.879
 that is to say by mature 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.429
 and now 

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:25.429
 actually this bone 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.589
 ecti related automatically to this part of the game they were traveling one can 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:33.589
 call it like that of the building but this one to that part 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.730
 hard meshing the crisis that is to say that now if god 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.919
 bush the bonus 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:44.319
 we can clearly see the deformation that is caused by the part of 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.209
 autism is the pole 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.479
 nearby we will say 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:51.299
 and then if we see a little better and well it's that part that maybe goes 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.099
 deformed 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.099
 same thing here 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.079
 so it looks like nothing but the day when homework to caen do 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.019
 animations creates characters 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.249
 I hope that thousands of frames I am at peace 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:09.309
 even on face deformations for the nation 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:11.209
 the expressions of a face 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.079
 you will realize that it can make the only service and 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.369
 see you next time
