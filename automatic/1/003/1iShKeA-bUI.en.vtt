00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello to you all started again for 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.890
 camera and today i'll show you how 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.590
 create your crafting recipes minecraft 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.530
 naturally 1.8 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.440
 and my previous schemes as I tell you 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.109
 didn't work in multiplayer however this 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.420
 scheme to work in multiplayer just 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.189
 great also single-player 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.870
 calm you can set aside on your 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.450
 ships and brag to our players 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:33.200
 Well, let's see what I crafting 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.950
 already added this crafting want again 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.950
 bib 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.550
 ecr sheepskin 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.960
 to brighten the bib we need 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.460
 gossip 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.730
 i try a mean visit like this 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.010
 and throws us out of it 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.340
 type of workbench actually of course 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:07.620
 distributor 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:07.620
 and we already have chain mail 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.320
 also I added craft saddle 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.210
 Kravts it added already many 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.400
 modifications but why on modification 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.130
 when the carcass we can painfully on mounting 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.110
 she appears at all let's 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.340
 consider the mechanism mechanism on 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.710
 the surprise is simple 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.859
 on the radio watching the first team of him 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.850
 test for blogs command 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:41.630
 I think if you understand the command team 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.920
 then you are well if you do not know the concepts 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.319
 him on the mainland 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.310
 preferably English version because 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:50.210
 there is more useful information 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.180
 and write here 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.659
 so what to do in brief this command 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:02.960
 block 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:09.319
 he checks a similar one this one 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:11.569
 Here are all the parameters that are stored in all 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.410
 cells as it is called which side 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.720
 looks that is back they are named 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.489
 the same side looks the same 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.030
 IDI you are one Tajik 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:25.390
 minecraft without a penny. things then run 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.390
 such 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.470
 this is nothing but if it 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.870
 lay here things such survived 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.810
 series of others leaned this team 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.730
 a block that performs another 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.290
 a team that also phrases and does what 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.940
 she plans 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:50.670
 she clones this block 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.670
 first lessons and leaves 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.099
 and in this block we have already like others 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:59.840
 guess maybe Masha want to advance 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.150
 that is, this is how it is all right 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.599
 to work here could 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.760
 teams and clone a blog team data 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:10.310
 divers and then we wouldn't even have to 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.969
 fly out every well hello fine 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.969
 something of 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.620
 assigned 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.069
 it would look smoother but 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.659
 what plus of this is that it does not require 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:31.040
 absolutely stable that is if we 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.040
 just copy the schema 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.510
 look i just copied no 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.519
 The settings there are deaf by 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:04.970
 and put the same do not harm a thing for example 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:04.970
 3 shelves and at sunset depend on spam 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.280
 Nazarbek why me 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.450
 and look turned out we have this sawing 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.139
 but everything was fine even the aggregates 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.510
 there is such a wonderful cable 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.490
 you can repeat it all 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.910
 once and do as many colors as you like 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.389
 one workbench action the problem is that in 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.389
 usual workbench 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.760
 mikro let us have nothing displayed 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.430
 also we will not be what new craft 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:47.729
 will not be available that is we will not be able 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:51.320
 including here in our super skydex did not 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:54.060
 craft will be available and from the usual we 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.010
 often cons only sorry what if 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.650
 garcons 2 time all the time will have 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.090
 run on spawn where this super is 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.409
 workbench to brighten up anything 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.349
 special 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:07.949
 but I think if you think well, you can 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:10.559
 somehow fix it well and i have 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:13.390
