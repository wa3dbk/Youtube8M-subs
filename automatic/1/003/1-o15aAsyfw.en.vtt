 air quality in several neighborhoods in santo amaro, for example in the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.940
 south at this time the air quality is considered regular 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:16.560
 but we find that there is a city within the state where pollution is 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.039
 four times higher than in the capital 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.099
 São Paulo with 11 million inhabitants 6 million vehicles and 29 thousand

 at seven in the evening the level of prose dust is already at 61 micrograms per 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.110
 cubic meter of air 11 points says minsk in that the world organization of 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.230
 acceptable 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.880
 at 9 o'clock started very early olhanense points forward focus 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.750
 by the cane-field in some points the flames reach more than 5 meters in height 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.920
 here to facilitate the cane harvest 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.120
 to stop hunger and drought and with forrester cut the skin of 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.920
 workers like razor 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.380
 twenty minutes later 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.009
 the fire extinguished in the area the size of five blocks left over the cane and 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.140
 so did 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.950
 little by little the police start to fall like rain 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.230
 at midnight the air of bariri is already inadequate the index of thick dust 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.230

 at three in the morning jumped to 134 micrograms 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.640
 at 5 the respirator recorded the peak the thick dust reached 300 companies 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.260
 at the same time the worst index recorded in the nine monitoring stations of the 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.660
 air in são paulo was almost four times smaller so one side of the note zeroed 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.689
