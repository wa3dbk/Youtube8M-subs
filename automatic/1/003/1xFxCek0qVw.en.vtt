closed to open which I noticed right

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.310 
closed to open which I noticed right
right<00:00:46.010> away<00:00:46.220> it<00:00:46.370> it<00:00:47.299> takes<00:00:47.659> almost<00:00:47.900> like<00:00:48.199> no

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320

reverse<00:04:14.810> the<00:04:14.989> tip<00:04:15.169> down<00:04:15.349> even<00:04:15.680> though<00:04:15.829> there's

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.099 
reverse the tip down even though there's

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.779 
reverse the tip down even though there's
a<00:04:16.329> pivot<00:04:17.329> there<00:04:17.359> I<00:04:17.720> wondered<00:04:18.680> if<00:04:18.799> they<00:04:19.639> would

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
a pivot there I wondered if they would

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:23.980 
a pivot there I wondered if they would
if<00:04:20.750> they<00:04:20.810> may<00:04:21.470> be<00:04:21.530> considered<00:04:22.099> putting<00:04:22.990> making

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
if they may be considered putting making

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.480 
if they may be considered putting making
it<00:04:24.110> so<00:04:24.229> that<00:04:24.260> you<00:04:24.409> can<00:04:24.560> put<00:04:24.740> the<00:04:24.860> pocket<00:04:25.310> there

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
it so that you can put the pocket there

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.310 
it so that you can put the pocket there
since<00:04:25.729> the<00:04:25.820> pivot<00:04:26.599> screw<00:04:26.719> looks<00:04:26.990> to<00:04:27.110> be<00:04:27.229> the

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
since the pivot screw looks to be the

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.350 
since the pivot screw looks to be the
same<00:04:27.530> as<00:04:27.710> the

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
same as the

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.869 
same as the
true<00:04:28.840> but<00:04:29.050> perhaps<00:04:29.830> they<00:04:30.129> didn't<00:04:30.370> want<00:04:30.520> you

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:30.879 
true but perhaps they didn't want you

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:33.350 
true but perhaps they didn't want you
removing<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.419> pivot<00:04:31.780> screw<00:04:31.900> just<00:04:32.169> so<00:04:32.349> you<00:04:32.469> can

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
removing the pivot screw just so you can

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.149 
removing the pivot screw just so you can
move<00:04:34.360> the<00:04:34.479> pocket<00:04:34.870> clip<00:04:35.050> or<00:04:35.500> something<00:04:36.039> like

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:36.159 
move the pocket clip or something like

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:38.700 
move the pocket clip or something like
that<00:04:36.219> so<00:04:36.759> it<00:04:37.150> may<00:04:37.330> be<00:04:37.360> it<00:04:37.539> affects<00:04:38.289> the<00:04:38.469> way<00:04:38.590> it

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
that so it may be it affects the way it

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.059 
that so it may be it affects the way it
just<00:04:39.930> great<00:04:40.930> fit<00:04:41.139> and<00:04:41.289> finish<00:04:41.409> on<00:04:41.710> the

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:42.069 
just great fit and finish on the

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:45.209 
just great fit and finish on the
Polliwog<00:04:42.520> no<00:04:43.270> play<00:04:43.539> whatsoever<00:04:43.930> and<00:04:44.349> still

Polliwog no play whatsoever and still

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:48.209 
Polliwog no play whatsoever and still
very<00:04:45.490> smooth<00:04:45.909> opening<00:04:46.360> and<00:04:46.479> closing<00:04:46.659> I<00:04:47.219> really

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:48.219 
very smooth opening and closing I really

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:50.730 
very smooth opening and closing I really
like<00:04:48.340> the<00:04:48.460> ball<00:04:48.639> bearing<00:04:48.909> la<00:04:49.090> come<00:04:49.360> in<00:04:49.810> aside

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
like the ball bearing la come in aside

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.439 
like the ball bearing la come in aside
from<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:51.039> fact<00:04:51.099> that<00:04:51.340> it's<00:04:51.580> slightly<00:04:52.000> harder

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 
from the fact that it's slightly harder

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.219 
from the fact that it's slightly harder
to<00:04:52.569> close<00:04:52.810> in<00:04:52.990> the<00:04:53.050> access<00:04:53.409> lock<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:55.750> fit<00:04:56.020> in

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
to close in the access lock the fit in

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.059 
to close in the access lock the fit in
and<00:04:56.650> and<00:04:57.039> an<00:04:57.900> action<00:04:58.900> of<00:04:59.139> the<00:04:59.590> ball<00:04:59.620> bearing

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:00.069 
and and an action of the ball bearing

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:02.760 
and and an action of the ball bearing
locks<00:05:00.310> in<00:05:00.819> my<00:05:01.029> opinion<00:05:01.270> is<00:05:01.479> superior<00:05:01.810> to<00:05:02.020> to

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
locks in my opinion is superior to to

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.709 
locks in my opinion is superior to to
that<00:05:02.919> of<00:05:03.039> the<00:05:03.430> access<00:05:03.909> lock<00:05:04.090> the<00:05:04.270> access<00:05:04.569> lock

00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:04.719 
that of the access lock the access lock

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:10.290 
that of the access lock the access lock
does<00:05:05.729> it<00:05:06.729> does<00:05:08.580> make<00:05:09.580> it<00:05:09.699> easier<00:05:09.819> for<00:05:10.180> you<00:05:10.240> to

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
does it does make it easier for you to

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.969 
does it does make it easier for you to
close<00:05:10.509> because<00:05:10.779> it<00:05:11.080> just<00:05:11.259> scripts<00:05:11.620> a<00:05:11.740> little

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
close because it just scripts a little

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.279 
close because it just scripts a little
bit<00:05:12.099> better<00:05:12.360> than<00:05:13.360> the<00:05:13.509> ball<00:05:13.689> does<00:05:13.900> in<00:05:14.110> my

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
bit better than the ball does in my

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:15.779 
bit better than the ball does in my
opinion<00:05:14.560> at<00:05:14.740> least<00:05:14.770> I<00:05:15.009> know<00:05:15.159> I<00:05:15.279> know<00:05:15.490> others

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
opinion at least I know I know others

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.689 
opinion at least I know I know others
have<00:05:15.969> different<00:05:16.330> opinions<00:05:16.509> so<00:05:17.430> that's<00:05:18.430> just

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:18.699 
have different opinions so that's just

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:22.499 
have different opinions so that's just
how<00:05:19.509> I<00:05:19.539> feel<00:05:19.870> about<00:05:19.900> them<00:05:20.199> but<00:05:20.409> from<00:05:21.509> virtually

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:22.509 
how I feel about them but from virtually

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:26.610 
how I feel about them but from virtually
every<00:05:22.719> other<00:05:23.460> virtually<00:05:24.460> every<00:05:24.669> other<00:05:25.620> a

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
every other virtually every other a

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.369 
every other virtually every other a
standpoint<00:05:27.550> I<00:05:27.729> think<00:05:27.759> it's<00:05:28.120> it's<00:05:28.599> a<00:05:28.900> superior

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:29.379 
standpoint I think it's it's a superior

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:32.879 
standpoint I think it's it's a superior
lock<00:05:30.330> maybe<00:05:31.330> doesn't<00:05:31.629> look<00:05:31.750> quite<00:05:31.960> as<00:05:32.050> quite

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
lock maybe doesn't look quite as quite

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.279 
lock maybe doesn't look quite as quite
as<00:05:33.039> nice<00:05:33.520> as<00:05:33.789> the<00:05:34.060> access<00:05:34.690> lock<00:05:34.900> but<00:05:35.139> it's

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 
as nice as the access lock but it's

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:38.519 
as nice as the access lock but it's
easier<00:05:35.589> to<00:05:35.680> clean<00:05:35.919> and<00:05:36.750> is<00:05:37.750> basically<00:05:38.440> the

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:38.529 
easier to clean and is basically the

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:41.640 
easier to clean and is basically the
same<00:05:38.680> type<00:05:38.919> of<00:05:38.949> mechanism<00:05:39.159> so<00:05:39.960> yeah<00:05:40.960> hope<00:05:41.529> you

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
same type of mechanism so yeah hope you

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.200 
same type of mechanism so yeah hope you
