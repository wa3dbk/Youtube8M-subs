 Kiln results start a little 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.950
 horizontal bar and gather girlfriend 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.020
 I'm probably going to google 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.200
 when you starts to pull down rose 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.890
 arm you go down bend when you 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.009
 pass already absolutely below their leaves 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:09.450
 kick up do this very much 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:14.610
 gathered for a long time 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.830
 Going together a few and since it's easier 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.349
 total learn gainer for beginners 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.599
 try to learn to bring 0 then 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:28.500

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:30.480
 can also with the support of you too 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.100

 leave direct dozens 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.650
 I really have too little space here 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.760
 bring your arms down before 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.220
 earlier earlier then respectively 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:47.470
 Signal you already legs such here anybody 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:50.050
 put your hands down when your legs are about 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:54.030
 here at the same time do it this way 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.030
 cross wire and happen 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:03.319
 as soon as here we will have 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.420

 or for a t-shirt shorts 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.670
 when will you do because more often 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.769
 just as I try it again it twists 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.079
 because here is less than from montale 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:21.400
 here is essentially half but a little more 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:24.230
 than half so do with someone 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.629
 when you step back you don't pull 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.959
 your hands should be okay 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:32.750

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.709
 so that is, you just hang your hands on 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:44.250
 horizontal bar take the castle so that you do not 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:46.870
 frustrated the match itself how are you how are you doing 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.980
 do this very same swinging 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.860
 reasonably overwhelmed 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:54.030
 lift people here to here Sheet 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.030

 get down pull up your legs take 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.990
 Rob group, that is, you see where you are 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.220
 kicked your legs don't let go before 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.410
 time to fly away is not 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:11.840
 do not let go later than time to become 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:16.230
 look at the horizontal bar look I look at 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.459
 then lets go you saw your legs you 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.449
 must translate the vision on trial 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.449
 watch where you fly 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:24.240
 but 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.420
 let's 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.070
 you don't see a doctor 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.930
 Well, by type 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.150
 here 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.300
 that is, they started looking at the flight to their feet 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.849
 competition for fish is important 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.530
 see the floor because it means war 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:43.580
 will get lost in as i told 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:46.159
 principles of sex to learn double 2008 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.400
 I don’t remember for about a month 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:50.320
 coached only the buildup of the place 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.090
 Here I really came all day business 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.180
 buildup how much buildup saver 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.949
 after i got to it 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.250
 I'm just on the unreal how would 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:01.000
 automata here I just had it right away 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.910
 set on 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.220
 factory nowhere after 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.830
 landed to get here but this is because 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.570
 the fact that 1 worked so how would I 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.460
 I didn't have to think about him anywhere 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.190
 I was in a hurry to waste time 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.190
 that is why I advise you to approach 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.900
 properly train as I could without 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.730
 any risks that is learned today 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.310
 relate already two goals tried 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:25.410
 rejoice it is wrong again 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.380

 what are you going to behind as i showed then 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.030
 have to get together in the corner 1 + 0 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.860
 dried up I will become a liter of water it is necessary for 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.780
 two blanches if you barely baptize 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:44.000
 the plan will never work out 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:48.020
 and back you will not succeed it 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.620
 baptize need to teach success 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.620
 shows his swing 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.360
 plus you can control 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.950
 can be done at different distances 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.050
 depending on where you are 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.960
 sent their new policies that is 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.520
 the case will follow the legs 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.880
 accordingly if you let go of a piece 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.380
 well, that is, go there and go ahead 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.610
 let here you fly purely up 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.889
 look at can answer 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.219
 rules sobchak 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:24.219
 novikov 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:41.729
 learn to control plus 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.889
 work out if you would 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:49.070
 felt that it took 20 there
