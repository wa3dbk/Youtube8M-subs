but kind of use this as a little cleaner

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.800 
but kind of use this as a little cleaner
instead<00:02:30.739> of<00:02:30.890> an<00:02:31.069> actual<00:02:31.610> planner<00:02:32.060> because<00:02:32.780> I

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
instead of an actual planner because I

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.720 
instead of an actual planner because I
have<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.350> write<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:33.860> many<00:02:34.040> notes<00:02:34.280> for<00:02:34.580> like

YouTube<00:02:35.390> videos<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.900> stuff<00:02:36.140> I<00:02:36.350> kind<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.620> just

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
YouTube videos and stuff I kind of just

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.009 
YouTube videos and stuff I kind of just
use<00:02:36.980> this<00:02:37.100> as<00:02:37.280> an<00:02:37.400> all-around<00:02:37.690> planner<00:02:38.690> and

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
but I would recommend getting an actual

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.759 
but I would recommend getting an actual
planner<00:02:41.569> from<00:02:41.750> like<00:02:41.930> Target<00:02:42.349> or<00:02:42.410> something

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
planner from like Target or something

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.339
