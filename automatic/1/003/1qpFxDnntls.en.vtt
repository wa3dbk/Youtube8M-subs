00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.960 
those girls and we didn't see Abby as
much<00:02:26.930> as<00:02:27.230> we<00:02:27.709> did<00:02:27.920> once<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.370> show<00:02:28.550> started

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
much as we did once the show started

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.840

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.630 
prerequisite girl I just put her in
dance<00:03:41.390> but<00:03:41.780> I<00:03:41.989> really<00:03:42.620> think<00:03:42.799> from<00:03:43.070> day<00:03:43.340> one

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
dance but I really think from day one

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.500 
dance but I really think from day one
you<00:03:43.760> would<00:03:43.850> have<00:03:43.880> known<00:03:44.090> that<00:03:44.120> Abby<00:03:44.480> was

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
you would have known that Abby was

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.910 
you would have known that Abby was
probably<00:03:44.930> not<00:03:45.109> what<00:03:45.290> you<00:03:45.410> want<00:03:45.590> your<00:03:45.739> daughter

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
probably not what you want your daughter

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.470 
probably not what you want your daughter
to<00:03:46.070> kind<00:03:46.370> of<00:03:46.459> have<00:03:46.579> to<00:03:46.670> face<00:03:46.850> every<00:03:47.180> day<00:03:47.299> she

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
to kind of have to face every day she

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.699 
to kind of have to face every day she
goes<00:03:47.600> well<00:03:47.750> she<00:03:47.870> wasn't<00:03:48.049> her<00:03:48.230> teacher<00:03:48.470> when

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
goes well she wasn't her teacher when

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.470 
goes well she wasn't her teacher when
she<00:03:48.829> was<00:03:48.920> little<00:03:49.130> she<00:03:49.489> only<00:03:49.820> started<00:03:50.180> dancing

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
she was little she only started dancing

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.970 
she was little she only started dancing
the<00:03:50.540> first<00:03:50.720> she<00:03:50.870> was<00:03:50.989> older<00:03:51.290> but<00:03:51.799> you<00:03:51.890> know

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
the first she was older but you know

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.030 
the first she was older but you know
what<00:03:52.130> I<00:03:52.160> think<00:03:52.549> that<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:52.910> show<00:03:53.209> really<00:03:53.780> I<00:03:54.500> I

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
what I think that the show really I I

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.660 
what I think that the show really I I
think<00:03:55.160> it<00:03:55.489> put<00:03:55.670> a<00:03:55.880> lot<00:03:56.090> of<00:03:56.470> positive<00:03:57.670> emphasis

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
think it put a lot of positive emphasis

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.009 
think it put a lot of positive emphasis
on<00:03:58.819> dance<00:03:59.030> as<00:03:59.209> well<00:03:59.359> because<00:03:59.630> there's<00:03:59.780> kids

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
on dance as well because there's kids

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.140 
on dance as well because there's kids
all<00:04:00.109> over<00:04:00.170> the<00:04:00.440> world<00:04:00.650> who<00:04:01.010> aspire<00:04:01.670> to<00:04:01.850> be<00:04:01.970> like

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
all over the world who aspire to be like

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.789 
all over the world who aspire to be like
these<00:04:02.299> guys<00:04:02.359> so<00:04:02.840> I<00:04:02.870> think<00:04:02.989> it's<00:04:03.290> inspired<00:04:03.680> a

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
these guys so I think it's inspired a

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.050 
these guys so I think it's inspired a
lot<00:04:03.920> of<00:04:04.069> kids<00:04:04.280> to<00:04:04.519> go<00:04:04.670> dance<00:04:05.319> another<00:04:07.060> says

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
lot of kids to go dance another says

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.300 
lot of kids to go dance another says
mother<00:04:08.299> dumb<00:04:08.690> if<00:04:09.049> there<00:04:09.739> are<00:04:09.859> a<00:04:09.889> lot<00:04:10.100> of<00:04:10.130> other

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
mother dumb if there are a lot of other

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.830 
mother dumb if there are a lot of other
dance<00:04:10.549> teachers<00:04:10.940> out<00:04:11.090> there<00:04:11.180> so<00:04:11.450> why<00:04:11.569> didn't

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
dance teachers out there so why didn't

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.199 
dance teachers out there so why didn't
you<00:04:11.870> just<00:04:12.019> move<00:04:12.200> quicker<00:04:12.940> sooner<00:04:13.940> did<00:04:14.120> you

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
you just move quicker sooner did you

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.140 
you just move quicker sooner did you
stay<00:04:14.389> two<00:04:15.139> years<00:04:15.170> didn't<00:04:15.620> you<00:04:15.709> once

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
stay two years didn't you once

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.969 
stay two years didn't you once
yeah<00:04:16.299> he's<00:04:16.810> gotta<00:04:17.049> started<00:04:17.500> well<00:04:17.799> I<00:04:17.829> think

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
yeah he's gotta started well I think

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.680 
yeah he's gotta started well I think
that<00:04:18.310> we<00:04:18.459> were<00:04:18.579> just<00:04:18.759> sort<00:04:18.970> of<00:04:19.030> watching<00:04:19.509> and

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
that we were just sort of watching and

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.240 
that we were just sort of watching and
seeing<00:04:19.870> what<00:04:20.049> was<00:04:20.169> best<00:04:20.350> for<00:04:20.470> Chloe<00:04:20.769> and<00:04:20.979> when

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
seeing what was best for Chloe and when

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.890 
seeing what was best for Chloe and when
it<00:04:21.370> was<00:04:21.489> time<00:04:21.729> we<00:04:21.759> knew<00:04:22.120> it<00:04:22.270> and<00:04:22.419> we<00:04:22.509> moved<00:04:22.720> on

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
it was time we knew it and we moved on

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.570 
it was time we knew it and we moved on
and<00:04:25.110> I<00:04:26.110> can't<00:04:26.530> see<00:04:26.740> that<00:04:26.860> you<00:04:26.979> could<00:04:27.100> be<00:04:27.310> a<00:04:27.340> good

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
and I can't see that you could be a good

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.879 
and I can't see that you could be a good
dance<00:04:27.940> teacher<00:04:28.300> I<00:04:29.050> think<00:04:29.289> I<00:04:29.380> learned<00:04:29.590> a<00:04:29.740> lot

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889

from<00:04:29.949> her<00:04:30.370> but<00:04:31.710> maybe<00:04:32.710> she<00:04:32.949> didn't<00:04:33.160> tell<00:04:33.310> me

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340
