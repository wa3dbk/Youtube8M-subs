00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.150
 welcome first good to the channel 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.759
 driving simulator 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.890
 My name is Andrew and in this first video 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:22.760
 I'll teach you how to create the profile of 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:25.710
 play on oge tech profile 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.359
 this video will only be useful for you 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.550
 that has a steering wheel 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:35.790
 the logitech is 25g 27 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:41.850
 so let's go first step obviously 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:44.910
 is to download his driver on the internet or 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.890
 if you have the cd easier still 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.850
 I'll put this link to download 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.530
 in the description of the video is very simple 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:59.460
 you select the operating system 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.230
 selects whether it is 32-bit and 64-bit and 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.479
 get software 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.880
 he will download it is yours 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.590
 computer 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:16.470
 I already have already downloaded it already 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:19.770
 installed you install your there and we 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:24.420
 although setting up I will use as 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.590
 example the game and other is simulator you 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:32.670
 use the game you want to set up 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:35.540
 easy nor new profile place it in the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.540
 name of the game 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:46.510
 the abbreviated check comes here in 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:49.000
 look for from there you look where you have 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.300
 health you installed your game in my case 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.300
 here is two points 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.300
 games 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:03.340
 tim tim app dog i dont to begin on x86 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.060
 and another one here 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:11.170
 2 it will appear that the zinho icon 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.709
 game already select here ok 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.350
 in the middle it already has this profile this 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:20.770
 profile so he is not giving this 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.670
 message where you are already going to create a 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.500
 profile at the time 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.140
 This is very good for a number of 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.680
 reasons is in my case here in this 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.320
 now only have the euro and simulator 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:39.130
 configured but if you have more games 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:42.820
 he goes he's here all the games that 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:47.200
 you created a profile and what this is 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:50.019
 useful mainly because you will not 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.850
 set up for example a roll the steering wheel 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.070
 with swivel of 900 grams to play 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.989
 formula 1 you simply will not 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:03.489
 to not be able to play and 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:06.730
 so that's where I created the profiles 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.140
 you just do not need to stay 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.370
 setting every time you go to play 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.890
 a different game 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:17.650
 it stores the profile for each game're 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:22.260
 more ahead in the next video I go 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:26.170
 teach you how to set up the game 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.720
 stay connected on the channel you will soon have more 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.580
 videos it was ok, this was only the 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.620
 first of many 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.620
 A hug until the next
