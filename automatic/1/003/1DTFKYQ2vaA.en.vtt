00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.250
 hello to all and all these x 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.620
 protection for my second video 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.310
 commented on newton in death match by 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.110
 team 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.240
 so the purpose of this video unlike 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.099
 to the previous one is to make a 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.039
 maximum points in a short time 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:18.019
 so here I play won silent 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:20.710
 paralyzing c4 that I will not use 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:23.119
 in this video I think and grenade 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.339
 so in fact I took a plane 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.490
 institutions as is the elimination 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:28.880
 anti-aircraft turrets and striking 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.800
 napalm 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.310
 in fact that makes a lot of points the 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.990
 antiaircraft turret because as soon as that 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.510
 destroyed spy planes that's 200 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.340
 points or 150 so I know more so forcibly 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.710
 that the enemies put it will do 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.280
 a lot of points so I leave you 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.280
 watch this video 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:56.949
 oh no horrible grenade a thigh 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.469
 as you can see on mad 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.049
 studios for now I have no hd 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.539
 pvr ni nothing we run away from the little ones 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:06.689
 videos we will see later interested 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:06.689
 people 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.380
 problem actually this video what 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.150
 did not have too many enemies who had 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.040
 ambitions that made me it did not 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.899
 makes a lot of points 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.970
 ah it's already not bad the building he has 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:28.149
 lasted about five minutes and I got 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.479
 done if I am well 2500 experts I 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.220
 still believe 5 minutes does not hurt if 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.680
 you add up each time 2000 2002 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:44.619
 2007 and five minutes 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:46.899
 rest of the good that we have the level I 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.780
 wanted to say the trumps I had put 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.880
 cold determination in life this is it a 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:02:03.179
 placard forgiveness relentless pass 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:02:03.179
 marathon and very difficult attention 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.910
 always pleasure there I in addition to 3000 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:15.950
 to five years thanks to implacable that I 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.950
 go ferrand course soon 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.500
 there I'm really hot we know that there 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.090
 to have some 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.209
 yeah I cut the beginning of the video 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.310
 it was not very interesting I had not 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.580
 saw a lot dead then turned several 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.780
 times the flame prices to silent and I 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.160
 playing must say as a proud and 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.680
 part became interesting as to 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.530
 from that moment on so I pay him 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.519
 just dominates the video the trouble of 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:52.610
 so specify there we win 6100 to 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.610
 3900 and I'm doing 16 to 4 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.660
 and tell you what starts black 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.049
 ops or those who are just doing a new 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.880
 account 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.489
 it's really convenient to do six 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.160
 game modes with all the assets for 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.030
 amy 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.030
 and 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.269
 and a little bug 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.769
 and yeah relentless marathon pass 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:22.060
 and with the elimination series 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.209
 it's really interesting it's not 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.379
 badly of points then in xp fast me I 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:31.120
 I'm level 26 before doing the video 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:34.420
 so it's a little long with a level 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.790
 finally at parties to put together a 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.940
 level and a half or two but those who 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:45.700
 are at the 10-month level and can 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:47.739
 easily get better so the 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.609
 part is going to end in two to three years 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.040
 there it's finished 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:54.660
 so thank you all for following this 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.660
 video to the next
