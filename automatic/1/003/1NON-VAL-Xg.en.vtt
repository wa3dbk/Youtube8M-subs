manual this is accelerator number 24 now

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.220 
manual this is accelerator number 24 now
we're<00:02:20.910> going<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.060> go<00:02:21.120> through<00:02:21.450> this<00:02:21.600> for<00:02:21.930> four

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
rounds this is a good one to replace a

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.420 
rounds this is a good one to replace a
cardio<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:26.940> intervals<00:02:27.360> on<00:02:27.570> an<00:02:27.750> off<00:02:27.930> day

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
cardio and the intervals on an off day

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.130 
cardio and the intervals on an off day
so<00:02:29.430> we've<00:02:29.820> got<00:02:29.910> six<00:02:30.270> moves<00:02:30.630> we're<00:02:30.870> going<00:02:30.990> to<00:02:31.050> do

a double dumbbell swing you got a B

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.170 
a double dumbbell swing you got a B
we're<00:02:34.980> going<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.160> move<00:02:35.340> straight<00:02:35.670> into<00:02:36.000> the

we're going back to the dumbbell swing
you've<00:02:44.340> got<00:02:44.460> eight<00:02:44.670> reps<00:02:44.970> then<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:45.930> want

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
you've got eight reps then you want

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
can see this is crazy metabolically

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.320 
can see this is crazy metabolically
demanding<00:02:55.500> so<00:02:55.890> it's<00:02:56.250> very<00:02:56.430> bad<00:02:56.700> people<00:02:56.940> aren't

thing<00:03:07.530> I<00:03:07.590> forgot<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.860> tell<00:03:08.100> you<00:03:08.220> we've<00:03:08.640> got<00:03:08.820> to

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
thing I forgot to tell you we've got to

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.810 
thing I forgot to tell you we've got to
rest<00:03:09.150> 90<00:03:09.660> seconds<00:03:10.350> between<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.770> rounds<00:03:11.190> so

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
rest 90 seconds between the rounds so

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.170 
rest 90 seconds between the rounds so
don't<00:03:12.600> do<00:03:13.020> all<00:03:13.440> this<00:03:13.800> in<00:03:14.100> four<00:03:14.640> rounds<00:03:15.030> without

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
don't do all this in four rounds without

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.690 
don't do all this in four rounds without
resting<00:03:15.840> that's<00:03:16.140> crazy<00:03:16.380> you<00:03:17.130> need<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.520> see<00:03:17.670> a

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
resting that's crazy you need to see a

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.580 
resting that's crazy you need to see a
break<00:03:17.970> you<00:03:18.450> need<00:03:18.600> to<00:03:18.690> focus<00:03:18.810> on<00:03:19.080> keeping<00:03:19.230> good

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
break you need to focus on keeping good

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.370 
break you need to focus on keeping good
form<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.970> idea<00:03:21.450> is<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.720> be<00:03:21.810> using<00:03:22.230> a

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
form and the idea is to be using a

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.530 
form and the idea is to be using a
resistance<00:03:23.370> or<00:03:23.580> a<00:03:23.610> weight<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:24.150> is

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
resistance or a weight that is

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.420 
resistance or a weight that is
metabolically<00:03:25.170> challenging<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:26.100> that's<00:03:26.220> why

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
metabolically challenging and that's why

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.070 
metabolically challenging and that's why
i<00:03:26.459> recommend<00:03:26.640> something<00:03:27.270> that<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.780> can<00:03:27.930> lift

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
i recommend something that you can lift

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.170 
i recommend something that you can lift
overhead<00:03:28.380> ten<00:03:28.860> times<00:03:29.220> because<00:03:29.880> going<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.120> be

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 
incorporate these hybrid metabolic

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.200 
incorporate these hybrid metabolic
complexes<00:06:48.590> and<00:06:48.770> then<00:06:49.340> progress<00:06:49.610> with<00:06:50.120> the
