00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.190
 tv talk galley figures today I brought 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.180
 for you a technique of 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.490
 scale improvement 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.920
 today we have access to several 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.949
 methodologies and there are several types of 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.679
 drawings of scales but sometimes it is 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.070
 missing the next we'll create 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:31.980
 okay phrases and apply some techniques 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.950
 to this scale it is as if 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.290
 speaking Portuguese is no use staying 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.480
 a B C D F G 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.940
 I'll just pass on information to you. 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.430
 passing the letters that are used 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.880
 to make any word 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.120
 but if I start to join sometimes 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.120
 repeating letters using consonants and 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.240
 in the middle I form phrases words and so 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.610
 successively with the music happens to 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.720
 same thing then I'll get a 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:07.400
 example of scale is three notes per string 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.400
 I'm going to have this drawing. 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:32.070
 This shape of this scale design is the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.100
 drawing of sun scale in mix mode 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.290
 Good olid walking explained to the fast 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.170
 would that be okay 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.560
 are changes we make on the scale 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.950
 which causes it to have sonorities 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.530
 different how you perceived the sensation 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:56.130
 we have is that it 's missing the fact 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:59.340
 to have gone but in fact I wanted to 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.540
 use the ffa to give this mix effect 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.700
 olidio ok 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.180
 luiz gonzaga also used in music 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.180
 his 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:16.350
 they realized the music is in the biggest sun 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.290
 but at the time of this well-known soil 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.350
 he made this characterization of music 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.030
 Northeastern that is the mix mode olídio to 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.340
 You 're just starting to hear about it. 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.600
 In Greek ways, I'll go 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.810
 to explain better 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.450
 today I'm going to focus on the mix-and- match mode that 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.140
 is the fifth degree of the natural scale of 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.260
 q larger scale feature of it okay 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.320
 we have a 7th grade change in 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.990
 scale we know the seventh 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.070
 and eighth grade they have a range of 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:53.850
 semi tone bloch and the seventh call 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:57.780
 sensitive in the case of the mix so we Olivio 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:00.420
 we have the seventh the bajada or it is going 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.780
 called tonic raise because there is a 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.910
 tone of the eighth tonic above ok 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.730
 first the idea of ​​phrase we go 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:15.080
 get the idea of luiz gonzaga himself 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.080
 which is to exercise the scale with Tuesdays 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.050
 What I did now is a non- standard. 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.870
 I mean that has to be followed to 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.709
 and do it in music and power. 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.970
 I can, but the interesting thing is 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:48.700
 know how to use it there as I always say 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.160
 depends on their musical influence and 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:55.890
 What do you want to put in the song, okay? 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.890
 sometimes a little bit will only solve 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:07.600
 I'll repeat this pattern on Tuesdays 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:33.669
 slower for you to accompany 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:36.360
 tablature I'll get this same idea 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.360
 from luiz gonzaga 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:45.240
 let's say you're making a blues 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.240
 which uses the sun with seventh 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:57.870
 how did you perceive the sound it 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.030
 came to change the characteristics of the blues 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.030
 rock the blues have their own scale 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:06.210
 your own way of playing but if you 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.310
 want to put new ideas or even 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.160
 another type of rock rock music too 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.980
 uses the same training 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:17.720
 Chords that I only with seventh you go 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.720
 get a bit something like that 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.960
 it's a chord with seven here you can 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.340
 use changing the time 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.030
 Whatever you want, come back or 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.000
 front 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.730
 remembering the scale will accompany good 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.070
 one more sentence that we can do is 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:37.070
 here on top of the same scale in 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:03.570
 this pattern I'm doing the same 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:06.990
 scale ok which is the fifth degree of the scale 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:09.810
 of his olidio mix mode that would be the 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:13.020
 sun with seven kill good so I am 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:15.870
 using this same scale 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:19.950
 only now with another standard one 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:22.470
 standard using 6 tubs six notes per 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:25.970
 time here so that's it folks 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.970
 Good studies and see you later
