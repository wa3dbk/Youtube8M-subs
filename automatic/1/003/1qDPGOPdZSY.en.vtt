00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.319 

we're<00:00:45.329> going<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.780> caramelize<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.770> sugar<00:00:47.329> you

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.119 
we're going to caramelize this sugar you
have<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.660> keep<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.020> on<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> low<00:00:49.500> flame<00:00:49.770> and

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
have to keep this on a low flame and

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.979 
have to keep this on a low flame and
keep<00:00:50.340> checking<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> slow<00:00:51.719> process

you<00:01:01.859> see<00:01:02.100> closely<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.149> sugar<00:01:03.480> has<00:01:03.629> started<00:01:04.049> to

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
you see closely the sugar has started to

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.039 
you see closely the sugar has started to
caramelize<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.280> they<00:01:05.970> could<00:01:06.180> defy<00:01:06.510> its

flame or a high flame depending on the
heat<00:01:29.150> of<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:29.420> pan

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.819 

the<00:01:41.659> sugar<00:01:41.990> will<00:01:42.170> turn<00:01:42.439> into<00:01:42.729> liquid<00:01:47.649> you<00:01:48.649> can

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
the sugar will turn into liquid you can

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:50.800 
the sugar will turn into liquid you can
now<00:01:48.950> see<00:01:48.979> that<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.670> sugar<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:50.329> butter<00:01:50.479> have

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
now see that the sugar and butter have

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.859 
now see that the sugar and butter have
melted<00:01:51.170> completely<00:01:51.350> and<00:01:51.979> become<00:01:52.340> a<00:01:52.579> liquid<00:01:53.179> if

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
melted completely and become a liquid if

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.539 
melted completely and become a liquid if
there<00:01:54.140> are<00:01:54.170> any<00:01:54.259> lumps<00:01:54.859> you<00:01:54.890> can<00:01:55.159> break<00:01:55.369> it

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
there are any lumps you can break it

there are any lumps you can break it
with<00:01:55.729> your<00:01:55.909> wooden<00:01:56.179> spoon<00:01:58.000> now<00:01:59.000> that<00:01:59.209> we<00:01:59.360> have

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
with your wooden spoon now that we have

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.160 
with your wooden spoon now that we have
a<00:01:59.569> caramel<00:02:00.229> and<00:02:00.469> also<00:02:01.159> think<00:02:01.549> liquid<00:02:02.179> add<00:02:02.630> your

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
a caramel and also think liquid add your

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:15.339 
a caramel and also think liquid add your
salt<00:02:06.549> mix<00:02:12.099> increase<00:02:13.099> the<00:02:13.280> flame<00:02:13.549> and<00:02:13.930> add<00:02:14.930> them

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
salt mix increase the flame and add them

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.839 
salt mix increase the flame and add them
teacher<00:02:17.530> we<00:02:18.530> have<00:02:18.680> increased<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.340> flame<00:02:19.610> as

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
teacher we have increased the flame as

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.610 
teacher we have increased the flame as
soon<00:02:20.090> as<00:02:20.209> we<00:02:20.360> put<00:02:20.599> in<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.840> nut<00:02:21.019> so<00:02:21.319> that<00:02:21.500> the

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
soon as we put in the nut so that the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.650 
soon as we put in the nut so that the
caramel<00:02:22.099> stays<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:22.700> it<00:02:22.849> could<00:02:23.030> form<00:02:23.329> and<00:02:23.569> the

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
caramel stays and it could form and the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.690 
caramel stays and it could form and the
temperature<00:02:24.079> stays<00:02:24.319> high<00:02:24.620> otherwise<00:02:25.340> it<00:02:25.579> will

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
temperature stays high otherwise it will

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.309 
temperature stays high otherwise it will
solidify<00:02:25.910> in<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.569> pot<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:26.959> we<00:02:27.079> don't<00:02:27.200> want

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
solidify in the pot and we don't want

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.630 
solidify in the pot and we don't want
that<00:02:28.780> mix<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.989> nuts<00:02:30.170> around<00:02:30.530> in<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.129> pot<00:02:31.370> so

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
that mix the nuts around in the pot so

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.460 
that mix the nuts around in the pot so
that<00:02:31.849> they<00:02:32.060> get<00:02:32.209> covered<00:02:32.599> in<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.810> caramel<00:02:33.260> and

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
that they get covered in the caramel and

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:40.360 
that they get covered in the caramel and
they<00:02:33.650> get<00:02:33.829> cooked<00:02:34.040> a<00:02:34.220> little<00:02:34.340> as<00:02:34.579> well

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.690 

I<00:02:40.430> think<00:02:41.180> it's<00:02:41.299> done<00:02:41.769> be<00:02:42.769> careful<00:02:43.159> not<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.549> burn

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
I think it's done be careful not to burn

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.880 
I think it's done be careful not to burn
the<00:02:43.849> sugar<00:02:44.150> and<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.720> take<00:02:44.930> it<00:02:45.110> out<00:02:45.260> on<00:02:45.290> the

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
the sugar and to take it out on the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.460 
the sugar and to take it out on the
right<00:02:46.040> stage<00:02:46.599> just<00:02:47.599> a<00:02:47.690> few<00:02:47.870> minutes<00:02:48.049> of<00:02:48.290> mixing

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
right stage just a few minutes of mixing

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.119 
right stage just a few minutes of mixing
should<00:02:48.920> be<00:02:49.099> enough<00:02:50.140> this<00:02:51.140> is<00:02:51.319> done<00:02:51.530> now<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:51.769> we

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
should be enough this is done now and we

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:59.710 
should be enough this is done now and we
will<00:02:52.250> pour<00:02:52.549> it<00:02:52.670> onto<00:02:52.879> our<00:02:53.090> grease<00:02:53.510> tray<00:02:58.720> spread

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
will pour it onto our grease tray spread

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.690 
will pour it onto our grease tray spread
it<00:02:59.840> out<00:02:59.989> with<00:03:00.319> your<00:03:00.349> wooden<00:03:00.799> spoon<00:03:01.129> and<00:03:01.370> press

we're going to separate it from the

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.160 
we're going to separate it from the
aluminium<00:03:35.050> foil<00:03:39.450> you<00:03:40.450> can<00:03:40.630> see<00:03:40.840> that<00:03:40.870> it's

hardened into one solid slab break it

00:03:49.930 --> 00:04:02.080 
hardened into one solid slab break it
into<00:03:50.080> rough<00:03:50.380> pieces<00:03:50.410> by<00:03:51.069> hand

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.319 

you're<00:04:03.090> peanut<00:04:03.390> brittle<00:04:03.569> is<00:04:03.840> now<00:04:04.050> ready
