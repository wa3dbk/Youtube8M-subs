00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.430 
fence about only because I didn't know
that<00:03:25.180> it<00:03:25.210> was<00:03:25.360> this<00:03:25.510> material<00:03:26.020> it's<00:03:26.200> kind<00:03:26.380> of

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
that it was this material it's kind of

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.040 
that it was this material it's kind of
like<00:03:26.590> a<00:03:26.760> linen<00:03:27.760> material<00:03:28.360> which<00:03:28.660> doesn't

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
like a linen material which doesn't

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.470 
like a linen material which doesn't
stretch<00:03:29.500> that<00:03:29.800> much<00:03:29.980> and<00:03:30.250> I<00:03:30.640> always<00:03:30.790> like<00:03:31.210> tops

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
stretch that much and I always like tops

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.350 
stretch that much and I always like tops
that<00:03:31.780> are<00:03:32.070> stretchy<00:03:33.070> just<00:03:33.700> because<00:03:34.000> this

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
that are stretchy just because this

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.830 
that are stretchy just because this
region<00:03:34.630> if<00:03:35.020> it's<00:03:35.200> not<00:03:35.260> stretchy<00:03:35.710> it's<00:03:36.070> like

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
region if it's not stretchy it's like

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.600 
region if it's not stretchy it's like
you<00:03:37.840> know<00:03:37.960> it<00:03:38.200> doesn't<00:03:38.470> really<00:03:38.590> work<00:03:38.830> but<00:03:39.430> um

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
you know it doesn't really work but um

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.610 
you know it doesn't really work but um
this<00:03:40.090> one<00:03:40.300> I<00:03:40.330> think<00:03:40.450> is<00:03:40.750> wide<00:03:41.050> enough<00:03:41.230> like

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
this one I think is wide enough like

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.180 
this one I think is wide enough like
it's<00:03:41.890> very<00:03:42.520> oversized<00:03:43.090> width<00:03:43.840> wise<00:03:44.080> also<00:03:44.440> that

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
it's very oversized width wise also that

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.740 
it's very oversized width wise also that
I<00:03:45.220> think<00:03:45.520> it<00:03:45.670> will<00:03:45.790> work<00:03:45.850> fine<00:03:46.300> and<00:03:46.540> then<00:03:46.660> it

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
I think it will work fine and then it

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.770 
I think it will work fine and then it
has<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.230> buttons<00:03:47.680> down<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.640> front<00:03:48.850> here<00:03:49.330> so

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
has the buttons down the front here so

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.480 
has the buttons down the front here so
yeah<00:03:50.230> just<00:03:50.530> a<00:03:50.590> really<00:03:50.800> good<00:03:50.830> basic<00:03:51.280> it's

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
yeah just a really good basic it's

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.190 
yeah just a really good basic it's
slightly<00:03:51.820> longer<00:03:52.390> in<00:03:52.570> the<00:03:52.660> back<00:03:52.810> than<00:03:53.170> the

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
slightly longer in the back than the

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.920 
slightly longer in the back than the
front<00:03:53.290> and<00:03:53.740> I<00:03:54.550> still<00:03:55.030> like<00:03:55.270> it<00:03:55.420> a<00:03:55.510> lot<00:03:55.690> it<00:03:55.840> was
