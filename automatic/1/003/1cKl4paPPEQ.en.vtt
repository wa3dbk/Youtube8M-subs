slicer and to talk about the simple
slicer<00:00:48.930> real<00:00:49.110> quick<00:00:49.320> we're<00:00:49.710> going<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.890> take

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
slicer real quick we're going to take

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.639 
slicer real quick we're going to take
off<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.149> handle<00:00:51.480> you're<00:00:52.230> going<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.440> see

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
off the the handle you're going to see

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.229 
off the the handle you're going to see
that<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:52.980> got<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.190> couple<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.670> different<00:00:54.030> ways

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
that it's got a couple of different ways

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.790 
that it's got a couple of different ways
to<00:00:54.270> use<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:54.870> right<00:00:55.050> now<00:00:55.199> it's<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.559> locked

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
to use it so right now it's in a locked

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.380 
to use it so right now it's in a locked
position<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.579> you've<00:00:56.730> got<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.969> lock<00:00:57.149> right

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
position so you've got the lock right

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.799 
position so you've got the lock right
here

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
here

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.150 
here
we're<00:00:58.230> going<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.410> move<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.859> first

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
we're going to move it to the first

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.529 
we're going to move it to the first
position<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.850> what<00:00:59.969> you'll<00:01:00.090> see<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.359> this

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
position and what you'll see is this

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.510 
position and what you'll see is this
drops<00:01:00.840> down<00:01:00.930> real<00:01:01.260> quick<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.680> then<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.309> allows

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
drops down real quick and then it allows

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.219 
drops down real quick and then it allows
access<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.359> blade<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:03.930> that's<00:01:04.080> a

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
access to the blade so that's a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.260 
access to the blade so that's a
sixteenth<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.979> an<00:01:05.129> inch<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:05.970> move<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.240> to

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
sixteenth of an inch you can move it to

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.789 
sixteenth of an inch you can move it to
the<00:01:06.450> second<00:01:06.869> position<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:07.560> would<00:01:07.710> be

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
the second position so this would be

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.289 
the second position so this would be
really<00:01:08.040> good<00:01:08.280> for<00:01:08.400> something<00:01:08.729> like<00:01:08.850> scalloped

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
really good for something like scalloped

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.050 
really good for something like scalloped
potatoes<00:01:09.750> they<00:01:10.049> cook<00:01:10.350> up<00:01:10.500> nice<00:01:10.770> or<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.880> third

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
potatoes they cook up nice or the third

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.880 
potatoes they cook up nice or the third
position<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.170> have<00:01:13.320> for<00:01:13.530> something<00:01:13.740> like

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
position you can have for something like

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.670 
position you can have for something like
slicing<00:01:14.820> up<00:01:14.909> Tomatoes<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.869> for<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.380> one

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
slicing up Tomatoes so for this one

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.740 
slicing up Tomatoes so for this one
we're<00:01:17.040> going<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.369> go<00:01:17.580> really<00:01:18.210> thin<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.630> our

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
we're going to go really thin on our

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.999 
we're going to go really thin on our
slice<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.200> we're<00:01:19.290> going<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.500> go<00:01:19.590> down<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
slice so we're going to go down to the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.120 
slice so we're going to go down to the
one<00:01:22.460> we're<00:01:23.460> going<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.640> put<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:25.130> blade

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130
