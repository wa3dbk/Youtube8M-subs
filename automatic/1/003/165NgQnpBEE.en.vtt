00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
we've quickly just wired it up on the

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.429 
we've quickly just wired it up on the
test<00:00:23.609> bench<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:24.150> we<00:00:24.510> set<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.869> thermostat<00:00:25.230> to

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
test bench and we set the thermostat to

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.000 
test bench and we set the thermostat to
100<00:00:26.310> left<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.939> run<00:00:27.150> for<00:00:27.449> about<00:00:27.510> 10<00:00:27.900> minutes<00:00:28.140> and

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
100 left it run for about 10 minutes and

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.820 
100 left it run for about 10 minutes and
there<00:00:29.550> was<00:00:29.670> no<00:00:29.820> heat<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.330> oven<00:00:30.500> this<00:00:31.500> leads

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
there was no heat in the oven this leads

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.530 
there was no heat in the oven this leads
me<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.099> believe<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.520> it's<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.000> fan<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.420> an

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
me to believe that it's a fan of an

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.540 
me to believe that it's a fan of an
element<00:00:33.989> as<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.440> fan<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.800> running<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
element as the fan is running and the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.780 
element as the fan is running and the
thermostat<00:00:35.880> light<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.600> coming<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.550> the<00:00:38.550> first

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
thermostat light is coming on the first

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.010 
thermostat light is coming on the first
thing<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.090> needs<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.510> be<00:00:39.540> done<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.989> the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
thing that needs to be done is the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.660 
thing that needs to be done is the
appliance<00:00:40.530> needs<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.890> be<00:00:41.010> disconnected<00:00:41.640> from

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
appliance needs to be disconnected from

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.700 
appliance needs to be disconnected from
the<00:00:41.969> electricity<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.750> would<00:00:43.200> also<00:00:43.379> recommend

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
the element has blown but we're going to

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.780 
the element has blown but we're going to
check<00:02:21.820> it<00:02:21.970> with<00:02:22.090> a<00:02:22.150> meter<00:02:22.390> in<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:22.720> minute<00:02:23.790> there

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
check it with a meter in a minute there

which<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:31.030> can<00:02:31.210> see<00:02:31.240> here<00:02:31.890> once<00:02:32.890> you've

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
which you can see here once you've

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.830 
which you can see here once you've
removed<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.640> two<00:02:33.850> screws<00:02:34.210> you'll<00:02:34.600> then<00:02:34.810> have

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
removed the two screws you'll then have

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.350 
removed the two screws you'll then have
access<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.770> pull<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.220> element<00:02:36.370> towards<00:02:36.880> you

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
access to pull the element towards you

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.650 
access to pull the element towards you
now<00:02:38.050> on<00:02:38.260> some<00:02:38.560> models<00:02:38.980> you<00:02:39.670> will<00:02:39.850> have<00:02:40.150> nuts

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
now on some models you will have nuts

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.080 
now on some models you will have nuts
and<00:02:40.930> bolts<00:02:41.320> holding<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:41.980> element<00:02:42.460> in<00:02:42.640> place

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
and bolts holding the element in place

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.360 
and bolts holding the element in place
if<00:02:43.450> this<00:02:44.200> is<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:44.500> case<00:02:44.710> you<00:02:44.980> will<00:02:45.130> have<00:02:45.160> to

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
if this is the case you will have to

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.670 
if this is the case you will have to
actually<00:02:45.880> remove<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.450> oven<00:02:46.600> to<00:02:47.140> get<00:02:47.440> at<00:02:47.560> the

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
actually remove the oven to get at the

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.030 
actually remove the oven to get at the
rear<00:02:47.950> to<00:02:48.100> undo<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.820> nuts<00:02:49.380> once<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.620> element

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
rear to undo the nuts once the element

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.130 
rear to undo the nuts once the element
is<00:02:51.190> pulled<00:02:51.490> out<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:52.150> will<00:02:52.300> see<00:02:52.540> two<00:02:52.840> wires

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
is pulled out you will see two wires

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.100 
is pulled out you will see two wires
attached<00:02:53.740> to<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.370> terminals<00:02:55.300> just

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
attached to the terminals just

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.110 
attached to the terminals just
disconnect<00:02:56.710> them<00:02:56.920> but<00:02:57.160> make<00:02:57.400> sure<00:02:57.430> that<00:02:57.730> they

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
disconnect them but make sure that they

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.180 
disconnect them but make sure that they
do<00:02:58.180> not<00:02:58.330> fall<00:02:58.780> back<00:02:59.110> through<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.620> back<00:02:59.770> panel

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
do not fall back through the back panel

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.830 
do not fall back through the back panel
as<00:03:00.340> you<00:03:00.550> will<00:03:00.730> have<00:03:00.970> to<00:03:01.090> take<00:03:01.240> the<00:03:01.390> appliance

as you will have to take the appliance
out<00:03:02.020> again<00:03:02.380> to<00:03:02.860> actually<00:03:03.250> retrieve<00:03:03.520> them<00:03:04.050> now

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
out again to actually retrieve them now

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.460 
out again to actually retrieve them now
here<00:03:05.410> you<00:03:05.530> can<00:03:05.710> see<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.070> element<00:03:07.290> with<00:03:08.290> the

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
here you can see the element with the

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.300 
here you can see the element with the
distortion<00:03:09.190> on<00:03:09.310> both<00:03:09.820> sides<00:03:10.920> but<00:03:11.920> what<00:03:12.130> we'll

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
distortion on both sides but what we'll

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.110 
distortion on both sides but what we'll
do<00:03:12.489> is<00:03:12.730> using<00:03:13.360> an<00:03:13.570> electrical<00:03:14.080> meter<00:03:14.320> is<00:03:15.120> set

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
do is using an electrical meter is set

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.560 
do is using an electrical meter is set
it<00:03:16.270> to<00:03:16.450> continuity<00:03:17.170> and<00:03:17.820> if<00:03:18.820> the<00:03:19.090> element<00:03:19.480> is

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
it to continuity and if the element is

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.060 
it to continuity and if the element is
blown<00:03:19.989> there<00:03:20.620> will<00:03:20.770> be<00:03:20.800> no<00:03:21.070> circuit<00:03:22.920> in<00:03:23.920> other

to replace the element and the only way

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.030 
to replace the element and the only way
to<00:03:51.790> test<00:03:52.120> it<00:03:52.360> properly<00:03:52.780> is<00:03:52.989> with<00:03:53.290> a<00:03:53.320> mega<00:03:53.590> which

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
to test it properly is with a mega which

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.880 
to test it properly is with a mega which
most<00:03:54.340> people<00:03:54.670> do<00:03:54.820> not<00:03:54.940> have<00:03:55.290> just<00:03:56.290> testing<00:03:56.770> the

most people do not have just testing the
element<00:03:57.280> here<00:03:57.489> so<00:03:57.670> you<00:03:57.760> can<00:03:57.970> see<00:03:58.150> there<00:03:58.390> could
