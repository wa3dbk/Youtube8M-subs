to<00:01:45.820> catch<00:01:46.000> this<00:01:46.270> bhakti<00:01:46.780> here<00:01:47.079> which<00:01:47.259> is<00:01:47.409> bad

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
to catch this bhakti here which is bad

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.060 
to catch this bhakti here which is bad
so<00:01:48.369> it<00:01:48.520> forces<00:01:48.850> good<00:01:49.180> barrel<00:01:49.539> delay<00:01:49.869> good<00:01:50.860> bat

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
so it forces good barrel delay good bat

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.480 
so it forces good barrel delay good bat
path<00:01:51.340> to<00:01:51.969> contact<00:01:52.509> and<00:01:52.810> then<00:01:53.380> I<00:01:53.409> get<00:01:53.679> extension

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
path to contact and then I get extension

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.999 
path to contact and then I get extension
through<00:01:54.729> the<00:01:54.850> ball<00:01:55.000> and<00:01:55.030> finish<00:01:55.570> so<00:01:56.439> based<00:01:56.799> on
