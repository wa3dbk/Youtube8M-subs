00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:13.449
In this tutorial I will teach you

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:15.287
how to make your own juggling balls

00:00:15.287 --> 00:00:17.101
in a very cheap and easy way.

00:00:17.314 --> 00:00:18.547
So here's the ingredients:

00:00:18.941 --> 00:00:20.328
you'll need millet

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.384
Millet is a seed,

00:00:22.384 --> 00:00:23.509
it looks like sesame

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:25.832
you can find it in any pet food store

00:00:25.832 --> 00:00:26.912
it's bird food

00:00:26.912 --> 00:00:28.046
and it's cheap

00:00:28.046 --> 00:00:29.453
it costs 4 reais (~2 dollars) per kg

00:00:30.221 --> 00:00:32.230
with 1 kg you can make more or less 10 balls

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:33.933
balloons number 9

00:00:36.026 --> 00:00:36.985
a funnel

00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:38.441
if you don't have a plastic funnel

00:00:38.441 --> 00:00:40.886
you can make a paper funnel like mine

00:00:40.886 --> 00:00:42.025
it's not very important

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.459
it'll help you to put the millet inside the balloon

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:46.932
safety scissors

00:00:46.932 --> 00:00:49.113
it doesn't have to be scissors like these

00:00:49.113 --> 00:00:50.254
it can be safety scissors

00:00:50.254 --> 00:00:51.186
if you're a child,

00:00:51.186 --> 00:00:52.418
get help from an adult

00:00:53.724 --> 00:00:54.870
and will also be useful to have

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.722
a mug or cup

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:59.188
to put the millet in the funnel

00:00:59.781 --> 00:01:01.556
and balloons to cover your ball

00:01:01.556 --> 00:01:03.341
I used these number 7

00:01:03.341 --> 00:01:05.042
but you can use number 8 or 9 too

00:01:05.042 --> 00:01:06.800
the color of your balls

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.485
will be the same color of the balloons you used to cover.

00:01:10.604 --> 00:01:12.247
so let's go to the method of preparation

00:01:12.912 --> 00:01:16.112
Fill and empty one balloon number 9

00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:18.674
Now with the funnel and the mug

00:01:18.674 --> 00:01:21.259
fill the empty balloon with millet

00:01:24.446 --> 00:01:26.470
make two knots

00:01:26.877 --> 00:01:28.547
your juggling ball is almost ready

00:01:28.547 --> 00:01:30.217
now let's make the cover

00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:34.040
Fill and empty one balloon you'll use to cover,

00:01:35.993 --> 00:01:38.068
this is just to stretch it

00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:40.764
now with the scissors cut the top of the balloon

00:01:40.764 --> 00:01:44.290
and cover the balloon you just filled with millet

00:01:45.202 --> 00:01:48.226
If you have difficulty to do this by yourself ask for someone to help you

00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:54.793
repeat this procedure with 3 balloons

00:01:55.024 --> 00:01:57.650
I use four balloons to cover each ball

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.701
if you use more, they'll probably become more resistant

00:02:00.701 --> 00:02:02.277
and will last longer

00:02:12.105 --> 00:02:13.700
Now just cut these burrs with scissors

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.762
and your juggling ball is ready

00:02:19.442 --> 00:02:20.223
Great!

00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:23.057
Now you know how to make your own juggling balls

00:02:23.438 --> 00:02:25.460
is kind of hard to make all the same size

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.752
and I do not recommend that you wet them

00:02:27.752 --> 00:02:29.569
but they'll work, until you can

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.792
buy some proper juggling balls.

00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:34.857
