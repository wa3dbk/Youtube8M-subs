00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
under and around the flat iron until

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:08.599 
under and around the flat iron until
your<00:01:07.380> ends<00:01:07.649> are<00:01:07.740> sticking<00:01:08.069> out<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.369> flat

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:11.539 
your ends are sticking out of the flat
iron<00:01:08.939> like<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.149> and<00:01:09.869> then<00:01:10.799> simply<00:01:11.219> pull<00:01:11.429> it

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
iron like this and then simply pull it

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.660 
iron like this and then simply pull it
down<00:01:11.759> slowly<00:01:12.209> to<00:01:12.740> get<00:01:13.740> straight<00:01:14.189> ends

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
down slowly to get straight ends

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.760 
down slowly to get straight ends
straighten<00:01:15.539> out<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.899> iron<00:01:16.229> pull<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.560> last

straighten out the iron pull the last
three<00:01:17.130> inches<00:01:17.520> or<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.600> let's<00:01:18.840> try<00:01:19.020> that

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
three inches or so so let's try that

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.830 
three inches or so so let's try that
again<00:01:19.200> take<00:01:20.039> a<00:01:20.069> strand<00:01:20.490> comb<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.270> through<00:01:21.299> and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
again take a strand comb it through and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.349 
again take a strand comb it through and
then<00:01:22.380> wrap<00:01:22.619> your<00:01:22.829> hair<00:01:23.039> around<00:01:23.069> the<00:01:23.639> flat<00:01:23.969> iron

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:24.359 
then wrap your hair around the flat iron

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:26.029 
then wrap your hair around the flat iron
until<00:01:24.569> the<00:01:24.959> ends<00:01:25.319> are<00:01:25.409> sticking<00:01:25.709> out<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.950> the

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
until the ends are sticking out of the

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.050 
until the ends are sticking out of the
flat<00:01:26.340> iron<00:01:26.549> like<00:01:26.789> this

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.180 

and<00:01:29.180> to<00:01:29.900> get<00:01:30.049> straight<00:01:30.320> ends<00:01:30.710> you<00:01:30.890> can<00:01:31.010> always

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
and to get straight ends you can always

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.490 
and to get straight ends you can always
go<00:01:31.460> for<00:01:31.640> it<00:01:31.729> again<00:01:31.940> afterwards<00:01:32.540> because<00:01:33.020> this

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
go for it again afterwards because this

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.469 
go for it again afterwards because this
flatiron<00:01:34.040> has<00:01:34.220> all<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:34.580> newest<00:01:34.820> technology

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
flatiron has all the newest technology

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.780 
flatiron has all the newest technology
so<00:01:35.720> it's<00:01:35.869> not<00:01:35.960> as<00:01:36.110> damaging<00:01:36.650> as<00:01:36.799> the<00:01:37.430> old<00:01:37.610> of

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
so it's not as damaging as the old of

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.780 
so it's not as damaging as the old of
curling<00:01:38.119> irons<00:01:38.420> are<00:01:38.830> so<00:01:39.830> until<00:01:40.280> we<00:01:40.400> get<00:01:40.520> to<00:01:40.580> the

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
curling irons are so until we get to the

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.310 
curling irons are so until we get to the
crown<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:41.299> we're<00:01:41.390> basically<00:01:41.690> doing<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.140> same

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
crown and we're basically doing the same

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.680 
crown and we're basically doing the same
motion<00:01:42.530> over<00:01:42.979> and<00:01:43.250> over<00:01:43.460> which<00:01:44.090> is<00:01:44.270> wrapping

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
motion over and over which is wrapping

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.510 
motion over and over which is wrapping
the<00:01:44.720> hair<00:01:44.930> around<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.350> iron<00:01:45.409> and<00:01:45.830> pulling<00:01:46.399> it

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
the hair around the iron and pulling it

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.060 
the hair around the iron and pulling it
down<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.210> away<00:01:47.479> from<00:01:47.540> our<00:01:47.810> face<00:01:48.050> if<00:01:48.680> you<00:01:48.890> want

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
even Messier than this you can alternate

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.109 
even Messier than this you can alternate
