and<00:00:10.230> now<00:00:10.709> we're<00:00:10.889> looking<00:00:11.010> at<00:00:11.219> Washington<00:00:11.879> and

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
and now we're looking at Washington and

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.470 
and now we're looking at Washington and
so<00:00:13.020> I<00:00:13.379> decided<00:00:13.799> that<00:00:14.000> Washington's<00:00:15.000> puzzle

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
so I decided that Washington's puzzle

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.020 
so I decided that Washington's puzzle
would<00:00:15.780> be<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.049> block<00:00:16.289> for<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.740> week<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.190> this

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.030 
would be the block for the week and this

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.660 
would be the block for the week and this
includes<00:00:18.689> some<00:00:19.050> half<00:00:19.410> rectangle<00:00:20.070> triangles

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
includes some half rectangle triangles

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.570 
includes some half rectangle triangles
as<00:00:20.910> well<00:00:21.119> as<00:00:21.300> squares<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.259> other<00:00:22.740> very<00:00:23.220> weird

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
as well as squares and other very weird

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.519 
as well as squares and other very weird
shapes<00:00:23.970> but<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.779> think<00:00:25.109> it's<00:00:25.259> going<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.470> be

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
shapes but I think it's going to be

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.189 
shapes but I think it's going to be
pretty<00:00:25.919> easy<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.490> sew<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.990> penny

machine I don't know about you but when

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.070 
machine I don't know about you but when
I<00:00:38.400> think<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.790> George<00:00:39.000> Washington<00:00:39.630> I<00:00:39.750> think<00:00:39.780> of

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
I think of George Washington I think of

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.100 
I think of George Washington I think of
a<00:00:40.170> cherry<00:00:40.470> tree<00:00:40.740> and<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:42.150> he<00:00:42.510> chopped<00:00:42.900> it

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
a cherry tree and that he chopped it

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.780 
a cherry tree and that he chopped it
down<00:00:43.140> when<00:00:43.650> he<00:00:43.740> was<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> little<00:00:44.040> kid<00:00:44.160> or<00:00:44.700> at

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
down when he was a little kid or at

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.780 
down when he was a little kid or at
least<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.210> was<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.660> story<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.740> I<00:00:46.770> decided<00:00:47.640> to

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
least that was the story so I decided to

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.350 
least that was the story so I decided to
make<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.300> block<00:00:48.600> red<00:00:49.640> for<00:00:50.640> cherries<00:00:51.120> and

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
make this block red for cherries and

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.770 
make this block red for cherries and
green<00:00:52.050> for<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.830> the<00:00:53.070> tree<00:00:53.310> however<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.420> can

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
green for like the tree however I can

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.020 
green for like the tree however I can
only<00:00:54.900> find<00:00:55.170> strawberry<00:00:55.680> fabric<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.490> that's

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
only find strawberry fabric so that's

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.260 
only find strawberry fabric so that's
what<00:00:57.270> we're<00:00:57.450> using<00:00:57.810> so<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.220> officially<00:00:59.730> a

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
what we're using so this is officially a

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.850 
what we're using so this is officially a
nine<00:01:00.600> patch<00:01:00.980> and<00:01:01.980> it's<00:01:02.520> kind<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.850> off-center

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
nine patch and it's kind of off-center

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.970 
nine patch and it's kind of off-center
so<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.339> challenge<00:01:05.580> here<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.000> going<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.299> be<00:01:06.480> to

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
rows are sewn together so we're just

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.510 
rows are sewn together so we're just
going<00:02:12.719> to<00:02:12.810> fold<00:02:13.290> up<00:02:13.469> the<00:02:13.620> bottom<00:02:13.650> row<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.219> so

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
and as you sew this together you'll

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.100 
and as you sew this together you'll
realize<00:02:20.460> that<00:02:20.490> all<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:20.940> these<00:02:21.210> scenes<00:02:21.600> all<00:02:21.960> of

the internal seams on the block are
straight<00:02:24.870> grain<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.410> cross<00:02:25.650> grain<00:02:25.890> of<00:02:26.100> the

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
straight grain and cross grain of the

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.760 
straight grain and cross grain of the
fabric<00:02:26.670> what's<00:02:27.600> going<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.840> be<00:02:27.930> difficult<00:02:28.140> here

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
fabric what's going to be difficult here

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.090

is going to be sewing the blocks

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.940 
is going to be sewing the blocks
together<00:02:32.510> because<00:02:33.510> these<00:02:33.750> are<00:02:33.990> now<00:02:34.140> all<00:02:34.410> pious

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
together because these are now all pious

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.250 
together because these are now all pious
seams<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:36.300> one<00:02:36.450> of<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.660> things<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:37.110> you

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
seams and so one of the things that you

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.320 
seams and so one of the things that you
can<00:02:37.440> do<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.920> once<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.490> block<00:02:38.700> is<00:02:38.910> all<00:02:39.060> sewn

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
can do is once the block is all sewn

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.590 
can do is once the block is all sewn
together<00:02:39.570> is<00:02:39.990> just<00:02:40.410> run<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.220> line<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.360> stitching

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
together is just run a line of stitching

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.140 
together is just run a line of stitching
around<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.200> outside<00:02:43.680> that's<00:02:44.640> straight

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
around the outside that's straight

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.100 
around the outside that's straight
stitching<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:46.080> will<00:02:46.200> help<00:02:46.590> prevent<00:02:47.160> the

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
stitching and that will help prevent the

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.870 
stitching and that will help prevent the
edges<00:02:49.110> from<00:02:49.410> stretching<00:02:49.800> as<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.520> sew<00:02:50.730> the

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
edges from stretching as you sew the

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.650 
edges from stretching as you sew the
