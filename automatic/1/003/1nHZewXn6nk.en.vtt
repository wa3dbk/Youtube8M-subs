00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.110
 the enchantment dam is normal if all 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.700

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.630
 if it has not changed 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:54.290
 what we have to do is put the 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:57.500
 sword or whatever the first hole is worth 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.480
 and as you can see we will leave everything that all 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.530

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:09.890

 we have 30 levels and we have all the 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.800

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.050
 everything is worth as you see depending on 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.960

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.370
 we have our diamond sword 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.500
 Haunted 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.500

 we minimize this 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.750
 we open the minecraft forge 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.130
 we select all the files of the 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.180

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.180
 our expensive point minecraft 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.640
 we hope we will accept 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.270
 once this is done we delete our 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.680

 we closed the hard point minecraft and 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.270
 we open minecraft worth so that it 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.490
 generate some folders that are missing 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.980
 for installing the mod absent 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.780
 the game 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.930
 will not release this window so I do not 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.840
 worry that the minecraft forge is worth 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.250
 who is downloading necessary files 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.410
 so well do not worry we hope 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.680
 a few seconds and our 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.680
 Minecraft 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.110
 and even as she is opening 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.950
 and will be generating all the folders 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.110
 that will not be necessary as I said before 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.750

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.130

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:55.640
 new folders and among them a 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:57.440

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.650
