will develop into workers and they can

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.509 
will develop into workers and they can
go<00:00:58.199> on<00:00:58.410> more<00:00:58.620> raids<00:01:03.559> the<00:01:04.559> stolen<00:01:04.920> workers<00:01:05.309> are

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
go on more raids the stolen workers are

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.370 
go on more raids the stolen workers are
called<00:01:05.729> slaves<00:01:06.060> because<00:01:06.750> they<00:01:06.930> do<00:01:06.990> all<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
called slaves because they do all the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.320 
called slaves because they do all the
work<00:01:07.530> for<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.860> slave<00:01:08.040> making<00:01:08.369> queen<00:01:08.610> but

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
work for the slave making queen but

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.120 
work for the slave making queen but
sometimes<00:01:09.689> they<00:01:09.960> don't<00:01:10.110> work<00:01:10.320> your<00:01:10.799> belt

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
sometimes they don't work your belt

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.310 
sometimes they don't work your belt
instead<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.119> taking<00:01:12.450> care<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.960> slave<00:01:13.140> make

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
instead of taking care of the slave make

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.039 
instead of taking care of the slave make
up<00:01:13.470> road<00:01:13.650> they<00:01:14.010> kill<00:01:14.340> many<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.790> them<00:01:15.049> however

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
up road they kill many of them however

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.679 
up road they kill many of them however
it's<00:01:16.500> unclear<00:01:16.710> why<00:01:17.159> they<00:01:17.340> do<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.700> slave

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
it's unclear why they do that slave

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.320 
it's unclear why they do that slave
workers<00:01:18.960> do<00:01:19.439> not<00:01:19.470> have<00:01:19.770> offspring<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.909> even<00:01:21.240> if

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
workers do not have offspring so even if

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.179 
workers do not have offspring so even if
they<00:01:21.450> killed<00:01:21.750> slave<00:01:22.110> makers<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.830> will<00:01:22.979> not

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
they killed slave makers it will not

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.520 
they killed slave makers it will not
increase<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.790> thickness<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.960> how<00:01:25.110> can<00:01:25.170> slave

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
increase the thickness so how can slave

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.740 
increase the thickness so how can slave
rebellion<00:01:25.920> exist<00:01:26.280> or<00:01:26.790> evolve<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.509> first

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
rebellion exist or evolve in the first

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.609 
rebellion exist or evolve in the first
place<00:01:28.610> we<00:01:29.610> have<00:01:29.820> an<00:01:29.939> idea<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.170> what<00:01:31.500> we

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
place we have an idea this is what we

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.850 
place we have an idea this is what we
think<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:31.950> going<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.689> the<00:01:33.689> slaves<00:01:33.990> kill<00:01:34.590> slave

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860

took the slaves and their neighbors to
the<00:02:18.770> lab<00:02:18.980> where<00:02:19.459> we<00:02:19.490> genotype<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.300> ends<00:02:20.510> at

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
determine whether the slaves are related

to their neighbors

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.320 
to their neighbors
we<00:02:26.900> found<00:02:27.170> that<00:02:27.650> slaves<00:02:28.010> are<00:02:28.220> indeed<00:02:28.700> often

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
we found that slaves are indeed often

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:49.940 
we found that slaves are indeed often
related<00:02:29.720> to<00:02:29.870> nearby<00:02:30.350> neighbors

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.740 

with<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:51.220> we<00:02:51.550> have<00:02:51.730> added<00:02:52.090> a<00:02:52.210> little<00:02:52.420> piece

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
with that we have added a little piece

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.630 
with that we have added a little piece
to<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.020> puzzle<00:02:53.050> we<00:02:54.040> already<00:02:54.340> knew<00:02:54.610> that

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
to the puzzle we already knew that

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.940 
to the puzzle we already knew that
slaves<00:02:55.180> kill<00:02:55.570> slave<00:02:55.840> maker<00:02:56.080> brood<00:02:56.410> which

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
slaves kill slave maker brood which

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.950 
slaves kill slave maker brood which
reduces<00:02:57.460> the<00:02:57.610> number<00:02:57.730> of<00:02:57.910> slaves<00:02:58.240> needed<00:02:58.630> and

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
reduces the number of slaves needed and

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.300 
reduces the number of slaves needed and
which<00:02:59.200> means<00:02:59.530> that<00:02:59.710> there<00:02:59.860> will<00:02:59.950> be<00:02:59.980> fewer

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
which means that there will be fewer

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.880 
which means that there will be fewer
arrays<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:00.910> better<00:03:01.690> survival<00:03:02.410> for<00:03:02.800> the

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
arrays and better survival for the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.430 
arrays and better survival for the
neighboring<00:03:03.280> app<00:03:03.630> now<00:03:04.630> we<00:03:04.690> know<00:03:05.080> that<00:03:05.110> the

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
neighboring app now we know that the

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.960 
neighboring app now we know that the
slaves<00:03:05.680> are<00:03:05.830> often<00:03:06.190> related<00:03:06.459> to<00:03:06.790> their

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
slaves are often related to their

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.460 
slaves are often related to their
neighbors<00:03:07.270> so<00:03:07.810> we<00:03:07.930> think<00:03:08.140> that<00:03:08.260> their

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
neighbors so we think that their

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.350 
neighbors so we think that their
rebellion<00:03:08.920> behavior<00:03:09.370> may<00:03:09.790> have<00:03:09.970> evolved

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
rebellion behavior may have evolved

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.330 
rebellion behavior may have evolved
because<00:03:10.660> it<00:03:10.930> increases<00:03:11.530> their<00:03:11.770> indirect

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
because it increases their indirect
