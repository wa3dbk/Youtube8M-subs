 We are obviously fine 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:33.439
 you to think that it has to life 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:33.439
 can appreciate when there are some girls 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.340
 that he had never lost a final 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.440
 until this last one was and the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.300
 feelings that he had as well as that the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.460
 face and why it happened that there was to be done 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.590
 do not 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.350
 what they know one is preparing 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.239

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.520
 final we won and good one day 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.489
 I was going to get that 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.010
 bad luck but I think we did it 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.290
 with great dignity I think the team 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.770
 he worked spectacularly and he did it very 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:17.840
 well how does the truth feel but as 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.220
 you feel the see that monterrey is 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.890
 the best time of the monterrey of 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.840
 championships where monterrey are given 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.340
 so much happiness to people and especially 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.200

 interesting about monterrey ya 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.350
 world level the fifa already recognizes it 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.880
 how it feels like personal achievement from 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.420
 then as a personal achievement it is 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.490
 extraordinary for us because then 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.770
 this means that the work that one goes 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.590

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.649
 productive has been recognized has been 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.960
 evaluated by football and especially that 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.390

 depending on times or weather 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.640
