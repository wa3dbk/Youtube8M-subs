now but if I turn it off it sometimes

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.140 
now but if I turn it off it sometimes
takes<00:01:48.869> 20<00:01:49.650> seconds<00:01:50.009> for<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.549> actually<00:01:50.970> turn

off<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.869> could<00:01:52.590> still<00:01:52.860> hear<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.220> fan<00:01:53.670> going

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
off I could still hear to fan going

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.800 
off I could still hear to fan going
maybe<00:01:55.170> that's<00:01:55.560> just<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.950> fan<00:01:56.159> itself<00:01:56.640> or<00:01:57.060> maybe

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
maybe that's just a fan itself or maybe

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.620 
maybe that's just a fan itself or maybe
to<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.079> left<00:01:58.170> sponsor<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.740> know<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.420> got<00:02:00.420> my

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
to the left sponsor I know so I got my

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:18.780 
to the left sponsor I know so I got my
thing<00:02:00.810> back<00:02:00.960> on

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.430 

so<00:02:19.790> what<00:02:20.300> I'm<00:02:20.390> guessing<00:02:20.540> here<00:02:20.870> is<00:02:20.990> that<00:02:21.170> East

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
so what I'm guessing here is that East

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.400 
so what I'm guessing here is that East
68th<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.220> v70<00:02:22.820> are<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:22.970> same<00:02:23.150> problem<00:02:23.540> or

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
68th and v70 are the same problem or

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.260 
68th and v70 are the same problem or
maybe<00:02:24.680> they're<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.010> same<00:02:25.220> they're<00:02:26.000> not<00:02:26.030> the

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
maybe they're the same they're not the

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.420 
maybe they're the same they're not the
same<00:02:26.420> problem<00:02:26.600> with<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.170> there's<00:02:28.100> a<00:02:28.190> slight

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
same problem with the there's a slight
