00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
this is a three-horse grizzly shaper

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.130 
this is a three-horse grizzly shaper
with<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.100> quarter<00:00:05.520> horse<00:00:05.670> power<00:00:06.359> feeder<00:00:06.750> on<00:00:06.870> it

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
with a quarter horse power feeder on it

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.830 
with a quarter horse power feeder on it
and<00:00:07.610> I<00:00:08.610> got<00:00:08.849> this<00:00:09.030> guard<00:00:09.240> on<00:00:09.389> here<00:00:09.540> right<00:00:09.690> now

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
and I got this guard on here right now

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.509 
and I got this guard on here right now
because<00:00:10.080> I<00:00:10.170> typically<00:00:10.469> hand<00:00:10.769> feed<00:00:10.950> my<00:00:11.099> panels

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
because I typically hand feed my panels

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.490 
because I typically hand feed my panels
and<00:00:11.670> they're<00:00:11.759> doing<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.059> cathedral<00:00:12.540> doors<00:00:12.719> so

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
and they're doing the cathedral doors so

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.709 
and they're doing the cathedral doors so
I<00:00:13.530> got<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.740> bearing<00:00:14.130> on<00:00:14.280> it<00:00:14.460> so<00:00:15.120> we'll<00:00:15.389> slide<00:00:15.480> the

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
I got a bearing on it so we'll slide the

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.210 
I got a bearing on it so we'll slide the
power<00:00:15.870> feeder<00:00:16.230> in<00:00:16.410> front<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:16.800> now<00:00:16.830> and

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
power feeder in front of it now and

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.010 
power feeder in front of it now and
we'll<00:00:17.940> get<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.090> feel<00:00:18.330> for<00:00:18.539> what<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:18.840> machine

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
we'll get a feel for what this machine

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:27.560 
we'll get a feel for what this machine
can<00:00:19.320> do

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:01:41.870 

they're<00:00:28.080> gonna<00:00:28.260> turn<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.500> desk<00:00:28.770> like<00:00:29.010> their<00:00:29.189> own

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.219 

all<00:01:42.880> righty<00:01:43.180> I<00:01:43.420> took<00:01:43.720> a<00:01:43.750> pretty<00:01:43.960> aggressive

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
all righty I took a pretty aggressive

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.260 
all righty I took a pretty aggressive
cut<00:01:44.650> there<00:01:44.860> for<00:01:45.070> you<00:01:45.189> to<00:01:45.280> see<00:01:45.460> how<00:01:45.670> it<00:01:45.820> actually

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
cut there for you to see how it actually

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.210 
cut there for you to see how it actually
do<00:01:46.450> I<00:01:46.689> left<00:01:47.409> it<00:01:47.590> so<00:01:47.710> I'd<00:01:47.770> end<00:01:47.979> up<00:01:48.070> with<00:01:48.190> a

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
do I left it so I'd end up with a

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.399 
do I left it so I'd end up with a
quarter-inch<00:01:48.640> tongue<00:01:49.170> overall<00:01:50.170> that's

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
quarter-inch tongue overall that's

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.480 
quarter-inch tongue overall that's
typically<00:01:50.799> what<00:01:50.920> you<00:01:51.040> want<00:01:51.159> I<00:01:53.310> thought<00:01:54.310> it

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
typically what you want I thought it

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.249 
typically what you want I thought it
might<00:01:54.790> have<00:01:54.909> fed<00:01:55.090> just<00:01:55.270> a<00:01:55.390> bit<00:01:55.570> fast<00:01:55.810> to<00:01:56.049> kind

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
might have fed just a bit fast to kind

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.690 
might have fed just a bit fast to kind
of<00:01:56.320> tax<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.710> Machine<00:01:57.009> down<00:01:57.190> a<00:01:57.250> little<00:01:57.460> bit

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
of tax the Machine down a little bit

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.399 
of tax the Machine down a little bit
although<00:01:58.119> I<00:01:58.240> was<00:01:58.450> running<00:01:58.780> red<00:01:58.930> oak<00:01:59.110> through

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
although I was running red oak through

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.200 
although I was running red oak through
it<00:01:59.530> so<00:01:59.860> it<00:02:00.280> all<00:02:00.460> depends<00:02:00.789> on<00:02:00.880> what<00:02:01.000> kind<00:02:01.149> of

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
it so it all depends on what kind of

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.510 
it so it all depends on what kind of
wood<00:02:01.390> you<00:02:01.479> have<00:02:01.509> I<00:02:01.930> was<00:02:02.740> running<00:02:03.070> a<00:02:03.159> four<00:02:03.399> and

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
wood you have I was running a four and

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.260 
wood you have I was running a four and
five<00:02:03.700> eighths

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
five eighths

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.359 
five eighths
it<00:02:04.659> just<00:02:04.899> came<00:02:05.020> brand-new<00:02:05.530> from<00:02:05.799> I<00:02:06.009> got<00:02:06.220> it

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
it just came brand-new from I got it

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.400 
it just came brand-new from I got it
resharpen<00:02:06.729> his<00:02:07.539> four<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:07.960> five<00:02:08.110> eighths

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
resharpen his four and five eighths

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.650 
resharpen his four and five eighths
outside<00:02:08.890> diameter<00:02:09.160> his<00:02:09.850> believe<00:02:10.149> is<00:02:10.270> on<00:02:10.420> a<00:02:10.450> one

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
outside diameter his believe is on a one

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.340 
outside diameter his believe is on a one
inch<00:02:10.840> spindle<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.440> was<00:02:12.370> 15<00:02:12.760> degree<00:02:13.060> cut<00:02:13.350> so

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
inch spindle and was 15 degree cut so

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.990 
inch spindle and was 15 degree cut so
there's<00:02:14.530> a<00:02:14.560> few<00:02:14.709> factors<00:02:15.190> there<00:02:15.370> involved<00:02:15.819> but

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
there's a few factors there involved but

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.120 
there's a few factors there involved but
I<00:02:16.180> was<00:02:16.390> impressed<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:16.989> tell<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.350> truth<00:02:17.620> so
