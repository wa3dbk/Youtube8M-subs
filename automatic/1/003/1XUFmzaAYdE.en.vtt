00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:42.569
 experiment and then last time threw away 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.569
 half a kilo of sausage 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:56.260

 gelatin if on adversary with grown up 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.270

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.460
 garlic on about 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.210
 a standard set of spices goes into all this 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.780
 it's a deal 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.390

 put the fridge and see what we have 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:41.949

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:48.550
 with spices 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:55.380

 no that sausage taste it in any way 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:46.460
 does not depend on the quality of minced meat 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.490
 or meat it depends on correctly 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:53.410
