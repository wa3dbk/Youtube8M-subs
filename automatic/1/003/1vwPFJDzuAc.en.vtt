00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.490 
it is um this is very good it's one of
the<00:00:40.710> best<00:00:40.890> tools<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.460> use<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.270> make<00:00:42.420> decals<00:00:42.840> you

the best tools to use to make decals you

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.459 
the best tools to use to make decals you
could<00:00:43.739> use<00:00:43.920> paint.net<00:00:44.309> I've<00:00:44.789> got<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.180> um<00:00:45.440> but<00:00:46.440> I

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.990 
could use paint.net I've got it um but I
think<00:00:46.649> firstly<00:00:47.489> paint<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.270> only<00:00:49.170> one<00:00:50.010> icing<00:00:50.910> is

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
think firstly paint is only one icing is

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.510 
think firstly paint is only one icing is
most<00:00:51.210> effective<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.129> you're<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.309> kind<00:00:53.430> of

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
what you should move to do then you can

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.089 
what you should move to do then you can
open<00:03:14.440> one<00:03:14.769> and<00:03:16.410> first<00:03:17.410> you're<00:03:17.829> going<00:03:17.950> to<00:03:18.010> go

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
open one and first you're going to go

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.470 
open one and first you're going to go
into<00:03:18.220> view<00:03:18.700> and<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.980> should<00:03:21.310> be<00:03:21.459> in<00:03:21.579> 100%<00:03:22.000> lies

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
into view and you should be in 100% lies

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.920 
into view and you should be in 100% lies
the<00:03:22.780> default<00:03:23.200> and<00:03:23.760> but<00:03:24.760> that<00:03:25.000> you<00:03:25.269> do<00:03:25.540> not<00:03:25.690> want

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
the default and but that you do not want

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.690 
the default and but that you do not want
that<00:03:26.079> and<00:03:26.349> you're<00:03:26.889> going<00:03:27.040> to<00:03:27.069> go<00:03:27.190> into<00:03:27.430> zoom

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
that and you're going to go into zoom

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.720 
that and you're going to go into zoom
and<00:03:28.060> just<00:03:28.750> up<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.139> percentage<00:03:29.739> to<00:03:30.099> originally

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
and just up the percentage to originally

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.190 
and just up the percentage to originally
five<00:03:31.769> this<00:03:32.769> is<00:03:32.829> because<00:03:33.370> if<00:03:33.730> you<00:03:34.060> held<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.810> a

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
five this is because if you held a a

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.229 
five this is because if you held a a
four<00:03:35.500> piece<00:03:35.709> of<00:03:35.919> paper<00:03:36.220> up<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:36.609> the<00:03:36.669> screen<00:03:36.970> is

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
four piece of paper up to the screen is

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.770 
four piece of paper up to the screen is
105<00:03:38.169> zoom<00:03:38.590> it<00:03:39.579> would<00:03:39.760> actually<00:03:39.940> match<00:03:40.419> the

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
105 zoom it would actually match the

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.729 
105 zoom it would actually match the
paper<00:03:41.169> on<00:03:41.560> the<00:03:41.739> screen<00:03:42.040> um<00:03:42.790> and<00:03:43.530> this<00:03:44.530> will

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
paper on the screen um and this will

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.559 
paper on the screen um and this will
come<00:03:44.889> in<00:03:45.010> handy<00:03:45.040> because<00:03:45.669> what<00:03:46.239> I'm<00:03:46.389> just

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
come in handy because what I'm just

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
necessary and I would go a tiny bit

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.760 
necessary and I would go a tiny bit
smaller<00:04:25.090> you<00:04:25.450> natural

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
smaller you natural

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.980 
smaller you natural
and<00:04:26.910> xi<00:04:27.910> also<00:04:28.500> just<00:04:29.500> cuz<00:04:30.569> you<00:04:31.569> know<00:04:31.690> you<00:04:31.750> don't

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
and xi also just cuz you know you don't

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.460 
and xi also just cuz you know you don't
let<00:04:32.199> any<00:04:32.379> unfurl<00:04:32.979> a<00:04:33.099> pin<00:04:33.370> or<00:04:33.580> anything<00:04:33.910> um<00:04:34.470> so

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
let any unfurl a pin or anything um so

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.920 
let any unfurl a pin or anything um so
yeah<00:04:35.650> and<00:04:36.039> let's<00:04:36.460> just<00:04:36.639> quickly<00:04:36.879> check<00:04:37.330> the

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
yeah and let's just quickly check the

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.529 
yeah and let's just quickly check the
size<00:04:38.169> now<00:04:38.440> so<00:04:38.500> go<00:04:38.770> to<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:38.949> size<00:04:39.159> and<00:04:39.190> position

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
size now so go to the size and position

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:45.089 
size now so go to the size and position
so<00:04:40.539> it's<00:04:40.720> 1<00:04:41.490> 122<00:04:42.490> centimeters<00:04:42.930> by<00:04:44.099> 148

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:45.099 
so it's 1 122 centimeters by 148

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:49.980 
so it's 1 122 centimeters by 148
centimeters<00:04:45.879> and<00:04:47.129> yeah<00:04:48.330> so<00:04:49.330> that's<00:04:49.539> it

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
centimeters and yeah so that's it

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.879 
centimeters and yeah so that's it
and<00:04:51.270> I<00:04:52.270> think<00:04:52.629> it's<00:04:52.780> that<00:04:52.990> pretty<00:04:53.560> sure<00:04:53.770> that's

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
and I think it's that pretty sure that's

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.629 
and I think it's that pretty sure that's
the<00:04:54.069> right<00:04:54.190> size<00:04:54.430> but<00:04:55.300> yeah<00:04:55.569> and<00:04:56.159> so<00:04:57.159> that<00:04:57.490> is

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
the right size but yeah and so that is

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.189 
the right size but yeah and so that is
it<00:04:57.849> actually<00:04:58.270> you<00:04:58.389> can<00:04:58.569> just<00:04:58.750> go<00:04:58.870> ahead<00:04:58.960> and

00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 
it actually you can just go ahead and

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.510 
it actually you can just go ahead and
print<00:04:59.470> it<00:05:00.750> you<00:05:01.750> could<00:05:02.380> print<00:05:02.740> on<00:05:02.949> to<00:05:03.220> normal

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
print it you could print on to normal

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.279 
print it you could print on to normal
paper<00:05:03.699> but<00:05:04.150> it<00:05:04.270> doesn't<00:05:04.509> come<00:05:04.659> out<00:05:04.690> very<00:05:05.050> well

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
paper but it doesn't come out very well

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:08.339 
paper but it doesn't come out very well
um<00:05:05.819> so<00:05:06.819> two<00:05:07.060> of<00:05:07.180> the<00:05:07.270> best<00:05:07.419> methods<00:05:07.870> are<00:05:08.050> either

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:08.349 
um so two of the best methods are either

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:11.159 
um so two of the best methods are either
to<00:05:08.740> print<00:05:09.009> on<00:05:09.159> to<00:05:09.370> professional<00:05:10.000> decal<00:05:10.930> paper

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
to print on to professional decal paper

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.029 
to print on to professional decal paper
which<00:05:12.130> um<00:05:12.960> makes<00:05:13.960> everything<00:05:14.349> quite<00:05:14.560> actually

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
which um makes everything quite actually

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:18.270 
which um makes everything quite actually
transparent<00:05:16.000> which<00:05:16.210> is<00:05:16.710> really<00:05:17.710> handy<00:05:17.860> in

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
transparent which is really handy in

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.029 
transparent which is really handy in
most<00:05:18.669> cases<00:05:18.940> but<00:05:19.449> sometimes<00:05:20.349> it<00:05:20.530> can<00:05:20.650> be<00:05:20.680> a

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
most cases but sometimes it can be a

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:25.409 
most cases but sometimes it can be a
little<00:05:21.250> bit<00:05:21.539> dodgy<00:05:22.539> um<00:05:23.520> or<00:05:24.520> you<00:05:24.909> can<00:05:25.060> actually

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
little bit dodgy um or you can actually

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.129 
little bit dodgy um or you can actually
use<00:05:25.750> like<00:05:26.020> printer<00:05:26.590> labels<00:05:27.039> and<00:05:27.960> you<00:05:28.960> might

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
use like printer labels and you might

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:31.050 
use like printer labels and you might
need<00:05:29.259> to<00:05:29.440> move<00:05:29.650> this<00:05:29.860> around<00:05:30.039> a<00:05:30.490> bit<00:05:30.669> if<00:05:30.849> you've

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
need to move this around a bit if you've

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.920 
need to move this around a bit if you've
got<00:05:31.300> printing<00:05:31.719> labels<00:05:32.759> mm<00:05:33.759> but<00:05:34.449> yeah<00:05:34.630> just

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
got printing labels mm but yeah just

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.540 
got printing labels mm but yeah just
load<00:05:35.169> them<00:05:35.380> into<00:05:35.530> your<00:05:35.710> printer<00:05:36.130> and<00:05:36.370> then

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
load them into your printer and then

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.370 
load them into your printer and then
print<00:05:36.849> out<00:05:37.090> there<00:05:37.990> are<00:05:38.199> actually<00:05:38.440> some<00:05:39.370> um

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
print out there are actually some um

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.909 
print out there are actually some um
quite<00:05:41.909> complicated<00:05:43.020> methods<00:05:44.020> when<00:05:44.409> you<00:05:44.560> are

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
quite complicated methods when you are

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.450 
quite complicated methods when you are
using<00:05:45.190> decal<00:05:45.849> paper<00:05:46.060> so<00:05:46.990> just<00:05:47.500> look<00:05:47.740> at<00:05:47.889> back

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
using decal paper so just look at back

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.219 
using decal paper so just look at back
in<00:05:48.490> the<00:05:48.610> packet<00:05:49.060> on<00:05:49.180> the<00:05:49.270> front<00:05:49.539> and<00:05:49.750> it<00:05:50.020> should

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
in the packet on the front and it should

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:52.800 
in the packet on the front and it should
say<00:05:50.500> and<00:05:51.159> give<00:05:51.279> you<00:05:51.370> details<00:05:51.849> to<00:05:52.389> everything

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
say and give you details to everything

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.610 
say and give you details to everything
you<00:05:52.930> need<00:05:53.110> to<00:05:53.229> do<00:05:53.409> um<00:05:54.389> so<00:05:55.389> yeah<00:05:55.810> this<00:05:56.259> actually

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
you need to do um so yeah this actually
