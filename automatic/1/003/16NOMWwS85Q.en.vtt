from here to here like this one you have
to<00:01:50.100> go<00:01:50.280> take<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:51.110> thread<00:01:52.110> i<00:01:52.140> know<00:01:52.380> from<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:53.100> top

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
to go take a thread i know from the top

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.050 
to go take a thread i know from the top
okay<00:01:55.200> from<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.530> top<00:01:55.560> here<00:01:56.159> then<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.670> can<00:01:56.700> go

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
okay from the top here then you can go

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.480 
okay from the top here then you can go
inside<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.840> come<00:01:58.110> out<00:01:58.290> then<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.130> can<00:01:59.310> do<00:01:59.460> the

inside and come out then you can do the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.209 
inside and come out then you can do the
seed<00:02:00.299> bead<00:02:00.570> like<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.079> one<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.290> know<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:02.009> can

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
seed bead like this one you know you can

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.450 
seed bead like this one you know you can
just<00:02:02.490> line<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.420> up<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.380> one<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.340> know

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
just line it up like this one you know

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.270 
just line it up like this one you know
then<00:02:06.360> whatever<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.960> combination<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.829> can<00:02:08.099> do

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
gold or yellow like this one then you

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.700 
gold or yellow like this one then you
can<00:02:13.260> put

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
can put

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.220 
can put
on<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.920> top<00:02:14.190> in<00:02:14.460> top<00:02:15.120> like<00:02:15.450> these<00:02:15.660> crystals

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
on the top in top like these crystals

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.910 
on the top in top like these crystals
then<00:02:17.040> put<00:02:17.460> some<00:02:17.490> hanging<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.300> know<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.690> can

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
then put some hanging you know you can

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.920 
then put some hanging you know you can
have<00:02:19.920> some<00:02:20.190> threads<00:02:20.580> in<00:02:20.910> a<00:02:20.940> change<00:02:21.300> like<00:02:21.690> this

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
have some threads in a change like this
