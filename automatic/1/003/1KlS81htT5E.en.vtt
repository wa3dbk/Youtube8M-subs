that in it so that's kind of how they
meet<00:02:01.049> let's<00:02:01.500> have<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.680> story<00:02:02.070> kind<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.340> runs<00:02:02.520> on

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:26.040 

I

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.120 

I<00:02:26.190> think<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.430> if<00:02:27.880> he<00:02:28.090> wants<00:02:28.390> is<00:02:28.540> like<00:02:29.100> like<00:02:30.100> a

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
I think that if he wants is like like a

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.570 
I think that if he wants is like like a
real<00:02:30.520> reflection<00:02:30.880> of<00:02:31.540> like<00:02:32.170> awesomely<00:02:33.100> yeah<00:02:33.400> I

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
real reflection of like awesomely yeah I

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.010 
real reflection of like awesomely yeah I
reckon<00:02:33.910> I<00:02:33.940> reckon<00:02:34.450> is<00:02:34.540> what<00:02:34.720> we'd<00:02:34.840> probably

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
reckon I reckon is what we'd probably

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.050 
reckon I reckon is what we'd probably
try<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.320> want<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.560> do<00:02:35.650> like<00:02:35.830> every<00:02:36.400> show<00:02:36.610> or<00:02:36.880> go
