wretches<00:00:14.009> product<00:00:14.429> philosophy<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.240> based<00:00:15.509> on

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
wretches product philosophy is based on

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.870 
wretches product philosophy is based on
a<00:00:15.750> quote<00:00:16.049> by<00:00:16.260> Aristotle<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.430> whole<00:00:17.640> is

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
a quote by Aristotle the whole is

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.580 
a quote by Aristotle the whole is
greater<00:00:17.940> than<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.539> sum<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:18.779> its<00:00:19.020> parts

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
greater than the sum of its parts

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.769 
greater than the sum of its parts
therefore<00:00:20.279> our<00:00:20.430> R&amp;D<00:00:20.730> department<00:00:21.570> does<00:00:21.750> not

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
simply choose high quality components

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.300
