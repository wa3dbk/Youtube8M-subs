00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.399
 last week we toured together the 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.380
 plant of the serenissima of general 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:31.630
 Rodríguez and with José Espina 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:36.190
 marcenaro we were analyzing the 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.960
 consumption habits of our country in 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.050
 We want to like this opportunity 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.660
 how is the process of making one 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:51.940
 of its most well-known milk products 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:57.010
 long life how long milk is made 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.870
 Life of milk long life is subdued 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.110
 to a process called ultra high 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.379
 uat temperature through which it 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.329
 heat the milk to a temperature of 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.440
 145 degrees centigrade for two 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:13.540
 seconds in this way is achieved 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.850
 eliminate 100 percent of their 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.860
 microbial which allows to conserve 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.530
 milk for a period of time more 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:30.850
 prolonged without the need for cold until 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:33.280
 the opening of the new packaging the process 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.440
 sterilization and previously the 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.780
 Milk packaging is stored 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.729
 transiently in special tanks 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.410
 that allow maintaining the conditions of 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.220
 sterility achieved during the 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.220
 heat treatment 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.810
 and these tanks are known as 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.430
 septic tanks and from there the 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:58.690
 product is sent to the sector of 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:02:00.550
 packaging in the packaging sector 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.310
 product can be sent to different 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.330
 types of carton or multi packaging 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.140
 laminates 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.479
 or plastic bottles with multi layers in 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.459
 both cases ensure the conditions 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:20.860
 of stability with which it was elaborated and 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:22.870
 packaging the product the sector counts 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.850
 with a process laboratory for the 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.250
 internal release control 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:32.410
 processing and packaging taking care that the 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:34.300
 quality is maintained in every process the 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.489
 product release the game is made 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.800
 of chemical physical controls and 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.660
 bacteriological and sensory and 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.620
 performed by the central laboratory of 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.620
 quality control 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.139
 to ensure the quality of the milk already 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.030
 packaged kept in quarantine it 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.680
 that allows to ensure the detection of 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:04.290
 any defect that the product has 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:06.659
 if there is evident the 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.510
 next step prior to the issuance of the 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:11.639
 product is to perform a power control 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.829
 intensive metric and a control by 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:16.200
 visual inspection of 100% of the 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.239
 merchandise ensuring the quality of the 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.280
 product that leaves the deposit 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:29.849
 intelligent with destiny to the different 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:31.469
 points of sale the big difference that 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.750
 we have with this extra calcium milk 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:36.599
 natural is that through the process of 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.549
 ultrafiltration concentrates calcium and 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.159
 the proteins of the same milk since 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.769
 is not an added calcium in the form of 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:46.290
 powder or extra calcium but that our 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.760
 added calcium is natural calcium with 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.019
 good bioavailability and tolerance 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.960
 good as you were told about calcium 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.300
 same from the same product so that for 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.720
 concentrates in milk by a process of 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:01.290
 ultrafiltration and that same one is added 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.210
 calcium to ordinary milk the 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.000
 of sawyer the school the different 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:08.340
 byproducts and also by the block 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.950
 It should be noted that it is very interesting 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.990
 Within the plant are four aspects 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.739
 that we here are a lot of emphasis 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.960
 more than anything is in the care of the 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.130
 raw material since the discharge 

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.290
 we would have since leaving the tambo 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.390
 until the product is closed here 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.460
 they are extremely careful and more than they were 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.900
 what is good raw material all 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.870
 We know that if the raw material is not 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.660
 good however much later it is 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.280
 do for you and take care of it 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.080
 that we do not have good from the origin is 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.770
 very difficult to get something good after 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.090
 Well that is an exceptional care here 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.290
 as well as the extreme care of 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.140
 hygiene that are done throughout all 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.910
 the processes the benefit we have is 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.240
 when you walk the plant 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.760
 can see every workplace that they are 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.120
 seen by thousands of people who pass 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.680
 year to year here and the possibility of 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.960
 control 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.120
 with certain precautions of eating glasses 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.729
 and all the security measures that the 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.630
 people can see how people work 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:07.550
 raw material 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.020
 to have the final product milk 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.539
 who consumes that is what is very valuable 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.389
 and also the issue that there may be the 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:16.039
 care in the workplace that since 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:18.410
 the seeds are very aware that 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:20.419
 good with our human resource is what 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.500
 main thing that we have and what it allows 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.500
 that everything takes place
