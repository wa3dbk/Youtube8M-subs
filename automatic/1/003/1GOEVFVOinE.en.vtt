colors um but it still feels really nice
on<00:03:22.840> your<00:03:22.960> lips<00:03:23.170> it's<00:03:23.350> it's<00:03:23.770> a<00:03:23.950> type<00:03:24.160> of

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
on your lips it's it's a type of

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.890 
on your lips it's it's a type of
lipstick<00:03:24.670> that<00:03:24.820> I<00:03:24.970> would<00:03:25.180> personally<00:03:25.420> wear

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
lipstick that I would personally wear

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.510 
lipstick that I would personally wear
because<00:03:26.080> I<00:03:26.230> don't<00:03:26.530> like<00:03:26.770> the<00:03:26.950> ones<00:03:27.100> that<00:03:27.250> dry

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
because I don't like the ones that dry

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:38.220 
because I don't like the ones that dry
out<00:03:27.730> your<00:03:27.910> lips<00:03:36.420> so<00:03:37.420> for<00:03:37.600> this<00:03:37.660> next<00:03:38.020> one<00:03:38.140> I'm

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
out your lips so for this next one I'm

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.690 
out your lips so for this next one I'm
going<00:03:38.380> to<00:03:38.470> try<00:03:38.650> just<00:03:38.680> putting<00:03:39.190> it<00:03:39.250> straight<00:03:39.370> on

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
going to try just putting it straight on

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.300 
going to try just putting it straight on
just<00:03:39.880> my<00:03:40.030> finger<00:03:40.570> and<00:03:40.900> and<00:03:41.470> just<00:03:41.860> see<00:03:42.040> if<00:03:42.130> that

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
just my finger and and just see if that

00:03:42.310 --> 00:04:10.500 
just my finger and and just see if that
makes<00:03:42.490> a<00:03:42.700> difference<00:03:43.120> with<00:03:43.420> how<00:03:43.690> it<00:03:43.870> applies

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.270 

so<00:04:11.510> this<00:04:12.110> one<00:04:12.440> is<00:04:12.800> the<00:04:13.220> color<00:04:13.690> alpha<00:04:14.690> I

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
so this one is the color alpha I

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.770 
so this one is the color alpha I
definitely<00:04:16.280> think<00:04:16.430> that<00:04:16.549> this<00:04:16.790> one<00:04:17.060> is<00:04:17.390> my

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
definitely think that this one is my

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.320 
definitely think that this one is my
favorite<00:04:18.350> so<00:04:18.620> far<00:04:18.650> it's<00:04:19.640> just<00:04:19.760> a<00:04:20.030> really

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
favorite so far it's just a really

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:25.240 
favorite so far it's just a really
beautiful<00:04:20.750> um<00:04:22.450> kind<00:04:23.450> of<00:04:23.890> it's<00:04:24.890> more<00:04:25.070> of<00:04:25.160> an

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
beautiful um kind of it's more of an

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.580 
beautiful um kind of it's more of an
orange<00:04:25.460> color<00:04:25.940> red<00:04:26.630> and<00:04:26.900> it's<00:04:27.020> definitely<00:04:27.560> a

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
orange color red and it's definitely a

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.620 
orange color red and it's definitely a
color<00:04:27.860> that<00:04:28.100> I<00:04:28.130> would<00:04:28.460> wear<00:04:28.730> and<00:04:29.030> I'm<00:04:29.120> really

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
color that I would wear and I'm really

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.630 
color that I would wear and I'm really
really<00:04:29.900> loving<00:04:30.140> it<00:04:30.320> now<00:04:30.740> I<00:04:30.770> tried<00:04:31.100> to<00:04:31.250> pop<00:04:31.430> this

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
really loving it now I tried to pop this

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.030 
really loving it now I tried to pop this
up<00:04:31.910> pop<00:04:32.540> this<00:04:32.750> one<00:04:32.810> on<00:04:33.110> with<00:04:33.230> my<00:04:33.410> finger<00:04:33.470> first

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
up pop this one on with my finger first

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.710 
up pop this one on with my finger first
dabbed<00:04:34.490> it<00:04:34.610> on<00:04:34.760> and<00:04:34.940> then<00:04:35.060> just<00:04:35.270> went<00:04:35.480> in<00:04:35.600> with

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
dabbed it on and then just went in with

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.440 
dabbed it on and then just went in with
a<00:04:35.780> brush<00:04:36.200> to<00:04:36.500> clean<00:04:36.830> up<00:04:36.980> the<00:04:37.130> edges<00:04:37.340> and<00:04:37.820> that

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
a brush to clean up the edges and that

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.660 
a brush to clean up the edges and that
definitely<00:04:38.780> worked<00:04:39.110> better<00:04:39.380> from<00:04:39.680> this<00:04:40.010> so

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
definitely worked better from this so

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.050 
definitely worked better from this so
that<00:04:41.150> leads<00:04:41.630> me<00:04:41.900> to<00:04:41.930> believe<00:04:42.380> that<00:04:42.850> with<00:04:43.850> the

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
that leads me to believe that with the

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.210 
that leads me to believe that with the
actual<00:04:44.480> stick<00:04:45.020> of<00:04:45.170> lipstick<00:04:45.620> you're<00:04:45.830> going<00:04:46.040> to

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
actual stick of lipstick you're going to

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.920 
actual stick of lipstick you're going to
get<00:04:46.370> a<00:04:46.400> lot<00:04:46.670> more<00:04:46.700> coverage<00:04:47.240> out<00:04:47.480> of<00:04:47.630> it<00:04:47.720> so

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
get a lot more coverage out of it so

00:04:47.930 --> 00:05:08.780 
get a lot more coverage out of it so
that's<00:04:48.080> really<00:04:48.500> great

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.750 

this<00:05:09.790> one<00:05:10.000> is<00:05:10.150> the<00:05:10.300> color<00:05:10.800> Emilie<00:05:11.800> yen<00:05:12.220> and<00:05:12.640> I'm

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
this one is the color Emilie yen and I'm

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.180 
this one is the color Emilie yen and I'm
sure<00:05:13.210> I'm<00:05:13.540> getting<00:05:13.870> that<00:05:14.170> wrong<00:05:14.500> but<00:05:14.980> it's

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
sure I'm getting that wrong but it's

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.900 
sure I'm getting that wrong but it's
number<00:05:16.080> 452<00:05:17.080> so<00:05:17.740> this<00:05:18.010> has<00:05:18.160> turned<00:05:18.340> out<00:05:18.550> a<00:05:18.610> lot

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
number 452 so this has turned out a lot

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.370 
number 452 so this has turned out a lot
different<00:05:19.330> to<00:05:19.450> what<00:05:19.600> it<00:05:19.720> looks<00:05:19.900> like<00:05:20.080> in<00:05:20.260> here

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
different to what it looks like in here

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.750 
different to what it looks like in here
I<00:05:20.410> thought<00:05:20.620> it<00:05:20.710> would<00:05:20.800> be<00:05:20.890> very<00:05:21.100> purple<00:05:21.610> but

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
I thought it would be very purple but

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.090 
I thought it would be very purple but
it's<00:05:21.880> um<00:05:22.060> kind<00:05:22.690> of<00:05:22.810> just<00:05:23.020> a<00:05:23.140> pinky<00:05:23.920> purple

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
it's um kind of just a pinky purple

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.370 
it's um kind of just a pinky purple
color<00:05:24.490> and<00:05:24.550> I<00:05:24.730> quite<00:05:25.030> like<00:05:25.270> it<00:05:25.480> I<00:05:25.600> really<00:05:25.630> do<00:05:26.170> um

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
color and I quite like it I really do um

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.950 
color and I quite like it I really do um
and<00:05:27.370> it's<00:05:27.790> definitely<00:05:28.090> a<00:05:28.210> color<00:05:28.480> that<00:05:28.660> I<00:05:28.780> would

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
and it's definitely a color that I would

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:39.990 
and it's definitely a color that I would
wear<00:05:29.110> often<00:05:37.980> that's<00:05:38.980> the<00:05:39.220> end<00:05:39.310> of<00:05:39.430> my<00:05:39.610> review

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
wear often that's the end of my review

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.500 
wear often that's the end of my review

that you like I quite liked them all one
of<00:06:10.750> them<00:06:10.930> I<00:06:11.080> wouldn't<00:06:11.470> wear<00:06:11.770> personally<00:06:12.370> but

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
of them I wouldn't wear personally but

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.520 
of them I wouldn't wear personally but
it<00:06:12.550> was<00:06:12.670> still<00:06:12.880> a<00:06:12.910> really<00:06:13.330> nice<00:06:13.510> color<00:06:13.840> now

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
it was still a really nice color now

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.740 
it was still a really nice color now
what<00:06:14.710> I<00:06:14.740> like<00:06:15.130> about<00:06:15.370> it<00:06:15.700> is<00:06:15.850> that<00:06:15.880> it<00:06:16.270> can<00:06:16.300> be

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
what I like about it is that it can be

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.960 
what I like about it is that it can be
more<00:06:17.260> sheer<00:06:17.710> so<00:06:18.070> and<00:06:18.220> look<00:06:18.340> like<00:06:18.520> a<00:06:18.550> bit<00:06:18.820> of<00:06:18.940> a

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
more sheer so and look like a bit of a

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.080 
more sheer so and look like a bit of a
lip<00:06:19.210> balm<00:06:19.420> it<00:06:20.140> says<00:06:20.590> on<00:06:20.920> the<00:06:21.310> back<00:06:21.490> here<00:06:21.850> that

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
lip balm it says on the back here that

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.890 
lip balm it says on the back here that
it<00:06:22.360> is<00:06:22.540> an<00:06:22.780> ultra<00:06:23.440> hydrating<00:06:23.740> lip<00:06:24.490> color<00:06:24.790> and<00:06:25.120> I

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
it is an ultra hydrating lip color and I

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.750 
it is an ultra hydrating lip color and I
do<00:06:25.960> think<00:06:26.710> that<00:06:26.770> that's<00:06:26.980> true<00:06:27.400> because<00:06:27.520> it

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760 
do think that that's true because it

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.850 
do think that that's true because it
feels<00:06:28.150> like<00:06:28.540> I'm<00:06:28.960> wearing<00:06:29.290> a

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
feels like I'm wearing a

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.999 
feels like I'm wearing a
farm<00:06:30.069> right<00:06:30.280> now<00:06:30.490> so<00:06:31.150> that's<00:06:31.810> the<00:06:32.050> end<00:06:32.169> of<00:06:32.349> this

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:33.009 
farm right now so that's the end of this
