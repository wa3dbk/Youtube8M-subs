00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello today we are going to teach how to do 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.000
 Chamoy apples 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.000
 or tamarind 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:16.460
 first you are going to buy the apples in the 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:19.300
 super then you are going to buy the chamoy 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.280
 or the tamarind 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:28.010
 and it's coming to prepare well 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.010
 later since you washed the apple 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.620
 You can grab a piece of tamarind or 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:38.870
 chamoy and put it and scattering in the 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.449
 apple or grab one 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.960
 to make it thinner and put it on 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.960
 Apple 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.949
 You can also put the dough on a plate 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.870
 and you can put it to melt but that's not 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.879
 very convenient that we say 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:05.659
 we prefer to knead it should be like that 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.659
 of thickness not too broad or too thin 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:13.760
 and that's how it has to come by staying 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.760
 here is another sample too 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.469
 it is better to fill the center to be 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.759
 of better quality and that's how it is 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:25.759
 apple must end 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.340
 and in the end to eat 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.340
 let's start the apple and then 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.330
 eat it to taste is recommended that the 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.830
 take an adult because he is very hard 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.740
 also the apples are for 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.110
 Enjoy them with your friends or friends or 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.210
 relatives can also be a gift 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.210
 very nice but you know
