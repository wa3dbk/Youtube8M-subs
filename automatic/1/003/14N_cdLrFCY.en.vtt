00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.290 
an amazing price for those shoes because

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
they were so expensive before and I

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.700 
they were so expensive before and I
always<00:02:23.540> feel<00:02:23.810> really<00:02:23.990> bad<00:02:24.110> spending<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:24.560> lot<00:02:24.680> of

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.640 
always feel really bad spending a lot of
money<00:02:24.920> on<00:02:25.010> shoes<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.640> then<00:02:26.540> I<00:02:27.020> just<00:02:27.350> couldn't

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
money on shoes and then I just couldn't

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
pretty so these us again Kurt Geiger

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.260 
pretty so these us again Kurt Geiger
still<00:02:42.380> haven't<00:02:42.680> left<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.280> shop<00:02:43.550> and<00:02:43.820> I<00:02:43.970> was<00:02:44.090> at

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
still haven't left the shop and I was at

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.210 
still haven't left the shop and I was at
this<00:02:44.450> point<00:02:44.720> trying<00:02:44.990> to<00:02:45.200> justify<00:02:45.560> how<00:02:45.950> I<00:02:45.980> could

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
this point trying to justify how I could

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.310 
this point trying to justify how I could
possibly<00:02:46.370> buy<00:02:46.730> another<00:02:47.150> pair<00:02:47.360> of<00:02:47.420> shoes<00:02:47.780> but

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
possibly buy another pair of shoes but

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.770 
possibly buy another pair of shoes but
these<00:02:48.590> are<00:02:48.890> mahoosive<00:02:49.430> lehigh<00:02:49.970> so<00:02:50.450> if<00:02:50.660> you're

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
these are mahoosive lehigh so if you're

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.930 
these are mahoosive lehigh so if you're
not<00:02:51.080> used<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.380> walking<00:02:51.560> in<00:02:51.800> high<00:02:51.980> heels<00:02:52.010> these

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
not used to walking in high heels these

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.760 
not used to walking in high heels these
will<00:02:53.090> probably<00:02:53.330> be<00:02:53.420> super<00:02:53.720> super<00:02:53.840> high<00:02:54.110> but

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
will probably be super super high but

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.920 
will probably be super super high but
for<00:02:54.950> me<00:02:55.130> I<00:02:55.460> would<00:02:55.910> probably<00:02:56.180> only<00:02:56.450> wear<00:02:56.720> these

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
for me I would probably only wear these

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.770 
for me I would probably only wear these
for<00:02:57.500> about<00:02:57.560> a<00:02:58.010> couple<00:02:58.490> of<00:02:58.700> hours<00:02:58.850> and<00:02:59.360> then<00:02:59.660> my

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
for about a couple of hours and then my

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.510 
for about a couple of hours and then my
feet<00:02:59.990> are<00:03:00.170> definitely<00:03:00.590> going<00:03:00.709> to<00:03:00.800> hurt<00:03:00.980> but<00:03:01.490> I

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
feet are definitely going to hurt but I

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.860 
feet are definitely going to hurt but I
love<00:03:01.790> them<00:03:01.970> because<00:03:02.090> they<00:03:02.330> have<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.480> little<00:03:02.720> bow

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
love them because they have a little bow

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.360 
love them because they have a little bow
on<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.050> back<00:03:03.170> which<00:03:03.410> is<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.709> best<00:03:03.890> part<00:03:04.220> and

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
on the back which is the best part and

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.310 
on the back which is the best part and

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
you can pull that boat out as well

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.260 
you can pull that boat out as well
depending<00:03:06.620> on<00:03:06.890> how<00:03:07.070> you<00:03:07.130> want<00:03:07.250> to<00:03:07.459> wear<00:03:07.580> the

further as well so it's just so key I
think<00:03:13.190> their<00:03:13.459> proper<00:03:13.760> little<00:03:13.970> kind<00:03:14.330> of

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
think their proper little kind of

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.440 
think their proper little kind of
Cinderella's<00:03:15.800> shoes<00:03:16.000> absolutely<00:03:17.000> love<00:03:17.180> them

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
Cinderella's shoes absolutely love them

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.720 
Cinderella's shoes absolutely love them
and<00:03:17.989> I<00:03:18.110> thought<00:03:18.290> they<00:03:18.470> were<00:03:18.560> beautiful<00:03:18.739> so<00:03:19.400> and

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
and I thought they were beautiful so and

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.520 
and I thought they were beautiful so and
again<00:03:20.090> they<00:03:20.420> will<00:03:20.540> reduce<00:03:20.900> their<00:03:21.140> like<00:03:21.320> half

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
again they will reduce their like half

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.670 
again they will reduce their like half
price<00:03:21.860> so<00:03:23.050> probably<00:03:24.050> shouldn't<00:03:24.440> have<00:03:24.530> bought

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
price so probably shouldn't have bought

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.500 
price so probably shouldn't have bought
them<00:03:24.920> but<00:03:25.280> I<00:03:25.340> do<00:03:25.519> wear<00:03:25.790> a<00:03:25.850> lot<00:03:26.000> of<00:03:26.030> high<00:03:26.239> heels

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
them but I do wear a lot of high heels

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.090 
them but I do wear a lot of high heels
and<00:03:26.810> I<00:03:26.870> do<00:03:26.930> wear<00:03:27.200> a<00:03:27.230> lot<00:03:27.380> of<00:03:27.410> black<00:03:27.590> cheese<00:03:27.830> and

and I do wear a lot of black cheese and

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.240 
and I do wear a lot of black cheese and
these<00:03:28.220> are<00:03:28.340> nice<00:03:28.459> because<00:03:28.670> they're<00:03:28.940> suede<00:03:29.239> and

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
these are nice because they're suede and

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.640 
these are nice because they're suede and
again<00:03:31.250> padding<00:03:31.820> inside<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:32.870> did<00:03:33.170> I<00:03:33.290> need<00:03:33.500> to

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
friends and stuff in the sales because

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:27.909 
friends and stuff in the sales because
you<00:05:26.599> can<00:05:26.780> get<00:05:26.900> the<00:05:27.020> stuff<00:05:27.289> that's<00:05:27.530> way<00:05:27.710> better

and<00:05:28.280> it's<00:05:28.520> also<00:05:28.699> cheaper<00:05:29.030> so<00:05:29.539> I<00:05:29.720> think<00:05:29.990> that's

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
and it's also cheaper so I think that's

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:31.930 
and it's also cheaper so I think that's
the<00:05:30.199> cool<00:05:30.440> idea<00:05:30.770> as<00:05:30.889> well<00:05:30.919> so<00:05:31.460> if<00:05:31.550> the<00:05:31.669> sales

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
the cool idea as well so if the sales

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.999 
the cool idea as well so if the sales
are<00:05:32.060> still<00:05:32.210> on<00:05:32.360> where<00:05:32.570> you<00:05:32.690> are<00:05:32.870> go<00:05:33.380> check<00:05:33.830> out
