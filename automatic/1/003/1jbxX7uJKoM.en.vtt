00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.370
 hi hello killion i hope you are 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.080
 pretty good and we're in a new way 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.420
 script and the truth that is pretty 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.010
 great and good as you know I will always leave 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.380
 in the description the link where 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.750
 you can download the link link link 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.510
 something saw but when we go with the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.970
 review and as they saw in the title it 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.630
 it's about an instantaneous elevator 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.430
 instant so literally and ok like 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.960
 is that it is done because it is quite simple 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.970
 can be the floors that you want 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.180
 although there are times that you jump some 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.829
 floor so with three floors that is like 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.960
 I did it good, it's four but 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.120
 some of them I think that does not have 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.550
 nothing inside that with three floors 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.040
 works well with more like that already 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.980
 it works a little weird and good as 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.170
 can see in the part here I have a 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.320
 kind of structure in my elevator 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.690
 wood is ecological good not so much 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.700
 because such masters trees to rays ok to 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.079
 Much silly and good as you can see 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.780
 I have two blocks from here 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.869
 of chopped stone wilson I think if you 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:09.130
 called psychic cane and ok have here what 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:11.560
 which is a good yellow flower to 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.229
 both sides and ok depends on the color of 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.789
 flower is what you go what you are going to do if 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.100
 is that you have something down or something up 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:21.670
 with the yellow flower what we do is 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.509
 go up and there will be a second there is that this 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.310
 flu that is going to give me very very cannon and 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.170
 well with the yellow flower we go up and 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.479
 we must always touch with what is 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.069
 a torch and you must be careful 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.409
 because what you see is that the torches 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:37.690
 they are put here and at some point because 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.880
 they run out without torches and then they 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.289
 will be trapped and well if I give it 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.360
 here says op 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.250
 and as you can see we are in the part of 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.039
 up I think we went to the 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.690
 penultimate it seems to me and how first is the 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.490
 same structure but in this case 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.009
 we have one 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.140
 and a blue torch because if I give it 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.930
 here I will go down 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.170
 ok we went down and went down ok we had 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.420
 climbed too much but this is a floor 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.050
 intermediate and if I give it back down 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.440
 we go to the beginning so it's pretty 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.330
 crazy if I give it here very well and we 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.890
 go up to the top we skipped an apartment 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.910
 as I said and I give it one more time 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:22.180
 we are at the top and so I want today almost 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.920
 I kill myself and that's how simple this mode is 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.549
 here there are pure blue because I do not know 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.670
 can go up we can down and it lowers us 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.769
 until the second floor it seems to me again 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.170
 if we go to the ground floor here we 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.660
 sent to the third floor or well I think 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.880
 that if I do not know but the truth is that 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.590
 pretty cool this mod 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.180
 I'll leave the link in the description so 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.590
 nothing I hope you liked 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.049

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.370
 made a comment and we will see in 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.890
 a following video lately been 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.650
 it's going up a lot of ways I know it but 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.990
 As I said before, I want to 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.110
 to take advantage of 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.720
 before the 0.9 comes out so nothing 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.690
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:08.510

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.510
