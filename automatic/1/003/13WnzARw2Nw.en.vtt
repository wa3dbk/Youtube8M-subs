a top a funnel and filter filter in a

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.229 
a top a funnel and filter filter in a
file<00:00:36.970> put<00:00:37.970> them<00:00:38.180> there<00:00:39.910> plasti<00:00:40.910> dip<00:00:40.940> out<00:00:41.210> of

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
file put them there plasti dip out of

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:48.280 
file put them there plasti dip out of
one<00:00:45.970> now<00:00:46.970> what<00:00:47.120> you<00:00:47.150> want<00:00:47.420> to<00:00:47.449> do<00:00:47.629> is<00:00:48.019> basically

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
one now what you want to do is basically

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.070 
one now what you want to do is basically
is<00:00:48.979> because<00:00:49.430> you<00:00:50.150> want<00:00:50.330> 10<00:00:50.540> liters<00:00:50.809> of<00:00:50.900> mixed

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
is because you want 10 liters of mixed

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.579 
is because you want 10 liters of mixed
product<00:00:51.409> your<00:00:52.280> fifty<00:00:52.820> percent<00:00:53.390> thinner<00:00:53.900> fifty

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
product your fifty percent thinner fifty

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:56.920 
product your fifty percent thinner fifty
percent<00:00:54.830> plasti<00:00:55.220> dip<00:00:55.250> in<00:00:55.550> both<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:56.030> tops<00:00:56.239> so

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
percent plasti dip in both the tops so

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.619 
percent plasti dip in both the tops so
the<00:00:57.379> easiest<00:00:57.559> way<00:00:58.070> to<00:00:58.129> do<00:00:58.370> that<00:00:58.430> is<00:00:58.820> to<00:00:59.059> get<00:00:59.479> the

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
the easiest way to do that is to get the

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.500 
the easiest way to do that is to get the
funnel<00:01:00.250> put<00:01:01.250> it<00:01:01.339> in<00:01:01.460> there<00:01:01.670> and<00:01:04.000> pour<00:01:05.000> half<00:01:05.269> of

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
funnel put it in there and pour half of

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.310 
funnel put it in there and pour half of
this<00:01:05.600> container<00:01:06.080> into<00:01:06.470> that<00:01:06.799> container<00:01:08.320> now

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
this container into that container now

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.789 
this container into that container now
as<00:01:09.560> this<00:01:09.950> is<00:01:10.159> go<00:01:10.310> exactly<00:01:10.640> five<00:01:11.090> liters<00:01:11.479> in<00:01:11.630> it

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
as this is go exactly five liters in it

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.110 
as this is go exactly five liters in it
and<00:01:12.799> you<00:01:12.950> want<00:01:13.130> to<00:01:13.310> and<00:01:13.490> our<00:01:13.580> fleet<00:01:13.850> is<00:01:13.970> in

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
and you want to and our fleet is in

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.090 
and you want to and our fleet is in
there<00:01:14.330> it's<00:01:14.720> quite<00:01:14.990> an<00:01:15.110> easy<00:01:15.200> process<00:01:15.560> because

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
there it's quite an easy process because

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.590 
there it's quite an easy process because
basically<00:01:16.310> you<00:01:16.549> just<00:01:16.610> pour<00:01:16.969> off<00:01:17.119> a<00:01:17.149> bit<00:01:17.509> in

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
basically you just pour off a bit in

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.050 
basically you just pour off a bit in
there<00:01:20.380> which<00:01:21.380> is<00:01:21.409> just<00:01:21.649> wanna<00:01:21.950> guess<00:01:22.189> what<00:01:22.219> to

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
there which is just wanna guess what to

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.029 
there which is just wanna guess what to
start<00:01:23.329> with<00:01:23.509> but<00:01:23.719> after<00:01:24.049> a<00:01:24.110> while<00:01:24.289> the<00:01:24.710> end<00:01:24.920> of

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
start with but after a while the end of

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.910 
start with but after a while the end of
it<00:01:25.189> but<00:01:25.880> for<00:01:26.090> them<00:01:26.210> up<00:01:26.329> you<00:01:26.780> see<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:27.409> not<00:01:27.500> equal

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
it but for them up you see and not equal

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.289 
it but for them up you see and not equal
so<00:01:28.219> you<00:01:28.310> want<00:01:28.460> a<00:01:28.490> bit<00:01:28.609> more<00:01:28.640> in<00:01:28.939> there<00:01:31.119> you<00:01:32.119> can

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
so you want a bit more in there you can

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.740 
so you want a bit more in there you can
pour<00:01:32.600> in<00:01:32.780> a<00:01:32.869> jug<00:01:33.140> mix<00:01:33.530> up<00:01:33.740> mix<00:01:34.549> you<00:01:35.210> know<00:01:35.270> 500

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
pour in a jug mix up mix you know 500

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.200 
pour in a jug mix up mix you know 500
bit<00:01:36.200> of<00:01:36.409> time<00:01:36.590> or<00:01:36.799> whatever<00:01:37.100> or<00:01:37.850> you<00:01:37.939> can<00:01:38.090> just

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
bit of time or whatever or you can just

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.929 
bit of time or whatever or you can just
do<00:01:38.420> it<00:01:38.450> this<00:01:38.630> way<00:01:38.869> which<00:01:39.109> is<00:01:39.259> a<00:01:39.640> little<00:01:40.640> easier

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
do it this way which is a little easier

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.510 
do it this way which is a little easier
and<00:01:41.270> just<00:01:41.469> as<00:01:42.469> accurate<00:01:42.649> develops<00:01:43.340> because

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
and just as accurate develops because

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.649 
and just as accurate develops because
you<00:01:44.179> know<00:01:44.359> for<00:01:44.600> a<00:01:44.630> fact<00:01:44.810> okay<00:01:46.450> once<00:01:47.450> that

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
you know for a fact okay once that

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.169 
you know for a fact okay once that
selves<00:01:48.200> you've<00:01:49.100> got<00:01:49.219> fifty<00:01:49.579> percent<00:01:49.850> in<00:01:50.030> there

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
selves you've got fifty percent in there

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:51.459 
selves you've got fifty percent in there
are<00:01:50.299> fifty<00:01:50.600> percent<00:01:50.899> in<00:01:51.049> there<00:01:51.200> or<00:01:51.289> where<00:01:51.380> they

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469 
are fifty percent in there or where they

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:54.340 
are fifty percent in there or where they
wouldn't<00:01:51.770> be<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.070> same<00:01:52.250> point<00:01:53.350> probably

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
wouldn't be the same point probably

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.889 
wouldn't be the same point probably
going<00:01:54.679> a<00:01:54.740> bit<00:01:54.859> too<00:01:54.920> far<00:01:55.390> right<00:01:56.390> cut<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.630> mill

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
going a bit too far right cut the mill

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:07.089 
going a bit too far right cut the mill
so<00:01:57.170> just<00:01:57.380> wants<00:01:57.530> a<00:01:57.590> splash<00:01:57.920> back<00:01:58.219> in<00:01:58.369> there

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:12.860 

bang<00:02:08.099> all<00:02:08.280> there<00:02:08.489> let<00:02:09.060> me<00:02:09.179> without<00:02:09.410> follow<00:02:11.870> but

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
bang all there let me without follow but

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.390 
bang all there let me without follow but
so<00:02:13.349> now<00:02:13.560> we've<00:02:14.459> got<00:02:15.920> fifty<00:02:16.920> percent<00:02:17.190> in<00:02:17.400> each

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
so now we've got fifty percent in each

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.640 
so now we've got fifty percent in each
what<00:02:20.400> we<00:02:20.489> do<00:02:20.670> now<00:02:20.879> is<00:02:21.180> get<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.480> plastidip<00:02:21.989> take

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
what we do now is get the plastidip take

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.650 
what we do now is get the plastidip take
the<00:02:22.799> lid<00:02:22.950> off<00:02:22.980> we<00:02:23.730> go<00:02:23.849> back<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.060> another<00:02:24.299> funnel

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
the lid off we go back to another funnel

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.930 
the lid off we go back to another funnel
now<00:02:25.410> there's<00:02:25.590> no<00:02:25.680> point<00:02:25.950> in<00:02:26.040> fear<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.519> plastic

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
now there's no point in fear and plastic

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.080 
now there's no point in fear and plastic
it<00:02:27.060> because<00:02:27.690> it's<00:02:28.260> way<00:02:28.500> too<00:02:28.560> thin<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.819> you<00:02:29.940> have

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
it because it's way too thin so you have

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.720 
it because it's way too thin so you have
to<00:02:30.209> have<00:02:30.330> quite<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:30.629> heavy<00:02:31.019> or<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.010> large<00:02:32.340> case<00:02:32.700> I

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
to have quite a heavy or a large case I

I love 600 local or something stupid
like<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.579> any<00:02:39.329> dirts<00:02:39.599> going<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:39.930> go<00:02:39.989> straight

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
like that any dirts going to go straight

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.780 
like that any dirts going to go straight
furrow<00:02:40.470> anyway<00:02:40.799> so<00:02:40.860> there's<00:02:41.160> no<00:02:41.280> point<00:02:41.489> in<00:02:41.670> the

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
furrow anyway so there's no point in the

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.720 
furrow anyway so there's no point in the
filter<00:02:42.000> in<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.180> plastic<00:02:42.690> now<00:02:43.130> obviously<00:02:44.130> five

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
filter in the plastic now obviously five

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.509 
filter in the plastic now obviously five
liters<00:02:45.180> on<00:02:45.390> these<00:02:45.599> tops<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:46.890> point

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
liters on these tops is to that point

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.030 
liters on these tops is to that point
there<00:02:48.470> obviously<00:02:49.470> this<00:02:49.860> is<00:02:50.459> a<00:02:50.610> five-link<00:02:51.120> tub

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
there obviously this is a five-link tub

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:04.280 
there obviously this is a five-link tub
so<00:02:53.040> what<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.670> would<00:02:53.760> do<00:02:58.129> get<00:02:59.129> the<00:02:59.220> plasti<00:02:59.640> dip

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:14.260 

pour<00:03:04.920> it<00:03:05.159> into<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.610> container<00:03:06.090> with<00:03:06.360> Athena's

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:26.030 

you

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.910 

looks<00:03:27.040> like

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
looks like

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:36.870 
looks like
Oh<00:03:29.010> touch<00:03:30.000> more

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.350 

that's<00:03:37.450> it<00:03:37.630> so<00:03:38.620> now<00:03:38.770> you've<00:03:39.220> got<00:03:39.580> five<00:03:40.150> that

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
that's it so now you've got five that

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.180 
that's it so now you've got five that
your<00:03:40.480> container<00:03:40.840> there<00:03:41.110> fifty<00:03:41.620> percent<00:03:41.890> fina

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
your container there fifty percent fina

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.730 
your container there fifty percent fina
fifty<00:03:43.120> percent<00:03:43.360> place<00:03:43.630> did<00:03:43.870> it<00:03:44.020> now<00:03:44.500> what<00:03:44.650> we

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
fifty percent place did it now what we

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:50.160 
fifty percent place did it now what we
would<00:03:44.890> do<00:03:45.070> with<00:03:45.790> this<00:03:45.820> one<00:03:48.750> it's<00:03:49.750> basically

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
would do with this one it's basically

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:57.560 
would do with this one it's basically
you<00:03:50.710> pour<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.280> fin<00:03:51.760> up<00:03:51.910> out<00:03:52.630> of<00:03:52.690> this<00:03:52.900> one

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:11.080 

straight<00:03:58.570> in<00:03:58.690> there

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.809 

but<00:04:11.660> you<00:04:11.780> could<00:04:11.959> use<00:04:11.989> the<00:04:12.379> funnel<00:04:12.739> because<00:04:13.220> you

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
but you could use the funnel because you

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.790 
but you could use the funnel because you
could<00:04:14.030> use<00:04:14.239> the<00:04:14.420> funnel<00:04:14.780> but<00:04:15.349> you're<00:04:15.650> just

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
could use the funnel but you're just

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.229 
could use the funnel but you're just
going<00:04:15.950> to<00:04:16.010> contaminate<00:04:16.280> it<00:04:16.549> because<00:04:16.820> this<00:04:17.120> has

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
going to contaminate it because this has

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.990 
going to contaminate it because this has
got<00:04:17.419> casted<00:04:17.780> in<00:04:17.930> broken<00:04:18.290> neck<00:04:18.669> and<00:04:19.669> you<00:04:19.820> want

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
got casted in broken neck and you want

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.150 
got casted in broken neck and you want
to<00:04:20.060> mix<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:20.359> two<00:04:20.510> really<00:04:20.930> so<00:04:21.320> this<00:04:21.889> is<00:04:21.919> the

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
to mix the two really so this is the

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.800 
to mix the two really so this is the
only<00:04:22.250> one<00:04:22.490> as<00:04:22.639> you<00:04:22.729> saw<00:04:22.910> i<00:04:22.940> just<00:04:23.330> did<00:04:23.479> then<00:04:23.630> i

only one as you saw i just did then i

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.000 
only one as you saw i just did then i
was<00:04:23.900> looking<00:04:24.199> away<00:04:24.580> yeah<00:04:25.580> bit<00:04:25.790> messy<00:04:26.180> but

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
was looking away yeah bit messy but

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.100 
was looking away yeah bit messy but
reality<00:04:28.010> once<00:04:28.850> you<00:04:29.030> empty<00:04:29.330> this<00:04:29.630> container

experiment<00:05:26.170> was<00:05:26.260> 64<00:05:26.770> point<00:05:26.920> 75<00:05:27.490> e<00:05:27.550> mix<00:05:28.540> this<00:05:28.690> up

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
experiment was 64 point 75 e mix this up

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.840 
experiment was 64 point 75 e mix this up
like<00:05:29.080> that<00:05:29.200> that's<00:05:29.890> fine<00:05:30.130> you've<00:05:30.640> got<00:05:30.760> the

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850 
like that that's fine you've got the

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.310 
like that that's fine you've got the
potential<00:05:31.150> abuse<00:05:31.600> we<00:05:31.780> just<00:05:31.960> need<00:05:32.080> to<00:05:32.170> measure

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
potential abuse we just need to measure

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.380 
potential abuse we just need to measure
it<00:05:32.440> differently<00:05:32.860> I<00:05:33.100> would<00:05:33.640> really<00:05:33.790> advise<00:05:34.150> it

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
it differently I would really advise it

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:35.940 
it differently I would really advise it
because<00:05:34.540> you<00:05:34.870> end<00:05:34.990> up<00:05:35.140> it's<00:05:35.380> been<00:05:35.590> driving<00:05:35.920> a

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
texture and we furry it won't just look

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.910 
texture and we furry it won't just look
hot<00:05:39.430> it<00:05:39.850> won't<00:05:40.060> look<00:05:40.180> as<00:05:40.330> nice<00:05:40.860> fifty-fifty<00:05:41.860> is

by<00:05:42.100> far<00:05:42.340> the<00:05:42.400> best<00:05:42.760> is<00:05:43.090> the<00:05:43.390> I<00:05:44.050> use<00:05:44.320> from<00:05:44.560> on

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
by far the best is the I use from on

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.340 
by far the best is the I use from on
paper<00:05:44.860> customers<00:05:45.310> cars<00:05:45.900> everyone<00:05:46.900> recommends

to<00:05:47.500> use<00:05:47.680> that<00:05:47.920> so<00:05:48.490> there<00:05:49.270> you<00:05:49.300> go<00:05:49.390> that's<00:05:49.840> how

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
to use that so there you go that's how

00:05:50.020 --> 00:06:08.439 
to use that so there you go that's how
easy<00:05:50.230> is<00:05:51.660> right
