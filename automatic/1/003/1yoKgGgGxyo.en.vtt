00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
a lot of the icons so on the icons

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.599 
a lot of the icons so on the icons
themselves<00:00:37.589> you<00:00:37.679> get<00:00:37.800> more<00:00:37.949> of<00:00:38.039> a<00:00:38.100> gradient

on the bottom that snowy gradient look
which<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:43.920> actually<00:00:44.010> think<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.429> a<00:00:44.460> really<00:00:44.670> good

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
which I actually think is a really good

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.599 
which I actually think is a really good
addition<00:00:45.300> kind<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.600> as<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.719> flavor<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.609> to

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
addition kind of as a flavor to the to

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:50.720

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
that's pretty cool now one of the

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.059 
that's pretty cool now one of the
biggest<00:02:29.500> arguments<00:02:30.500> when<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.739> motorola

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
biggest arguments when the motorola

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.710 
biggest arguments when the motorola
atrix<00:02:31.190> came<00:02:31.640> out<00:02:31.849> or<00:02:32.060> one<00:02:32.420> of<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.540> biggest

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
atrix came out or one of the biggest

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.420 
atrix came out or one of the biggest
disappointments<00:02:33.470> is<00:02:33.590> that<00:02:33.920> it<00:02:34.190> was<00:02:34.340> an

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
disappointments is that it was an

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.039 
disappointments is that it was an
