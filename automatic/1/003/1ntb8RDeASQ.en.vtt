spider and your sockets in bow this boat
will<00:01:00.020> practically<00:01:01.020> always<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:03.350> now<00:01:04.350> if<00:01:04.530> you

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
will practically always it now if you

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:15.850 
will practically always it now if you
can<00:01:04.860> get<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> mop<00:01:05.369> here<00:01:07.040> for<00:01:08.040> example<00:01:13.549> let's<00:01:14.549> see

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
can get a mop here for example let's see

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:27.920 
can get a mop here for example let's see
this<00:01:17.450> so<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:18.600> called<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.900> big<00:01:25.820> and<00:01:26.840> in<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
this so it's called a big and in the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.130 
this so it's called a big and in the
very<00:01:28.049> same<00:01:28.380> time<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.220> display<00:01:29.880> what<00:01:30.750> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
very same time I can display what the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.770 
very same time I can display what the
type<00:01:31.380> arrows<00:01:31.860> does<00:01:32.479> first<00:01:33.479> we<00:01:33.659> have<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
type arrows does first we have the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.740 
type arrows does first we have the
explosive<00:01:34.170> arrow<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:35.340> explosive<00:01:36.270> arrow<00:01:36.479> is

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
explosive arrow the explosive arrow is

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.350 
explosive arrow the explosive arrow is
like<00:01:37.079> just<00:01:37.770> affordable<00:01:38.250> TT<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.909> will<00:01:39.090> explode

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
like just affordable TT it will explode

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
like just affordable TT it will explode
on<00:01:39.630> impact<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:41.240> look<00:01:42.240> at<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> pig<00:01:42.659> I'm<00:01:42.899> not

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
on impact and look at a pig I'm not

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.499 
on impact and look at a pig I'm not
aiming<00:01:43.590> for<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.070> now<00:01:44.250> and

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
aiming for it now and

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.050 
aiming for it now and
still<00:01:47.509> aim<00:01:47.689> for<00:01:47.930> it<00:01:48.340> so<00:01:49.340> that's<00:01:49.729> what<00:01:49.939> the

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
still aim for it so that's what the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.800 
still aim for it so that's what the
explosive<00:01:50.960> arrow<00:01:51.229> does<00:01:52.060> now<00:01:53.060> we'll<00:01:53.329> go<00:01:53.570> to<00:01:53.630> the

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
explosive arrow does now we'll go to the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.170 
explosive arrow does now we'll go to the
normal<00:01:54.229> bow<00:01:54.439> so<00:01:55.040> we<00:01:55.220> won't<00:01:55.460> aim<00:01:55.700> for<00:01:56.000> any

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
normal bow so we won't aim for any

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.560 
normal bow so we won't aim for any
seasons<00:01:56.899> we<00:01:57.020> need<00:01:57.170> to<00:01:57.290> test<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:58.700> autumn<00:01:58.939> the

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
seasons we need to test the autumn the

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.340 
seasons we need to test the autumn the
other<00:01:59.689> arrows<00:02:01.509> so<00:02:02.509> we'll<00:02:02.780> throw<00:02:03.020> that<00:02:03.200> one

other arrows so we'll throw that one

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.440 
other arrows so we'll throw that one
away<00:02:05.860> then<00:02:06.860> we<00:02:07.009> go<00:02:07.189> test<00:02:07.520> out<00:02:07.670> our<00:02:08.030> other

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
away then we go test out our other

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.440 
away then we go test out our other
arrows<00:02:08.869> we<00:02:09.590> have<00:02:09.769> the<00:02:10.130> fire<00:02:10.369> arrow<00:02:10.670> this<00:02:11.180> well

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
arrows we have the fire arrow this well

arrows we have the fire arrow this well
as<00:02:11.720> name<00:02:12.560> says<00:02:12.890> it<00:02:13.000> will<00:02:14.000> put<00:02:14.209> things<00:02:14.450> on<00:02:14.569> fire

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
as name says it will put things on fire

Oh accidentally use the Lightning arrow
that<00:02:22.549> was<00:02:23.890> that<00:02:24.890> was<00:02:25.040> just<00:02:25.400> beyond<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.940> pic

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
that was that was just beyond the pic

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.949 
that was that was just beyond the pic
spawner<00:02:26.630> and<00:02:27.700> what<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:28.819> practically<00:02:29.420> does<00:02:29.630> it

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
spawner and what it practically does it

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.550 
spawner and what it practically does it
yeah<00:02:30.769> it<00:02:31.040> sends<00:02:31.430> lightning<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.720> plan<00:02:33.019> to

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
yeah it sends lightning to the plan to

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.240 
yeah it sends lightning to the plan to
the<00:02:33.739> place<00:02:34.430> where<00:02:35.360> you<00:02:35.540> aim<00:02:35.750> now<00:02:36.560> we<00:02:36.980> have<00:02:37.100> here

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
the place where you aim now we have here

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.600 
the place where you aim now we have here
a<00:02:37.280> fire<00:02:37.640> arrow<00:02:38.410> very<00:02:39.410> simple<00:02:39.920> it<00:02:40.130> will<00:02:40.340> ignite

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
a fire arrow very simple it will ignite

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.360 
a fire arrow very simple it will ignite
place<00:02:41.569> on<00:02:41.750> impacts<00:02:42.350> as<00:02:42.620> you<00:02:42.920> see<00:02:43.160> using<00:02:43.670> a<00:02:43.730> fire

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370

place on impacts as you see using a fire
the<00:02:46.370> ice<00:02:46.549> arrow<00:02:47.260> this<00:02:48.260> is<00:02:48.519> practically<00:02:49.519> in

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
the ice arrow this is practically in

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.220 
the ice arrow this is practically in
interesting<00:02:50.540> because<00:02:52.810> because<00:02:53.810> this<00:02:53.989> error

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
interesting because because this error

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.060 
interesting because because this error
will<00:02:54.350> freeze<00:02:55.070> water<00:02:55.340> but<00:02:55.760> also<00:02:56.590> make<00:02:57.590> obsidian

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
will freeze water but also make obsidian

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:05.349 
will freeze water but also make obsidian
from<00:02:58.579> magma<00:03:00.220> so<00:03:01.220> if<00:03:01.549> we<00:03:01.640> use<00:03:02.180> our<00:03:02.420> bow<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:05.090> see

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
from magma so if we use our bow you see

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:10.960 
from magma so if we use our bow you see
it's<00:03:05.660> ice<00:03:08.380> now<00:03:09.380> the<00:03:09.769> final<00:03:09.950> arrow<00:03:10.250> is<00:03:10.549> the<00:03:10.790> egg

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
it's ice now the final arrow is the egg

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.380 
it's ice now the final arrow is the egg
arrow<00:03:11.359> it<00:03:11.690> is<00:03:12.049> a<00:03:12.079> secret<00:03:12.680> attached<00:03:13.220> to<00:03:13.250> it<00:03:13.519> so<00:03:13.910> i

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
arrow it is a secret attached to it so i

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.550 
arrow it is a secret attached to it so i
will<00:03:14.900> not<00:03:15.170> say<00:03:15.470> that<00:03:16.100> secret<00:03:16.430> yet<00:03:16.959> but<00:03:17.959> what<00:03:18.380> is
