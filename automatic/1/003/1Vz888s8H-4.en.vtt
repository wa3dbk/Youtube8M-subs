00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.900
 I am I have I in 2006 when I have the reaction of Rutte to the words of one 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.690
 year and currently runs a mend that the united states find 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.789
 the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.239
 it is a lot more expensive and costly 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:22.539
 sculpture is at the same time one 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.739
 that is what I want here now, totally golf under the motto leaked from a futuristic one 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:31.550
 space shuttle that there are just one state of the world that has three different and 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.339
 steps then one can just imagine it is the search for a new union 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.640
 the moment people get touched by the sculpture that we like it very much 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.640
 satisfied people try to look at the 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.250
 Homeowners who have their people living in a tent caravan 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.810
 of course it's a bit 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.810
 10 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.070
 it was the backer consists of 32 played like 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.960

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.640
 the first round 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.890
 with the walls and thereby stop the transport towards Ghent 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.710
 of course trucks hoped for the winning pieces before the end 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.220
 because they feel like paving stones on quiet ground 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.890
 connect and has a pretty good job 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.640
 then works through a giant crane that it can be found on the roof to indicate 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.510
 People come to the thought that he has never solved the people instead of it 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.620
 and you can all walk outside and denmark the many the phones that 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.310
 the whole event followed more where other people become than a team 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.060
 he still plans the bivouac 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.130
 by putting on and that the officer has shown a lot of Marianne 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.130
 want a picture 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.110
 in which eleven contests led to make small models to women 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.099
 the imagination in the virtual world 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.730
 over 44 percent like this chance to get away from your dream 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.730
 to study 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.259
 the

 You will come to the next steps include the fence and a topless 

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:24.979
