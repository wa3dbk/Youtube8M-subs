now<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.580> only<00:03:06.790> thing<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:07.090> I<00:03:07.299> had<00:03:07.450> an<00:03:07.569> issue

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
now the only thing that I had an issue

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.990 
now the only thing that I had an issue
with<00:03:08.140> that<00:03:08.200> was<00:03:08.650> because<00:03:09.549> like<00:03:09.580> my<00:03:10.000> scalp<00:03:10.630> was

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
with that was because like my scalp was

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.600 
with that was because like my scalp was
significantly<00:03:13.000> lighter<00:03:13.390> than<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.840> actual

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
significantly lighter than the actual

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.150 
significantly lighter than the actual
unit<00:03:15.610> itself<00:03:15.790> so<00:03:16.569> I<00:03:16.870> didn't<00:03:17.590> know<00:03:17.680> if<00:03:17.950> maybe

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
unit itself so I didn't know if maybe

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.220 
unit itself so I didn't know if maybe
they<00:03:18.430> didn't<00:03:18.850> bleach<00:03:19.000> some<00:03:19.180> knots<00:03:19.360> or<00:03:19.780> does<00:03:20.200> it

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
they didn't bleach some knots or does it

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.140 
they didn't bleach some knots or does it
come<00:03:20.560> dark<00:03:20.859> like<00:03:21.040> that<00:03:21.070> already<00:03:21.489> I<00:03:21.640> wasn't

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
come dark like that already I wasn't

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.170 
come dark like that already I wasn't
very<00:03:22.269> sure<00:03:22.359> but<00:03:23.250> sometimes<00:03:24.250> I<00:03:24.430> had<00:03:24.609> to<00:03:24.850> go<00:03:25.000> in

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
very sure but sometimes I had to go in

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.330 
very sure but sometimes I had to go in
with<00:03:25.329> a<00:03:25.359> little<00:03:25.540> concealer<00:03:26.049> and<00:03:26.410> actually

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
with a little concealer and actually

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.370 
with a little concealer and actually
lighten<00:03:27.790> up<00:03:27.880> that<00:03:28.090> area<00:03:28.420> but<00:03:28.690> if<00:03:28.959> you<00:03:29.140> have

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
lighten up that area but if you have

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.370 
lighten up that area but if you have
like<00:03:30.370> a<00:03:30.400> darker<00:03:31.060> scalp<00:03:31.359> than<00:03:31.630> what<00:03:32.049> I<00:03:32.260> would

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
like a darker scalp than what I would

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.160 
like a darker scalp than what I would
have<00:03:32.650> then<00:03:33.250> it<00:03:33.549> is<00:03:33.730> going<00:03:33.970> to<00:03:34.180> be<00:03:34.299> muy<00:03:34.720> bueno

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.140 
first video when I purchased the hair
the<00:04:17.500> very<00:04:17.799> ends<00:04:18.310> of<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.609> hair<00:04:18.940> was<00:04:19.600> coarse<00:04:20.049> and

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
the very ends of the hair was coarse and

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.480 
the very ends of the hair was coarse and
just<00:04:22.150> didn't<00:04:22.690> feel<00:04:22.900> very<00:04:22.960> well<00:04:23.350> well<00:04:24.039> it<00:04:24.280> kind

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
just didn't feel very well well it kind

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.670 
just didn't feel very well well it kind
of<00:04:24.550> felt<00:04:24.789> like<00:04:25.050> someone<00:04:26.050> who<00:04:26.860> had

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
of felt like someone who had

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.750 
of felt like someone who had
like<00:04:28.490> split<00:04:28.820> ends<00:04:29.030> so<00:04:29.810> I<00:04:30.350> was<00:04:30.949> debating<00:04:31.430> going

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
like split ends so I was debating going

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.070 
like split ends so I was debating going
back<00:04:31.910> and<00:04:32.060> forth<00:04:32.240> on<00:04:32.300> whether<00:04:32.480> or<00:04:32.690> not<00:04:32.750> I<00:04:32.840> would

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
back and forth on whether or not I would

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.080 
back and forth on whether or not I would
cut<00:04:33.290> it<00:04:33.320> because<00:04:33.650> it<00:04:33.980> was<00:04:34.100> really<00:04:34.520> really

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
cut it because it was really really

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.560 
cut it because it was really really
bothering<00:04:35.660> me<00:04:35.810> and<00:04:36.169> I<00:04:36.949> did<00:04:37.190> that<00:04:37.370> so<00:04:37.760> I<00:04:38.060> think<00:04:38.479> I

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
bothering me and I did that so I think I

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.510 
bothering me and I did that so I think I
may<00:04:38.720> have<00:04:38.750> cut<00:04:39.110> maybe<00:04:39.380> two<00:04:39.740> to<00:04:39.889> three<00:04:39.919> inches
