 landscapes of the northeast under a 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.160
 quite different view 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.439
 the newspaper the houses now a trip of 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.189

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.630
 hundreds of springs dozens of 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.809
 waterfalls inviting to practice 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.180
 of a radical sport orchids 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.969
 bromeliads trees that shelter 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.850
 for the most different species some 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.120
 endangered as a painter 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.120
 true a place so deserves the name 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.100
 that has beautiful with the municipality in 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.010

 seven wonders of the state and the most 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.390
 recent came about because of this sign 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.960
 rugged hollywood 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.140
 if everything is so beautiful this close 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.540
 imagine from above the adventure begins in 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.490
 half the darkness to fly balloon is 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.610
 I need to agree very early on 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.460
 They start when the day is still dark it's 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.340
 that, as soon as possible, the conditions for 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.880
 the flight is better than the balloon just takes off 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.430
 when there is little wind and no rain at 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.729
 staff works fast holds cars 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.189
 to the sixth test the torch stretching 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.900
 envelope that this part of the balloon that 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.049
 gets full of air 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.869
 all this movement in the rural area has 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.070
 residents jumping out of bed full of 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.079
 curiosity 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.920
 after all, it is not always possible to see a 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.270
 fly machine like this the first time 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.149
 What do you think is most interesting? 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.840
 interesting is that he takes the flight to 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.729
 fly right 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.690
 leaves flying around the unit the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.420
 blowtorch warms balloon air 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.060
 slowly filling a half hour is 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.270
 everything ready for boarding begins 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.280
 up and you go to the range r 500 and 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.680
 800 meters of altitude 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.680
 the climb is very quiet and now the 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.490
 from the cable and the trip is only 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.400
 pro high 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.910
 let's walk smoothly through the scenarios 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.610
 of the agreste in the privileged belvedere only 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.590
 to see what the fog allows the dense 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.970
 cloudy curtain plays hide and seek 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.360
 Hides 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.690
 but gradually the rays of the sun throw light 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.240
 on the hills the woods the fields 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.880
 the stone of the surroundadouro the main one 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.980
 Rock formation of beautiful gets more 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.110
 with the morning glow 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.210
 Landscapes here from above are breathtaking 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.440
 We do not even know which side to look at. 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:56.260
 each one is more beautiful than the other 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.100
 almost 50 minutes of flight and the time of 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.890
 go down 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.650
 Our airstrip is the nature of the 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.420

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.100

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.140

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:18.630
 near or far from the top of the mainland 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.630
 It's really beautiful to see.
