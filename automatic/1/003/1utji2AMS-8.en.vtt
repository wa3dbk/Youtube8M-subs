for the plug-in to work we need to give

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.369 
for the plug-in to work we need to give
it<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.920> spline<00:00:14.639> object<00:00:14.849> that<00:00:15.719> can<00:00:15.900> be<00:00:15.990> any<00:00:16.170> kind

it a spline object that can be any kind

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.050 
it a spline object that can be any kind
of<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.619> spline<00:00:16.830> as<00:00:17.039> long<00:00:17.310> as<00:00:17.430> it's<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.670> closed<00:00:17.880> one

but<00:00:19.020> for<00:00:19.199> demo<00:00:19.350> purposes<00:00:19.770> I'm<00:00:19.949> gonna<00:00:20.130> choose<00:00:20.430> a

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
but for demo purposes I'm gonna choose a

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.189 
but for demo purposes I'm gonna choose a
circle<00:00:21.689> smile<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.760> drop<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:23.880> in<00:00:24.269> spline

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
circle smile and drop it in spline

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.620 
circle smile and drop it in spline
object<00:00:25.230> right<00:00:25.650> here

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630

by<00:00:27.630> default<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.080> plugin<00:00:28.380> slices<00:00:28.710> your<00:00:28.800> spline

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
by default the plugin slices your spline

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.939 
by default the plugin slices your spline
into<00:00:29.490> ten<00:00:29.670> equal<00:00:29.820> pieces<00:00:30.320> but<00:00:31.320> what<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.769> stop

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
into ten equal pieces but what to stop

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:32.299 
into ten equal pieces but what to stop
here

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
here

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.959 
here
let's<00:00:32.850> choose<00:00:33.030> let's<00:00:33.329> say<00:00:33.420> 50<00:00:33.930> there<00:00:34.590> we<00:00:34.710> go

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
let's choose let's say 50 there we go

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.180 
let's choose let's say 50 there we go
and<00:00:35.969> we<00:00:36.180> can<00:00:36.300> always<00:00:36.570> change<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:37.290> on<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.010> fly

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
and we can always change this on the fly

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.090 
and we can always change this on the fly
this<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.300> procedural<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.649> breaks<00:00:40.920> my

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
this is so procedural that it breaks my

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.130 
this is so procedural that it breaks my
heart

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
heart

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.940 
heart
alright<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.379> let's<00:00:43.590> leave<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.920> turn<00:00:44.280> right<00:00:44.430> now

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
alright so let's leave it turn right now

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.229 
alright so let's leave it turn right now
in<00:00:46.950> case<00:00:47.160> we<00:00:47.250> want<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.460> here<00:00:47.640> at<00:00:47.730> random<00:00:48.090> with

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
in case we want to here at random with

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.720 
in case we want to here at random with
slices<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:49.110> that's<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.680> checkbox<00:00:50.039> there<00:00:50.640> we

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
slices so that's the checkbox there we

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.990 
slices so that's the checkbox there we
go<00:00:50.910> we<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.210> always<00:00:51.329> enable<00:00:51.960> or<00:00:52.170> disable<00:00:52.350> it's

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
go we can always enable or disable it's

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.240 
go we can always enable or disable it's
easy<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.870> case<00:00:55.289> we<00:00:55.379> want<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.530> have<00:00:55.739> different

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
easy in case we want to have different

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.119 
easy in case we want to have different
seeds<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.610> that's<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.059> button<00:00:57.770> go<00:00:58.770> nuts<00:00:59.010> with

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
seeds so that's the button go nuts with

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.910 
seeds so that's the button go nuts with
its<00:00:59.660> container<00:01:00.660> mode<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.079> will<00:01:01.260> explain<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.829> a

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
its container mode I will explain it a

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.189 
its container mode I will explain it a
little<00:01:01.949> bit<00:01:02.280> later<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:03.390> not<00:01:03.780> contain<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
little bit later and not contain the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.050 
little bit later and not contain the
checkbox<00:01:04.589> does<00:01:04.890> what<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.159> says<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.549> instead<00:01:06.000> of

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
checkbox does what it says so instead of

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.480 
checkbox does what it says so instead of
slicing<00:01:06.390> yours<00:01:06.780> line<00:01:07.080> object<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:08.040> will<00:01:08.250> slice

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
slicing yours line object it will slice

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.390 
slicing yours line object it will slice
the<00:01:08.820> bounding<00:01:09.360> box<00:01:09.600> or<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.409> container<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.340> to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
the bounding box or the container so to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.850 
the bounding box or the container so to
speak<00:01:12.200> this<00:01:13.200> option<00:01:13.530> might<00:01:13.650> give<00:01:13.830> some

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
speak this option might give some

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.359 
speak this option might give some
interesting<00:01:14.490> results<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:14.970> left<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.270> there

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
interesting results so we left it there

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.760 
interesting results so we left it there
all<00:01:17.369> right<00:01:17.580> moving<00:01:17.820> along<00:01:18.350> slice<00:01:19.350> position

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
all right moving along slice position

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.910 
all right moving along slice position
linear<00:01:20.340> X<00:01:20.720> will<00:01:21.720> move<00:01:21.869> your<00:01:22.049> slices<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.650> X

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
linear X will move your slices in X

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.280 
linear X will move your slices in X
direction<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.119> disable<00:01:24.630> circle<00:01:25.110> now

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
direction and this disable circle now

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.870 
direction and this disable circle now
let's<00:01:26.130> get<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:27.710> awesome<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.860> linear<00:01:29.280> wipe<00:01:29.610> will

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
let's get it awesome a linear wipe will

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.789 
let's get it awesome a linear wipe will
move<00:01:30.060> slices<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.810> y<00:01:31.020> direction<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.650> linear

all right same goes for y direction like

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.220 
all right same goes for y direction like
this

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.950 

he<00:02:12.230> is<00:02:12.350> easy<00:02:12.620> it's<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:12.950> procedural<00:02:13.430> now<00:02:13.820> this<00:02:14.810> is

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
he is easy it's a procedural now this is

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.940 
he is easy it's a procedural now this is
beautiful<00:02:15.820> all<00:02:16.820> right<00:02:17.030> so<00:02:17.150> angle<00:02:17.770> depends<00:02:18.770> the

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
beautiful all right so angle depends the

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:27.930 
beautiful all right so angle depends the
angle<00:02:19.640> of<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.850> slice<00:02:20.230> there<00:02:21.230> we<00:02:21.350> go<00:02:25.510> beautiful

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
angle of the slice there we go beautiful

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.840 
angle of the slice there we go beautiful
expansion<00:02:28.940> it<00:02:29.150> shrinks<00:02:29.540> this<00:02:30.290> is<00:02:30.470> or<00:02:31.430> it

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
expansion it shrinks this is or it

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.880 
expansion it shrinks this is or it
expands<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.300> mask<00:02:35.080> if<00:02:36.080> we<00:02:36.290> enable<00:02:36.440> random

expands the mask if we enable random

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.250 
expands the mask if we enable random
with<00:02:38.650> so<00:02:39.650> slices<00:02:40.100> will<00:02:40.900> dissipate<00:02:41.900> faster

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
with so slices will dissipate faster

let's<00:03:13.400> take<00:03:13.580> a<00:03:13.640> moment<00:03:13.850> to<00:03:14.060> talk<00:03:14.209> about<00:03:14.270> the

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
let's take a moment to talk about the

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.660 
let's take a moment to talk about the
container<00:03:14.900> mode<00:03:15.110> by<00:03:16.100> default<00:03:16.370> it's<00:03:16.489> set<00:03:16.550> to

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
container mode by default it's set to

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.370 
container mode by default it's set to
adaptive<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:17.300> this<00:03:17.540> is<00:03:17.690> a<00:03:17.720> really<00:03:18.020> good<00:03:18.170> mode

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
adaptive and this is a really good mode

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.680 
adaptive and this is a really good mode
it<00:03:18.890> doesn't<00:03:19.070> introduce<00:03:19.400> any<00:03:19.850> clipping<00:03:20.180> it

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
it doesn't introduce any clipping it

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.060 
it doesn't introduce any clipping it
doesn't<00:03:21.020> generate<00:03:21.140> any<00:03:21.500> unnecessary

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
doesn't generate any unnecessary

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.240 
doesn't generate any unnecessary
geometry<00:03:23.080> however<00:03:24.080> if<00:03:24.650> you<00:03:24.770> take<00:03:24.890> a<00:03:24.950> look<00:03:25.160> at

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
geometry however if you take a look at

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.570 
geometry however if you take a look at
the<00:03:25.540> width<00:03:26.540> of<00:03:26.630> the<00:03:26.780> slice<00:03:26.959> on<00:03:27.230> angle<00:03:28.040> zero<00:03:28.280> and

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
the width of the slice on angle zero and

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.940 
the width of the slice on angle zero and
take<00:03:29.330> a<00:03:29.360> look<00:03:29.570> at<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.810> width<00:03:30.410> of<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.620> slices

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
take a look at the width of the slices

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.250 
take a look at the width of the slices
90<00:03:31.250> degrees<00:03:31.550> well<00:03:31.760> you<00:03:32.600> see<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.900> difference

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
90 degrees well you see the difference

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.220 
90 degrees well you see the difference
this<00:03:34.160> is<00:03:34.280> because<00:03:34.550> the<00:03:34.730> container<00:03:35.690> is<00:03:35.959> trying

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
this is because the container is trying

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.310 
this is because the container is trying
to<00:03:36.590> cover<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.280> entire<00:03:37.430> shape<00:03:37.910> of<00:03:38.060> your<00:03:38.090> spine

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
to cover the entire shape of your spine

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.040 
to cover the entire shape of your spine
so<00:03:39.320> that's<00:03:39.500> what's<00:03:39.620> happening<00:03:40.810> alright<00:03:41.810> let's

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
so that's what's happening alright let's

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.860 
so that's what's happening alright let's
take<00:03:42.140> a<00:03:42.200> look<00:03:42.380> a<00:03:42.530> square<00:03:42.920> mode<00:03:43.690> slices<00:03:44.690> cover

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
take a look a square mode slices cover

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.160 
take a look a square mode slices cover
entire<00:03:45.380> shape<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:47.030> with<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.420> slice<00:03:47.690> does<00:03:47.989> not

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
entire shape the with the slice does not

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.590 
entire shape the with the slice does not
change<00:03:48.380> depending<00:03:48.590> on<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.130> angle<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:49.970> we

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
change depending on the angle and we

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.080 
change depending on the angle and we
don't<00:03:50.750> get<00:03:50.870> any<00:03:50.930> clipping<00:03:51.350> that's<00:03:51.560> awesome

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
don't get any clipping that's awesome

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.310 
don't get any clipping that's awesome
however<00:03:53.090> on<00:03:53.330> some<00:03:53.540> angles<00:03:53.870> we<00:03:54.019> might<00:03:54.200> be

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
however on some angles we might be

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.530 
however on some angles we might be
getting<00:03:54.590> some<00:03:54.800> empty<00:03:55.160> slices<00:03:55.550> the<00:03:56.120> rendering

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
getting some empty slices the rendering

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.870 
getting some empty slices the rendering
unnecessary<00:03:57.260> geometry<00:03:57.709> like<00:03:57.890> here<00:03:58.040> if<00:03:58.730> we

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
unnecessary geometry like here if we

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.780 
unnecessary geometry like here if we
disable<00:03:59.480> the<00:03:59.510> invert<00:03:59.900> container

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
disable the invert container

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.310 
disable the invert container
those<00:04:01.790> slices<00:04:02.750> are<00:04:02.870> there<00:04:02.989> but<00:04:03.200> they<00:04:03.290> are

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
those slices are there but they are

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.780 
those slices are there but they are
empty<00:04:03.680> alright<00:04:05.080> and<00:04:06.080> the<00:04:06.709> last<00:04:06.890> one<00:04:07.070> is<00:04:07.280> circle

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
empty alright and the last one is circle

however<00:04:13.100> we<00:04:13.670> are<00:04:13.820> getting<00:04:14.120> some<00:04:14.360> clippings

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.250 
however we are getting some clippings
right<00:04:15.380> here<00:04:15.650> are<00:04:16.010> the<00:04:16.459> corners<00:04:16.820> and<00:04:17.570> we're

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
right here are the corners and we're

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.770 
right here are the corners and we're
losing<00:04:18.560> information<00:04:19.039> so<00:04:19.910> the<00:04:20.120> circle<00:04:20.660> mode

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
losing information so the circle mode

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.490 
losing information so the circle mode
works<00:04:21.140> perfectly<00:04:21.739> we

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
works perfectly we

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.350 
works perfectly we

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
circles line take a look

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.620 
circles line take a look
like<00:04:27.360> this<00:04:27.660> poof<00:04:28.550> if<00:04:29.550> we<00:04:29.700> change<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:30.030> angle<00:04:30.150> no

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
like this poof if we change the angle no

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.800 
like this poof if we change the angle no
