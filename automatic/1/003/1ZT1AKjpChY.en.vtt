00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.510 
if I were this close on an HD television
all<00:02:19.900> I'd<00:02:20.140> be<00:02:20.290> seeing<00:02:20.500> is<00:02:20.830> like<00:02:20.860> a<00:02:21.250> grid<00:02:21.490> of

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
all I'd be seeing is like a grid of

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.230 
all I'd be seeing is like a grid of
pixels<00:02:21.840> but<00:02:22.840> I'm<00:02:23.590> basically<00:02:24.370> sitting<00:02:24.850> like<00:02:25.210> a

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
pixels but I'm basically sitting like a

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.890 
pixels but I'm basically sitting like a
foot<00:02:25.540> away<00:02:25.660> from<00:02:26.020> this<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:27.180> it's<00:02:28.180> really<00:02:28.510> hard

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
foot away from this and it's really hard

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.040 
foot away from this and it's really hard
to<00:02:29.320> point<00:02:29.680> out<00:02:29.890> individual<00:02:30.640> pixels<00:02:31.090> on<00:02:31.540> the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
screen I don't know that's something

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.480 
screen I don't know that's something
that's<00:02:35.350> pretty<00:02:35.590> amazing<00:02:35.800> and<00:02:36.130> when<00:02:36.250> you<00:02:36.340> do

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
that's pretty amazing and when you do

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.750
