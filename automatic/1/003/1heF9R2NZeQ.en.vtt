layout at least not where anybody can

see it

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.149

now<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.720> biggest<00:01:40.020> fear<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.470> had<00:01:40.829> when<00:01:41.070> I

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
now the biggest fear I had when I

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
layout was the thought or nightmare

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.010 
layout was the thought or nightmare
rather<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.790> rewiring<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.600> whole<00:01:45.750> thing

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
rather of rewiring the whole thing

rather of rewiring the whole thing
little<00:01:46.680> did<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:46.890> know<00:01:46.920> at<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.220> time<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.670> would

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
little did I know at the time it would

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.730 
little did I know at the time it would
end<00:01:47.820> up<00:01:48.030> being<00:01:48.270> much<00:01:48.689> easier<00:01:49.350> than<00:01:49.530> even

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
end up being much easier than even

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.289 
end up being much easier than even
wiring<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.399> whole<00:01:50.549> layout<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.060> first

didn't<00:03:12.370> say<00:03:12.520> it<00:03:12.640> earlier<00:03:12.970> we're<00:03:13.180> actually

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
didn't say it earlier we're actually

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.210 
didn't say it earlier we're actually
working<00:03:13.690> on<00:03:13.870> two<00:03:14.080> panels<00:03:14.530> on<00:03:14.710> the<00:03:14.830> same<00:03:15.010> layout

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
working on two panels on the same layout

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.760 
working on two panels on the same layout
at<00:03:15.520> the<00:03:15.610> same<00:03:15.820> time<00:03:16.090> here<00:03:16.660> you<00:03:16.840> see<00:03:17.080> we<00:03:17.530> got<00:03:17.650> the

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
at the same time here you see we got the

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.199 
at the same time here you see we got the
wires<00:03:17.980> pulled<00:03:18.340> through<00:03:18.580> and<00:03:18.760> there's<00:03:18.940> the<00:03:19.060> old

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
wires pulled through and there's the old

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.890 
wires pulled through and there's the old
area<00:03:20.820> okay<00:03:21.820> it<00:03:21.940> looks<00:03:22.090> like<00:03:22.180> Kevin's<00:03:22.630> got<00:03:22.750> all

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
area okay it looks like Kevin's got all

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.540 
area okay it looks like Kevin's got all
the<00:03:22.989> parts<00:03:23.170> already<00:03:23.440> on<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.770> far<00:03:24.010> left<00:03:24.250> is<00:03:24.430> the

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
the parts already on the far left is the

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.770 
the parts already on the far left is the
control<00:03:24.910> base<00:03:25.120> where<00:03:25.330> we're<00:03:25.420> going<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:25.600> plug

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
control base where we're going to plug

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.720 
control base where we're going to plug
everything<00:03:25.930> into<00:03:26.350> your<00:03:26.709> 12-volt<00:03:27.370> power

this<00:03:31.090> particular<00:03:31.420> panel<00:03:31.870> we're<00:03:32.110> working<00:03:32.440> on

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
this particular panel we're working on

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.860 
this particular panel we're working on
is<00:03:32.680> going<00:03:32.830> to<00:03:32.890> power<00:03:33.100> eight<00:03:33.400> turnouts<00:03:34.060> so

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
is going to power eight turnouts so

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.100 
is going to power eight turnouts so
here's<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.320> control<00:03:35.950> base<00:03:36.160> on<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:37.600> left<00:03:37.810> hand

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
here's the control base on the left hand

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.180 
here's the control base on the left hand
side<00:03:38.290> you're<00:03:38.470> going<00:03:38.530> to<00:03:38.650> see<00:03:38.709> where<00:03:38.920> you<00:03:39.010> plug

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
side you're going to see where you plug

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.580

course before we started we mocked

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.140 
course before we started we mocked
everything<00:03:51.010> up<00:03:51.130> to<00:03:51.280> see<00:03:51.430> where<00:03:51.580> we<00:03:51.700> wanted<00:03:52.030> it

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
everything up to see where we wanted it

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
control base in place now for the sake

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.320 
control base in place now for the sake
of<00:03:56.680> video<00:03:56.920> all<00:03:57.310> those<00:03:57.520> wires<00:03:57.820> hanging<00:03:58.150> out

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.520 
there looks scary but all they are is
two<00:04:00.310> wires<00:04:00.550> for<00:04:01.330> each<00:04:01.480> switch<00:04:01.750> machine<00:04:01.959> and

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.560 
not to cut the wires because you see
they're<00:06:28.040> still<00:06:28.220> attached<00:06:28.550> he'll<00:06:29.150> put<00:06:29.360> it<00:06:29.390> in

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:29.570 
they're still attached he'll put it in

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.020 
they're still attached he'll put it in
the<00:06:29.690> frame<00:06:29.900> and<00:06:30.380> mock<00:06:30.620> it<00:06:30.650> up<00:06:30.920> when<00:06:31.730> it<00:06:31.820> comes

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.030
