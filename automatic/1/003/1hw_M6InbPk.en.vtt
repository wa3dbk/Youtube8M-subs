00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:08.580
 gym hi shorter topic of the day 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.889
 such a telling most well 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.130
 scooter with such a problem 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:18.080
 when the scooter on the cold starts with 50 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:22.650
 Once there 60 100 times or when 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.949
 it is necessary to weave shove with a rag 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.630
 air filters to scooter 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.330
 but this is due to the fact that 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:35.430
 too little gasoline comes across cold 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.559
 for normal engine start 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.170
 in this garbage 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:45.030
 rather in and and adjustments it 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:47.940
 dresser here he gives and dispenses 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.469
 fuel and air to cold that is 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:56.730
 when the motor is still cold here we see 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:01.100
 here but consists of such a needle stock and 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:05.129
 Itself here on the ground so here it is 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.049
 so what can be done to 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.720
 the cold scooter is better to start and to 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.540
 you did not have a hundred times his such as 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.729
 China or would describe anything 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.500
 air filter to shut off the excess 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.119
 air 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.780
 showing rented enrich from 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.930
 carburetor 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:27.990
 that's how it looks we clamp it in a vice 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.509
 we will pick up pliers like this 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:36.270
 grasp and there is this part like this 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:39.270
 and jerking sharply pulled sharply here 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.390
 the river is the thread here that's part 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:47.060
 it is sealed from the factory and that no one 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:51.350
 I did not understand, of course, all this garbage and 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:56.000
 we are expanding this whole business and 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.000
 further what we do actually 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:03.079
 attention look here if we have a scooter 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.939
 the cold does not start him well 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:10.870
 enough gasoline this part of this one 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:16.130
 we twist it here so here we 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:18.140
 We turn away here and so and which hand 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.299
 I can not cop about just going then 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:25.670
 there is, as it were, twisting there 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:29.049
 there is such a situation when a scooter 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:33.380
 start up and just motrich 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:36.730
 go does not go only prom fills here 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.480
 so for the address nods him when we 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.769
 twirl here and so and thus we 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.489
 the needle we have below will be 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:50.630
 be on the cold but it will go 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:53.959
 less gasoline that is what it is 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.720
 adjustment is set at the factory here 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.760
 let's say some definite 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.220
 temperature conditions let's say let's say 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.709
 under plus there is 25 degrees because 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.139
 No one would say that would not be in the winter 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.480
 scooter wrong what for them to do under 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.739
 winter time adjustment 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.489
 you make adjustments to your 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.319
 the temperature 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.709
 that is what you have if you live 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.930
 anywhere and behind it in the tropics or in 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.739
 Africa you will have fuel to spin 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.250
 here's the thing 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.230
 so that this itself would lie below 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.480
 that is, in the external gasoline on the cold not 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.549
 needed if you have a cold season 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.150
 either just not enough gasoline and 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.880
 unscrew this thing and thus we 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.750
 achieve normal adjustments 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.730
 drunkenness and walks so need so 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.980
 adjusted about the principle of the start up 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.660
 normal and faster warming me 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.160
 in general here now I will show you here but 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.599
 there it is direct spinning normally that is itself 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.630
 shut off then please 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:52.220
 visible gave me straight rotates easily then 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.190
 there is i can adjust gram as 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.370
 I want for myself here the same thing 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:01.370
 did cold fuel lacked in 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.260
 culture now we will fix this whole thing 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.330
 here you go 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.040
 this way is normal 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.569
 optimal adjustment but for some 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.269
 certain temperature if you 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.159
 let's put under plus 20 degrees 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:16.070
 temperature to get you there chip 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:17.690
 propper gone and drove normally then 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.049
 you on the cold will be stupid to miss 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.000
 gasoline if you put under -20 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.160
 let's adjust the differential -10 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.800
 boxed cold season and you 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.240
 base scooter plus 30 and you 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.150
 flood it until we completely 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.639
 warm and completely so that it does not come out 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.919
 there are warm-up time you increase 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:39.530
 hereby this adjustment here we 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.770
 set the temperature for adjustment 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:46.130
 under a certain temperature that 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.400
 I hope I answered all the questions all 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.400
 until
