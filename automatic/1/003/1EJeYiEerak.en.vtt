00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
stitches give us a background for all

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.690

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.980 
so you see I've put a twist in the work
an<00:01:46.190> interesting<00:01:46.580> thing<00:01:46.760> about<00:01:46.940> cables<00:01:47.780> is

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
an interesting thing about cables is

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.770 
an interesting thing about cables is
they<00:01:48.200> look<00:01:48.440> twisted<00:01:48.890> because<00:01:49.310> they<00:01:49.670> are<00:01:49.940> the

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
they look twisted because they are the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.660 
they look twisted because they are the
work<00:01:51.050> is<00:01:51.290> actually<00:01:51.590> flip-flopped<00:01:52.490> and

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
work is actually flip-flopped and

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.520 
work is actually flip-flopped and
twisted<00:01:53.119> around<00:01:53.240> to<00:01:53.510> give<00:01:53.780> it<00:01:53.930> this<00:01:54.110> effect

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
twisted around to give it this effect

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.190 
twisted around to give it this effect
now<00:01:55.160> again<00:01:55.520> all<00:01:55.729> wrong<00:01:56.210> side<00:01:56.540> rows<00:01:56.780> are<00:01:57.020> the

now again all wrong side rows are the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.330 
now again all wrong side rows are the
same<00:01:57.790> I'll<00:01:58.790> turn<00:01:59.090> my<00:01:59.300> work<00:02:02.320> it's<00:02:03.320> always<00:02:03.680> knit

then<00:02:33.260> you<00:02:33.380> will<00:02:33.500> definitely<00:02:33.709> want<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.459> block

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
then you will definitely want to block

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.050 
then you will definitely want to block
this<00:02:35.480> out<00:02:35.690> by<00:02:36.010> giving<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.340> full<00:02:37.549> wet<00:02:37.820> block

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
in a sink of wool wash or you can

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.949 
in a sink of wool wash or you can
probably<00:02:40.850> get<00:02:41.060> away<00:02:41.150> with<00:02:41.299> steaming<00:02:41.840> this

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
probably get away with steaming this

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.890 
probably get away with steaming this
because<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.650> yarn<00:02:42.830> that<00:02:42.950> we're<00:02:43.130> using<00:02:43.310> is

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
because the yarn that we're using is

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.620 
because the yarn that we're using is
merino<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.110> really<00:02:45.320> soft<00:02:45.530> wool<00:02:46.150> but<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.299> is

merino and really soft wool but that is
