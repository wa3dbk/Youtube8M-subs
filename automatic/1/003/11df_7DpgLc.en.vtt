00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:02.730
 I speak 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.730
 indeed 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.579
 cla vim 

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:13.579
 I think 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.390
 nothing 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:35.250
 my name is ol stephanie else g 44 years old I'm married and I have three 

00:00:35.249 --> 00:00:36.530
 children 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.870
 I fell on it 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.730
 in fact the 14 year old 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.000
 when i was in senegal 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.810
 so I started with chopin senegal motocross 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:47.800
 so now there is 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.970
 it's been thirty years then they are passionate about the greens 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.900
 I went through all the deserts a bit to realize it at 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.780
 know that is the Libyan desert where the Egyptian desert 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.500
 last Tuesday 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.870
 it's the rally of the pharaohs 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.270
 when we are great the fun where he proves I did a race to the old ones 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.909
 what I know is not on stage 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.990
 with marigot that had rolled to the dakar in 94 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.160
 So here is China preparing for a new a new raid a new 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:16.570
 rally 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.570
 put on the market 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.380
 winners at the level of 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.340
 from Egypt so I said to myself we can Egyptians I finish this 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.039
 scene yet categorical old all that had to start from 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:33.460
 98 years old 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.190
 so suits them or not every two years I will make Morocco the afp the 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.580
 first was tunisia then morocco egypt and libya and so the 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.229
 rally starts with raoul it's a rally jeff bridges now we have two 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.229
 children with them this ancient justly 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.740
 not angry ride on a motorcycle and his verve 13 years 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.660
 it's in Senegal with the map 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.690
 I had a friend who puts a small machine 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.649
 cross 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.789
 right now I was passionate about this place I climbed on for 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.399
 100 euros and I felt like I'm like a fish in the water 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.179
 you must also know that it was 

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:16.349
 the low ridges that is to say the pink lake where the arrival of paris dakar 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.620
 where there are plenty of unesco 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.620
 and generous was the click the motorcycle 

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:24.189
 what do you want to please me in e liga of things in fact 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.739
 in the off-road bike itself it's that feeling of great freedom 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.589
 on the other hand not to see rolling where we want to the speed that we want it 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:34.680
 it's the first thing 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.689
 the second it is true that I suffer the motorcycle 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:42.969
 with the landscapes and especially again for them the desert 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:43.949
 because 

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:47.829
 i can tell you that it's extremely loud levels filled with surfing power 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:48.740
 in the dunes 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.060
 to be able to ride on a track without his knowing any obstacle and it's true that 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.600
 as I said just now when we set foot once 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.000
 in enduro 20 in the desert necessarily produce 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.619
 the paradox is that I'm not scared 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:10.219
 compared to the falls though 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:12.099
 on sale since I am 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.599
 and god knows that I fell in the sand I scared the world of a 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.530
 good last rally precisely% in egypt simply because 

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:23.939
 the anecdote eric that the second special I wanted to follow someone 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.099
 that everyone knows in the middle of the rally called franck au 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:28.009
 piccolo 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:32.019
 simply because I had seen that this character knew me 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.429
 perfectly the Egyptian ground 

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:35.589
 thinking that I was 

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:39.359
 best of the world and I said to myself we will alleviate that is to say that I have not 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.059
 put a lot of gasoline or motorcycle gp 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:44.279
 jj miller meaning to enforce these rules according to what our friend says 

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:45.949
 franco picot was lost 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:49.039
 and that I was about 500 meters to the minot who did not have it 

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.679
 seen 

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:54.709
 so we missed the CP of the special result I continued and I got 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.849
 lost in the desert alone and especially I broke down 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:58.689
 gasoline 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:00.869
 it was at 8 o'clock in the morning 

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:04.819
 it's a great moment of loneliness I think I'll remember it all 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.469
 my life is one of the reasons besides why I was at enduro massa 

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:08.689
 because there are not two 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:10.679
 2this is sex and arrow 

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:11.869
 % 

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:15.749
 the satellite phone the marl rang that from 17 pm 

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:18.879
 that is to say that 2 o'clock in the morning until 17h we are all alone 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:21.130
 % and I had my three liters of water of course 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.280
 no it was fenoyl organizers I know he would have done everything for me 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.279
 find but I can tell you when the phone rang I was happy 

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:30.449
 on the other hand he had descended 200 kilometers further down so we came 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:31.219
 look for me 

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:34.110
 with a kaka late at 9 pm 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.199
 12 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.840
 in euros per year of birth I have 200 square kilometers of a case arrived 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.039
 at the bivouac at 2 am falling several times because in addition 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:44.969
 as I had an 83 year old motorcycle had simply forgotten to put the 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:45.849
 light above 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.240
 it was the 4 4 ​​that leclerc me and 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.590
 against the current is an exceptional memory but against it is true 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.590
 that it's the biggest fear of my life 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:06.460
 it will never stop to continue 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.650
 the thing is sure that 11% and also sign a little reason why I 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.499
 talk about 50 tests to limit speed 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:17.449
 because in the rally what is it's a difficult moment it's 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.939
 will follow both on the ground 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:22.979
 everything that goes down 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.520
 the pieces that that 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.190
 see his product in power his gps there again in the course of 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.479
 the enduro massa leave with a motorcycle completely scorpions 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:35.660
 eric especially you do not need to have your eyes fixed on the gps on 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:39.750
 the roadbook you are by his boss on the site the rally of Morocco the 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:41.249
 next day is exactly 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:44.299
 and besides that specified in the sense that for me it's called 

00:05:44.299 --> 00:05:45.309
 a loop 

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:48.149
 that is to say, we speak a little fixed we make loops all around this 

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:49.729
 benefit of this reprieve 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:52.979
 at the same time we still enjoy a little bit those of this environment 

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:54.669
 we still see 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:55.909
 and especially 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:59.279
 e for me who is passionate about driving in the sand 

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:03.680
 we take advantage of two years of this piloting precisely you know this track 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.129
 I can tell you that it is extremely 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:09.449
 it's really very very beautiful world to ride in the exit track and its 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:10.089
 to come up 

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:13.739
 you're going to take advantage of it we take the time to 

00:06:13.739 --> 00:06:16.519
 enjoy even if compared to driving even if it is not 

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:19.519
 necessarily in relation to anything that can tell us around 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.439
 the competition side is something that pleases me enormously% 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.470
 a goal the mixed reviews I like we are always happy 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.530
 front is in any case try to always 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.530
 catch up with the next 25 to 44 years now it's no longer time for 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.720
 the poorest young first I mean 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.580
 this is the reason why 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.900
 he judges young people are physically preparing 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.990
 seriously judd hirsch with this physical preparation because for 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.110
 hundred by going on endurance massa with my acquaintance 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.110

 above all, it's passion 

00:07:18.619 --> 00:07:20.960
 it's passion to be passionate 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.379
