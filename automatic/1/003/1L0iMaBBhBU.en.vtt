give you an update on how my

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.630 
give you an update on how my
scarification<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.299> going<00:00:15.630> today<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.980> day<00:00:17.220> four

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
scarification is going today is day four

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.750 
scarification is going today is day four
and<00:00:18.080> I<00:00:19.080> think<00:00:19.770> it's<00:00:19.980> going<00:00:20.070> really<00:00:20.609> really

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
and I think it's going really really

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.779 
and I think it's going really really
well<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.470> can<00:00:22.470> just<00:00:22.890> barely<00:00:23.070> start<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.609> see<00:00:23.760> some

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
well I can just barely start to see some

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.620 
well I can just barely start to see some
new<00:00:24.180> scar<00:00:24.930> tissue<00:00:25.170> forming<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:26.180> well<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.359> can't

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
new scar tissue forming and well I can't

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.050 
new scar tissue forming and well I can't
get<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.840> set<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.650> line<00:00:28.800> up<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.519> scar<00:00:29.820> tissue

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
get that set to line up so scar tissue

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.030 
get that set to line up so scar tissue
forming<00:00:30.599> especially<00:00:31.500> in<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.679> center<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.719> I

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
forming especially in the center and I

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.580 
forming especially in the center and I
think<00:00:35.040> it's<00:00:35.160> turning<00:00:35.489> out<00:00:35.550> beautifully

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
think it's turning out beautifully

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.380 
think it's turning out beautifully
originally<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.890> was<00:00:38.460> going<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.879> record<00:00:39.239> myself

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
originally I was going to record myself

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.110 
originally I was going to record myself
and<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.230> did<00:00:40.379> record<00:00:40.680> myself<00:00:40.890> applying<00:00:41.850> an

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
and I did record myself applying an

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.869 
and I did record myself applying an
irritant<00:00:42.570> into<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.260> cuts<00:00:43.520> just<00:00:44.520> some

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
irritant into the cuts just some

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.779 
irritant into the cuts just some
hydrogen<00:00:45.750> peroxide<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.800> poured<00:00:47.430> into

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
hydrogen peroxide that I poured into

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.020 
hydrogen peroxide that I poured into
some<00:00:48.030> guys<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.629> rubbed<00:00:49.289> in<00:00:49.500> there<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:50.030> thought

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
some guys and rubbed in there I thought

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.459 
some guys and rubbed in there I thought
it<00:00:51.090> would<00:00:51.210> be<00:00:51.329> pretty<00:00:51.510> entertaining<00:00:52.079> because

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
it would be pretty entertaining because

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.069 
it would be pretty entertaining because
I<00:00:53.160> thought<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.640> was<00:00:53.820> going<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.030> hurt<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.420> lot<00:00:54.750> and

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
I thought it was going to hurt a lot and

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.720 
I thought it was going to hurt a lot and
that<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.770> was<00:00:55.949> going<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.100> be<00:00:56.219> making<00:00:56.399> funny

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
that I was going to be making funny

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.060 
that I was going to be making funny
faces<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.480> probably<00:00:57.750> cursing<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.620> might

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
faces and probably cursing and it might

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.810 
faces and probably cursing and it might
be<00:00:59.219> cute<00:00:59.460> might<00:00:59.730> be<00:00:59.850> funny<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.329> don't<00:01:00.809> know<00:01:00.899> um

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
be cute might be funny I don't know um

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.240 
be cute might be funny I don't know um
but<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:03.030> didn't<00:01:03.329> hurt<00:01:03.510> at<00:01:03.780> all<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:05.129> was

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
but it didn't hurt at all and I was

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.490 
but it didn't hurt at all and I was
really<00:01:05.460> surprised<00:01:05.790> by<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.540> guess<00:01:07.470> that

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
really surprised by that I guess that

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.800 
really surprised by that I guess that
since<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.400> haven't<00:01:08.610> been<00:01:08.909> irritating<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.630> too

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
since I haven't been irritating it too

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.320 
since I haven't been irritating it too
much<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:10.530> healing<00:01:11.010> faster<00:01:11.610> than<00:01:11.880> most

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
much it's healing faster than most

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.130 
much it's healing faster than most
peoples<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.909> the<00:01:14.909> hydrogen<00:01:15.180> peroxide<00:01:15.450> just

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
peoples and the hydrogen peroxide just

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.410 
peoples and the hydrogen peroxide just
didn't<00:01:16.409> get<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.710> deep<00:01:16.920> enough<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.430> do<00:01:18.240> any

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
didn't get in deep enough to do any

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.480 
didn't get in deep enough to do any
damage<00:01:19.490> which<00:01:20.490> I'm<00:01:20.939> kind<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.210> happy<00:01:21.390> about<00:01:21.570> but

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
damage which I'm kind of happy about but

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.200 
damage which I'm kind of happy about but
doesn't<00:01:23.490> make<00:01:23.580> for<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.880> very<00:01:23.909> good<00:01:24.390> video<00:01:26.210> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
doesn't make for a very good video the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.840 
doesn't make for a very good video the
reason<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.570> i<00:01:28.049> was<00:01:28.439> using<00:01:28.740> an<00:01:29.189> irritant<00:01:29.610> is

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
reason that i was using an irritant is

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.350 
reason that i was using an irritant is
because<00:01:30.500> it<00:01:31.670> slows<00:01:32.670> down<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.090> healing

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
because it slows down the healing

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.330 
because it slows down the healing
process<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.500> slower<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.009> healing

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
process and the slower the healing

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.850 
process and the slower the healing
process<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:36.119> more<00:01:36.420> scar<00:01:37.259> tissue<00:01:37.290> you're

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
process the more scar tissue you're

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.609 
process the more scar tissue you're
gonna<00:01:38.009> get<00:01:38.250> i<00:01:39.180> was<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:39.869> going<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.110> do<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.380> once

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
gonna get i was just going to do it once

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.469 
gonna get i was just going to do it once
because<00:01:41.009> i<00:01:41.369> want<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.670> little<00:01:41.970> bit<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.180> raised

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
because i want a little bit of raised

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.280 
because i want a little bit of raised
scar<00:01:42.869> tissue<00:01:43.140> but

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
scar tissue but

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.930 
scar tissue but
if<00:01:44.440> I<00:01:44.830> didn't<00:01:45.250> want<00:01:45.370> to<00:01:45.430> do<00:01:45.520> it<00:01:45.640> too<00:01:45.760> much

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
if I didn't want to do it too much

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.400 
if I didn't want to do it too much
because<00:01:46.150> I<00:01:46.330> didn't<00:01:46.660> want<00:01:46.690> it<00:01:46.900> to<00:01:46.990> be<00:01:47.170> like

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
because I didn't want it to be like

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.060 
because I didn't want it to be like
super<00:01:48.150> prominent<00:01:49.150> on<00:01:49.420> my<00:01:49.660> chest<00:01:49.980> the<00:01:50.980> whole

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
super prominent on my chest the whole

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.830 
super prominent on my chest the whole
reason<00:01:51.550> that<00:01:51.580> I<00:01:52.060> got<00:01:52.330> a<00:01:52.360> scarification

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
reason that I got a scarification

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.320 
reason that I got a scarification
instead<00:01:53.590> of<00:01:53.680> a<00:01:53.740> tattoo<00:01:54.160> was<00:01:54.730> because<00:01:55.090> it<00:01:55.300> was

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
instead of a tattoo was because it was

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.810 
instead of a tattoo was because it was
going<00:01:55.690> to<00:01:55.840> be<00:01:55.990> white<00:01:56.680> in<00:01:56.860> the<00:01:57.100> end<00:01:57.250> and<00:01:57.580> pretty

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
going to be white in the end and pretty

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.120 
going to be white in the end and pretty
subtle<00:01:58.090> so<00:01:58.870> I<00:01:58.900> didn't<00:01:59.440> want<00:01:59.560> anything<00:01:59.830> too

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
subtle so I didn't want anything too

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.469 
subtle so I didn't want anything too
prominent<00:02:00.690> but<00:02:01.690> um<00:02:01.900> I<00:02:02.260> love<00:02:02.950> it<00:02:03.100> I<00:02:03.479> really

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
prominent but um I love it I really

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.270
