00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.489
 Hello, how are you? I am your dear friend Daniel Borja 1 and I have been very 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.439
 boring all these days 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.039
 so I came up with the idea of ​​making a top 5 of the toughest enemies in 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.250
 to win in videogames I must clarify that this video will only have enemies 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.460
 of consoles of the sixth generation like the ps2 the expo c's the gamecube psp ec it 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.090
 remains 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.090
 we started the video 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.670
 number 5 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.090
 uu of the vital liquid 3 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.200
 Expert difficulty 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.760
 this one that is a rival lou is almost impossible to win because he 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.430
 because he almost never makes mistakes in the notes and if you put him in an expert I think 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.470
 it's going to cost you a new one because you'll have to have some fucking mother reflexes 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.120
 to shoot in all the notes which makes it too difficult 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.960
 also and that uses its power equal he mounts grafiado perhaps they are not mistaken 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.910
 If you are a rookie in this game with the difficulty of not easy German bonus 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.670
 because you will not be able to pass that level and you will have to play from the beginning 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.470
 in my opinion I was able to defeat 9 but in easy and normal difficulty but 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.470
 I have never achieved it in difficult and worse the expert 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.840
 Number 4 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.670
 who this 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.090
 sergio is harmful fantasy 7 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.310
 I do not believe 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.500
 I can say you 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.659
 this opponent was very strong for me because if you are at a very low level 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.049
 when you get to this fight 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.289
 consider this fact shit because it will shatter you into insurance 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.530
 what is recommended is 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.520
 that you are very well equipped with a very high level 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.300
 with all the mafias or like chucha want to tell you and know how to dodge their 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.789
 attacks 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.899
 I do not know much about this game because I did not play at a friend's house with his 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:19.539
 psp and I started to fight with this wretch and after 20 or 30 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:22.539
 seconds I said shit here 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:35.839
 number 3 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.639
 mujica 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:47.719
 well I can tell you 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:51.919
 he is defeated he makes use but never in the titan difficulty because he is very 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:53.379
 complicated to defeat him 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.959
 what you have to do to defeat it is to attack it at a moderate distance and 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.009
 know when to dodge their attacks I did not put to the service of all juan 3 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:04.739
 because I have not had the opportunity to play it 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.719
 maybe it's not the hardest enemy at all 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:11.639
 but he deserves this place because he is a god and must be treated as such 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.359
 number 2 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:32.699
 from luján 

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:38.479
 I do not know if they know this game because it is a game not very known for the ps2 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:43.749
 has is not the final enemy of the game to fight against him you must go to 

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:45.639
 cashier goals more 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:49.560
 I think that in order to defeat him it will cost you an egg and maybe half of 

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:52.099
 another because it's really difficult 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.399
 you will have to know how to dodge their attacks that are not very predictable and 

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:57.629
 to be able to hit him 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:59.129
 That is so difficultt 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.379
 because the change does not avoid almost everything 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.379
 and the worst of all if you had a reverend beating will not take away almost 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.449
 nothing john 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:08.729
 had more children 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:11.119
 you do not know how much inc 

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:15.019
 and now follows the number one which is the hardest enemy I have ever met 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.710
 number one 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.009
 Nancy Tercal terror excalibur 

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:47.739
 before I must tell you that this is the enemy more shock to your mother than I have 

00:04:47.739 --> 00:04:50.039
 seen in my life 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.110
 and before I go on I bet they're going to say this 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.970
 do not exaggerate I do not think it's that hard 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.240
 just try to overthrow it and find its weak point i win make a few seconds 

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:06.619
 well maybe they are right I will look for their weak point and I think that 

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:09.619
 this time I will beat him moon 

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:30.699
 shit gara did not let me do anything no matter what I was told that number 987 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:33.699
 it's lucky this time I will not lose 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:25.999
 aar 

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:28.999
 We regret not being able to finish the video 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.699
 because daniel borita 1 is now in intensive care 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.350
 We hope you liked the video and have a good time
