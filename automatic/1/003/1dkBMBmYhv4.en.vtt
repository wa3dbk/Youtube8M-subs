00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
series now two to one what was I talking

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.859 
series now two to one what was I talking
about<00:01:58.890> Vancouver<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.640> was<00:01:59.759> saying<00:02:00.000> um<00:02:00.240> if<00:02:00.600> they

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
about Vancouver I was saying um if they

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.929 
about Vancouver I was saying um if they
can<00:02:01.049> win<00:02:01.200> tonight<00:02:01.590> then<00:02:02.219> they<00:02:02.340> go<00:02:02.430> back<00:02:02.460> home

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
can win tonight then they go back home

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.819 
can win tonight then they go back home
for<00:02:03.149> Game<00:02:03.360> five<00:02:03.600> they<00:02:03.899> can<00:02:04.079> win<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.380> game<00:02:04.619> so

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
for Game five they can win that game so

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.620 
for Game five they can win that game so
I<00:02:04.860> think<00:02:04.950> if<00:02:05.159> they<00:02:05.280> win<00:02:05.490> tonight<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:06.210> series

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
I think if they win tonight that series

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.540 
I think if they win tonight that series
goes<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:07.020> at<00:02:07.110> least<00:02:07.259> six<00:02:07.619> if<00:02:07.860> they<00:02:08.310> can<00:02:08.459> win

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
goes to at least six if they can win

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.249 
goes to at least six if they can win
Game<00:02:08.789> six<00:02:09.149> well<00:02:09.450> anything<00:02:09.780> could<00:02:09.869> happen<00:02:10.050> in

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
Game six well anything could happen in

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.800 
Game six well anything could happen in
the<00:02:10.349> game<00:02:10.530> seven<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.400> think<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:12.000> is<00:02:12.030> within

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
the game seven so I think it is within

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.120 
the game seven so I think it is within
I<00:02:12.840> think<00:02:13.200> this<00:02:13.319> is<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.530> hardest<00:02:13.860> game<00:02:13.890> that

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
I think this is the hardest game that

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.339 
I think this is the hardest game that
they<00:02:14.250> got<00:02:14.459> right<00:02:14.670> now<00:02:14.819> Game<00:02:15.120> four<00:02:15.480> on<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:16.200> road

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
they got right now Game four on the road
