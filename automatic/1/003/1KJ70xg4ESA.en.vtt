my<00:01:21.479> dad<00:01:21.630> was<00:01:21.780> saying<00:01:21.930> wins<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.380> smart<00:01:22.680> kid<00:01:22.950> he

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.830 
my dad was saying wins a smart kid he
didn't<00:01:23.640> miss<00:01:23.759> out<00:01:23.939> on<00:01:24.119> too<00:01:24.299> much<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.780> he

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
didn't miss out on too much and he

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.910 
didn't miss out on too much and he
quickly<00:01:25.049> realized<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.619> he<00:01:25.770> could

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
quickly realized that he could

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.249 
quickly realized that he could
capitalize<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:27.240> overzealous<00:01:27.869> nature

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
capitalize on this overzealous nature

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.069 
capitalize on this overzealous nature
and<00:01:28.470> used<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.340> his<00:01:29.430> advantage<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:30.810> when<00:01:30.990> I

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
and used that to his advantage so when I

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.020 
and used that to his advantage so when I
say<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.470> he<00:01:31.590> always<00:01:31.740> put<00:01:32.070> me<00:01:32.159> first<00:01:32.189> it's<00:01:32.790> not
