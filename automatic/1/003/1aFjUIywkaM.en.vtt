application<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:38.789> if<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:38.939> tap<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.390> settings

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
application so if we tap on the settings

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.899 
application so if we tap on the settings
we<00:01:40.350> can<00:01:40.409> change<00:01:40.560> some<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.130> sounds<00:01:41.609> such<00:01:41.880> as

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
we can change some of the sounds such as

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.840 
we can change some of the sounds such as
indicators<00:01:42.600> open<00:01:43.079> close<00:01:43.259> safe<00:01:43.670> deletion<00:01:44.670> and

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
indicators open close safe deletion and

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.279 
indicators open close safe deletion and
self-destruction<00:01:45.509> we<00:01:45.780> can<00:01:45.960> turn<00:01:46.110> these

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
self-destruction we can turn these

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:47.779 
self-destruction we can turn these
sounds<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:46.710> or<00:01:46.860> off<00:01:47.009> by<00:01:47.219> sliding<00:01:47.549> those

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
sounds on or off by sliding those

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:49.969 
sounds on or off by sliding those
sliders<00:01:48.060> go<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.140> come<00:01:49.289> back<00:01:49.319> out<00:01:49.649> we<00:01:49.829> can

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
sliders go and come back out we can

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.130 
sliders go and come back out we can
change<00:01:50.189> our<00:01:50.399> passcode<00:01:50.909> which<00:01:51.119> we<00:01:51.719> can<00:01:51.869> enter

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
change our passcode which we can enter

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.719 
change our passcode which we can enter
in<00:01:52.200> our<00:01:52.350> current<00:01:52.619> passcode<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.340> then<00:01:53.460> change

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
in our current passcode and then change

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.179 
in our current passcode and then change
it<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:53.969> a<00:01:54.119> new<00:01:54.360> one<00:01:54.539> if<00:01:54.689> we<00:01:54.780> wanted<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.170> we<00:01:55.500> have

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
it to a new one if we wanted to we have

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.919 
it to a new one if we wanted to we have
a<00:01:56.340> self-destruction<00:01:57.000> feature<00:01:57.360> which<00:01:57.689> will

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
a self-destruction feature which will

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.289 
a self-destruction feature which will
allow<00:01:58.200> us<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.439> have<00:01:59.159> our<00:01:59.429> time<00:01:59.700> lock<00:01:59.909> vault

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
allow us to have our time lock vault

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.529 
allow us to have our time lock vault
deleted<00:02:01.259> after<00:02:01.979> five<00:02:02.250> unsuccessful<00:02:03.209> attempts

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
deleted after five unsuccessful attempts

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.600 
deleted after five unsuccessful attempts
to<00:02:03.659> log<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.920> if<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.039> go<00:02:05.189> ahead<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.369> take

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
to log in so if I go ahead and take

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.550 
to log in so if I go ahead and take
activate<00:02:06.209> it's<00:02:06.450> gonna<00:02:06.630> activate<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.319> and

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
activate it's gonna activate that and

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.710 
activate it's gonna activate that and
then<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.099> can<00:02:08.160> choose<00:02:08.459> any<00:02:08.789> racing<00:02:09.360> method

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
then I can choose any racing method

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.479 
then I can choose any racing method
which<00:02:09.869> by<00:02:10.079> default<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:10.679> going<00:02:10.829> to<00:02:10.890> be<00:02:11.009> random

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
which by default is going to be random

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.530 
which by default is going to be random
data<00:02:12.110> come<00:02:13.110> back<00:02:13.290> out<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.530> have<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:14.540> language

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
data come back out I have a language

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.630 
data come back out I have a language
selector<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.620> can<00:02:16.829> select<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.280> different

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
selector that I can select the different

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.699 
selector that I can select the different
languages<00:02:17.970> for<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.269> application<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:19.110> have<00:02:19.620> an

languages for the application I have an

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.259 
languages for the application I have an
I<00:02:19.860> file<00:02:20.160> feature<00:02:20.400> which<00:02:20.700> is<00:02:20.819> really<00:02:21.090> neat

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
I file feature which is really neat

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.660 
I file feature which is really neat
because<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.690> can<00:02:22.079> turn<00:02:22.290> this<00:02:22.440> on<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:23.069> you<00:02:23.459> see

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
because I can turn this on and you see

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.300 
because I can turn this on and you see

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
will bypass my camera roll allow me just

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.360 
will bypass my camera roll allow me just
to<00:02:39.090> have<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.420> photos<00:02:39.780> in<00:02:39.959> my<00:02:39.989> secure<00:02:40.590> vault<00:02:40.859> by

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
to have the photos in my secure vault by

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.890 
to have the photos in my secure vault by
themselves<00:02:41.880> without<00:02:41.970> having<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.389> go<00:02:42.510> anywhere

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
themselves without having to go anywhere

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.319 
themselves without having to go anywhere
else<00:02:42.959> on<00:02:43.230> my<00:02:43.319> device<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.970> way<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.120> we

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
else on my device so the way that we

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.000 
else on my device so the way that we
import<00:02:45.720> photos<00:02:46.079> will<00:02:46.260> come<00:02:46.410> back<00:02:46.530> out<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:46.920> the

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
import photos will come back out to the

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.129 
import photos will come back out to the
main<00:02:47.220> time<00:02:47.489> lock<00:02:47.760> we'll<00:02:48.420> hit<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.690> plus<00:02:48.900> button

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
main time lock we'll hit the plus button

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.080 
main time lock we'll hit the plus button
in<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.410> top<00:02:49.620> right<00:02:49.859> hand<00:02:49.889> corner<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.639> it's

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
in the top right hand corner and it's

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.819 
in the top right hand corner and it's
going<00:02:51.239> to<00:02:51.299> access<00:02:51.780> if<00:02:51.930> we<00:02:52.019> like<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.380> do<00:02:52.500> photo

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
going to access if we like to do photo

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.789 
going to access if we like to do photo
or<00:02:53.100> video<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:54.269> if<00:02:54.359> I<00:02:54.450> tap<00:02:54.510> on<00:02:54.870> photo<00:02:55.230> it's<00:02:55.560> going

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
or video so if I tap on photo it's going

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.410 
or video so if I tap on photo it's going
to<00:02:55.859> load<00:02:56.010> up<00:02:56.160> all<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.370> albums<00:02:56.819> on<00:02:57.000> my<00:02:57.090> device
