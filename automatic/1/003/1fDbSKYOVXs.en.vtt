00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.239
 we are inside of nature 

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:14.509
 hut pressure all such fluctuations all 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:15.919
 such waves 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:18.029
 radioactivity and other parameters 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.359
 a huge number of parameters 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.310
 affects us 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.289
 we are after being in line with all 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.770
 these manifestations are the nature of the state 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.689
 equilibrium 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.940
 it is physically law 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.830
 body in balance 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.640
 environment is in the very 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.090
 comfortable condition 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.560
 just above the temperature is bad just below is bad 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.650
 pressure what zheglov they tightly and so 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.500
 Further 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.260
 I created this topic 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.920
 in this nature 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.020
 that I can leave so dressed internally 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.930
 Christmas tree hit a certain framework 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.160
 and in these works I have to do 7 km and 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.430
 yourself you are like nature that is mine 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.650
 the position is childish what to be like 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.610
 second round second balance dreamed 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.610
 q in the summer the opposite and so on 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.400
 this is me as regards the final 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.850
 parts there is also an invisible part of us 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.710
 of nature 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.830
 she fathers stands out of the laws 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.640
 congratulations and wish not to be ill 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.190
 from our laws preferably on 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.620
 development 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.030
 of moral laws 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.540
 and the person will also have to 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.610
 match them just be with them 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.360
 equilibrium 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.280
 we do not know these laws 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.920
 we think in our world we are so good from 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.400
 English I give as if donations 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.930
 help the poor without offending anyone 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.640
 pay taxes and I have procedures 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.610
 impeach the old lady translate there through 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.310
 the road and started the business 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.310
 in general, everything that you can imagine 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.310
 this is not enough 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.630
 it's not that little is absolutely nothing 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.090
 this is absolutely nothing because i do that 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.670
 what I think I understand 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.799
 in order not to do what is necessary for 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.669
 of this i need to study the very nature 

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.379
 and in the third like her only this one 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:13.809
 the law does not have to abide by the law 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:15.479
 like 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:18.929
 I changed every day 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:21.629
 simple in the word to others 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.739
 so I owe them every day 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.819
 and naturally correct 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.819
 adjust your balance of nature 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.489
 so what should you do for this 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.379
 first study what requirements 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.779
 imposes nature or name us 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:42.129
 it is a creator and it matters how 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.200
 how far would fit no 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.819
 these requirements and when the 50 consequence 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.059
 all science was telling us all this 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:52.549
 what is nature around us what is 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:53.239
 Alas 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.549
 what a mismatch on 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.439
 what parameters are we to say from 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:58.329
 nature and what should we do to 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:02:59.569
 corresponding 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:00.769
 and that's all science
