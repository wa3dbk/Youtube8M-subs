00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:12.269
 wind has no icon on the 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:16.170
 in fact, our smartphone or tablet 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:20.699
 possibly going to visualize 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:26.330
 the application list will not come 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:31.130
 shown in soon yi with relative to win 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:37.469
 to start uim on our smartphone 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:46.110
 it will be sufficient to simulate a call 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:54.079
 with the secret number to start uim 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:57.780
 by default the number is 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.420
 the call is made 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.519
 started up as we see in the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:09.299
 screen many tablet devices not 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.210
 have a telephone connection 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.049
 but only a connection away 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.009
 Internet 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:25.170
 for this reason to start uim sui 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:30.509
 tablet lacking precisely of the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:35.150
 telephony device is sufficient 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:38.579
 download the application or on the bridge 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:41.100
 from the google store is an application 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.890
 free that allows you to enter 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.290
 quickly 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:54.530
 the startup password as if it were one 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:59.170
 phone call on the point tablet we can 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:04.540
 use the application or on the bridge 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:07.540
 we see the icon of the same on a 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.540
 Tablet 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:19.040
 clicking on the icon shows one 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.959
 window for entering the 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.880
 password 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:31.130
 we could also insert in this case 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:33.610
 the default password and confirm with 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.610
 ok 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:42.370
 This will start uim on our tablet
