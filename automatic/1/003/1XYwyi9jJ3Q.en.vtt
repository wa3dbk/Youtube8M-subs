00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.460
 good to three meters are not lived well 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.870
 pretty important video the truth already 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.100
 you know with the latest update of 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.809
 precision three simple are four 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.759
 we can make a new feature 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.530
 that basically play with the command of 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.530
 playstation four companies are three in 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.880
 wireless mode or be the wireless mode and 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.320
 well basically before you could do 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.359
 with cable and others play with the command of 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.130
 play 4 in companies are 3 hong kong the 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.539
 cable seems to be that there is a new method 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.660
 a new method to play as I say 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.840
 wireless and here I 'm going to say step 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.519
 by step the truth is a little eye is a 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.830
 little the tooth sometimes works and sometimes 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.330
 I do not shoot myself for quite a while yet 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.650
 trying not trying to make 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.930
 different ways until at the end 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.430
 I've got one that has not 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.900
 failed basically the first thing that 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.300
 we have to do is turn on the 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.390
 precision 3 with the command of places are 4 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.510
 connected with the cable go to 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.390
 to what would be the adjustments of 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.480
 accessories and from accessories settings 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.120
 you can select the function 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.910
 state 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.890
 of what it would be bluetooth to see if now 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.330
 You'll have it yourself 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.479
 screen administer devices 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.080
 bluetooth and from there we give to the 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.729
 we enter and well if you want it to be 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.229
 well the device had one 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.020
 registered to be registered and we give it 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.729
 to register we start the scan and 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.880
 when we started it, we disconnected 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.190
 the cable and we press the button at the same time 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.540
 share and the button despite trying to make the 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.520
 share button is the first he 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.899
 press and when you hit the ps button because 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.800
 if pressure 4 will not turn on once 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.509
 Once you have recognized it 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.330
 basically then start to move the 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.649
 light from the command to the target then 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.890
 you just have to reconnect 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:45.230
 the control by cable and give it to ok in 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.870
 How much do you give to ok? 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.720
 basically, it's already done 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.340
 managed we can give it back 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.960
 disconnect it from the cable and turn it on 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.340
 using the ps button the command what 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.980
 we will have to turn on and a light will come out 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.240
 a white light and it is simply 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.740
 we will simply have that 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.210
 connected we can play with the command of 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.220
 pressure 4 some buttons that do not 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.440
 they work as for example the ps button 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.940
 we can not use it or with cable 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.369
 or without wires one of the buttons that does not 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.170
 we can use and it seems that the 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.700
 vibration because it would not work either in 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.560
 this way but well still I think that 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.390
 will help many people spread 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.590
 the video and nothing but that has been liked and 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.750
 nothing we see in the next video will be 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.940
 next show and well I forgot to 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.500
 reuse of the normal control price 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.000
 are four in your precious four 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.070
 logically, you only have to 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.410
 connect the cable by command turn on the 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.410
 playstation 4 console and then already if 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.700
 you want to use with it so 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.530
 wireless since they are already only 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.700
 remove the cable and that's it but as 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.250
 I say you have to start your company 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.420
 they are four 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.069
 connecting the pressure knob four and 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.360
 then removing it basically for 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.400
 start will ask you to give him the button 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.040
 ps and you take care to understand the 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.360
 play3 at that time and if as I say then 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.610
 you want to do it in another way 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.890
 basically I eliminated the device 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.269
 bluetooth of prison 3 and that's it but 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.500
 well as I say it also works 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.880
 so good nothing more kids toshio 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.330
 everything and nothing we go in the next video 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.330
 until next time
