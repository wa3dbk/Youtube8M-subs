00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
why I think this is going to be a great

why I think this is going to be a great
idea<00:00:34.649> if<00:00:34.860> they<00:00:35.160> were<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.370> ever<00:00:35.489> implement<00:00:35.969> it

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
idea if they were to ever implement it

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.360 
idea if they were to ever implement it
into<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.480> game<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:37.079> because<00:00:37.499> just<00:00:37.859> you<00:00:38.280> know

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
into the game is because just you know

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.610 
into the game is because just you know

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:42.749 
have a funny-looking shader you could

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:44.059 
have a funny-looking shader you could
end<00:00:42.839> up<00:00:42.960> going<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.289> route<00:00:43.440> with<00:00:43.589> call<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.829> duty

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
for destiny I do hate the idea of just

you<00:00:59.399> know<00:00:59.519> having<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.479> buy<00:01:00.719> your<00:01:01.139> shaders<00:01:01.499> and

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
you know having to buy your shaders and

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.139 
you know having to buy your shaders and
sparrows<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.309> does<00:01:02.460> sound<00:01:02.729> like<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.909> really

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
sparrows that does sound like a really

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.479 
sparrows that does sound like a really
bad<00:01:03.329> idea<00:01:03.389> but<00:01:04.110> if<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.680> comes<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.040> fact<00:01:05.280> of

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
bad idea but if it comes to the fact of

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.850 
bad idea but if it comes to the fact of
having<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.210> it's<00:01:06.360> not<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.570> bad<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.830> just

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
having to that it's not that bad it just

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.680 
having to that it's not that bad it just
shows<00:01:08.280> how<00:01:08.310> much<00:01:08.640> Activision<00:01:09.210> wants<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.540> milk

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
shows how much Activision wants to milk

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.270 
shows how much Activision wants to milk
you<00:01:09.870> of<00:01:10.050> money<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:10.590> otherwise<00:01:10.800> I<00:01:10.980> think<00:01:11.010> that

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
you of money but otherwise I think that

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.070 
you of money but otherwise I think that
you<00:01:11.370> could<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.790> some<00:01:12.000> crazy<00:01:12.300> cool<00:01:12.660> ideas

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
you could have some crazy cool ideas

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.570 
you could have some crazy cool ideas
with<00:01:13.320> like<00:01:13.530> let's<00:01:13.770> say<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:14.160> the<00:01:14.190> exotic

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
with like let's say for the exotic

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.650 
with like let's say for the exotic
shaders<00:01:14.910> maybe<00:01:15.120> you<00:01:15.210> could<00:01:15.300> have<00:01:15.390> like<00:01:15.540> an

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
shaders maybe you could have like an

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.020 
shaders maybe you could have like an
exotic<00:01:15.870> shader<00:01:16.230> of<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> like<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> joker

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
exotic shader of like a like a joker

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.670 
exotic shader of like a like a joker
looking<00:01:18.480> kind<00:01:18.690> of<00:01:18.750> guy<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.200> know<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.530> looks

sparrow is amazing it just looked
awesome<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.480> mean<00:01:48.630> obviously<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.740> doesn't<00:01:49.890> have

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
awesome I mean obviously it doesn't have

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.770 
awesome I mean obviously it doesn't have
to<00:01:50.280> be<00:01:50.310> technically<00:01:50.820> made<00:01:51.150> because<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.690> know

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
to be technically made because you know

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.060 
to be technically made because you know
you<00:01:51.900> already<00:01:51.990> have<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.320> gala<00:01:52.500> horn<00:01:52.740> but<00:01:52.950> it's

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
you already have the gala horn but it's

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.380 
you already have the gala horn but it's
still<00:01:53.190> a<00:01:53.250> really<00:01:53.580> cool<00:01:53.850> thing<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
still a really cool thing that the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.390 
still a really cool thing that the
person<00:01:54.720> did<00:01:54.870> making<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:55.980> I<00:01:56.010> think<00:01:56.280> they

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
person did making that so I think they

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.320 
person did making that so I think they
should<00:01:56.580> actually<00:01:56.730> take<00:01:56.970> that<00:01:57.030> into

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
should actually take that into

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.240 
should actually take that into
consideration<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:58.260> make<00:01:58.560> some<00:01:58.770> exotic

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
consideration and make some exotic

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.830 
consideration and make some exotic
sparrows<00:01:59.580> that<00:01:59.760> look<00:01:59.970> like<00:02:00.270> really<00:02:00.630> cool<00:02:00.780> i

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
don't know like I was expecting the raid

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.520 
don't know like I was expecting the raid
spero<00:02:03.000> for<00:02:03.180> corazon<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.690> have<00:02:03.870> like<00:02:04.140> scales

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
spero for corazon to have like scales

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.930 
spero for corazon to have like scales
and<00:02:04.800> stuff<00:02:04.950> on<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.310> know<00:02:05.340> follow<00:02:05.610> the

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
and stuff on it you know follow the

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.460 
and stuff on it you know follow the
scene<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.480> weapons<00:02:06.930> how<00:02:07.080> they<00:02:07.200> all<00:02:07.290> had

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
scene of the weapons how they all had

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.930 
scene of the weapons how they all had
scales<00:02:07.770> on<00:02:07.950> them<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.220> was<00:02:08.580> like<00:02:08.640> alright<00:02:08.849> cool

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
scales on them I was like alright cool

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.369 
scales on them I was like alright cool
so<00:02:09.119> this<00:02:09.450> Sparrow<00:02:09.690> should<00:02:09.929> be<00:02:09.989> really<00:02:10.289> really

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
so this Sparrow should be really really

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.839 
so this Sparrow should be really really
nice<00:02:10.590> but<00:02:10.920> no<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.250> was<00:02:11.340> just<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.519> different

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
nice but no it was just a different

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.059 
nice but no it was just a different
color<00:02:12.030> time<00:02:12.390> breaker<00:02:12.659> pretty<00:02:12.959> much<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.470> the

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
color time breaker pretty much and the

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.320 
color time breaker pretty much and the
colors<00:02:14.340> just<00:02:14.520> don't<00:02:14.760> really<00:02:14.940> look<00:02:15.060> that<00:02:15.120> nice

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
colors just don't really look that nice

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.940 
colors just don't really look that nice
together<00:02:15.540> either<00:02:15.870> in<00:02:16.110> my<00:02:16.230> opinion<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:16.740> just

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
together either in my opinion I just

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:17.840 
together either in my opinion I just
don't<00:02:17.160> really<00:02:17.310> enjoy<00:02:17.490> them

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850
