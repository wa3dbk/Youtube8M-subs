00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
that hitch up in there might require the

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.730 
that hitch up in there might require the
use<00:04:28.090> of<00:04:28.240> a<00:04:28.300> crowbar<00:04:28.540> or<00:04:28.780> something<00:04:29.230> just<00:04:29.620> to

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
pry the arms out just enough to get the

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.420 
pry the arms out just enough to get the
hitch<00:04:31.390> up<00:04:31.540> into<00:04:31.690> position<00:04:31.980> and<00:04:32.980> once<00:04:33.220> they've
