and that was about it the only major

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.890 
and that was about it the only major
change<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.930> design<00:01:16.049> was<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.920> GTA<00:01:17.369> 4<00:01:17.850> where<00:01:18.720> it

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
change the design was in GTA 4 where it

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.990 
change the design was in GTA 4 where it
became<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.290> chevrolet<00:01:19.799> van<00:01:20.040> instead<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> ford
