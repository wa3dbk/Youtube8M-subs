00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
you a certain technique that I had for a

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.480 
you a certain technique that I had for a
do-it-yourself<00:00:10.019> reflector<00:00:10.620> holder<00:00:10.950> now<00:00:11.429> you

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
do-it-yourself reflector holder now you

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.770 
do-it-yourself reflector holder now you
know<00:00:11.610> reflector<00:00:12.059> it's<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.240> five<00:00:12.420> on<00:00:12.599> one's

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
know reflector it's the five on one's

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.970 
know reflector it's the five on one's
it's<00:00:13.019> something<00:00:13.200> like<00:00:13.259> about<00:00:13.380> shadows<00:00:13.889> and

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
it's something like about shadows and

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.709 
it's something like about shadows and
faces<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.670> I'm<00:00:14.849> actually<00:00:15.000> using<00:00:15.269> one<00:00:15.540> right

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
faces and I'm actually using one right

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:16.970 
faces and I'm actually using one right
now<00:00:15.839> that's<00:00:15.960> what's<00:00:16.170> blocking<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.650> Sun<00:00:16.830> if

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
now that's what's blocking the Sun if

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.650 
now that's what's blocking the Sun if
you<00:00:17.070> see<00:00:17.190> if<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.369> step<00:00:17.609> out<00:00:17.760> that's<00:00:18.359> what<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.630> is

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
you see if I step out that's what it is

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.420 
you see if I step out that's what it is
so<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:18.990> see<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.230> shadows<00:00:19.529> there<00:00:19.740> but<00:00:20.279> I'm

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
so you see the shadows there but I'm

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.830 
so you see the shadows there but I'm
using<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.180> wanted<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.539> tell<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:21.810> guys

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
using this and I wanted to tell you guys

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.439 
using this and I wanted to tell you guys
how<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.260> use<00:00:22.800> reflectors<00:00:23.369> myself<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.330> know

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
how I use reflectors myself you know

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.730 
how I use reflectors myself you know
because<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:24.900> don't<00:00:24.960> have<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.170> system<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> lot<00:00:25.619> of

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
because I don't have a system a lot of

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.259 
because I don't have a system a lot of
the<00:00:25.800> times<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.189> it's<00:00:26.310> just<00:00:26.460> me<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:27.240> know

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
the times and it's just me you know

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.150 
the times and it's just me you know
trying<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.080> hold<00:00:28.230> something<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.920> just

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
trying to hold something and it just

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.650 
trying to hold something and it just
doesn't<00:00:29.340> always<00:00:29.580> work<00:00:29.849> out<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.119> don't<00:00:30.330> have

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
doesn't always work out I don't have

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.420 
doesn't always work out I don't have
someone<00:00:30.900> with<00:00:31.080> me<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.679> best<00:00:31.890> way<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.130> could

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
someone with me so the best way I could

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.370 
someone with me so the best way I could
tell<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.759> do<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.210> tell<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.809> what<00:00:33.989> it's

little weight on it I'm having in my
sandbags<00:02:19.390> with<00:02:19.600> me<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:21.100> can<00:02:21.310> use<00:02:21.459> this

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
with 20 I think this is a 20 inch

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.960 
with 20 I think this is a 20 inch
reflector<00:02:23.620> or<00:02:24.069> you<00:02:24.430> could<00:02:24.580> use<00:02:24.730> this<00:02:24.910> with

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
reflector or you could use this with

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.449 
reflector or you could use this with
like<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.569> 40<00:02:25.870> inch<00:02:25.990> which<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.290> forgot<00:02:26.500> at<00:02:26.770> home<00:02:26.920> or

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
like a 40 inch which I forgot at home or

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.699 
like a 40 inch which I forgot at home or
I<00:02:27.490> would<00:02:27.670> have<00:02:27.760> used<00:02:28.120> it<00:02:28.270> but<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:29.319> just<00:02:29.500> got<00:02:29.620> to

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
I would have used it but you just got to

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.230 
I would have used it but you just got to
watch<00:02:29.830> out<00:02:30.069> for<00:02:30.430> that<00:02:30.580> because<00:02:30.760> it's<00:02:31.060> really

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
watch out for that because it's really

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.090 
watch out for that because it's really
really<00:02:31.390> big<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:32.080> you<00:02:32.170> can<00:02:32.470> take<00:02:32.620> in<00:02:32.770> a<00:02:32.830> lot<00:02:32.950> of

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
really big and you can take in a lot of

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.620 
really big and you can take in a lot of
wind<00:02:33.250> so<00:02:33.430> be<00:02:33.730> careful<00:02:34.150> a<00:02:34.209> hundred<00:02:34.540> percent

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
wind so be careful a hundred percent

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.360 
wind so be careful a hundred percent
even<00:02:35.470> though<00:02:35.560> it's<00:02:35.740> not<00:02:35.860> necessarily<00:02:35.920> gonna

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
even though it's not necessarily gonna

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.949 
even though it's not necessarily gonna
break<00:02:36.520> anything<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:36.970> don't<00:02:37.060> want<00:02:37.270> to<00:02:37.330> move<00:02:37.870> as

break anything you don't want to move as

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.600 
break anything you don't want to move as
a<00:02:38.020> stand<00:02:38.260> but<00:02:38.680> who<00:02:38.770> cares<00:02:39.010> here's<00:02:39.459> the

a stand but who cares here's the

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.250 
a stand but who cares here's the
do-it-yourself<00:02:40.180> reflector<00:02:40.660> older<00:02:40.870> as<00:02:40.990> I<00:02:41.110> said

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
do-it-yourself reflector older as I said

I use this all the time to film videos

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.420 
I use this all the time to film videos
and<00:02:43.690> should<00:02:43.930> do<00:02:44.080> small<00:02:44.380> shoots<00:02:44.650> so<00:02:45.130> here<00:02:45.280> we<00:02:45.340> go

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
and should do small shoots so here we go

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.830 
and should do small shoots so here we go
I'm<00:02:45.520> gonna<00:02:45.610> grab<00:02:45.819> my<00:02:45.849> big<00:02:46.120> beefy<00:02:46.390> stand<00:02:46.660> right

I'm gonna grab my big beefy stand right

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.150 
I'm gonna grab my big beefy stand right
here<00:02:46.870> and<00:02:47.200> I'm<00:02:47.530> gonna<00:02:47.650> use<00:02:47.830> two<00:02:48.010> of<00:02:48.040> these

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
here and I'm gonna use two of these

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.380 
here and I'm gonna use two of these
clips<00:02:48.430> that's<00:02:48.640> why<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:48.760> have<00:02:48.940> both<00:02:49.150> of<00:02:49.180> these

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
clips that's why I have both of these

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.360 
clips that's why I have both of these
out<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:49.840> it's<00:02:50.290> as<00:02:50.380> simple<00:02:50.410> as<00:02:50.740> putting<00:02:50.800> it<00:02:51.250> up

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
out and it's as simple as putting it up

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.090 
out and it's as simple as putting it up
I<00:02:51.670> like<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.600> raise<00:02:52.780> my<00:02:52.810> rise<00:02:53.110> are<00:02:53.290> up<00:02:53.380> all<00:02:53.950> the

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
I like to raise my rise are up all the

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.500 
I like to raise my rise are up all the
way<00:02:54.220> all<00:02:54.550> depends<00:02:54.970> on<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.120> height<00:02:55.270> on<00:02:55.390> what

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
way all depends on the height on what

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.660 
way all depends on the height on what
you<00:02:55.630> have<00:02:55.780> so<00:02:55.990> this<00:02:56.080> is<00:02:56.230> over<00:02:56.470> 6<00:02:56.710> feet<00:02:56.770> alone

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
you have so this is over 6 feet alone

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
you have so this is over 6 feet alone
right<00:02:57.880> here<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:58.180> that's<00:02:58.300> just

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
right here and that's just

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.480 
right here and that's just
pressurizer<00:02:59.050> so<00:02:59.620> I'm<00:02:59.680> gonna<00:02:59.770> put<00:02:59.980> this<00:03:00.100> up<00:03:00.280> I'm

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
pressurizer so I'm gonna put this up I'm

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.770 
pressurizer so I'm gonna put this up I'm
gonna<00:03:00.610> use<00:03:00.790> it<00:03:00.940> close<00:03:01.120> to<00:03:01.270> the<00:03:01.390> end<00:03:01.510> so

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
gonna use it close to the end so

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.630 
gonna use it close to the end so
something<00:03:02.080> similar<00:03:02.380> to<00:03:02.530> this<00:03:02.710> and<00:03:02.950> I'm<00:03:03.400> just

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
something similar to this and I'm just

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.520 
something similar to this and I'm just
going<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:03.910> clip<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.090> on

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
going to clip it on

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.500 
going to clip it on
you<00:03:05.530> know<00:03:05.620> something<00:03:06.040> similar<00:03:06.640> like<00:03:06.940> this

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
you know something similar like this

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.000 
you know something similar like this
okay<00:03:10.510> that's<00:03:10.720> one<00:03:11.020> arm<00:03:11.200> I'm<00:03:11.650> gonna<00:03:11.800> grab<00:03:11.980> my

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
okay that's one arm I'm gonna grab my

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.920 
okay that's one arm I'm gonna grab my
second<00:03:12.490> clip<00:03:12.670> and<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.510> got<00:03:13.630> to<00:03:13.720> be<00:03:13.780> careful

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
second clip and you got to be careful

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.540 
second clip and you got to be careful
because<00:03:14.230> until<00:03:14.770> you<00:03:14.890> get<00:03:15.040> this<00:03:15.160> a<00:03:15.190> hundred

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
because until you get this a hundred

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.330 
because until you get this a hundred
percent<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.970> way<00:03:16.420> you<00:03:16.480> want<00:03:16.780> right<00:03:17.260> away<00:03:17.470> you

percent the way you want right away you
know<00:03:18.460> some<00:03:18.760> of<00:03:18.790> these<00:03:18.910> my<00:03:19.090> clips<00:03:19.390> snap<00:03:19.690> off<00:03:19.900> so

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
know some of these my clips snap off so

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.680 
know some of these my clips snap off so
if<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.650> does<00:03:20.830> it<00:03:21.040> might<00:03:21.460> but<00:03:21.970> it's<00:03:22.480> as<00:03:22.570> simple

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
if it does it might but it's as simple

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.170 
if it does it might but it's as simple
as<00:03:22.870> that<00:03:22.930> this<00:03:23.320> is<00:03:23.470> now<00:03:23.680> I'll<00:03:24.610> turn<00:03:24.820> it<00:03:24.970> towards

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
as that this is now I'll turn it towards

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.420 
as that this is now I'll turn it towards
you<00:03:25.330> this<00:03:25.960> is<00:03:26.110> now<00:03:26.260> on<00:03:26.500> it's<00:03:26.860> completely<00:03:27.310> on

you this is now on it's completely on

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.310 
you this is now on it's completely on
it's<00:03:27.940> pretty<00:03:28.360> sturdy<00:03:28.630> as<00:03:28.840> I<00:03:28.930> said<00:03:29.110> it<00:03:29.230> might

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
it's pretty sturdy as I said it might

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.350 
it's pretty sturdy as I said it might
snap<00:03:29.620> off<00:03:29.770> of<00:03:29.950> my<00:03:30.070> knot<00:03:30.250> you<00:03:30.790> know<00:03:30.910> but<00:03:31.090> as<00:03:31.210> soon

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
as you get the right combination you'll

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.490 
as you get the right combination you'll
be<00:03:32.470> fine<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:32.890> I'm<00:03:33.430> pretty<00:03:33.640> sure<00:03:33.850> that<00:03:34.060> this<00:03:34.270> is

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
be fine and I'm pretty sure that this is

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.590 
be fine and I'm pretty sure that this is
diffusing<00:03:35.500> me<00:03:35.620> right<00:03:36.010> now<00:03:36.250> I<00:03:36.520> mean<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.360> sun's

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
diffusing me right now I mean the sun's

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.600 
diffusing me right now I mean the sun's
right<00:03:37.780> here<00:03:38.020> I'm<00:03:38.170> pretty<00:03:38.620> diffused<00:03:39.040> you<00:03:39.490> know

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
right here I'm pretty diffused you know

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.080 
right here I'm pretty diffused you know
if<00:03:39.670> I<00:03:39.760> take<00:03:39.940> it<00:03:40.090> away<00:03:41.250> boom<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.520> sun's<00:03:42.760> on<00:03:42.910> me

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
if I take it away boom the sun's on me

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.540 
if I take it away boom the sun's on me
so<00:03:43.360> this<00:03:43.930> is<00:03:44.140> it<00:03:44.350> this<00:03:44.590> is<00:03:44.770> my<00:03:44.800> do-it-yourself

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
so this is it this is my do-it-yourself

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.040 
so this is it this is my do-it-yourself
reflector<00:03:45.970> older<00:03:46.180> it's<00:03:46.300> as<00:03:46.420> simple<00:03:46.540> as<00:03:46.810> just

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
light stand it's just easier obviously

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.970 
light stand it's just easier obviously
but<00:03:51.070> something<00:03:51.640> as<00:03:51.730> simple<00:03:51.910> as<00:03:52.440> two<00:03:53.440> clasps

your<00:03:54.610> reflector<00:03:55.150> and<00:03:55.420> as<00:03:55.540> I<00:03:55.630> said<00:03:55.780> you<00:03:55.900> can<00:03:56.050> use

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
your reflector and as I said you can use

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.900 
your reflector and as I said you can use
this<00:03:56.380> on<00:03:56.590> your<00:03:56.860> even<00:03:57.400> your<00:03:57.520> 40<00:03:57.790> inch

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
this on your even your 40 inch

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.190 
this on your even your 40 inch
reflectors<00:03:58.360> even<00:03:58.600> though<00:03:58.690> those<00:03:58.840> aren't<00:03:59.140> as

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
reflectors even though those aren't as

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.840 
reflectors even though those aren't as
common<00:03:59.440> if<00:03:59.710> you're<00:03:59.830> doing<00:04:00.070> simple<00:04:00.340> portraits

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
common if you're doing simple portraits

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.060 
common if you're doing simple portraits
but<00:04:01.360> it's<00:04:01.570> very<00:04:01.690> very<00:04:01.840> simple<00:04:02.230> just<00:04:02.590> space<00:04:02.860> out

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
but it's very very simple just space out

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.190 
but it's very very simple just space out
the<00:04:03.160> clasp<00:04:03.459> and<00:04:03.760> you<00:04:03.820> can<00:04:04.060> just<00:04:04.300> use<00:04:04.510> a<00:04:04.540> you

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
the clasp and you can just use a you

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.990 
the clasp and you can just use a you
know<00:04:05.320> put<00:04:05.530> your<00:04:05.590> risers<00:04:05.800> up<00:04:06.130> and<00:04:06.340> watch<00:04:06.790> out
