00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
errors I just don't think should be in

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.060 
errors I just don't think should be in
books<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:15.560> everybody<00:01:16.560> always<00:01:16.590> says<00:01:16.860> who

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
have nothing better to do she's not a

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.760 
have nothing better to do she's not a
bad<00:02:35.020> writer<00:02:35.520> storyteller<00:02:37.230> mmm<00:02:38.230> not<00:02:38.590> the

bad writer storyteller mmm not the

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.550 
bad writer storyteller mmm not the

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
greatest storyteller but her writing

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.680 
greatest storyteller but her writing
probably<00:02:42.220> saves<00:02:42.550> her<00:02:42.700> in<00:02:42.820> that<00:02:42.970> respect<00:02:43.480> but

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690
