to give you an update on the sax project
I've<00:00:11.700> changed<00:00:12.860> the<00:00:13.860> handle<00:00:14.280> here<00:00:14.400> this<00:00:15.299> is<00:00:15.540> a

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
I've changed the handle here this is a

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.650 
I've changed the handle here this is a
birch<00:00:18.390> as<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.140> can<00:00:19.260> see<00:00:19.439> here<00:00:19.710> it's<00:00:20.660> Carly

birch as you can see here it's Carly

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.960 
birch as you can see here it's Carly
watch<00:00:21.840> we<00:00:22.769> call<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.010> Carla<00:00:23.369> barge<00:00:23.580> very

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
watch we call it Carla barge very

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.349 
watch we call it Carla barge very
probably<00:00:24.180> other<00:00:24.510> names<00:00:24.689> would<00:00:24.980> anyway<00:00:26.359> the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
probably other names would anyway the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.870 
probably other names would anyway the
patterns<00:00:27.720> will<00:00:27.900> emerge<00:00:28.140> better<00:00:28.500> here<00:00:28.769> by<00:00:29.160> if<00:00:29.699> I

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
patterns will emerge better here by if I

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.020 
patterns will emerge better here by if I
use<00:00:30.060> some<00:00:30.529> special<00:00:31.529> chemicals<00:00:32.070> or<00:00:32.279> maybe

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
use some special chemicals or maybe

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.720 
use some special chemicals or maybe
certain<00:00:33.480> oils<00:00:33.840> on<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.530> when<00:00:34.860> it's<00:00:34.980> done<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.640> you

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
certain oils on it when it's done so you

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.209 
certain oils on it when it's done so you
can<00:00:35.790> see<00:00:36.059> here<00:00:36.680> this<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:38.550> almost<00:00:38.910> flame<00:00:39.300> like

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
can see here this so almost flame like

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.459 
can see here this so almost flame like
almost<00:00:41.219> three-dimensional<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.300> sign<00:00:43.020> here

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
almost three-dimensional the sign here

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.360 
almost three-dimensional the sign here
is<00:00:43.680> actually<00:00:44.010> from<00:00:46.370> the<00:00:47.370> tree<00:00:49.070> carling<00:00:50.070> itself

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
is actually from the tree carling itself

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.939 
is actually from the tree carling itself
in<00:00:50.550> knots<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.090> then<00:00:51.660> when<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:51.989> filled<00:00:52.199> up<00:00:52.350> you

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
in knots and then when you filled up you

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.860 
in knots and then when you filled up you
can<00:00:53.129> get<00:00:53.250> cross<00:00:53.460> sections<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.600> show<00:00:54.809> this

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
can get cross sections the show this

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.599 
can get cross sections the show this

little team through it on this side of
the<00:01:40.740> healthy<00:01:41.070> together<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:42.090> then<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.299> have

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
the healthy together and then you have

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.030 
the healthy together and then you have
three<00:01:42.659> holes<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:43.140> could<00:01:43.290> be<00:01:43.409> more<00:01:43.590> homes<00:01:43.829> on

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
three holes it could be more homes on

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.460 
three holes it could be more homes on
summer<00:01:44.280> days<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.820> fewer<00:01:45.420> holes<00:01:45.630> but<00:01:46.079> usually

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
summer days and fewer holes but usually

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.940 
summer days and fewer holes but usually
three<00:01:46.710> or<00:01:46.740> four

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
three or four

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:56.980

here<00:01:52.810> I'll<00:01:53.810> show<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:54.140> actually<00:01:55.689> before<00:01:56.689> it

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
here I'll show you actually before it

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.200 
here I'll show you actually before it
first<00:01:57.289> I<00:01:57.590> can't<00:01:58.159> attach<00:01:58.520> this<00:01:58.759> right<00:01:59.030> now

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
first I can't attach this right now

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.020 
first I can't attach this right now
because<00:01:59.600> I<00:01:59.869> have<00:02:00.490> another<00:02:01.490> piece<00:02:01.759> that<00:02:01.820> goes

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
because I have another piece that goes

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.490 
because I have another piece that goes
here<00:02:02.179> that's<00:02:02.600> going<00:02:02.750> to<00:02:02.840> move<00:02:02.990> everything<00:02:03.229> up

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
here that's going to move everything up

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.800 
here that's going to move everything up
and<00:02:03.829> that<00:02:04.280> means<00:02:04.429> that<00:02:04.610> there<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.539> tiny

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
and that means that there the tiny

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.809 
and that means that there the tiny
actually<00:02:06.259> protrudes<00:02:06.560> on<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:07.100> backside<00:02:07.549> so<00:02:07.759> I

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
actually protrudes on the backside so I

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:09.609 
actually protrudes on the backside so I
can't<00:02:08.090> fit<00:02:08.330> this<00:02:08.479> in<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.780> sloth<00:02:08.989> I<00:02:09.200> made<00:02:09.380> for

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
can't fit this in the sloth I made for

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.589 
can't fit this in the sloth I made for
it<00:02:09.679> but<00:02:10.280> you<00:02:10.399> can<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:10.789> can<00:02:10.940> imagine<00:02:11.150> what<00:02:11.480> it

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
it but you can you can imagine what it

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.630 
it but you can you can imagine what it
will<00:02:11.720> look<00:02:11.780> like<00:02:11.959> something<00:02:12.590> like<00:02:12.709> this<00:02:12.950> and

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
will look like something like this and

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.660 
will look like something like this and
then<00:02:13.790> you<00:02:13.819> be<00:02:14.420> able<00:02:14.599> to<00:02:14.780> pull<00:02:15.739> a<00:02:15.769> knife<00:02:16.040> on<00:02:16.250> the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
then you be able to pull a knife on the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.089 
then you be able to pull a knife on the
list<00:02:16.880> for<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:17.360> piece<00:02:17.569> of<00:02:19.900> string<00:02:21.099> letter

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
list for the piece of string letter

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.910 
list for the piece of string letter
quarter

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
quarter

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.130 
quarter
anyway<00:02:24.640> as<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:24.790> can<00:02:24.970> see<00:02:25.209> I<00:02:25.240> polished<00:02:25.840> off<00:02:26.020> the

times<00:02:48.190> anyway<00:02:49.150> let<00:02:49.900> me<00:02:49.930> see<00:02:50.200> here<00:02:50.500> this<00:02:51.250> is<00:02:51.550> a

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
times anyway let me see here this is a

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.850 
times anyway let me see here this is a
very<00:02:52.030> similar<00:02:52.569> design<00:02:53.519> it's<00:02:54.519> got<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:54.840> ring<00:02:55.860> like

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
very similar design it's got a ring like

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.590 
very similar design it's got a ring like
this<00:02:56.890> one<00:02:57.250> is<00:02:57.370> of<00:02:57.580> trying<00:02:57.880> to<00:02:58.120> make<00:02:58.300> something

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
this one is of trying to make something

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.870 
this one is of trying to make something
like<00:02:58.870> that<00:02:59.080> I<00:02:59.350> know<00:02:59.980> if<00:03:00.130> you<00:03:00.160> can<00:03:00.400> see<00:03:00.640> the

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
like that I know if you can see the

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.440 
like that I know if you can see the
comparison<00:03:01.690> here<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:02.709> then<00:03:03.190> you<00:03:03.370> have<00:03:03.610> the

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
comparison here and then you have the

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.780 
comparison here and then you have the
loop<00:03:05.080> plate<00:03:05.500> like<00:03:05.769> this<00:03:05.799> and<00:03:06.280> you<00:03:06.340> have<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.549> pin

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
loop plate like this and you have to pin

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.759 
loop plate like this and you have to pin
through<00:03:07.000> on<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.420> side<00:03:07.630> and<00:03:08.049> if<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:08.590> back

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
through on the side and if the back

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.680 
through on the side and if the back
plate<00:03:09.040> is<00:03:09.190> being<00:03:09.430> carved<00:03:09.730> here<00:03:10.060> I<00:03:10.239> don't<00:03:10.630> know

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
plate is being carved here I don't know

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.090 
plate is being carved here I don't know
this<00:03:10.989> is<00:03:11.170> what<00:03:11.440> it<00:03:11.530> actually<00:03:11.680> looked<00:03:12.040> like

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
this is what it actually looked like

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.800 
this is what it actually looked like
when<00:03:12.400> I<00:03:12.430> was<00:03:12.489> on<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.819> knife<00:03:12.940> it<00:03:13.330> might<00:03:13.690> have

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
when I was on the knife it might have

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.590 
when I was on the knife it might have
been<00:03:13.959> a<00:03:14.019> nice<00:03:14.200> with<00:03:14.500> it<00:03:14.670> carb<00:03:15.670> damned<00:03:16.030> like

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
been a nice with it carb damned like

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.320 
been a nice with it carb damned like
this<00:03:17.370> but<00:03:18.370> it's<00:03:18.519> not<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:18.700> nice<00:03:18.970> that<00:03:19.239> I'm

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
this but it's not the nice that I'm

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.850 
this but it's not the nice that I'm
actually<00:03:19.510> going<00:03:20.140> to<00:03:20.260> reproduce<00:03:20.860> here<00:03:21.360> this<00:03:22.360> is

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
actually going to reproduce here this is

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.770 
actually going to reproduce here this is
where<00:03:23.860> this<00:03:24.370> is<00:03:24.670> actually<00:03:25.030> from<00:03:25.330> a<00:03:25.420> German

doesn't really matter him it can make
something<00:03:30.130> that<00:03:30.430> looks<00:03:30.700> like<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:31.810> same<00:03:32.019> age

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
something that looks like the same age

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.080 
something that looks like the same age
about<00:03:34.269> the<00:03:34.329> same<00:03:34.450> a<00:03:35.910> similar<00:03:36.910> culture<00:03:37.390> anyway

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
this I know if you can see it before you

also be recast and we have some other
ways<00:03:53.920> there's<00:03:54.519> another<00:03:54.820> one<00:03:54.940> here<00:03:55.329> you<00:03:55.959> can

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
ways there's another one here you can

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.099 
ways there's another one here you can
see<00:03:56.320> similar<00:03:56.680> to<00:03:57.340> lean<00:03:57.549> and<00:03:57.790> this<00:03:58.570> piece<00:03:58.840> here

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
see similar to lean and this piece here

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:04.259 
see similar to lean and this piece here
like<00:04:00.269> like<00:04:01.269> this<00:04:01.950> that<00:04:02.950> and<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.250> rest<00:04:04.150> is

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
like like this that and the rest is

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:05.940 
like like this that and the rest is
missing<00:04:04.630> but<00:04:05.049> you<00:04:05.170> can<00:04:05.320> see<00:04:05.440> here<00:04:05.650> it<00:04:05.769> had<00:04:05.920> a

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
missing but you can see here it had a

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.270 
missing but you can see here it had a
hole<00:04:06.160> through<00:04:06.790> here<00:04:07.060> to<00:04:07.359> hold<00:04:07.510> it<00:04:07.569> in<00:04:07.660> place

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
hole through here to hold it in place

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.190 
hole through here to hold it in place
you<00:04:09.280> can<00:04:09.310> see<00:04:09.640> little<00:04:09.790> ribs<00:04:10.299> I<00:04:10.630> try<00:04:11.140> to

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
you can see little ribs I try to

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.000 
you can see little ribs I try to
recreate

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
recreate

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.300 
recreate
ribs<00:04:12.400> on<00:04:12.640> here<00:04:13.530> I'll<00:04:14.530> hold<00:04:14.769> it<00:04:14.920> up<00:04:15.010> again

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
ribs on here I'll hold it up again

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.670 
ribs on here I'll hold it up again
hopefully<00:04:15.939> you<00:04:16.209> can<00:04:16.359> see<00:04:16.600> that<00:04:16.780> better<00:04:17.019> yes

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
hopefully you can see that better yes

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.040 
hopefully you can see that better yes
and<00:04:19.799> you<00:04:20.799> can<00:04:21.010> see<00:04:21.220> also<00:04:21.699> why<00:04:22.630> I<00:04:22.660> made<00:04:22.930> the

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
and you can see also why I made the

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.939 
and you can see also why I made the
whole<00:04:23.199> series<00:04:23.620> for<00:04:23.979> spikes<00:04:24.520> or<00:04:25.020> males<00:04:26.020> you<00:04:26.770> see

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:26.949 
whole series for spikes or males you see

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.540 
whole series for spikes or males you see
it's<00:04:27.100> a<00:04:27.280> similar<00:04:27.820> design<00:04:28.080> here<00:04:29.080> nails<00:04:29.650> mrs.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
it's a similar design here nails mrs.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.790 
it's a similar design here nails mrs.
for<00:04:30.789> nails<00:04:31.000> in<00:04:31.180> this<00:04:31.330> case<00:04:31.570> and<00:04:31.960> probably<00:04:32.470> the

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
for nails in this case and probably the

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.340 
for nails in this case and probably the
time<00:04:33.250> going<00:04:33.490> throwing<00:04:34.090> being<00:04:34.960> hammered<00:04:35.169> out

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
time going throwing being hammered out

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.710 
time going throwing being hammered out
here<00:04:35.680> but<00:04:36.220> it<00:04:36.310> could<00:04:36.400> also<00:04:36.520> be<00:04:36.729> faithful
