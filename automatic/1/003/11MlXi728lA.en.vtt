retro PC thing being that Windows 95
which<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.289> technically<00:00:24.890> windows<00:00:25.890> 4<00:00:27.410> then<00:00:28.410> it

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
which is technically windows 4 then it

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.740 
which is technically windows 4 then it
came<00:00:28.680> right<00:00:28.890> after<00:00:29.010> 3.1<00:00:29.789> isn't<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.449> true<00:00:30.720> that

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
came right after 3.1 isn't it true that

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.889 
came right after 3.1 isn't it true that
there<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.380> some<00:00:31.710> leftover<00:00:32.369> stuff<00:00:32.669> from<00:00:32.700> 3-1<00:00:33.570> in

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
there is some leftover stuff from 3-1 in

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.549 
there is some leftover stuff from 3-1 in
Windows<00:00:34.320> 95<00:00:34.969> yes<00:00:35.969> there<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.630> I'll<00:00:37.380> show

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
Windows 95 yes there is and I'll show

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.319 
Windows 95 yes there is and I'll show
two<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.950> them<00:00:39.050> the<00:00:40.050> program<00:00:40.500> manager<00:00:41.329> start

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
two of them the program manager start

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.310 
two of them the program manager start
run<00:00:43.190> frogman

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
run frogman

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.049 
run frogman
there's<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.530> program<00:00:46.890> manager<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.700> same<00:00:47.879> one

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
there's the program manager the same one

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.700 
there's the program manager the same one
that<00:00:48.090> was<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.450> Windows<00:00:48.719> 3.1<00:00:50.210> yup<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.500> here

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
that was in Windows 3.1 yup it's in here

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.040 
that was in Windows 3.1 yup it's in here
now<00:00:53.370> ordinarily<00:00:53.640> when<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.210> start<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.809> think

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
now ordinarily when you start it I think

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.060 
now ordinarily when you start it I think
everything<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.530> minimized<00:00:56.129> like<00:00:56.340> this

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
everything is minimized like this

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.830 
everything is minimized like this
there's<00:00:59.070> no<00:00:59.250> real<00:00:59.550> reason<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.120> run<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.539> because

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
there's no real reason to run it because

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.840 
there's no real reason to run it because
to<00:01:01.020> be<00:01:01.109> honest<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.500> runs<00:01:01.710> like<00:01:01.829> crap<00:01:02.190> because

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
to be honest it runs like crap because

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.940 
to be honest it runs like crap because
it's<00:01:03.390> better<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> use<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.170> Explorer<00:01:04.650> but<00:01:06.950> if

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
it's better to use the Explorer but if

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.700 
it's better to use the Explorer but if
for<00:01:08.250> example<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.820> take<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.390> properties<00:01:10.320> and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
for example I take the properties and

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.530 
for example I take the properties and
auto<00:01:11.070> hide<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> taskbar<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:13.280> just<00:01:14.540> maximize

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
auto hide the taskbar and just maximize

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.020 
auto hide the taskbar and just maximize
this<00:01:15.810> we've<00:01:16.140> essentially<00:01:16.799> got<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.280> Windows<00:01:17.640> 3-1

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
this we've essentially got a Windows 3-1

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.700 
this we've essentially got a Windows 3-1
environment<00:01:18.570> here<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:18.930> Windows<00:01:19.229> 95

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
environment here in Windows 95

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.300 
environment here in Windows 95
let<00:01:20.610> me<00:01:20.700> just<00:01:20.850> tile<00:01:21.180> these<00:01:21.830> I'm<00:01:22.830> gonna<00:01:23.040> put<00:01:23.220> it

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
let me just tile these I'm gonna put it

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.160 
let me just tile these I'm gonna put it
back<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.520> way<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.640> had<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.060> let's<00:01:24.330> see<00:01:24.509> put<00:01:24.930> that

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
back the way I had it let's see put that

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.649 
back the way I had it let's see put that
up

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
up

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.510 
up
I<00:01:26.689> just<00:01:27.500> put<00:01:27.649> them<00:01:27.770> all<00:01:27.829> up

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.139 

and<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.600> will<00:01:34.369> window<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:37.220> tile<00:01:38.220> there<00:01:38.729> we<00:01:38.850> go

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
and I will window and tile there we go

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.859 
and I will window and tile there we go
now<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.869> gotta<00:01:40.140> do<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:40.320> one<00:01:40.530> too<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.689> view<00:01:42.689> that

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
now I gotta do this one too I view that

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.690 
now I gotta do this one too I view that
differently<00:01:43.640> instead<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.700> doing<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.060> crap

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
differently instead of doing this crap

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.670 
differently instead of doing this crap
Auto<00:01:47.700> arrange<00:01:48.119> there<00:01:48.420> we<00:01:48.509> go<00:01:48.630> okay<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.259> we've

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
Auto arrange there we go okay so we've

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.760 
Auto arrange there we go okay so we've
got<00:01:49.710> some<00:01:50.039> auto<00:01:50.250> arrange<00:01:50.700> going<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.180> and

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
got some auto arrange going on and

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.710 
got some auto arrange going on and
there's<00:01:52.770> all<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.340> stuff<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.600> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
there's all the stuff and that is the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.940 
there's all the stuff and that is the
program<00:01:54.929> manager<00:01:55.939> now<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.299> can<00:01:57.780> minimize<00:01:58.439> this

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
program manager now I can minimize this

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.760 
program manager now I can minimize this
and<00:01:59.220> you<00:01:59.520> know<00:01:59.610> go<00:01:59.759> back<00:01:59.789> to<00:02:00.090> Windows<00:02:00.390> 95<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.259> I

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
and you know go back to Windows 95 and I

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.809 
and you know go back to Windows 95 and I
will<00:02:02.340> uh<00:02:02.490> naught<00:02:03.330> Oh<00:02:03.360> hide<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:04.640> but<00:02:05.640> yeah

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
will uh naught Oh hide that but yeah

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.669 
will uh naught Oh hide that but yeah
there<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:07.140> old<00:02:07.289> program<00:02:07.619> manager<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:09.679> don't

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
there is the old program manager I don't

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.870 
there is the old program manager I don't
know<00:02:10.799> if<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.069> in<00:02:11.220> Windows<00:02:11.670> 98<00:02:12.350> might<00:02:13.350> be

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
know if this is in Windows 98 might be

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.160 
know if this is in Windows 98 might be
but<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:14.910> would<00:02:15.090> assume<00:02:15.209> uh<00:02:15.510> no<00:02:15.780> on<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.260> one

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
but I would assume uh no on that one

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.830 
but I would assume uh no on that one
so<00:02:19.170> there<00:02:19.380> we<00:02:19.500> go<00:02:19.790> now<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.850> other<00:02:21.030> one<00:02:21.239> is<00:02:21.540> that

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
so there we go now the other one is that

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.630 
so there we go now the other one is that
the<00:02:22.530> try<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.340> close<00:02:23.819> this<00:02:24.090> Oh<00:02:25.340> actually<00:02:26.340> it's

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
the try to close this Oh actually it's

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.280 
the try to close this Oh actually it's
right<00:02:26.790> here<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.060> was<00:02:27.269> going<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.480> show<00:02:27.690> that<00:02:27.870> as<00:02:28.049> a

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
right here I was going to show that as a

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.680 
right here I was going to show that as a
running<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.340> from<00:02:29.519> the<00:02:29.640> command<00:02:30.000> line<00:02:30.060> but<00:02:30.569> the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
running it from the command line but the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.960 
running it from the command line but the
file<00:02:30.840> manager<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.380> here<00:02:31.410> too<00:02:31.769> so<00:02:32.580> if<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.730> double

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
file manager is here too so if I double
