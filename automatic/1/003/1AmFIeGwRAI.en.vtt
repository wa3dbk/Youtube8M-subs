00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:04.290
 I made with the selection of doors under a strict control in the thickness 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.500
 sizing 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.019
 straightness and presence of defects that lu2 guitar joints and marrows 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.429
 In the same way, the preparation of plates and cuts of 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.070
 cartons for filling 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.630
 homogeneous humidity of 8 to 12 percent and in the absence of twists 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.230
 are the conditions to control during the selection of parts before 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.779
 assemble the racks 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.760
 after this verification on a flat surface are arranged the 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.510
 Rectangular stringers and heads 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.210
 making sure that the end of the heads are faced firmly to the 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.240
 end of each spar to staple the contact points on both sides 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.080
 place the molded plate on a flat surface then apply the 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.190
 Unequal fight in the frame 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.269
 on both sides of corrugated cardboard 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.249
 by the filling in the support of locks and in internal reinforcements 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.660
 the other molded plate is installed taking care of the framing of the frame 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.340
 twelve minutes elapsed from this cast side of the first molded plate 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.540
 the armed and stacked forces begin the pressing process that will last 30 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.500
 minutes 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.220
 necessary time that ensures the quality of the gluing of the surfaces in 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.890
 Contact 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.340
 The thickness of the doors manufactured by the company is 45 millimeters for 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.790
 Step and 30 mm doors for folding closet 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.530
 but nevertheless 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.900
 The company's facilities allow the production of wide doors 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.900
 range of dimensions that thickness high and wide 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.320
 One of the most important stages is the rest for 24 hours that allows 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.320
 complete the adhesion between the plates and the frame 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.850
 then the formative and longitudinal square feet of crossbar and 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:48.770
 crossbar 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.750
 This manufacturing phase is carried out by specialized saws whose 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.160
 Court achieves an accurate termination 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.090
 square perez considers that the width of both archers is equal so that 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.360
 Laporta maintain the proportions 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.040
 verification of the size of the force is done as part of the process 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.340
 quality control along with it says edge side on both sides in the 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.310
 door with the purpose of diminishing the risk of chipped nailing on the edges 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.049
 alive 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.819
 the painting of lateral edges and head prevents the entry of 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.739
 moisture to the finished door increasing the durability and dimensional stability 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.299
 the folding doors of the closet the letter hobby font 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.439
 are manufactured in the same way working simultaneously in both 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.619
 parts in which they are composed 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:40.619
 in order to align the reliefs 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.919
 I finished the manufacture of the doors and the process of 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:45.819
 palletized 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.529
 for the subsequent packing and labeling of the packages according to the 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:52.529
 requirements previously defined by customers 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.010
 Another of the services offered by medicine and chili is the installation of 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.930
 hinges locks and freshness
