00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
that line is an orange pod so you put

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.610 
that line is an orange pod so you put
the<00:02:12.239> pots<00:02:12.450> there<00:02:12.690> so<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:12.989> set<00:02:13.260> up<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.470> whole

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
the pots there so you set up the whole

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.910

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.300 
outermost ring on the game board and so
we<00:02:42.630> did<00:02:42.870> that's<00:02:43.050> what<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.290> told<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.769> that's

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
we did that's what I told you that's

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.660 
we did that's what I told you that's
what<00:02:44.459> you<00:02:44.550> see<00:02:45.709> when<00:02:46.709> less<00:02:46.980> than<00:02:47.010> four<00:02:47.400> people

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
what you see when less than four people

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.090 
what you see when less than four people
are<00:02:47.790> playing<00:02:48.090> only<00:02:48.600> use<00:02:49.140> as<00:02:49.319> many<00:02:49.590> spaceships

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
are playing only use as many spaceships

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.520 
are playing only use as many spaceships
as<00:02:50.580> there<00:02:50.910> are<00:02:51.030> players

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
as there are players

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.920 
as there are players
now<00:02:52.530> place<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.280> 20<00:02:53.819> small<00:02:54.090> pieces<00:02:54.390> which<00:02:54.780> are

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
now place the 20 small pieces which are

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.220 
now place the 20 small pieces which are
the<00:02:55.019> energy<00:02:55.200> pods<00:02:55.739> this<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:56.340> an<00:02:56.489> energy<00:02:56.880> pad

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
the energy pods this is an energy pad

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.640 
the energy pods this is an energy pad
okay<00:02:58.230> I'm<00:02:58.980> on<00:02:59.730> the<00:03:00.390> smaller<00:03:00.750> matching<00:03:01.290> colored

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
okay I'm on the smaller matching colored

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.620 
okay I'm on the smaller matching colored
dots<00:03:01.920> which<00:03:02.220> we<00:03:02.400> did<00:03:02.610> so<00:03:02.819> we're<00:03:03.090> setting<00:03:03.390> up<00:03:03.510> a

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
dots which we did so we're setting up a

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.210 
dots which we did so we're setting up a
game<00:03:03.780> like<00:03:03.989> we're<00:03:04.170> playing<00:03:04.410> it<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.890> says<00:03:05.069> when

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
game like we're playing it it says when

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.250 
game like we're playing it it says when
a<00:03:05.250> spaceship<00:03:05.760> is<00:03:05.940> not<00:03:06.180> being<00:03:06.390> played<00:03:06.630> the

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
a spaceship is not being played the

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.170 
a spaceship is not being played the
energy<00:03:07.709> pods<00:03:07.950> of<00:03:08.190> that<00:03:08.340> color<00:03:08.610> are<00:03:08.850> still

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
now here's the spinner which will spin

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.390 
now here's the spinner which will spin
but<00:05:31.110> since<00:05:31.380> you<00:05:31.680> can't<00:05:31.920> see<00:05:32.070> the<00:05:32.130> light<00:05:32.310> you

but since you can't see the light you

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.890 
but since you can't see the light you
