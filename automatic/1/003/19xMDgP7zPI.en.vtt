00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.560 
doesn't matter if you're on normal mode
or<00:01:56.219> vault<00:01:56.399> hunter<00:01:56.700> mode<00:01:56.729> it'll<00:01:57.090> still<00:01:57.329> drop

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
or vault hunter mode it'll still drop

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.889 
or vault hunter mode it'll still drop
the<00:01:57.750> head<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.360> recommend<00:02:00.360> doing<00:02:00.420> on<00:02:00.600> normal

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.050 
the head so I recommend doing on normal
mode<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.200> just<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.409> lot<00:02:01.619> faster<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.670> Henry

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
mode it's just a lot faster so Henry

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.030 
mode it's just a lot faster so Henry
will<00:02:03.180> finally<00:02:03.570> pop<00:02:03.780> out<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> little<00:02:04.259> cave<00:02:04.710> and

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
will finally pop out a little cave and

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.389
