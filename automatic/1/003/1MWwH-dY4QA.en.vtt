00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:17.529 
I always knew I wanted to stand and fish

I always knew I wanted to stand and fish
out<00:00:17.740> of<00:00:17.770> the<00:00:17.890> kayak<00:00:18.160> because<00:00:18.610> kayaks<00:00:19.210> by

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
out of the kayak because kayaks by

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.720 
out of the kayak because kayaks by
nature<00:00:19.869> are<00:00:20.140> rather<00:00:20.650> unstable<00:00:21.220> there<00:00:21.580> are

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
stand in a kayak and fish out of it but

fighting a fish during during the

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.990 
fighting a fish during during the
process<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.870> system<00:00:53.350> came<00:00:53.770> about<00:00:54.100> through

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
process this system came about through

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.880 
process this system came about through
years<00:00:55.900> of<00:00:56.400> development<00:00:57.400> I<00:00:57.610> started<00:00:58.270> actually

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
years of development I started actually

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.940 
years of development I started actually
kayak<00:00:59.890> fishing<00:01:00.130> probably<00:01:00.579> 20<00:01:00.940> years<00:01:01.090> ago<00:01:01.480> and

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
kayak fishing probably 20 years ago and

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.179 
kayak fishing probably 20 years ago and
found<00:01:02.950> over<00:01:03.400> the<00:01:03.520> years<00:01:03.550> that<00:01:04.119> the<00:01:04.329> need<00:01:04.570> for

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
found over the years that the need for

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.460 
found over the years that the need for
standing<00:01:06.189> up<00:01:06.369> was<00:01:06.850> pretty<00:01:07.180> great<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:07.750> ability

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
standing up was pretty great the ability

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.710 
standing up was pretty great the ability
to<00:01:08.560> cease<00:01:08.799> to<00:01:09.280> spot<00:01:09.670> fish<00:01:10.000> from<00:01:10.240> the<00:01:10.329> standing

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
to cease to spot fish from the standing

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.399 
to cease to spot fish from the standing
position<00:01:11.549> cast<00:01:12.549> a<00:01:13.060> fly<00:01:13.750> rod<00:01:14.079> from<00:01:14.259> the

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
position cast a fly rod from the

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.639 
position cast a fly rod from the
standing<00:01:14.770> position<00:01:15.270> see<00:01:16.270> potholes<00:01:16.990> and<00:01:17.439> just

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
standing position see potholes and just

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.129 
standing position see potholes and just
a<00:01:17.740> general<00:01:18.130> comfort<00:01:18.429> of<00:01:18.789> standing<00:01:19.299> up<00:01:19.479> the

00:01:20.129 --> 00:01:20.139 
a general comfort of standing up the

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:22.469 
a general comfort of standing up the
problem<00:01:20.649> with<00:01:20.889> it<00:01:20.920> was<00:01:21.280> always<00:01:21.759> that<00:01:22.270> the

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
problem with it was always that the

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.859 
problem with it was always that the
kayaks<00:01:23.310> pontoon<00:01:24.310> systems<00:01:24.850> were<00:01:25.060> all<00:01:25.240> fixed<00:01:25.749> in

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
kayaks pontoon systems were all fixed in

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.080 
kayaks pontoon systems were all fixed in
the<00:01:25.960> water<00:01:26.200> and<00:01:26.530> you<00:01:26.710> were<00:01:26.829> unable<00:01:27.009> to<00:01:27.159> paddle

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
the water and you were unable to paddle

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.569 
the water and you were unable to paddle
easily<00:01:28.539> so<00:01:29.229> we've<00:01:29.469> come<00:01:29.740> up<00:01:29.770> with<00:01:29.889> a<00:01:30.039> system<00:01:30.459> at

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
easily so we've come up with a system at

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.879 
easily so we've come up with a system at
standing<00:01:30.999> fish<00:01:31.270> where<00:01:31.780> the<00:01:31.929> pontoons<00:01:32.530> can<00:01:32.770> be

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:32.889 
standing fish where the pontoons can be

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:34.919 
standing fish where the pontoons can be
retracted<00:01:33.280> out<00:01:33.700> of<00:01:33.939> the<00:01:34.030> water<00:01:34.299> when<00:01:34.780> you're

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
retracted out of the water when you're

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:37.440 
retracted out of the water when you're
ready<00:01:35.109> to<00:01:35.200> paddle<00:01:35.649> and<00:01:35.939> when<00:01:36.939> you<00:01:37.060> get<00:01:37.209> to<00:01:37.329> your

ready to paddle and when you get to your

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.120 
ready to paddle and when you get to your
spot<00:01:37.780> where<00:01:37.959> you<00:01:38.020> want<00:01:38.139> to<00:01:38.289> fish<00:01:38.530> you<00:01:38.979> can

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
spot where you want to fish you can
