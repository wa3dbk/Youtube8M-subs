00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
of heights you can be doing stuff like

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.650 
of heights you can be doing stuff like
this<00:04:01.360> on<00:04:01.920> cliffs

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
this on cliffs

if<00:04:04.660> you<00:04:04.840> have<00:04:05.320> a<00:04:05.350> problem<00:04:05.620> or<00:04:05.890> I<00:04:05.950> think<00:04:06.280> you'll

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
if you have a problem or I think you'll

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.650 
if you have a problem or I think you'll
have<00:04:06.490> a<00:04:06.550> problem<00:04:06.880> with<00:04:06.970> the<00:04:07.060> altitude<00:04:07.270> you

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
have a problem with the altitude you

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.390 
have a problem with the altitude you
probably<00:04:08.470> shouldn't<00:04:08.740> do<00:04:08.860> high<00:04:08.980> on<00:04:09.040> Picchu

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
probably shouldn't do high on Picchu

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.240 
probably shouldn't do high on Picchu
we're<00:04:10.150> starting<00:04:10.720> at<00:04:10.780> about<00:04:10.840> 7,500<00:04:11.650> feet<00:04:11.680> and

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
we're starting at about 7,500 feet and

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.840 
we're starting at about 7,500 feet and

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
we're walking up a spike so it's

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:16.920 
we're walking up a spike so it's
definitely<00:04:16.180> going<00:04:16.330> to<00:04:16.420> cause<00:04:16.570> you<00:04:16.750> some

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
definitely going to cause you some

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.380 
definitely going to cause you some
