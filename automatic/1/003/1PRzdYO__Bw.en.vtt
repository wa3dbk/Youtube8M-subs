field sensor is there as well now let's

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.810 
field sensor is there as well now let's
run<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.670> full<00:01:14.939> bench<00:01:15.180> park<00:01:16.460> we<00:01:17.460> have<00:01:17.580> fast

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
run the full bench park we have fast

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.490 
run the full bench park we have fast
forward<00:01:18.150> all<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.450> benchmarks<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.350> we

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
forward all the benchmarks so that we

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:27.679 
forward all the benchmarks so that we
can<00:01:19.680> get<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.009> final<00:01:20.310> score<00:01:20.580> quickly<00:01:26.570> so<00:01:27.570> we

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
can get the final score quickly so we

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.410 
can get the final score quickly so we
call<00:01:27.810> final<00:01:28.140> score<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.530> 4<00:01:28.740> 0<00:01:29.040> 5<00:01:29.250> 9<00:01:29.520> which<00:01:30.119> puts

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
call final score of 4 0 5 9 which puts

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.300 
call final score of 4 0 5 9 which puts
it<00:01:30.570> just<00:01:30.900> below<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.320> Asus<00:01:31.710> Transformer<00:01:31.920> Prime

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
it just below the Asus Transformer Prime

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.010 
it just below the Asus Transformer Prime
tablet<00:01:32.850> which<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.390> great<00:01:33.750> for<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.079> device

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
tablet which is great for this device

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.569 
tablet which is great for this device
now<00:01:37.020> we<00:01:37.079> are<00:01:37.290> going<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.530> run<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> Nina<00:01:38.040> mark<00:01:38.310> 2

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
now we are going to run the Nina mark 2

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.670 
now we are going to run the Nina mark 2
benchmark<00:01:39.090> which<00:01:39.750> tests<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.200> graphics

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
benchmark which tests the graphics

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.920 
benchmark which tests the graphics
abilities<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.670> device<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.270> will<00:01:42.750> give

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
abilities of this device and will give

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:52.910 
abilities of this device and will give
us<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.170> frame<00:01:43.409> rate

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.850 

so<00:01:53.920> we<00:01:54.010> got<00:01:54.159> a<00:01:54.190> final<00:01:54.490> score<00:01:54.700> 54.8<00:01:55.570> FPS<00:01:55.960> which

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
so we got a final score 54.8 FPS which

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.249 
so we got a final score 54.8 FPS which
is<00:01:57.010> great<00:01:57.220> for<00:01:57.490> flicker-free<00:01:58.030> gaming<00:02:01.200> now<00:02:02.200> we

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
is great for flicker-free gaming now we

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.980 
is great for flicker-free gaming now we
are<00:02:02.440> going<00:02:02.560> to<00:02:02.680> run<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:03.250> antutu<00:02:03.820> benchmark<00:02:03.990> it
