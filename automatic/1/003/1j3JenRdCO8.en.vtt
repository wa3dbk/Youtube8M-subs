00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 and greet you well before you 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.000
 watch this video I want to say 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.040
 that this video is very different 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.730
 since there is music in the background and 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.110
 that at the end there is a little animation 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.299
 the story of you to warn you 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.150
 that there will be some small changes 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.670
 then you just have to put down your 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.519
 opinion if you prefer with it's this 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.430
 technical or before when I was doing 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.849
 my dofus videos and it's the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.849
 good videos 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.730
 and well dirty everyone and my world 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.910
 and today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.950
 little video them 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:57.850
 a little tutorial a little demonstration 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:01:00.160
 for for the game skateboard 3 how to 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.239
 create a logo on this t3 so I'm going 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:07.270
 rather call it a tutorial so here 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.910
 so first of all I have to say that 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.480
 so at the end of the video I booked 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:16.450
 a little animation 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:21.340
 I took sound effects on sound 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:23.320
 phishing for those who do not know it 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.540
 so then as promised we are valid 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.490
 skate 3 then my desire is a little slow 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.280
 because in fact it's a song that has 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.720
 which started since this morning it makes 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.170
 that walk that the market can not 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.890
 cancel 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.580
 not only the cdt the computer fast 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.840
 I have a little laziness of 10 tons to 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.720
 laymont to go to bed 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:50.620
 so we go to the e-mails site 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:53.370
 skate it's the special skate site 3 you 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:58.180
 of course you need to create an account 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:59.800
 yay guay as well as to account origin the 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.350
 comte origin i'm not sure he's 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.750
 obligatory but the tale watches the agent 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.380
 were then it's very easy for those 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.990
 crav for what tells that it is enough to 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.390
 bar down to the guînes paris 6 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.370
 behind the bow and login it will be good 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.709
 so me everything is in french is this 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.460
 that I have a translator 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.750
 that's it 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:25.060
 I did everything automatically 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.880
 speak so 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.690
 so that's so already fake will be on 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.510
 skate quilt one complicates on 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.400
 logically 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:42.640
 oh yes it's true as you have my 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:44.380
 ordi by ramé a lot here we are 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.840
 so once you're in stoppage 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.580
 it'll show us a little bit here 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.170
 all and beautiful videos every 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.030
 new pictures that that the 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.090
 people who were able to add and we 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.590
 go and in the ain its graphics graphics 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.870
 creator click on it 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.120
 there is a music that will launch a 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.860
 music otherwise completely rotten 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.250
 in me I think it was going to go 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.730
 really very badly chosen for the 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.170
 for the lower rhine for skateboard 3 because 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.530
 I find that absolutely nothing to see 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.940
 500 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.670
 I leave you I leave you a little 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:22.800
 good listened to this I'll cut this 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.880
 music what I do not want anymore l 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.020
 arpam then not at all so that's it then 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.260
 if it's the two logos that I could 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.260
 create but we are going to go there then to 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.090
 beginning 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.400
 to the 3 starting cells that are empty 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.540
 he was and that's when we're in 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.000
 something like that for who is 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.000
 our father our logo is complex 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:58.170
 a little better we will say a logo finally 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.170
 like that 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.700
 really 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.700
 to the lodging 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.700
 if there is any emmanuel who 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.060
 who are recruiting it's me who's feet 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.880
 his sketchup sneakers it's like the 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.189
 ketchup knows what health ketchup make a 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.340
 backtracking and 

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:26.620
 the logo so contacted month on the flame 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.970
 thanks to 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.970
 it's léo +0 07 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.019
 m 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:36.169
 this is how I created my taste 

00:04:34.019 --> 00:04:39.800
 of course still added ex 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:42.520
 it makes sense we do not put in the right 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.520
 already knows the waters 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:55.159
 he was not shooting at all it's just for 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.439
 to show you here once we've done 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:59.569
 we're going to save and here it's a bit 

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:02.599
 the part is more full-bodied we will say that 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:05.449
 of the thing that is his logo it's very 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:07.759
 very simple so here is one 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:10.310
 we'll think it's good 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:13.069
 for safety and well not suddenly 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:16.370
 has it in our in our gallery 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:18.620
 but we do not have it in the bath yet 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:23.479
 on our server on the wound we're going 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:26.779
 have it published here are you asking when 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.339
 he is asked how do we 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:32.900
 want to call him me I'll call him by 

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:35.949
 example test and a password it mega 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:39.469
 test I do not know what to choose 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:43.520
 then the three boxes of where is in 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:49.330
 done by checking ten arable boxers 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:50.780
 wind to eight days of fame 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.110
 then submitted 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:57.190
 next graphic scene or game we go there 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.190
 choose the gameloft 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:08.450
 what you chose the season is in 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:10.529
 do they shell oil to us 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:17.129
 load 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:19.499
 finally his cat load is there low and 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:23.189
 that she swears mateille will be waiting of course 

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:26.419
 the meadow 2 to 3 minutes 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:29.120
 it will suffice 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:30.950
 investigation in which his son 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.790
 nothing 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:36.120
 and you do 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:37.650
 the loyal and nobody who will punctuate their 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.460
 kind of squares with 1 1 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:44.310
 a little tomorrow for example 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:48.620
 it will be the third in history 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.620
 more than the normal look these marks 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.380
