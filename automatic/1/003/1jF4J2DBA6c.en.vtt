 gusts like hurricanes from my mouth like this

 that runs for the basement that the 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.600
 Thunb take note of the heavy material 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.850
 like a toque 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.769
 I bring more poison than food in our 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.380
 tables with a firm conviction that the 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.720
 hip hop for heads to knock down weeds 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.030
 with a revolutionary machete wielded 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.190
 by inheritance or I am a monster 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.899
 writing every word is a face 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.690
 who sees me smiling I do not even know what 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.280
 I'm eating because when the 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.740
 notebook loose bombs where I'm 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.869
 flowing so they have easy college 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.940
 voice enjoys rap without you 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.979
 I do not worry if you see me with the 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.200
 tree if you are with me jump the boat and 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.420
 let's go to the point of the connection the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.280
 connection that flows like my latex cues 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.840
 thousands turn off the lights because this 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.850
 project to withstand the voltages that its 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.310
 server produces and they look like 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.350
 Mayweather with the gloves already deduces that 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.270
 this is not a da vinci code is 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.789
 resolved how it turned out when I'm 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.979
 loose and return to the line taken to the 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.380
 cannon firing with the precision of a 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.509
 sniper I see drag on the night blog 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.909
 truth day and I listen to your song 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.979
 conclusion is a cancer I bring you the 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.840
 trachea therapy from stem to girdle 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.270
 so that they learn to catch the air like 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.880
 an astronaut 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.100
 to see if they recognize what is really 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.100
 here is a nomad child
