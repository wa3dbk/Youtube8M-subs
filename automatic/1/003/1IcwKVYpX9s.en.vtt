but<00:04:08.050> at<00:04:08.320> UCLA<00:04:08.770> you<00:04:09.250> know<00:04:09.340> we're<00:04:09.790> only

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
but at UCLA you know we're only

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.520 
but at UCLA you know we're only
rehearsing<00:04:10.390> three<00:04:10.540> times<00:04:10.720> a<00:04:10.840> week<00:04:10.989> during<00:04:11.380> the

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
week and so it's a little different than

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.220 
week and so it's a little different than
in<00:04:12.880> a<00:04:12.940> drum<00:04:13.180> corps<00:04:13.300> situation<00:04:13.780> you<00:04:13.870> rehearsing

you all nine hours a day you don't have
anything<00:04:16.900> else<00:04:17.109> going<00:04:17.290> on<00:04:17.440> to<00:04:17.590> worry<00:04:17.770> about

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
anything else going on to worry about

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.560 
anything else going on to worry about
just<00:04:18.070> the<00:04:18.190> drumming<00:04:18.520> we're<00:04:18.910> at<00:04:19.000> UCLA<00:04:19.359> you<00:04:19.450> know

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
just the drumming we're at UCLA you know

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.479 
just the drumming we're at UCLA you know
some<00:04:20.200> guys<00:04:20.350> coming<00:04:20.650> from<00:04:20.739> class<00:04:21.040> and<00:04:21.370> guys

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
some guys coming from class and guys

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:22.890 
some guys coming from class and guys
have<00:04:21.580> finals<00:04:22.000> midterms<00:04:22.360> it's<00:04:22.660> kind<00:04:22.810> of<00:04:22.870> a

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
have finals midterms it's kind of a

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.360 
have finals midterms it's kind of a
different<00:04:23.140> vibe<00:04:23.260> in<00:04:23.500> it<00:04:23.620> makes<00:04:24.040> it<00:04:24.130> a<00:04:24.190> little

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
different vibe in it makes it a little

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.890 
different vibe in it makes it a little
more<00:04:24.490> challenging<00:04:24.580> I<00:04:25.090> think<00:04:25.120> to<00:04:25.480> be<00:04:25.600> worrying

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
more challenging I think to be worrying

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.450 
more challenging I think to be worrying
about<00:04:25.960> drumming<00:04:26.650> and

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
about drumming and

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.700 
about drumming and
but<00:04:27.639> you<00:04:27.819> know<00:04:27.960> most<00:04:28.960> guys<00:04:29.169> here<00:04:29.410> do<00:04:29.530> pretty

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
but you know most guys here do pretty

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:46.620 
but you know most guys here do pretty
well<00:04:29.919> I<00:04:30.160> think<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:45.220> main<00:04:45.370> difference<00:04:45.789> here<00:04:46.000> at

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
well I think the main difference here at

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.200 
well I think the main difference here at
a<00:04:46.930> UCLA<00:04:47.740> for<00:04:47.860> the<00:04:48.130> marching<00:04:48.430> band<00:04:48.669> in<00:04:49.090> a

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
college line as opposed to a drum corps

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.059 
college line as opposed to a drum corps
line<00:04:52.330> is<00:04:52.630> everybody<00:04:53.289> is<00:04:53.380> a<00:04:53.410> student<00:04:53.860> and

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:54.069 
line is everybody is a student and

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:56.159 
line is everybody is a student and
that's<00:04:54.160> our<00:04:54.370> main<00:04:54.490> priority<00:04:55.030> is<00:04:55.300> that<00:04:55.870> they<00:04:56.110> do

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
that's our main priority is that they do

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.320 
that's our main priority is that they do
well<00:04:56.440> academically<00:04:57.069> in<00:04:57.759> addition<00:04:58.240> to

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
well academically in addition to

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.050 
well academically in addition to
drumming<00:04:58.690> well<00:04:58.810> although<00:04:59.560> we<00:04:59.680> practice<00:05:00.340> a<00:05:00.580> lot

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
drumming well although we practice a lot

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.180 
drumming well although we practice a lot
we<00:05:01.720> can't<00:05:01.900> practice<00:05:02.050> as<00:05:02.320> much<00:05:02.470> as<00:05:02.530> say<00:05:02.889> a<00:05:02.919> drum

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
we can't practice as much as say a drum

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.010 
we can't practice as much as say a drum
corps<00:05:03.370> would<00:05:03.550> to<00:05:04.479> achieve<00:05:04.720> the<00:05:04.840> same

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
corps would to achieve the same

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.140 
corps would to achieve the same
excellence<00:05:05.410> so<00:05:05.949> we<00:05:06.490> really<00:05:06.699> have<00:05:06.820> to<00:05:06.940> take

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
excellence so we really have to take

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.310 
excellence so we really have to take
advantage<00:05:07.539> of<00:05:07.630> the<00:05:07.720> time<00:05:07.840> we<00:05:08.020> have<00:05:08.169> at

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
advantage of the time we have at

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.320 
advantage of the time we have at
rehearsal<00:05:08.800> because<00:05:09.580> we<00:05:09.759> don't<00:05:09.910> have<00:05:10.000> any<00:05:10.150> time

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
rehearsal because we don't have any time

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:22.670 
rehearsal because we don't have any time
to<00:05:10.449> waste

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.920 

so<00:05:23.680> most<00:05:23.889> of<00:05:24.009> our<00:05:24.300> our<00:05:25.300> drummers<00:05:25.659> are<00:05:25.780> not

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
so most of our our drummers are not

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.230 
so most of our our drummers are not
music<00:05:26.289> majors<00:05:26.560> we<00:05:26.770> have<00:05:26.860> engineers<00:05:27.460> people
