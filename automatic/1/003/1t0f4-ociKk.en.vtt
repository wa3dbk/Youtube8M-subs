people<00:01:49.560> not<00:01:50.340> really<00:01:50.579> affected<00:01:51.090> at<00:01:51.180> all<00:01:51.299> they

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
people not really affected at all they

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.060 
people not really affected at all they
were<00:01:51.570> very<00:01:51.840> resistant<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.710> follow<00:01:52.920> up

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
were very resistant to the follow up

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.179 
were very resistant to the follow up
reason<00:01:54.030> as<00:01:54.240> scientists<00:01:54.930> figured<00:01:55.259> out<00:01:55.380> they

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
reason as scientists figured out they

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.889 
reason as scientists figured out they
were<00:01:56.250> all<00:01:56.490> drinking<00:01:56.729> from<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.299> same<00:01:57.600> water

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
were all drinking from the same water

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.020 
were all drinking from the same water
source<00:01:58.259> very<00:01:58.680> remote<00:01:59.009> water<00:01:59.369> source<00:01:59.729> that

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
source very remote water source that

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.690 
source very remote water source that
have<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.810> unique<00:02:01.170> water<00:02:01.560> structure<00:02:02.130> again

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
have that unique water structure again

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.149 
have that unique water structure again
so<00:02:03.360> those<00:02:03.600> three<00:02:03.960> things<00:02:03.990> being<00:02:04.649> born<00:02:05.009> with

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
so those three things being born with

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.130 
so those three things being born with
that<00:02:05.310> water<00:02:05.490> structure<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.509> importance<00:02:06.990> of

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
that water structure the importance of

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.529 
that water structure the importance of
that<00:02:07.290> signify<00:02:07.770> alignment<00:02:08.280> from<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.030> Nobel

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
that signify alignment from the Nobel

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.570 
that signify alignment from the Nobel
prize-winning<00:02:09.959> research<00:02:10.140> we<00:02:10.530> reference

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
prize-winning research we reference

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.330 
prize-winning research we reference
and<00:02:11.670> lastly<00:02:12.540> this<00:02:13.230> structure<00:02:13.710> already<00:02:13.920> having

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
and lastly this structure already having

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.460 
proven itself in a toxic environment
those<00:02:17.430> are<00:02:17.610> three<00:02:17.940> key<00:02:18.240> things<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.870> people

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
those are three key things that people

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.160 
those are three key things that people
need<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.860> know<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.670> really<00:02:21.000> understand<00:02:21.660> the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
need to know to really understand the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.410 
need to know to really understand the
power<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.190> technology<00:02:23.340> like<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:24.030> ammeter

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.199 
idea can you describe that absolutely
the<00:03:45.690> way<00:03:45.840> I<00:03:45.870> see<00:03:46.260> it<00:03:46.290> is<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.950> hub<00:03:47.220> is<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:48.180> eye

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
the way I see it is the hub is the eye

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.110 
the way I see it is the hub is the eye
water<00:03:48.600> so<00:03:48.989> water<00:03:49.290> isn't<00:03:49.620> just<00:03:50.220> a<00:03:50.520> hydration

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
water so water isn't just a hydration

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.479 
water so water isn't just a hydration
technology<00:03:51.390> water<00:03:52.320> is<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.620> ultimate<00:03:53.010> solvent

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
technology water is the ultimate solvent

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.790 
technology water is the ultimate solvent
and<00:03:53.910> it's<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.239> great<00:03:54.510> delivery<00:03:55.110> mechanism<00:03:55.680> for

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
and it's a great delivery mechanism for

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.040 
and it's a great delivery mechanism for
nutrients<00:03:56.220> so<00:03:56.730> imagine<00:03:57.180> if<00:03:57.330> with<00:03:57.930> the

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
nutrients so imagine if with the

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.660 
nutrients so imagine if with the
operative<00:03:58.440> technology<00:03:58.890> we<00:03:59.130> have<00:03:59.280> water<00:03:59.550> that

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
operative technology we have water that

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.330 
operative technology we have water that
is<00:04:00.060> as<00:04:00.630> science<00:04:01.050> has<00:04:01.170> shown<00:04:01.340> significantly

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
is as science has shown significantly

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.270 
is as science has shown significantly
more<00:04:02.610> liquid<00:04:03.360> so<00:04:03.660> it's<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.870> super<00:04:04.140> liquid<00:04:04.620> that

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
more liquid so it's a super liquid that

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.870 
more liquid so it's a super liquid that
is<00:04:05.489> also<00:04:05.700> a<00:04:05.880> super<00:04:06.150> solvent<00:04:06.750> so<00:04:07.410> you<00:04:07.489> infuse<00:04:08.489> or

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
is also a super solvent so you infuse or

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.240 
is also a super solvent so you infuse or
you<00:04:09.060> couple<00:04:09.570> it<00:04:09.720> with<00:04:09.930> nutrients<00:04:10.890> whether<00:04:11.040> the

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
you couple it with nutrients whether the

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.330 
you couple it with nutrients whether the
liquids<00:04:11.790> capsules<00:04:12.690> powders<00:04:13.380> whatever<00:04:14.040> it<00:04:14.190> may

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
liquids capsules powders whatever it may

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.690 
liquids capsules powders whatever it may
be

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
be

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.180 
be
imagine<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.780> nutrient<00:04:16.290> delivery<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:17.070> the

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
imagine the nutrient delivery and the

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.510 
imagine the nutrient delivery and the
nutrient<00:04:17.700> uptake<00:04:18.350> into<00:04:19.350> your<00:04:19.560> system<00:04:19.979> so

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
nutrient uptake into your system so

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.130 
nutrient uptake into your system so
that's<00:04:20.700> what<00:04:20.910> we<00:04:21.000> call<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.330> hub<00:04:21.479> and<00:04:21.660> spoke<00:04:21.960> as

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
that's what we call the hub and spoke as

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.469 
that's what we call the hub and spoke as
having<00:04:22.410> the<00:04:22.530> I<00:04:22.560> water<00:04:22.919> use<00:04:23.669> the<00:04:23.880> I<00:04:23.910> water<00:04:24.270> as

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
the technology by itself but you couple

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.490 
the technology by itself but you couple
