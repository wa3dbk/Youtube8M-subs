you get that source there's gonna be

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.229 
you get that source there's gonna be
tons<00:00:58.640> of<00:00:59.899> packages<00:01:00.899> but<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.620> want<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.890> go<00:01:02.239> to

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
tons of packages but you want to go to

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.609 
tons of packages but you want to go to
the<00:01:03.329> very<00:01:03.539> bottom<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.229> W's<00:01:06.200> let's<00:01:07.200> see<00:01:07.500> if

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
the very bottom to the W's let's see if

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:16.070 
the very bottom to the W's let's see if
we<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:07.920> get<00:01:08.100> down<00:01:08.310> there

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:25.340 

so<00:01:17.070> I'll<00:01:17.220> write<00:01:17.370> the<00:01:17.520> W's<00:01:22.640> and<00:01:23.870> you<00:01:24.870> want<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.200> go

springboard umm you click on it let it
load<00:01:59.700> load<00:02:02.420> and<00:02:05.000> so<00:02:06.000> yes<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.660> is<00:02:07.580> all<00:02:08.580> the

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
load load and so yes this is all the

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.960 
load load and so yes this is all the
previously<00:02:10.710> entered<00:02:10.830> passwords<00:02:11.520> before<00:02:11.940> I

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
previously entered passwords before I

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.250 
previously entered passwords before I
even<00:02:12.230> installed<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.440> package<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.900> if<00:02:15.900> that's

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
even installed the package so if that's

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.330 
even installed the package so if that's
how<00:02:16.820> you<00:02:17.960> say<00:02:18.960> your<00:02:19.200> friend<00:02:19.470> doesn't<00:02:20.010> want<00:02:20.160> you

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
how you say your friend doesn't want you

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.030 
how you say your friend doesn't want you
know<00:02:20.489> its<00:02:20.640> password<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.630> just<00:02:21.660> enters<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.770> and

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
know its password and just enters it and

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.440 
know its password and just enters it and
so<00:02:23.220> there's<00:02:23.520> no<00:02:23.640> other<00:02:23.790> way<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.030> can<00:02:24.270> know

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.630 
so there's no other way you can know
unless<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:24.870> do<00:02:25.020> this<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.040> hope<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.489> guys
