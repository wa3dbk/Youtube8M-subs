class and it's a fail cuz I only because
I<00:04:27.969> get<00:04:28.210> maximum<00:04:28.840> it<00:04:28.960> gets<00:04:29.110> 100<00:04:29.669> because<00:04:30.669> I

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
I get maximum it gets 100 because I

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.869 
I get maximum it gets 100 because I
choke<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.259> first<00:04:32.530> round<00:04:32.710> I<00:04:33.069> can't<00:04:33.550> get<00:04:33.729> the

00:04:33.869 --> 00:04:33.879 
choke the first round I can't get the

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:36.059 
choke the first round I can't get the
first<00:04:34.150> round<00:04:34.419> like<00:04:34.870> so<00:04:35.319> I<00:04:35.500> can't<00:04:35.830> get<00:04:35.949> the

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:36.069 
first round like so I can't get the

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:38.610 
first round like so I can't get the
actual<00:04:36.520> first<00:04:37.389> round<00:04:37.659> streaks<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:38.229> I<00:04:38.319> think

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
actual first round streaks and I think
