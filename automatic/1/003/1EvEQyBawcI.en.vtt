 hello welcome once again to those who 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.970
 we comment spreads 28 and we are in a 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.560
 new edition of in charm the server if 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.020
 we are in section e and today we are going to 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.390
 learn as the title says a menu of 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.279
 pet good idols are already all 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.140
 permissions configured the link with the 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.460
 paragraph l leave in the description of 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.070
 this video as always the version 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.960
 simple that will only contain only the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.030
 necessary for this plugin to work 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.220
 correctly and also a version 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.870
 complete that would include everything that has 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.240
 the lobby has already been set as the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.040
 white weed pound and the essential the 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.570
 essential pound and all the plugin 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.760
 generals that this lobby has that are 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.770
 essential plugins to have a lobby 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.870
 ok idols now let's see the gri 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.970
 view more or less what this includes 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.070
 paragraph as you will see here we have a 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.870
 tool and it's called - of pets and 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.460
 says down right click to open the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.870
 pet shop we are going to them 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.270
 do almost we're going to right click 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.309
 as always and how will they see if it is not going to 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.380
 open a very intuitive and very cute menu 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.049
 of pets this from here to row 4 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.790
 would all the different pets or 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.009
 pets that we will have to select 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.750
 obviously already configure them for three 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.550
 different types of football range 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.020
 for those who enter for the first time 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.840
 to the server and they do not have any 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.970
 beep privilege and also a common beep and 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.650
 one more beep that would be two types of range 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.120
 different obviously the most bit has 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.740
 much more privileges than what would be 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.750
 the beep as a good in guys like 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.030
 I will always leave you attached to the link 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.160
 machito with the essential commands for 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.050
 use what would this be me I have 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.880
 configured using the it and plugin 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.860
 customs join so that it appears from the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.300
 box number 2 the menu item of 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.220
 selection to simply make 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.140
 click on entered me without having to be 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.580
 putting any command but the 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.130
 opposite for those who want to know 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.920
 exactly how is it simply to copy 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.960
 in the east code that would be fet selector 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.640
 and they will stick it will grant them what would be 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.430
 the selection tool well and 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.800
 I will also leave you the command that serves 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.270
 to directly open the menu without 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.759
 have to be clicking on any 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.289
 and it is also exactly the same thing 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.910
 I leave those three options for you 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.520
 see which one you like the most and which one 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.500
 more favored which one is better with the 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.030
 your server's style as you will see here in 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.920
 the bottom we have different 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.350
 tools that will allow us to edit 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.940
 many things of the pet as per 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.970
 example the name 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.520
 to be able to put on that hat 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.520
 pet make that pet speak 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.320
 make it disappear and of course 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.480
 enter a menu of that pet well 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.490
 the blond will basically do it from the 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.740
 group of fans towards the highest group 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.330
 that is to say to the group of the highest rank that 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.040
 would be the first bit first let's see the 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.290
 default to see what it contains as it is 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.330
 the group by default and we're going to see the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.670
 different things that it offers us 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.130
 in the default group what would be the menu 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.290
 of pets we are going to click and for 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.330
 example if I want to choose some pet 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.940
 that is not within the permissions for 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.590
 example if you want to choose the pp is not going 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.660
 to leave he will not study the fish for 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.550
 course but if for example you want 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.770
 choose the pet chicken 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.120
 this is the one that is enabled the only 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.730
 which is enabled for those who would be 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.670
 the users of this beautiful I love 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.560
 the hen and we could also make him 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.420
 click on that chicken and if we want 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.860
 changing the name will not leave us anymore 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.330
 who within the soccer group 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.370
 The only thing we can do is have a 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.860
 only pet and we can not rename it 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.930
 neither use as hat nor do that 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.630
 speak absolutely nothing well this would be 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.820
 basically for those users who 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.320
 they just enter the server well for 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.940
 encourage what donations would be 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.560
 in your created servers or other two 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.630
 groups with a lot more permissions 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.130
 obviously so that you can 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.670
 progress with the server and users 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.260
 they manage to entertain in the process 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.020
 generated the now let's make a 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.700
 small transition and let's move it to 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.330
 what would be the vip group that would be the 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.340
 group who although we return it a 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.800
 now been what we already returned as they can 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.660
 observe we are now in the group vips 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.730
 that would be the second group that comes in 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.010
 the hierarchy of the vip group and then the 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.960
 last is bit more we are already in the group 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.180
 well and let's see the different 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.210
 options offered by the group this 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.069
 video 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:15.099
 in fact for example let's select 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:17.530
 caber like summer now if you leave us 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.660
 select some specials not all 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.169
 of course for example what would be the 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.639
 ocelot would not leave us because that is 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.690
 enabled for the beat group more 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:30.699
 would not leave us for example the 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.590
 traveler that is also for the group 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.110
 beat rather idols now what we're going 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.120
 to do is rename to be and table 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.620
 let's put a name in an interface 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.330
 very intuitive as I told them to 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.660
 we are simply going to click 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.610
 here where it says name your pet 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.010
 here is not going to say that we introduce 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.810
 the name of the pet they want 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.600
 put we can use colors for 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:55.070
 example , we are going to put it in red and 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.070
 in bolt we are going to put 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.750
 and as you will see the name has been changed 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.000
 correctly well that would also be 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.780
 part of the edition for users 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.330
 vip and could also for example ride 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.530
 what would your pet see and now 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.380
 we could finish with their pets 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.540
 look how fast the frog is every 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.340
 once has its different qualities by 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.170
 example the bat could fly with 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.390
 him but the bat would be only for 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.120
 the most bits charge the spider is 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:26.520
 pretty fast it 's quite dimension 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.070
 comes with jumps it 's like making a 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.960
 double jump pretty cute and it would be 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.990
 pretty scary to go to where bp 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.230
 mounted on this because not right now 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.910
 we will also show for example how 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.770
 hide the pet simply by doing 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.510
 click here 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.800
 our pet would disappear wounded what 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.510
 let's do now if a small 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.760
 more transition to see what would be the 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.650
 group vips more and now yes we are already 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.270
 back we will see the group vilma for 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.250
 that you corroborate we are already in the 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.770
 vips group more and good now let's see 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.420
 for example what would be the bat that does not 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.150
 let's go open earlier with the 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.130
 common beat and as you will see now yes we already 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.180
 He has left his bow and left us his 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.430
 worldwide any 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.530
 who wants to show a head line that 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.720
 has been he wanted to clarify that for 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.870
 use what would be the item this 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:15.030
 will have a cool down of 5 seconds to 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.919
 prevent it from accumulating a lot in the in the 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.690
 server you will have access to edit 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.340
 that value if they want to not have a point 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.919
 where the host hanging or obviously that 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.660
 have inside the custom file 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:26.520
 join item of what the file would be and 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.310
 ml well configuration 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.110
 we are going to choose the bat of 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.060
 new and good what I wanted to show him 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.910
 that for example we can ride the 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:38.250
 our bat and what he told them 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:39.990
 that we are going to be able to fly with him and how 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.030
 you will see it start to fall because our 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.620
 own weight pushes it down is what 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.789
 I love this pet menu 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.710
 they have their different 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:48.479
 features each pet and they are 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.490
 pretty intuitive look at pretty that 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:52.530
 it remains do not tell me that it is quite 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.690
 cute too for example we would have what 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:58.500
 that would be the lion of the dragon we are going to 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:07:00.449
 example choose to ride on it and how 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.180
 power ride 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:04.979
 and as summer we can control and give 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.840
 return to our whim and take it to 

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:10.499
 wherever we want, do not tell me you 're not 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:13.169
 One last thing that my son dies 

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:14.759
 he is very happy the truth that they are 

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:17.610
 very happy to be in your dragon in 

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:19.499
 there as summer we can drive to 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.659
 our whim rename do what 

00:07:19.499 --> 00:07:25.110
 we want well now yes idols we're going 

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:27.289
 to dismiss he goes happy in his dragon 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.819
 dancing I do not know why I 'm sitting 

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:31.710
 I hope you liked it and for 

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:33.870
 look for those that are not the first time
