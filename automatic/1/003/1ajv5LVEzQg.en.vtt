spaghetti you know what I mean so like

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.970 
spaghetti you know what I mean so like
you<00:00:45.719> could<00:00:45.840> still<00:00:46.110> favor<00:00:46.350> something<00:00:46.649> more

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
you could still favor something more

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.830 
you could still favor something more
even<00:00:47.250> if<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.430> isn't<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.940> know<00:00:48.059> more<00:00:48.270> perfect

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
even if it isn't you know more perfect

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.569 
even if it isn't you know more perfect

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
this map definitely offers up something

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.170 
this map definitely offers up something
I<00:00:55.410> started<00:00:55.980> playing<00:00:56.190> on<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.550> map<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.059> I

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
I started playing on this map and I

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.000 
I started playing on this map and I
actually<00:00:57.390> played<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.020> rush<00:00:58.320> now<00:00:58.530> my<00:00:58.829> one

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
actually played it on rush now my one

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.130 
actually played it on rush now my one
big<00:00:59.250> gripe<00:00:59.550> with<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.910> map<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.390> there's

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
big gripe with this map is there's

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.229 
big gripe with this map is there's
something<00:01:01.440> about<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.370> attacking<00:01:02.879> side<00:01:03.090> on

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
something about the attacking side on

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.910 
something about the attacking side on
rush<00:01:03.480> it's<00:01:03.690> kind<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.019> flaw<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.290> my<00:01:04.559> opinion

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
rush it's kind of a flaw in my opinion

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.990 
rush it's kind of a flaw in my opinion
that<00:01:05.010> I'll<00:01:05.100> talk<00:01:05.250> about<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.850> minute

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000

fighting<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.290> cave<00:01:16.500> system<00:01:16.740> there's<00:01:17.100> like<00:01:17.189> a

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
fighting in a cave system there's like a

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.399 
fighting in a cave system there's like a
little<00:01:17.460> waterfall<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.689> everything<00:01:19.170> like

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
little waterfall and and everything like

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.670 
little waterfall and and everything like
that<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.680> can<00:01:19.830> hear<00:01:19.950> my<00:01:20.040> echo<00:01:21.229> okay<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.259> did<00:01:22.560> that

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
that I can hear my echo okay I did that

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.140 
that I can hear my echo okay I did that
myself<00:01:22.860> but<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.580> know<00:01:23.700> what<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.850> mean<00:01:23.970> it's

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
myself but you know what I mean it's

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.539 
myself but you know what I mean it's
pretty<00:01:24.360> cool<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.920> idea<00:01:26.280> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
pretty cool I I like the idea the

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.999 
pretty cool I I like the idea the
concept<00:01:26.580> behind<00:01:27.299> having<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.140> because<00:01:28.829> you

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
concept behind having this because you

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.200 
concept behind having this because you
have<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.280> cave<00:01:29.490> system<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:30.030> have<00:01:30.119> the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
have the cave system you have the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.630 
have the cave system you have the
outward<00:01:30.630> jungle<00:01:31.170> area<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:32.040> think<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.430> best

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
outward jungle area and I think the best

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.819 
outward jungle area and I think the best
Maps<00:01:32.909> ever<00:01:33.180> made<00:01:33.450> were<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.750> jungle<00:01:34.409> maps<00:01:34.619> in

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
Maps ever made were the jungle maps in

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.999 
Maps ever made were the jungle maps in
bc2<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.939> now<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.900> have<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.710> this

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
bc2 so now you have like this this

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.370 
bc2 so now you have like this this
merged<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.729> happy<00:01:39.060> area<00:01:39.450> between<00:01:39.810> both<00:01:40.079> and

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
merged this happy area between both and

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.590 
merged this happy area between both and
I<00:01:40.799> think<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.430> probably<00:01:41.640> my<00:01:42.060> favorite<00:01:42.090> map

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
I think this is probably my favorite map

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.270 
I think this is probably my favorite map
in<00:01:42.810> all<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.380> battlefield<00:01:43.860> games<00:01:44.070> I've

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
in all of the battlefield games I've

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.880 
in all of the battlefield games I've
played<00:01:44.310> which<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.820> bc2<00:01:45.299> bf3<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.110> this<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.710> never

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
played which is bc2 bf3 and this I never

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.010 
played which is bc2 bf3 and this I never
played<00:01:47.130> any<00:01:47.159> prior<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.659> can't

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
played any prior to that so I can't

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.359 
played any prior to that so I can't
judge<00:01:49.259> on<00:01:49.470> those<00:01:49.680> but<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.070> map<00:01:50.220> is

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
judge on those but this map is

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.429 
judge on those but this map is
incredible<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.030> like<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.869> way<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.079> set<00:01:52.200> up<00:01:52.229> on

this<00:03:17.640> is<00:03:17.730> definitely<00:03:18.030> my<00:03:18.269> favorite<00:03:18.300> map<00:03:18.750> in

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900

all<00:03:19.080> of<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.320> battlefield<00:03:19.739> games<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.370> I<00:03:20.730> think

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
all of the battlefield games and I think

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.940 
all of the battlefield games and I think
it's<00:03:21.030> because<00:03:21.300> it<00:03:21.420> builds<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.320> aspect<00:03:22.800> of

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
it's because it builds the aspect of

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.979 
it's because it builds the aspect of
you're<00:03:23.160> kind<00:03:23.190> of<00:03:23.489> in<00:03:23.820> a<00:03:24.180> jungle<00:03:24.600> but<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:24.840> also

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.870 
seen
before<00:04:27.530> there's<00:04:28.530> a<00:04:28.590> dead<00:04:28.890> zone<00:04:29.160> for<00:04:29.430> defenders

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
before there's a dead zone for defenders

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.300 
before there's a dead zone for defenders
that<00:04:30.180> attackers<00:04:30.870> can<00:04:31.230> go<00:04:31.440> to<00:04:31.500> now<00:04:31.980> it's

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
that attackers can go to now it's

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.130 
that attackers can go to now it's
usually<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.790> other<00:04:32.910> way<00:04:33.030> around<00:04:33.150> if<00:04:33.690> anything

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
usually the other way around if anything

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.800 
usually the other way around if anything
but<00:04:34.860> when<00:04:35.430> rushing<00:04:35.880> there's<00:04:36.090> one<00:04:36.330> certain<00:04:36.660> set

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
but when rushing there's one certain set

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:37.910 
but when rushing there's one certain set
of<00:04:36.840> actually<00:04:37.170> I<00:04:37.200> think<00:04:37.290> there's<00:04:37.500> two<00:04:37.590> incomes

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
of actually I think there's two incomes

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.980 
of actually I think there's two incomes
that<00:04:38.010> have<00:04:38.160> this<00:04:38.280> issue<00:04:38.430> but<00:04:38.730> one<00:04:38.910> income<00:04:39.300> set

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
that have this issue but one income set

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.810 
that have this issue but one income set
in<00:04:40.200> particular<00:04:40.440> that<00:04:41.040> there's<00:04:41.190> like<00:04:41.340> a<00:04:41.370> giant

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
in particular that there's like a giant

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.910 
in particular that there's like a giant
hill<00:04:42.000> that<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.240> entire<00:04:42.780> team<00:04:43.320> can<00:04:43.620> like<00:04:43.740> put

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
hill that the entire team can like put

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.620 
hill that the entire team can like put
beacons<00:04:44.280> on<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:44.610> go<00:04:44.730> up<00:04:44.910> that's<00:04:45.060> right<00:04:45.330> next

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
beacons on and go up that's right next

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.900 
beacons on and go up that's right next
to<00:04:45.840> objectives<00:04:46.380> that<00:04:46.980> all<00:04:47.220> the<00:04:47.370> attackers<00:04:47.640> can

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
to objectives that all the attackers can

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.910 
to objectives that all the attackers can
get<00:04:48.060> right<00:04:48.210> next<00:04:48.450> to<00:04:48.510> the<00:04:48.600> objectives<00:04:49.050> or<00:04:49.140> able

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
get right next to the objectives or able

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.170 
get right next to the objectives or able
to<00:04:50.010> put<00:04:50.160> a<00:04:50.190> beacon<00:04:50.430> down<00:04:50.610> so<00:04:50.760> they<00:04:50.880> can<00:04:51.030> float

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
to put a beacon down so they can float

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.060 
to put a beacon down so they can float
on<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.480> land<00:04:51.660> right<00:04:51.840> on<00:04:51.870> the<00:04:51.960> objectives<00:04:52.470> but

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
on the land right on the objectives but

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.290 
on the land right on the objectives but
none<00:04:53.220> of<00:04:53.250> the<00:04:53.430> defenders<00:04:53.820> can<00:04:53.970> go<00:04:54.090> there

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
none of the defenders can go there

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.700 
none of the defenders can go there
that's<00:04:54.540> really<00:04:54.960> really<00:04:55.170> kind<00:04:55.290> of<00:04:55.380> messed<00:04:55.590> up

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
that's really really kind of messed up

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.230 
that's really really kind of messed up
that's<00:04:55.920> kind<00:04:56.070> of<00:04:56.190> broken<00:04:56.670> in<00:04:56.790> my<00:04:56.910> opinion

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
that's kind of broken in my opinion

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.130 
that's kind of broken in my opinion
there<00:04:57.360> should<00:04:57.390> be<00:04:57.570> a<00:04:57.600> dead<00:04:57.840> zone<00:04:57.870> where

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
there should be a dead zone where

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.510 
there should be a dead zone where
defenders<00:04:58.530> can't<00:04:58.740> go<00:04:58.860> to<00:04:58.920> protect<00:04:59.370> their

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
defenders can't go to protect their

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.730 
defenders can't go to protect their
incomes<00:04:59.880> so<00:05:00.540> other<00:05:00.720> than<00:05:00.930> that<00:05:01.080> this<00:05:01.260> map<00:05:01.500> is

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
incomes so other than that this map is

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.409 
incomes so other than that this map is
just<00:05:02.100> a<00:05:02.220> 10<00:05:02.430> out<00:05:02.520> of<00:05:02.550> 10<00:05:02.790> it's<00:05:03.000> absolutely
