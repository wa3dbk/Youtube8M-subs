00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.590 
and to apply this I'm using an elf
powder<00:04:24.550> brush<00:04:24.940> and<00:04:25.330> it<00:04:26.320> looks<00:04:26.470> like<00:04:26.620> this<00:04:27.600> you

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
powder brush and it looks like this you

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.950 
powder brush and it looks like this you
can<00:04:28.630> get<00:04:28.810> elf<00:04:29.070> at<00:04:30.070> Target<00:04:30.669> and<00:04:31.449> then<00:04:31.630> kind<00:04:31.840> of

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
can get elf at Target and then kind of

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.930 
can get elf at Target and then kind of
Pat<00:04:32.500> the<00:04:32.650> powder<00:04:32.860> into<00:04:33.160> my<00:04:33.250> face<00:04:33.520> and<00:04:33.760> then<00:04:33.820> I

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
Pat the powder into my face and then I

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.390 
Pat the powder into my face and then I
blend<00:04:34.090> it<00:04:34.270> out<00:04:34.389> like<00:04:34.750> this<00:04:35.190> just<00:04:36.190> to<00:04:38.250> make<00:04:39.250> sure

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
blend it out like this just to make sure

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.590 
blend it out like this just to make sure
that<00:04:39.550> it's<00:04:39.699> actually<00:04:39.850> setting<00:04:40.330> my<00:04:40.419> face

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
that it's actually setting my face

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.510 
that it's actually setting my face
because<00:04:40.780> if<00:04:41.139> you<00:04:41.260> just<00:04:41.440> put<00:04:41.860> your<00:04:41.919> powder<00:04:42.160> in

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
because if you just put your powder in

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.650 
because if you just put your powder in
and<00:04:42.699> then<00:04:42.820> you<00:04:42.940> kind<00:04:43.090> of<00:04:43.180> just<00:04:43.330> dust<00:04:43.479> it<00:04:43.600> on

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
and then you kind of just dust it on

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.820 
and then you kind of just dust it on
your<00:04:43.840> face<00:04:43.990> it<00:04:44.169> kind<00:04:44.320> of<00:04:44.350> defeats<00:04:44.650> the<00:04:44.770> purpose

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
your face it kind of defeats the purpose

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:52.010 
your face it kind of defeats the purpose
of<00:04:45.370> your<00:04:45.490> foundation<00:04:46.000> or<00:04:46.090> your<00:04:46.240> concealer<00:04:46.810> and

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.939 

then<00:04:53.020> I'm<00:04:53.110> going<00:04:53.380> to<00:04:53.410> apply<00:04:53.919> some<00:04:55.320> bronzer<00:04:56.320> and
