here pretty much be making the shape of

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.320 
here pretty much be making the shape of
the<00:00:21.630> shell<00:00:21.900> casing<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.680> bullet<00:00:22.949> itself<00:00:23.330> so

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
the shell casing in the bullet itself so

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.540 
the shell casing in the bullet itself so
let's<00:00:24.510> go<00:00:24.630> ahead<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.779> get<00:00:24.900> started<00:00:25.519> our<00:00:26.519> first

to<00:00:36.149> go<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.329> or<00:00:37.020> spline<00:00:38.030> and<00:00:39.030> grab<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.480> b-spline

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
to go to or spline and grab a b-spline

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.600 
to go to or spline and grab a b-spline
and<00:00:42.329> then<00:00:42.420> we<00:00:42.510> pretty<00:00:42.840> much<00:00:43.160> we<00:00:44.160> use<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.460> red

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
and then we pretty much we use the red

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.220 
and then we pretty much we use the red
line<00:00:44.789> as<00:00:45.000> our<00:00:45.149> center<00:00:45.510> we<00:00:45.690> want<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.960> go<00:00:46.050> down

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
line as our center we want to go down

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.160 
line as our center we want to go down
three<00:00:46.739> from<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.070> red<00:00:47.250> line<00:00:47.989> right<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.050> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
three from the red line right in the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.830

middle and click right there go over

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.639 
middle and click right there go over
three<00:00:52.550> click<00:00:53.550> again<00:00:53.930> then<00:00:54.930> between<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> red

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
and then drag this over it will create a

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.850 
and then drag this over it will create a
little<00:01:01.289> curve<00:01:01.469> line<00:01:01.739> for<00:01:02.039> us<00:01:03.619> and<00:01:04.619> then<00:01:04.739> we'll

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
little curve line for us and then we'll

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.550 
little curve line for us and then we'll
go<00:01:05.070> up<00:01:05.250> probably<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.270> above<00:01:06.799> the<00:01:07.799> red<00:01:08.010> line

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
go up probably to above the red line

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.550 
go up probably to above the red line
click<00:01:10.560> again<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.630> we'll<00:01:12.630> go<00:01:12.840> over<00:01:15.380> just<00:01:16.380> to

what we want to do to do is uh go into

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.410 
what we want to do to do is uh go into
our<00:01:52.470> nerves<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.100> add<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.759> lathe<00:01:54.659> NURBS<00:01:56.420> grab

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
our nerves and add a lathe NURBS grab

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.480 
our nerves and add a lathe NURBS grab
our<00:01:57.570> spline<00:01:57.899> drag<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.500> into<00:01:58.649> drop<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.219> into<00:01:59.340> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
our spline drag it into drop it into the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.280 
our spline drag it into drop it into the
lathe<00:01:59.729> nervous<00:02:00.240> as<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.479> child<00:02:01.700> it<00:02:02.700> gives<00:02:02.880> us<00:02:03.030> a

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
lathe nervous as a child it gives us a

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.859 
lathe nervous as a child it gives us a
pretty<00:02:04.290> much<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> rounded<00:02:05.270> both<00:02:06.270> creates<00:02:06.750> two

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
pretty much a rounded both creates two

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.869 
pretty much a rounded both creates two
second<00:02:07.200> side<00:02:07.350> put<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.740> way<00:02:07.799> when<00:02:08.789> we

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
second side put it that way when we

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.480 
second side put it that way when we
press<00:02:09.149> f1<00:02:09.599> on<00:02:09.720> our<00:02:09.869> keyboard

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
press f1 on our keyboard

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.900 
press f1 on our keyboard
and<00:02:11.940> takes<00:02:12.180> us<00:02:12.330> back<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.600> our<00:02:13.080> main

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
and takes us back to our main

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.200 
and takes us back to our main
perspective<00:02:15.920> now<00:02:16.920> pretty<00:02:17.610> much<00:02:17.700> all<00:02:17.970> we<00:02:18.060> need

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
perspective now pretty much all we need

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.630 
perspective now pretty much all we need
to<00:02:18.240> do<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.570> resize<00:02:19.200> this<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:20.220> let's<00:02:20.580> uh<00:02:20.790> make

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
to do is resize this so let's uh make

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.180 
to do is resize this so let's uh make
sure<00:02:23.640> we<00:02:23.910> got<00:02:24.030> our<00:02:24.210> tool<00:02:24.660> selected<00:02:25.260> go<00:02:26.160> to
