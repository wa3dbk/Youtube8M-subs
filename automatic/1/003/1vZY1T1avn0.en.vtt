because<00:02:21.250> we<00:02:22.090> really<00:02:22.120> do<00:02:22.690> think<00:02:23.080> it<00:02:23.620> was<00:02:23.709> the

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
because we really do think it was the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.370 
because we really do think it was the
whole<00:02:24.010> reason<00:02:24.040> why<00:02:24.690> another<00:02:25.690> reason<00:02:25.780> why<00:02:26.230> we

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
whole reason why another reason why we

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.840 
whole reason why another reason why we
wanted<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.680> bring<00:02:26.740> back<00:02:26.890> gold<00:02:27.280> because<00:02:27.670> we

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
wanted to bring back gold because we

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.940 
wanted to bring back gold because we
knew<00:02:28.030> that<00:02:28.240> it<00:02:28.390> would<00:02:28.510> give<00:02:28.720> our<00:02:29.350> country<00:02:29.830> the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
knew that it would give our country the

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.800 
knew that it would give our country the
best<00:02:30.100> opportunity<00:02:30.820> to<00:02:31.000> get<00:02:31.150> a<00:02:31.180> league<00:02:31.390> started

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
best opportunity to get a league started

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.620 
best opportunity to get a league started
again<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:32.490> it's<00:02:33.490> a<00:02:33.640> bit<00:02:33.790> of<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:33.970> shame<00:02:34.240> that<00:02:34.270> we

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
again and it's a bit of a shame that we

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.500 
again and it's a bit of a shame that we
can't<00:02:34.900> keep<00:02:35.140> one<00:02:35.380> going<00:02:35.770> up<00:02:35.920> until<00:02:36.190> now<00:02:36.550> and<00:02:36.850> so

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
can't keep one going up until now and so

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.080 
can't keep one going up until now and so
it's<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:38.050> great<00:02:38.530> opportunity<00:02:39.340> for<00:02:39.370> us<00:02:39.580> to<00:02:39.970> be

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090
