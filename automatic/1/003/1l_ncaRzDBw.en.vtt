00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.740 
minecraft 2.5 and in Minecraft 2.5
there's<00:00:13.070> a<00:00:13.160> feature<00:00:13.370> where<00:00:13.760> if<00:00:13.820> you<00:00:14.209> have<00:00:14.540> some

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
there's a feature where if you have some

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:15.999 
there's a feature where if you have some
bone<00:00:14.900> meal<00:00:15.110> and<00:00:15.349> you<00:00:15.410> right<00:00:15.620> click<00:00:15.769> on<00:00:15.950> a

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:16.009 
bone meal and you right click on a

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:18.700 
bone meal and you right click on a
zombie<00:00:16.219> it<00:00:17.000> will<00:00:17.150> create<00:00:17.330> a<00:00:17.450> giant<00:00:17.779> so

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
zombie it will create a giant so

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.380 
zombie it will create a giant so
someone's<00:00:19.130> taken<00:00:19.460> this<00:00:19.520> idea<00:00:19.700> and<00:00:20.000> created<00:00:20.330> a

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
someone's taken this idea and created a

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.540 
someone's taken this idea and created a
plug-in<00:00:20.630> called<00:00:20.750> bone<00:00:21.230> meal<00:00:21.470> for<00:00:21.710> mobs<00:00:21.919> and

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
plug-in called bone meal for mobs and

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.130 
plug-in called bone meal for mobs and
basically<00:00:22.880> this<00:00:23.060> is<00:00:23.119> a<00:00:23.240> really<00:00:23.480> good<00:00:23.600> idea<00:00:23.720> and

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
basically this is a really good idea and

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.870 
basically this is a really good idea and
what<00:00:24.260> it<00:00:24.350> does<00:00:24.470> is<00:00:24.529> if<00:00:24.830> you<00:00:24.949> have<00:00:25.070> any<00:00:25.250> baby<00:00:25.550> mob

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
what it does is if you have any baby mob

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.519 
what it does is if you have any baby mob
and<00:00:26.210> you<00:00:26.359> right-click<00:00:26.779> on<00:00:26.900> it<00:00:26.960> with<00:00:27.109> bone<00:00:27.289> meal

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
and you right-click on it with bone meal

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.410 
and you right-click on it with bone meal
it'll<00:00:27.769> make<00:00:27.920> it<00:00:28.070> into<00:00:28.250> an<00:00:28.340> adult<00:00:28.460> mob<00:00:28.820> and<00:00:29.300> you

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
it'll make it into an adult mob and you

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.179 
it'll make it into an adult mob and you
can<00:00:29.539> also<00:00:29.689> create<00:00:29.990> an<00:00:30.260> t<00:00:30.500> bone<00:00:30.710> meal<00:00:30.949> which

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
can also create an t bone meal which

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.210 
can also create an t bone meal which
will<00:00:31.369> turn<00:00:31.580> any<00:00:31.789> mob<00:00:32.090> into<00:00:32.419> its<00:00:32.570> baby<00:00:32.809> state<00:00:33.290> so

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
will turn any mob into its baby state so

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.979 
will turn any mob into its baby state so
this<00:00:34.460> work<00:00:34.760> for<00:00:35.000> previous<00:00:35.420> versions<00:00:35.840> it

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
this work for previous versions it

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:37.509 
this work for previous versions it
doesn't<00:00:36.230> have<00:00:36.320> to<00:00:36.440> be<00:00:36.470> 2.5<00:00:37.129> because<00:00:37.430> that

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:37.519 
doesn't have to be 2.5 because that

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:39.009 
doesn't have to be 2.5 because that
isn't<00:00:37.640> released<00:00:37.970> yet<00:00:38.090> so<00:00:38.449> it<00:00:38.510> works<00:00:38.690> for<00:00:38.870> any

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 
isn't released yet so it works for any

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:40.869 
isn't released yet so it works for any
of<00:00:39.140> the<00:00:39.199> previous<00:00:39.620> versions<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:40.610> I<00:00:40.699> think

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
of the previous versions and I think

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:42.189 
of the previous versions and I think
it's<00:00:40.970> a<00:00:41.030> really<00:00:41.059> great<00:00:41.360> idea<00:00:41.420> so<00:00:41.930> I'll<00:00:42.019> quickly

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
it's a really great idea so I'll quickly

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.310 
it's a really great idea so I'll quickly
run<00:00:42.440> you<00:00:42.589> through<00:00:42.799> the<00:00:42.920> plugin<00:00:43.870> if<00:00:44.870> I<00:00:45.049> spawn<00:00:45.290> a

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
run you through the plugin if I spawn a

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.689 
run you through the plugin if I spawn a
couple<00:00:45.620> of<00:00:45.710> chickens<00:00:45.890> and<00:00:46.280> then<00:00:46.400> make<00:00:46.549> them

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699 
couple of chickens and then make them

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:48.670 
couple of chickens and then make them
breed<00:00:47.089> they'll<00:00:47.629> obviously<00:00:47.780> produce<00:00:48.350> a<00:00:48.559> baby

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
breed they'll obviously produce a baby

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
you bone meal it until it's at the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.810 
you bone meal it until it's at the
smallest<00:01:46.580> state<00:01:47.860> so<00:01:48.860> create<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.340> bit<00:01:49.490> more<00:01:49.640> any

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
smallest state so create a bit more any

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.680 
smallest state so create a bit more any
bone<00:01:50.120> meal<00:01:51.909> and<00:01:52.909> this<00:01:53.030> time<00:01:53.240> was<00:01:53.360> it<00:01:53.540> on<00:01:53.659> a

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
bone meal and this time was it on a

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.980 
bone meal and this time was it on a
zombie<00:01:54.110> so<00:01:54.500> for<00:01:54.770> instance<00:01:54.830> spawn<00:01:55.400> a<00:01:55.430> zombie

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
zombie so for instance spawn a zombie

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.420 
zombie so for instance spawn a zombie
use<00:01:56.990> anti<00:01:57.350> bone<00:01:57.560> meal<00:01:57.800> and<00:01:57.950> you<00:01:57.979> can<00:01:58.159> see<00:01:58.280> it's

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
use anti bone meal and you can see it's

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.690 
use anti bone meal and you can see it's
a<00:01:58.520> tiny<00:01:58.729> one<00:01:59.110> he's<00:02:00.110> normal<00:02:00.500> bone<00:02:00.680> meal<00:02:00.950> and

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
a tiny one he's normal bone meal and

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.990 
a tiny one he's normal bone meal and
then<00:02:01.880> use<00:02:02.030> it<00:02:02.180> twice<00:02:02.330> and<00:02:02.659> it's<00:02:02.780> a<00:02:02.840> giant<00:02:03.490> so<00:02:04.490> i

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
then use it twice and it's a giant so i

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.850 
then use it twice and it's a giant so i
could<00:02:05.450> actually<00:02:05.570> shrink<00:02:06.049> the<00:02:06.170> giant<00:02:06.500> down<00:02:06.650> to

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
could actually shrink the giant down to

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.620 
could actually shrink the giant down to
a<00:02:06.890> normal<00:02:07.040> zombie<00:02:07.460> again

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.580 

so<00:02:12.630> as<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.780> can<00:02:12.870> see<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.170> plug-in<00:02:13.470> works

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
so as you can see the plug-in works

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.320 
so as you can see the plug-in works
really<00:02:13.920> well<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.160> think<00:02:14.370> it's<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.730> great<00:02:14.760> idea<00:02:14.940> I

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
really well I think it's a great idea I

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.640 
really well I think it's a great idea I
think<00:02:15.390> players<00:02:15.959> would<00:02:16.200> have<00:02:16.230> been<00:02:16.380> looking

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
think players would have been looking

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.900 
think players would have been looking
forward<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.069> feature<00:02:17.310> like<00:02:17.520> this<00:02:17.580> for<00:02:17.880> a

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
forward to a feature like this for a

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.550 
forward to a feature like this for a
while<00:02:17.970> being<00:02:18.360> able<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.690> change<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.140> size<00:02:19.380> of

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
while being able to change the size of

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.290 
while being able to change the size of
their<00:02:19.680> mobs<00:02:19.890> make<00:02:20.550> them<00:02:20.700> grow<00:02:20.910> more<00:02:21.150> quickly

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
their mobs make them grow more quickly

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.030 
their mobs make them grow more quickly
so<00:02:21.870> for<00:02:22.020> instance<00:02:22.080> if<00:02:22.440> you've<00:02:22.590> got<00:02:22.740> a<00:02:22.770> load<00:02:22.920> of
