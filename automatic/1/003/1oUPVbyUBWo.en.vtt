which one is the negative in the

which one is the negative in the
positive<00:02:02.740> which<00:02:03.100> is<00:02:03.250> good<00:02:04.740> says<00:02:05.740> they<00:02:05.920> push<00:02:06.250> to

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
positive which is good says they push to

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.520 
positive which is good says they push to
start<00:02:09.450> once<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.600> engines<00:02:10.899> ready<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.200> push

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
start once the engines ready to push

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.020 
start once the engines ready to push
that<00:02:11.740> and<00:02:11.950> it<00:02:12.040> starts<00:02:12.310> charging<00:02:12.490> the<00:02:12.760> battery

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
that and it starts charging the battery

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.500 
that and it starts charging the battery
I<00:02:13.060> supposed<00:02:15.240> it's<00:02:16.240> got<00:02:16.390> a<00:02:17.940> cool<00:02:18.940> camera

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
I supposed it's got a cool camera

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.949 
I supposed it's got a cool camera
already<00:02:21.060> looks<00:02:22.060> like<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.270> knees<00:02:22.540> working

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
already looks like the knees working

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.110 
already looks like the knees working
because<00:02:23.380> I<00:02:23.620> was<00:02:24.720> blaring<00:02:25.720> down<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.260> fuel<00:02:26.739> line

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
because I was blaring down the fuel line

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.220 
because I was blaring down the fuel line
looks<00:02:28.120> like<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.390> needles<00:02:28.690> working<00:02:29.050> cause<00:02:29.170> a

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
looks like the needles working cause a

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.600 
looks like the needles working cause a
bit<00:02:29.380> of<00:02:29.410> fuel<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.709> come<00:02:29.980> out<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:30.220> side<00:02:30.370> on<00:02:30.550> the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
bit of fuel to come out the side on the

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.100 
bit of fuel to come out the side on the
cover<00:02:31.800> which<00:02:32.800> is<00:02:32.920> good

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
cover which is good

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.250 
cover which is good
so<00:02:34.800> it<00:02:34.860> should<00:02:35.010> be<00:02:35.040> ready<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.370> go<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:36.110> bit<00:02:37.110> of

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
so it should be ready to go a bit of

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.930 
so it should be ready to go a bit of
petrol<00:02:37.680> in<00:02:37.770> it<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:39.780> fuel<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.110> have<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.940> Trotter

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
petrol in it the fuel I have the Trotter

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.140 
petrol in it the fuel I have the Trotter
operate<00:02:42.660> by<00:02:42.810> hand<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.620> goes<00:02:43.770> up<00:02:44.040> but<00:02:44.340> this

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
operate by hand it goes up but this

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.870 
operate by hand it goes up but this
little<00:02:45.360> weird<00:02:45.630> fuel<00:02:45.870> setup<00:02:46.110> wait<00:02:46.350> bring<00:02:46.590> that

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
little weird fuel setup wait bring that

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.010 
little weird fuel setup wait bring that
give<00:02:47.880> us<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.090> few<00:02:48.330> this<00:02:48.870> read<00:02:49.680> front<00:02:49.980> all<00:02:50.070> set<00:02:50.280> up

give us a few this read front all set up

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.220 
give us a few this read front all set up
it<00:02:52.020> just<00:02:52.790> moves<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.880> throttle<00:02:54.240> up<00:02:54.750> alright

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
it just moves the throttle up alright

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.960 
it just moves the throttle up alright
but<00:02:55.800> it<00:02:55.890> doesn't<00:02:56.130> really<00:02:56.190> back<00:02:56.400> down<00:02:56.640> so<00:02:56.940> I

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
but it doesn't really back down so I

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.150 
but it doesn't really back down so I
just<00:02:57.270> did<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.540> all<00:02:57.750> by<00:02:57.870> hand<00:02:57.900> for<00:02:58.260> now<00:02:58.380> until<00:02:59.070> I

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
just did it all by hand for now until I

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.140 
just did it all by hand for now until I
could<00:02:59.310> sit<00:02:59.490> outside<00:02:59.700> for<00:02:59.910> that<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:03.030> edge<00:03:03.120> of

could sit outside for that the edge of

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.550 
could sit outside for that the edge of
itself<00:03:03.540> doesn't<00:03:03.810> look<00:03:03.959> like<00:03:04.080> it's<00:03:04.230> really<00:03:04.380> be

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560

petrol<00:03:21.000> in<00:03:21.090> it<00:03:21.120> I've<00:03:21.900> got<00:03:22.020> to<00:03:22.080> sort<00:03:22.230> out<00:03:22.380> their

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
petrol in it I've got to sort out their

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.270 
petrol in it I've got to sort out their
spark<00:03:24.420> plug<00:03:24.630> lead<00:03:25.310> it's<00:03:27.739> split<00:03:28.739> there<00:03:28.950> so<00:03:29.250> I

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
spark plug lead it's split there so I

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.260 
spark plug lead it's split there so I
take<00:03:29.730> that<00:03:29.880> up<00:03:30.030> and<00:03:30.830> maybe<00:03:31.830> nip<00:03:32.820> a<00:03:32.850> bit<00:03:33.060> more

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
take that up and maybe nip a bit more

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.590 
take that up and maybe nip a bit more
off<00:03:33.450> there<00:03:33.720> so<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.500> could<00:03:34.620> just<00:03:35.480> tighten<00:03:36.480> it

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
off there so I could just tighten it

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.830 
off there so I could just tighten it
underneath<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:38.030> spark<00:03:39.030> plug<00:03:39.180> cap

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
underneath the spark plug cap

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.479 
underneath the spark plug cap
it's<00:03:41.650> a<00:03:41.709> kill<00:03:41.890> switch<00:03:42.209> put<00:03:43.209> a<00:03:43.269> bit<00:03:43.390> of<00:03:43.480> rubber

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
it's a kill switch put a bit of rubber

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.680 
it's a kill switch put a bit of rubber
make<00:03:45.489> a<00:03:45.610> line<00:03:45.760> aged<00:03:45.970> only<00:03:46.150> ended<00:03:46.450> up<00:03:46.569> in

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
make a line aged only ended up in

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.140 
make a line aged only ended up in
earshot<00:03:49.290> it's<00:03:50.290> just<00:03:50.530> mounted<00:03:50.950> on<00:03:51.069> a<00:03:51.099> bit<00:03:52.030> of

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
earshot it's just mounted on a bit of

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.170 
earshot it's just mounted on a bit of
wood<00:03:52.620> nothing<00:03:53.620> special<00:03:55.800> the<00:03:56.910> generator<00:03:57.910> part

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
wood nothing special the generator part

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.059 
wood nothing special the generator part
of<00:03:58.269> it<00:03:58.390> weighs<00:03:59.319> much<00:03:59.769> more<00:04:00.250> than<00:04:00.549> injured<00:04:02.069> so

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
of it weighs much more than injured so

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.729 
of it weighs much more than injured so
it's<00:04:03.250> sort<00:04:03.400> of<00:04:03.580> balanced<00:04:04.440> but<00:04:05.440> it<00:04:05.560> is<00:04:05.650> heavy<00:04:07.739> so

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
it's sort of balanced but it is heavy so

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.460 
it's sort of balanced but it is heavy so
let's<00:04:09.519> start<00:04:09.700> it<00:04:09.819> up<00:04:09.879> and<00:04:10.290> see<00:04:11.290> if<00:04:11.349> it<00:04:11.440> actually

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
let's start it up and see if it actually

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.949 
let's start it up and see if it actually
charges<00:04:12.280> batteries<00:04:12.880> which<00:04:13.540> would<00:04:13.660> be<00:04:13.720> quite

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
charges batteries which would be quite

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.289 
charges batteries which would be quite
cool<00:04:14.370> dad<00:04:15.370> said<00:04:15.579> you<00:04:15.670> finally<00:04:15.940> got<00:04:16.030> an<00:04:16.150> engine

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
cool dad said you finally got an engine

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.599 
cool dad said you finally got an engine
machi<00:04:16.930> you<00:04:17.290> saw<00:04:17.590> something<00:04:17.799> other<00:04:18.430> than

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
machi you saw something other than

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.110 
machi you saw something other than
cutting<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:19.030> grass<00:04:20.040> hopefully<00:04:21.040> I<00:04:21.070> have<00:04:21.340> all

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
cutting the grass hopefully I have all

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.290 
cutting the grass hopefully I have all
right

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300

ready

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:40.190 

rifle<00:05:17.930> from

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:50.350
