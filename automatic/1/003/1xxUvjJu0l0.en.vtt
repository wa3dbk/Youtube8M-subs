00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.230
 and me 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.889
 now let's start what is the 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.320
 body and we're going to work it out of it 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.990
 way we did the face with a 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.990
 slip ring then 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:28.870
 we take our thread in this way the 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.950
 we entangle here on our finger 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.950
 and let's move on 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.760
 let's spend our hook for the 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.760
 center to remove the strand 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.420
 we raise a chain 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.040
 that will be our first half point and 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.720
 again we are going to work we are going to 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.720
 work seven more half points 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.430
 have a total of 8 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.379
 half points and in this row number 1 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.670
 since we have the eight half points 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.310
 we pulled the thread a little 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.850
 we took the first one where we did the 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.250
 chain there we passed a slipped point 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:20.480
 and now if we pull the thread well for 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:23.870
 close this circle completely 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.810
 we raise three chain points 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.940
 to form the first high point and in 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.280
 that same point we will work another 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.070
 high point then let's repeat 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.540
 let's work here two high points 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.740
 for each half point of the row 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.240
 previous 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.860
 until you have a total of 16 high points 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.700
 let's finish with a slipped point 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.610
 in the 3rd string 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.539
 of these that we raise to initiate 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.539
 this row number 2 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.890
 and we are going to raise now three points 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.800
 chain 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.530
 to start row number 3 here 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.920
 we will also be making increases 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.720
 let's go working on each high point 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.270
 from the previous row 2 high points 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.770
 then we continue at each high point 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.830
 two high points 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:22.220
 until we finish the row that we're going to 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:25.460
 get a total of 32 high points 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.130
 we are going to close here also with a point 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.750
 slipped 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.750
 on the chain number 3 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.450
 and now what we are going to do 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.650
 a chain 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.440
 and we will work in each point of the 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:45.930
 previous row 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.870
 a half point here already with the chain that 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.760
 we already have 2 and we're going to 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.750
 continue making half points up 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.580
 have a total of 26 media points 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.360
 after having done the 26 means 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.160
 points let's take point number 27 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.360
 but we're just going to take the gauze 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.900
 the opposite 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.860
 and let's take what is the face and 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:15.980
 let's count 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:18.140
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and in point number 9 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.050
 the same thing we are going to take only the 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.910
 house from the front 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.040
 and let's make a slipped point 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.740
 taking these 2 gazas we make a point 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.390
 slipped and we 're going to do it in the 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.790
 following 5 points equal 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.810
 taking only the part's gauzes 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.569
 in front of both pieces I already made the 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.540
 points slid by 5 more points in 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:47.200
 total are six slipped points and now 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.820
 let's take the chain the first one 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.050
 we raise to start the row of 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:55.360
 half points and let's move 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.770
 with a slipped point to close the 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.370
 row 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:03.190
 we make a reinforced chain and we're going to 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.380
 cut our strand to hide it and from 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.390
 this way we have finished the 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.880
 rabbit what we are going to do now is 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.210
 decorating it here is very important that 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.090
 you use the pompoms or if 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:19.209
 they can embroider the eyes and the nose would be 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.139
 much better me in this case I will use 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.439
 the buttons 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:27.050
 because nothing else because this blanket nothing 

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:29.330
 I'm going to use it more decoratively 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.979
 then if you are going to use it for 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.720
 wrap the baby and I recommend that you 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:37.620
 use the pompoms 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.540
 or that they approach the eyes and the mouth but 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.289
 if they are also going to use buttons if they 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.330
 I recommend that you make them very reinforced 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.740
 now to decorate we are going to need the 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.810
 needle 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.500
 and the thread 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.389
 We're going to need 18-bar lengths 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.970
 centimeters 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:59.240
 we will need for each rabbit 2 already 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.509
 be the 2 pompoms 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.030
 black and red or the buttons in this 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:07.700
 case the nose we're going to put it here in 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:11.070
 the center in the circle 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:14.330
 and I'm going to put it 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.330
 I'm going to start with 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.880
 happen 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.120
 and only what I'm going to do is like 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.830
 I tell them to sew here in the center but 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.070
 well reinforced 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:31.600
 now for the eyes we are going from here 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:35.230
 from the center we will take as reference 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.720
 this space here to the center and we're going to 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.910
 count a massif and in the next let's 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.190
 to put a little eye the same as here of the 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.950
 center we have a massif and in the 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.470
 next let's put the other ojito is 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:51.340
 say let's leave 2 massifs in the 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:56.270
 center and in each of the others that 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:58.670
 they are next we are going to put the eyes 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.560
 and the same thing I'm going to sew them so that 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.950
 be well reinforced 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:07.220
 the buttons in this way is how it looks 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:10.419
 and the eyes and the nose now what you 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.419
 I'm going to put is the ribbon 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.110
 I'm going to cross it here in the bottom 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.500
 and I'm going to link it here to the center 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:28.680
 I'm going to do a sewing here 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:32.300
 and since it is formed I am going to put it 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.300
 here where we made the union 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.300
 I will sew it there 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.639
 to the tissue 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.440
 I will also sew it well reinforced 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.390
 finally this is how we have left 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.680
 finished rabbit 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:02.290
 that you can use to apply in 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:05.670
 as a detail in any good garment 

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.670
 up here with the rabbit tutorial 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.160
 this one that we are going to use to perform 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.940
 the blanket but you can use it 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:15.430
 to apply it on any garment 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.710
 I hope you like it useful and 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:20.490
 especially that they do it, I wait for them in 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.490
 the next video
