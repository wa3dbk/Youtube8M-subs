seems to have you know they used to be

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.480 
seems to have you know they used to be
the<00:00:06.150> king<00:00:06.480> of<00:00:06.629> sensors<00:00:07.109> and<00:00:07.350> they've<00:00:08.099> kind<00:00:08.370> of

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
the king of sensors and they've kind of

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.629 
the king of sensors and they've kind of
not<00:00:08.970> been<00:00:09.240> keeping<00:00:09.719> up<00:00:09.840> lately<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.320> mean<00:00:10.639> they

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
not been keeping up lately I mean they

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.410 
not been keeping up lately I mean they
don't<00:00:11.730> have<00:00:11.940> anything<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.630> rival<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.500> D<00:00:14.420> 836

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420

don't have anything to rival the D 836
megapixel<00:00:16.320> sensor<00:00:16.920> they<00:00:17.699> don't<00:00:17.940> have

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
megapixel sensor they don't have

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:26.109 
megapixel sensor they don't have
anything<00:00:20.150> that<00:00:21.150> beats<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:22.910> d70<00:00:23.910> 100d<00:00:24.840> 5300<00:00:25.769> d

3324<00:00:27.119> megapixel<00:00:27.720> sensor<00:00:28.699> why<00:00:29.699> that's<00:00:30.090> that's

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
3324 megapixel sensor why that's that's

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.959 
3324 megapixel sensor why that's that's
a<00:00:30.510> good<00:00:30.689> question<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.289> know<00:00:31.430> they<00:00:32.430> used<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.820> be

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
a good question you know they used to be

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.639 
a good question you know they used to be
you<00:00:33.420> know<00:00:33.510> king<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.960> hill<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> few<00:00:34.469> years

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
you know king of the hill a few years

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.200 
you know king of the hill a few years
back<00:00:34.950> ever<00:00:35.460> since<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.820> advent<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.660> d3<00:00:37.260> the

d700 d7000 that series of cameras from
Nikon<00:00:42.110> Canon<00:00:43.110> just<00:00:43.410> hasn't<00:00:43.649> been<00:00:43.680> able<00:00:43.800> to

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
Nikon Canon just hasn't been able to

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.130 
Nikon Canon just hasn't been able to
keep<00:00:44.160> up<00:00:44.370> with<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.730> sensors<00:00:45.180> I'm<00:00:45.930> not<00:00:46.079> sure

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
keep up with the sensors I'm not sure

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.810 
keep up with the sensors I'm not sure
why<00:00:46.500> hopefully<00:00:47.039> they<00:00:47.129> have<00:00:47.160> something<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
why hopefully they have something in the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.209 
why hopefully they have something in the
works<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:48.390> mean<00:00:49.170> basically<00:00:49.379> now<00:00:49.829> they've<00:00:50.039> got

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
works I mean basically now they've got

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.520 
works I mean basically now they've got
what<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.399> think<00:00:50.610> it's<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.809> 20<00:00:52.079> or<00:00:52.199> 22

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
what I think it's is it 20 or 22

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.290 
what I think it's is it 20 or 22
megapixels<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.370> their<00:00:53.550> highest<00:00:53.730> sensor<00:00:54.270> I

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
megapixels is their highest sensor I

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.420 
megapixels is their highest sensor I
mean<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.570> DI<00:00:54.750> Hunter<00:00:55.110> has<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> 36<00:00:55.860> megapixel

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
mean the DI Hunter has a 36 megapixel

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.119 
mean the DI Hunter has a 36 megapixel
sensor<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.300> performs<00:00:57.750> amazing<00:00:58.289> where<00:00:58.859> is

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
sensor and it performs amazing where is

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.410 
sensor and it performs amazing where is

something<00:01:24.420> from<00:01:24.840> them<00:01:25.020> not<00:01:25.229> only<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:26.009> know<00:01:26.100> at

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
something from them not only you know at

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.789 
something from them not only you know at
least<00:01:26.280> equaling<00:01:27.030> 24<00:01:27.420> megapixels<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.650> you

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
least equaling 24 megapixels and and you

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.069 
least equaling 24 megapixels and and you
know<00:01:28.829> good<00:01:29.220> performing<00:01:29.729> sensor<00:01:30.119> I'd<00:01:30.570> also<00:01:30.840> I

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
know good performing sensor I'd also I

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.170 
know good performing sensor I'd also I
think<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.650> lot<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:31.979> people<00:01:32.130> would<00:01:32.549> would<00:01:33.000> like
