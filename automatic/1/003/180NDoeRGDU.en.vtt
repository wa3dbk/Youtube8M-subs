00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
in there and there's a red mark so you

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.490 
in there and there's a red mark so you
know<00:00:53.480> where<00:00:53.629> to<00:00:53.660> put<00:00:53.870> it<00:00:53.929> back<00:00:54.219> the<00:00:55.219> little

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
know where to put it back the little

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.200 
know where to put it back the little
little<00:00:57.500> thumbtack<00:00:57.980> has<00:00:58.339> a<00:00:58.370> little<00:00:58.789> plunger<00:00:59.179> on

little thumbtack has a little plunger on

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.819 
little thumbtack has a little plunger on
so<00:00:59.449> if<00:00:59.539> you're<00:00:59.629> using<00:00:59.870> thicker<00:01:00.260> fabrics

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
so if you're using thicker fabrics

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.579 
so if you're using thicker fabrics
something<00:01:01.309> maybe<00:01:01.460> with<00:01:01.640> quilt<00:01:01.940> batting<00:01:02.120> in<00:01:02.420> it

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
something maybe with quilt batting in it

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.950 
something maybe with quilt batting in it
it<00:01:03.589> will<00:01:03.769> accommodate<00:01:04.309> that<00:01:04.699> and<00:01:04.910> it<00:01:05.300> has<00:01:05.540> a

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
it will accommodate that and it has a

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.440 
it will accommodate that and it has a
notch<00:01:06.470> in<00:01:06.800> it<00:01:06.950> so<00:01:07.130> it<00:01:07.250> locks<00:01:07.520> into<00:01:07.820> place<00:01:07.940> so

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
notch in it so it locks into place so

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.050 
notch in it so it locks into place so

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:06.580 
your designs closer together or more
spread<00:02:04.909> apart<00:02:05.210> so<00:02:05.750> if<00:02:05.840> you<00:02:05.930> want<00:02:06.140> them<00:02:06.320> very

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
spread apart so if you want them very

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.370 
spread apart so if you want them very
close<00:02:06.890> together<00:02:07.180> like<00:02:08.180> in<00:02:08.420> this<00:02:08.600> piece<00:02:08.960> here

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
close together like in this piece here

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.809 
close together like in this piece here
you<00:02:10.160> can<00:02:10.399> have<00:02:10.840> your<00:02:11.840> satin<00:02:12.350> stitches<00:02:12.860> one<00:02:13.610> on

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
you can have your satin stitches one on

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.640 
you can have your satin stitches one on
top<00:02:14.090> of<00:02:14.239> each<00:02:14.360> other<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.780> in<00:02:15.319> this<00:02:15.410> instance

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
top of each other and in this instance

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.680 
top of each other and in this instance
we<00:02:15.950> have<00:02:16.220> a<00:02:16.250> triple<00:02:16.700> straight<00:02:16.910> stitch<00:02:16.970> right

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
we have a triple straight stitch right

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.080 
we have a triple straight stitch right
in<00:02:17.900> between<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.560> two

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
in between the two

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.780 
in between the two
so<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.930> looks<00:02:20.200> like<00:02:20.290> one<00:02:20.739> unit<00:02:21.160> as<00:02:21.280> opposed<00:02:21.700> to

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
so it looks like one unit as opposed to

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.940 
so it looks like one unit as opposed to
three<00:02:22.150> different<00:02:22.330> stitches<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:26.170> as<00:02:26.380> this<00:02:26.620> sews

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
three different stitches so as this sews

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.280 
three different stitches so as this sews
you<00:02:27.430> so<00:02:27.670> all<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.090> way<00:02:28.180> around<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.630> circle<00:02:28.900> as

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
you so all the way around the circle as

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.220 
you so all the way around the circle as
you<00:02:29.500> like<00:02:29.980> when<00:02:30.640> you're<00:02:30.849> done<00:02:31.060> all<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:32.080> have
