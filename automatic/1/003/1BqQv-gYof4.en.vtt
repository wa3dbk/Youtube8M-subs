00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
fan it's it's been a new development

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.749 
fan it's it's been a new development
from<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.490> really<00:00:29.760> engineering<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.660> Italy

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
from and really engineering in Italy

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.600 
from and really engineering in Italy
that<00:00:32.759> designers<00:00:33.329> fan<00:00:34.340> especially<00:00:35.340> for

that designers fan especially for
spraying<00:00:36.090> trees<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:36.750> it's<00:00:36.930> it's<00:00:37.620> got<00:00:37.829> a

tremendous output the air sucked in the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.680 
tremendous output the air sucked in the
front<00:00:40.950> here<00:00:41.190> which<00:00:41.370> prevents<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.360> lot<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
front here which prevents a lot of the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.090 
front here which prevents a lot of the
leaf<00:00:42.899> choke<00:00:43.260> problem<00:00:43.649> when<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.890> get<00:00:44.010> here

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
leaf choke problem when you get here

leaf choke problem when you get here
sucked<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.489> from<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.730> back<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.059> tend<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.270> get

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
sucked in from the back you tend to get

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.150 
sucked in from the back you tend to get
a<00:00:45.450> leaf<00:00:45.570> choke<00:00:45.870> problem<00:00:46.230> it's<00:00:46.770> coming<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.129> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
a leaf choke problem it's coming in the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.920 
a leaf choke problem it's coming in the
front<00:00:47.340> that's<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.910> through<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.210> 12<00:00:48.480> bladed

fan<00:00:49.489> axial<00:00:50.489> fan<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.059> then<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:51.899> computerized

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
fan axial fan and then have computerized

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.160 
fan axial fan and then have computerized
the<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:54.000> baffles<00:00:54.360> at<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.539> back<00:00:54.719> here<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.989> give

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
the the baffles at the back here to give

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.910 
the the baffles at the back here to give
maximum<00:00:55.829> airflow<00:00:56.449> in<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.570> 180<00:00:58.050> degree<00:00:58.410> quadrant

maximum airflow in a 180 degree quadrant

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.479 
maximum airflow in a 180 degree quadrant
so<00:00:59.100> we're<00:00:59.250> getting<00:00:59.520> here<00:01:00.620> out<00:01:01.620> at<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.340> bottom

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
so we're getting here out at the bottom

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.920 
so we're getting here out at the bottom
as<00:01:02.760> well<00:01:02.879> as<00:01:03.030> right<00:01:03.239> around<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.690> top

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
as well as right around to the top

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.620 
as well as right around to the top
unlike<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.530> lot<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:05.090> sprayers<00:01:06.090> out<00:01:06.270> there<00:01:06.450> now

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
unlike a lot of sprayers out there now

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.420 
unlike a lot of sprayers out there now
which<00:01:06.900> are<00:01:07.049> mainly<00:01:07.530> designed<00:01:07.770> for<00:01:08.220> doing

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
which are mainly designed for doing

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.469 
which are mainly designed for doing
kiwifruit<00:01:09.030> canopy<00:01:09.810> which<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.920> top

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
kiwifruit canopy which is just the top

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.960 
kiwifruit canopy which is just the top
section<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.990> fans<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.619> effective<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.640> of

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
section of the fans is effective and of

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.580 
section of the fans is effective and of
course<00:01:15.180> people<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.689> put<00:01:15.840> volutes<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.380> try

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
course people have put volutes to try

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.920 
course people have put volutes to try
and<00:01:16.710> direct<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.040> air<00:01:17.220> over<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.670> one<00:01:17.790> side<00:01:17.930> but

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
and direct the air over to one side but

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.690 
and direct the air over to one side but
this<00:01:19.110> one<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.500> designed<00:01:20.009> specifically<00:01:20.610> for

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
this one is designed specifically for

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.210 
this one is designed specifically for
spraying<00:01:21.299> trees<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.409> very<00:01:22.710> effective

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
spraying trees and it's very effective

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.370 
spraying trees and it's very effective
now<00:01:23.460> we've<00:01:23.939> tuned<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.479> fan<00:01:24.840> out<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.259> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
now we've tuned the fan out to the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.740 
now we've tuned the fan out to the
maximum<00:01:25.740> 45<00:01:26.549> degree<00:01:26.850> pitch<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.540> that's

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
maximum 45 degree pitch so that's

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.780 
maximum 45 degree pitch so that's
improving<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.710> performance<00:01:28.950> quite

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
improving the performance quite

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.940 
improving the performance quite
significantly<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.479> fact<00:01:30.810> we<00:01:31.110> had<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.380> upscale

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
significantly in fact we had to upscale

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.890 
significantly in fact we had to upscale
projector<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.759> 100<00:01:33.060> horsepower<00:01:33.329> tractor<00:01:33.780> to

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
projector to 100 horsepower tractor to

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.749 
projector to 100 horsepower tractor to
run<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.200> fan<00:01:34.500> which<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.250> goes<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.460> show<00:01:35.700> you

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
run this fan which just goes to show you

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.760 
run this fan which just goes to show you
how<00:01:35.970> much<00:01:36.119> air<00:01:36.479> it's<00:01:36.630> sucking<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.350> blowing

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
how much air it's sucking in and blowing

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.140 
how much air it's sucking in and blowing
out<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.100> we<00:01:38.189> get<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.340> tremendous<00:01:38.520> amount<00:01:39.060> of

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
out so we get a tremendous amount of

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.359 
out so we get a tremendous amount of
airflow<00:01:39.659> which<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.740> course<00:01:40.890> helping<00:01:41.280> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
airflow which is of course helping the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.310 
airflow which is of course helping the
spray<00:01:41.579> penetrate<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> trees<00:01:42.420> we<00:01:42.840> walk<00:01:43.020> around

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
spray penetrate the trees we walk around

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.499 
spray penetrate the trees we walk around
the<00:01:43.409> front<00:01:43.560> here<00:01:43.729> we've<00:01:44.729> got<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.090> pump
