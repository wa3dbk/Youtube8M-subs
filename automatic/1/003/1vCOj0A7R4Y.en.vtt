00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.990
 hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:17.350
 climb the other day the incredible happened 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:21.310
 the event returned to us the great Russian 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:25.600
 machine called an-94 Abakan 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:28.060
 and as you understand today, the guide on an-94 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.860
 this wonderful machine for the first time 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.039
 appeared in bad company 1 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.780
 in those days he possessed only 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:36.820
 automatic firing bad 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.940
 company 2 abakan had only mode 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.370
 cut-off rate of firing 1200 shots at 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.249
 a minute you called him noob to us 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.409
 because of the hellish news in battlefield 3 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:49.809
 Abakan became more close to 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:51.879
 reality and had a double pace 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.030
 shooting 600 shots per minute for 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.729
 Auto mode 1200 for mode 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.190
 cutoffs but more about history 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:01.749
 Abakanu series of battlefield games you can 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.629
 find out from this video 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:07.299
 Abakan entered the composition of the free dlc 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.270
 which came out in the spring poncho 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.170
 and this is the first dlc pack that came out 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.509
 is free 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.409
 not one dlc for battlefield 3 yet 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.740
 is free 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:20.799
 thank you very much and give a whole for what 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.460
 they broke this tradition of paid 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.890
 dlc 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.590
 another great thing is accessibility 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.619
 Abakan he opened it immediately I need 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.530
 perform any task 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.159
 Abakan characteristics damage maximum 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.530
 24.5 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.329
 up to 12 and a half meters damage 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.549
 minimum 18 pace shooting 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.640
 600 shots classic for abakan 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.920
 for automatic fire and 1200 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.329
 for cutoff mode recharge full 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.609
 take three and a half seconds in many ways 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.890
 An-94 remained unchanged as was the 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:56.079
 precision machine and has remained as 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.270
 old tempo values ​​are preserved 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.369
 shooting though many have assumed that 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.039
 This time, when shooting with a cut-off in 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.929
 battlefield 4 he will issue 1800 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.810
 shots per minute like in real life 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:10.750
 but let the strength not go on so dangerous 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.300
 step into battlefield 4 abakan 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.300
 summer shooting 600 for automatic 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.280
 fire regime and 1200 for cut-off but 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.600
 there was one thing that was not 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.440
 battlefield 3 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.020
 this is the delay between 0.12 cutoffs 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.000
 seconds made it to fight 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.760
 macros that were created for 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.250
 Abakan still in times 2 bad company and 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.920
 Battlefield 3 and it turns out that the pace 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.709
 firing at 1200 rounds min shots 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.230
 it's almost impossible to achieve now 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.239
 in addition to a high rate of fire to the pros 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.520
 can be attributed high accuracy which 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.489
 directly dependent on low scatter 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.420
 Abakan and practical absence 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.910
 vertical and horizontal recoil 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.870
 Of course the vertical cottage is not like that 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.840
 low qusar 21 or ak-12 but when clamping 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.209
 and and there is no horizontal cottage lowest 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.430
 in class assault rifle entry 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.010
 trunk side to side completely 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.620
 missing to high tempo accuracy 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.930
 shooting at plus and we will assign very 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.239
 high speed of a bullet that 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.959
 makes the delivery of two rounds of ammunition 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.910
 enemy head instant 620 meters 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.840
 second allows you to give up shooting 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.670
 ahead of the curve 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.640
 minus abakan can be called very 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.100
 high initial return is higher by two 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.410
 half times than the subsequent shot 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.769
 from this machine that is comparable to 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.200
 initial recoil f2000 walnut and famas 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.720
 but you can get used to it but at first 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.239
 it may cause some discomfort and 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.180
 dissonance 2 minus abacan lies in 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:46.420
 global change battlefield 4 due 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.489
 damage reduction to 24 seconds 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.470
 half unit abakan stopped 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.840
 kill with one finger at a distance of up to 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.910
 12 meters and it's sad because it 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.930
 was the most important feature of the Abakan 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.000
 battlefield 3 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.170
 modules to combat initial recoil 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.690
 should install 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.930
 angular handle which is smaller and it is on 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.519
 33 percent if you tolerate initial 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.470
 recoil then you can install the box 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.600
 handle to reduce the maximum 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.280
 the scatter of the second mandatory module is 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.620
 thickened barrel which is slightly 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.930
 will increase the vertical return but at the same time 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.230
 reduce scatter when shooting 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.880
 sighting 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:24.360
 by 50 percent yet an-94 even in 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.770
 battlefield 4 proved to be very effective 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.020
 the trunk for both long and for 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.700
 I can personally tell a short distance 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.310
 that return abakan turned 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.860
 successful and we have a truly 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.080
 unique nice russian trunk yes 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.440
 maybe he is no better than in the battlefield 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.110
 3 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:44.520
 but he is cool think of it all 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.520
 see you on the groin battlefield
