to do this you guys know sort of like

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.410 
to do this you guys know sort of like
slightly<00:00:38.040> convoluted<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.820> know<00:00:38.879> four<00:00:39.059> orders

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
slightly convoluted you know four orders

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.000 
slightly convoluted you know four orders
through<00:00:39.629> California's<00:00:40.260> make<00:00:40.829> no<00:00:40.920> sense<00:00:41.300> and

through California's make no sense and

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.860 
through California's make no sense and

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
and we're just looking fundamentally for

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.270 
and we're just looking fundamentally for
people<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.260> Texas<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.649> have<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.860> rights<00:00:47.039> just

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
people in Texas to have the rights just

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.150 
people in Texas to have the rights just
to<00:00:47.550> decide<00:00:47.820> how<00:00:48.030> they<00:00:48.180> want<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.420> buy<00:00:48.480> their<00:00:48.660> car

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
to decide how they want to buy their car

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.240 
to decide how they want to buy their car
that's<00:00:50.160> that's<00:00:50.550> really<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:52.250> legislative

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
that's that's really the legislative

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:01.220 
that's that's really the legislative
change<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:55.940> got<00:00:56.940> maybe<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.239> bridge<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.629> fall<00:01:00.230> step

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
change I got maybe a bridge to fall step

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.460 
change I got maybe a bridge to fall step
one<00:01:01.440> if<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:01.829> sell<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> cars<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.969> know

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
the law was there if it was originally

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.430 
the law was there if it was originally
put<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.440> place<00:01:37.590> for<00:01:37.620> a<00:01:37.830> just<00:01:37.860> cause<00:01:38.220> which<00:01:39.030> is

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
back to the company to the parents had

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.520 
back to the company to the parents had
kind<00:01:55.260> of<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.560> Teta<00:01:56.220> really<00:01:57.180> thought<00:01:57.479> FiOS<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.960> no

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
kind of a Teta really thought FiOS it no

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.670 
kind of a Teta really thought FiOS it no
low<00:01:58.680> price<00:01:59.000> and<00:02:01.310> so<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:03.080> motor<00:02:04.080> dealers<00:02:04.290> went

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
low price and so the motor dealers went

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.140 
low price and so the motor dealers went
to<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.010> state<00:02:05.160> legislature<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.940> seek

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.280 
to the state legislature to seek
protection<00:02:07.550> various<00:02:08.550> actions<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.929> they<00:02:10.110> can

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
protection various actions and they can

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.140 
protection various actions and they can
got<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.679> protection<00:02:11.010> but<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.820> law<00:02:12.120> was

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
got that protection but the law was

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.600 
got that protection but the law was
overly<00:02:12.600> fraud<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.290> prevented<00:02:13.860> even<00:02:14.010> new<00:02:14.400> car

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
overly fraud and prevented even new car

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.740 
overly fraud and prevented even new car
companies<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.000> have<00:02:15.120> never<00:02:15.239> granted<00:02:15.690> a

companies that have never granted a

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.030

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.780 
franchise so we're just starting direct
from<00:02:17.580> from<00:02:17.850> be<00:02:18.000> able<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.720> sell<00:02:18.900> cars<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:20.640> now

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
from from be able to to sell cars so now

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.190 
from from be able to to sell cars so now
the<00:02:21.270> motor<00:02:21.480> dealers<00:02:21.690> are<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:21.989> quite

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
the motor dealers are is quite

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.840 
the motor dealers are is quite
reasonable<00:02:22.380> that<00:02:22.920> was<00:02:23.070> put<00:02:23.250> in<00:02:23.370> place<00:02:23.459> for<00:02:23.580> a

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
reasonable that was put in place for a

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.850 
reasonable that was put in place for a
just<00:02:23.880> cause<00:02:24.209> they're<00:02:25.140> using<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.470> for<00:02:25.680> and

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
just cause they're using it for and

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.570 
just cause they're using it for and
unjust<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.500> think<00:02:28.590> support<00:02:29.040> which<00:02:29.340> there's

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
unjust so I think support which there's

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.370 
unjust so I think support which there's
to<00:02:29.730> understand<00:02:30.090> right<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:31.230> original

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
to understand right the original

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.850 
to understand right the original
rationale<00:02:31.920> for<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.340> law

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
rationale for the law

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.350 
rationale for the law
and<00:02:32.950> why<00:02:33.160> it<00:02:34.060> made<00:02:34.240> sense<00:02:34.480> you<00:02:35.080> know<00:02:35.800> it<00:02:36.240> was<00:02:37.240> it

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
and why it made sense you know it was it

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.240 
and why it made sense you know it was it
was<00:02:37.390> adjusting<00:02:38.020> then<00:02:38.230> but<00:02:38.440> it's<00:02:38.590> in<00:02:38.830> fact<00:02:39.010> not

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
was adjusting then but it's in fact not

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.330 
was adjusting then but it's in fact not
just<00:02:39.280> thing<00:02:39.670> now<00:02:39.820> a<00:02:40.620> company<00:02:41.620> is<00:02:41.890> that<00:02:42.070> better

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
just thing now a company is that better

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.640 
just thing now a company is that better

battering the next generation yeah I

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.840
