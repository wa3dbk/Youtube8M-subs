00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hey people hello today i have the nancy 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.960
 from the channel mummy series with me and us 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.880
 are just in such a pretty cool 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.150
 hotel will also be at the katies event 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.190
 yesterday and but we were even at 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.540
 dm and that's why we show you now 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.270
 So a few things we bought 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.500
 have everything so autumnal and we 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.630
 imagine a few of them too 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.699
 our new darling sky trees 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.769
 especially for fun 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.230
 So I'll just go and that 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.420
 I bought a product one 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.160
 foundation namely the lumi massive of 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.350
 l'oreal I have a lot of good things about that 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.550
 heard and I have him so dry skin 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.200
 and I hope you can too 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.579
 I donate moisture 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.190
 but bought in the darkest colors 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.440
 and I do not know that yet with the color 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.610
 quite if that fits but otherwise I am 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.010
 definitely looking forward to it 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.710
 the product to me i have if so 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.629
 One is bought a moisture fight 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.210
 because I found it very interesting and that 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.949
 since not so busy but 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.079
 I had the feeling it is such a 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.270
 a bit low because he is studying 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.530
 particles in it and I knew 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.500
 a bit out of test but if that 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.510
 I can not find the case 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.390
 I want to be with my all the time 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.189
 continue to attend it is the eyes 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.150
 products and I have here once from 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.189
 jack atrys the absolute metal that's yes 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.689
 this new with these matte colors in it 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.700
 and I found it super exciting now 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.600
 also just for the autumn brave though 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.030
 You can do it a bit too 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.920
 still build up to a smokey eyes and 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.829
 you have me very interested therefore 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.290
 Probably with the p2 and I found myself 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.420
 from this forever intense direction 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.280
 Krems bought a new one me hard 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.490
 always be calm and it is 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.159
 now that in the nearly 40 guests e &amp; s 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.320
 keep and beautiful yasch in the shelf easily 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.700
 what can i do with champagne colored tone 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.180
 actually sooner and I think so 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.890
 right 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.710
 Next time I have one 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.520
 bought one and there is the p2 like that 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.619
 alone 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.060
 and he's also waterproof I have 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.380
 even now you can do it too 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.820
 By the way, at nancy again over 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.880
 look because there we have the 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.619
 I also find make-up products 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.119
 pretty cool i like it too with this one 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.509
 island quite like 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.100
 I just learned you can do it too 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.440
 then do it and I do that 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.390
 Apply anja and really pretty cool 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.610
 and I have an idea of l'oreal 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.840
 bought eyebrow pencil I think that 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.490
 anyway pretty difficult in the 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.930
 print shop the right color for 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.430
 to find the eyebrows and I taste 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.490
 me a bit through in the moment 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.980
 and I have now just the 303 of 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.540
 I've got l'oreal and it's here once 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.850
 the side with the color 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.520
 the other side is just that 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.210
 camp to keep it in shape 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.770
 can make 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.980
 besides, I'm off after that 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.530
 manhattan so got a bus and in 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.030
 the color gordon brown so I have 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.720
 even now on it and that is and 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.370
 who brown shabby hus I think the 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.650
 color somehow totally exciting but me 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.540
 So it does not seem to suit me that way 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.370
 but it is very autumnal and quite 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.790
 Colleagues so I'm actually standing 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.400
 and I looked at by al'm so 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.410
 a sandbox ladder brought this one 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.580
 RosÃ©-colored has been great but the 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.810
 I also wanted to try it out so 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.330
 just for autumn I find this 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.040
 yes sunkist look still very nice 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.180
 and swims for me too fits that 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.470
 autumn ahead 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.390
 I'll be back for the lips 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.160
 bought a lipstick from p2 because 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.560
 which are simply cheap and I like those 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.300
 totally for me and it is the color wall 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.010
 street and that's right 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.260
 Here it looks so dark for me now 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.940
 but I like it somehow completely 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.650
 well that's a bit of a classic too 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.910
 really say so very difficult and 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.350
 not too strong on the lips 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.720
 pigmented and it's just such a lot 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.900
 autumnal color yes so I have mine 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.620
 caught up by max factor namely the 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.340
 color 745 and I would like you 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.290
 look in here 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.850
 actually dark yes but I find 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.410
 my lips looks a bit brighter 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.760
 but that is what I believe in mine 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.560
 pigmentation of the lips that is namely 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.260
 already relatively strong and if I then 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.490
 no matter with a slightly darker lipstick 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.290
 it still works 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.490
 a bit bright but otherwise found 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.050
 I've been pretty good so far 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.830
 then donate properly moisture then 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.420
 Let's have a few more 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.270
 highlights from the new patrick 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.340
 assortment show that we are so for us 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.740
 and the first thing I have on everyone 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.800
 case would like to show here is this blush 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.840
 that's the color 0 20 and that's one 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.010
 illuminati meat so like the name 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.570
 So it's a bit saying 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.340
 Shimmer in any case but with it 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.229
 otherwise you might see that 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.150
 these three of the fillings so i find 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.230
 that made her really cute she is one 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.630
 little hands 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.640
 out and the color is just as well 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.560
 nice and that's why I find that very 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.060
 interesting I have an eyebrow 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.590
 selected product because there is now 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.430
 at this two-meter- thick is one 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.840
 real woman h there are really many 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.360
 cool stuff and i have time for this 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.620
 his album thriller this is a gel and 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.810
 so you can stop that one too 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.370
 fill up and shape and that 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.440
 I think they are really great 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.000
 many other cool things to do 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.410
 wax founder and so but that's how it is 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.820
 my little favorite 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.610
 And then there are a lot of new ones 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.670
 eyelash products and I have 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.630
 me now the iconic mascara 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.550
 I found that really great 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.440
 once the hand is down and for 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.270
 a brush at the top and it is there too 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.250
 in waterproof and not waterproof and 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.020
 I like it somehow totally like her 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.910
 so the eyelashes look so the 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.310
 drink really well and leaves you too 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.190
 whole look relatively long and the 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.810
 I think it's really great and I have it here 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.550
 Windparks around so I use moment 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.390
 that of rhi continues and I am very happy 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.130
 satisfied with it 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.650
 So it really worked for me like that 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.820
 you also got it right and patrice did 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.260
 now synonymous so brought out something 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.760
 So I am also a eyelash serum 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.870
 Of course, super happy like that 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.430
 works 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.930
 that is of course much cheaper 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.090
 and yes, that would be real 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.460
 awesome wise that 's what I want too 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.080
 necessarily from Theissen to because it is already 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.700
 cool if you gave me a cost around the 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.500
 five euro land his eyelashes like this 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.260
 can look a bit longer with 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.600
 Start the money and have the end 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.940
 I am also a product of Patrice 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.790
 also paid so many cool lipsticks 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.760
 I think it's just a pity that the uni 40 on 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.980
 4 eur 990 should cost so little 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.320
 so cheap but i have a lot of time for 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.690
