handbook
they<00:00:21.180> all<00:00:21.359> need<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:22.560> need<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.920> know<00:00:23.039> stats

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400

effects<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:24.029> over<00:00:24.380> 640<00:00:25.380> pokémon's<00:00:25.920> pokey<00:00:26.820> wand

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.570 
effects on over 640 pokémon's pokey wand
and<00:00:27.359> yes<00:00:28.230> that's<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.710> guess<00:00:28.949> that's<00:00:29.189> how<00:00:29.340> much

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
and yes that's I guess that's how much

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.500 
and yes that's I guess that's how much
there<00:00:29.820> is

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
there is

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.700 
there is
that's<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.529> lot<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.660> this<00:00:33.660> was<00:00:33.870> actually<00:00:34.050> $10

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
that's a lot and this was actually $10

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.709 
that's a lot and this was actually $10
so<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.070> wasn't<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.579> bad<00:00:35.790> for<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.270> kind<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.600> a

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
so it wasn't that bad for this kind of a

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.900 
so it wasn't that bad for this kind of a
book<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.649> has<00:00:37.829> everything<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.520> it

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
book it has everything in it

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.500 
book it has everything in it
not<00:00:39.390> bad<00:00:39.600> at<00:00:39.750> all<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.969> I'm<00:00:41.969> gonna<00:00:42.120> flip

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
not bad at all and I'm gonna flip

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.340 
not bad at all and I'm gonna flip
through<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:43.590> way<00:00:46.820> all<00:00:47.820> these<00:00:48.289> so<00:00:49.289> you

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
through it this way all these so you

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.380 
through it this way all these so you
might<00:00:49.800> recognize<00:00:50.309> these<00:00:50.550> books<00:00:50.910> because<00:00:51.090> they

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
might recognize these books because they

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.510 
might recognize these books because they
really<00:00:51.809> stuns<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.559> these<00:00:52.770> but<00:00:53.070> I'm<00:00:53.190> pretty

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
really stuns of these but I'm pretty

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.110 
really stuns of these but I'm pretty
sure<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.820> like<00:00:54.379> the<00:00:55.379> best<00:00:55.860> up<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.850> date

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
sure this is like the best up to date

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.279 
sure this is like the best up to date
one<00:00:58.430> it's<00:00:59.430> got<00:00:59.640> everything<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.270> here<00:01:00.510> mixture

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
one it's got everything in here mixture

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.240 
one it's got everything in here mixture
of<00:01:01.500> all<00:01:01.739> five<00:01:02.160> gents<00:01:03.110> kento<00:01:04.140> total

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
of all five gents kento total

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.870 
of all five gents kento total
holy<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.970> say<00:01:06.450> no<00:01:06.630> ANOVA<00:01:08.030> and<00:01:10.729> usually<00:01:11.729> these

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
holy and say no ANOVA and usually these

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.670 
holy and say no ANOVA and usually these
things<00:01:11.939> come<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.780> poster<00:01:13.170> but<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.530> one

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
things come in a poster but this one

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.140 
things come in a poster but this one
didn't<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.130> guess<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.549> makes<00:01:14.729> sense<00:01:14.820> because

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
didn't I guess it makes sense because

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.149 
didn't I guess it makes sense because
there<00:01:15.630> are<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.229> much<00:01:16.409> probably<00:01:16.770> one<00:01:16.950> that

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
there are so much probably one that

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.990 
there are so much probably one that
poster<00:01:17.610> would<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:17.909> been<00:01:18.920> really<00:01:19.920> big<00:01:20.159> that

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
poster would have been really big that

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.210 
poster would have been really big that
was<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.270> case<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:22.020> skipped<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:23.040> my
