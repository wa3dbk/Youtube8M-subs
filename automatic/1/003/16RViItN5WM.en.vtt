00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.019
 second part for this tutorial because rightly so 

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:14.649
 some of you told me that 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:17.359
 dinner previous versions not having 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.869
 me and functions for alma white regulation black 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.920
 all in one you can apply the suggestions that now opens the first part 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:26.819
 here 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:31.889
 which is born where the second part where we go to see how to behave with 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.760
 d photoshop signs. a little less recent 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.940
 open 2 identical images 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.770
 to be able to evaluate the differences on the 2 and different methods 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.930
 we can start with image 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.960
 adjustments 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.800
 suturing shade 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.800
 completely desaturate 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.940
 here is not the best way solved an image must be image 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.100
 good starting for it to be a good black and white 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.780
 anyway 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.910
 lugia a first assumption where we can apply to do some 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.440
 little other intervention to improve what 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.630
 we confirm that we can make an intervention on the regulation levels 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.910
 then level 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.830
 I apologize, image 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.830
 level adjustments 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.760
 this is the window where we have this graph that we can start 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.270
 ht repression tries to understand how to interpret it king in a bit to the vision 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.630
 in graphic form of how the shades are distributed in the images 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.060
 on the left we have 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.180
 therefore dark area of ​​the images 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.240
 on the right a person who loves whites at the itcg center 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.890
 marry him these are only two extremes to the left right 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.640
 here we are already to see what happens is true that 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.600
 we exaggerate in the 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.349
 therefore the displacement in these cussu we can obtain 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:10.739
 lol 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.379
 another major 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.719
 the intensity of dark tones light tones 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:19.989
 but you must 3 consider that going beyond the limit on the graph 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.219
 it means giving up information on the image because this 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:28.759
 the black cursor and the white one determine what is called entry 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:31.629
 that is to say of the white they entertained the limit 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.260
 youtube therefore the program to assign the 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:38.420
 how can we call it 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.400
 april. of aimed image 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.490
 en. of white to go ulteo means to take away information 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.720
 re move this input to deteriorating the image then 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.610
 we get to lose 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.060
 all the effects 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.620
 what information of 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.680
 go then you don't go let's go 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.379
 further this position 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.299
 there 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.749
 sensitive wellness center for adjusting the average levels of 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:08.669
 Tuninetti 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:11.399
 and also when I am missing Augustus staves 

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:12.599
 looking for you 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.599
 to find the anger in cement 

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:18.319
 d lol eu 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.449
 we will try we will try are the solution for us 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.379
 that I stop here regarding this method 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.240
 here now that we see how to deal with another path 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.529
 always image 

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:37.669
 saturation color adjustments intended to be used here too 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:43.049
 let's come who we are 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.359
 has a black and white confirm 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.939
 and then we intervene more locally with another instrument 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.429
 still - image adjustments 

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:57.889
 this time selective color correction 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.159
 this is a window that allows us to do several localized interventions 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.040
 generally on color images in fact we see to the field 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.939
 colors 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:08.349
 all interventions 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.349
 localized we can do on primary colors 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:19.339
 I have done und all relaxed done a tutorial time ago also on the use of 

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:20.939
 this 

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:22.629
 of this function 

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:25.629
 in this in this 

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:30.020
 this tutorial where belts 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.180
 we start from black white lions we orient ourselves on 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.009
 q-tro and on the three neutral shades of black and white 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:39.939
 and we see that here we can appear c 

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:43.159
 blacks and work directly 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:45.250
 only in in stores 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.819
 last on mine 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.919
 always valid even if you 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.260
 he always calls the black white rule valid because he would like images 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:54.749
 with 

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:59.979
 as I said in the first part white deep clean black eeepc di 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.309
 intermediate shades of gray 

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:04.470
 so on mine we try to act 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.220
 with the cursor of Verona to show 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.890
 in others because intro on clothes could introduce the dominant of 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:12.719
 color 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:14.260
 black penisul 7 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.530
 we turn on we see that the ares 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:17.520
 ax 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.689
 to brallo 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:20.350
 an intensity of miero 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.089
 + marked 

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:27.509
 here we can locally intervene on these actions 4 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:29.999
 if we like to see 

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:33.349
 it has a stronger effect than the black tones 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:35.580
 alp we will increase 3 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:36.780
 the same thing 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.009
 We will reduce 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:44.110
 of course with the attack with caution you see that it is easy to wash everything 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.169
 it's spoiling too 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.169
 all this is what we always do 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.349
 with 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:54.039
 in moderation 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:56.889
 the same thing for whites 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:58.979
 it's always juicy I see it black 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.509
 weight emphasized a lot because we can see the clearest areas are 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:08.499
 become direct were the situations in which we like that is not a white 

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:09.810
 shot but 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.939
 maybe a little 

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:14.999
 goku some more nuances 

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:16.260
 in the same way 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.370
 the neutral terms suinette we work on gray areas 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:21.809
 here is that 

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:28.009
 on the intermediate races we can also use here to counteract more 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:30.360
 why on the michela murgia 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.550
 worked on whites also 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.550
 forever with moderation even here 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:41.939
 here are videos side by side the results are minimal 

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:45.130
 but there are and it is not a song that says water 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.110
 center 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.110
 the contrast between legion m 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.439
 more marked and more evident respect 

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:55.879
 to the previous one 

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:57.520
 is 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.419
 of course you don't choose was the method that succeeds you best 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:03.289
 doors results that more 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:05.169
 - satisfy 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:09.849
 no no I would not add anything else to avoid complicating hunter - inwardly le 

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:13.749
 things that you already have a good method to achieve good results 

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:15.310
 I remember that 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.460
 anyway 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.440
 keygen we must have a good color image at the start if it is an image 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.229
 under exposed exposed sex 

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:29.530
 but if there are too strong contrasts naturally in black and white they will have 

00:07:29.529 --> 00:07:31.009
 their influence 

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:33.539
 when a photo is leaving 

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:37.999
 color photography aja a good tonal range then 

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:41.349
 we will probably also get a good black and white
