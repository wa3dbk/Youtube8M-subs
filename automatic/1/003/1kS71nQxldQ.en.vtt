working with that are brand new and of
course<00:00:54.030> everyone<00:00:54.570> recognizes<00:00:55.289> what<00:00:55.469> a

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
course everyone recognizes what a

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.610 
course everyone recognizes what a
standard<00:00:56.010> ring<00:00:56.280> worm<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.730> okay<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.690> that's

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
standard ring worm is okay and that's

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.080 
standard ring worm is okay and that's
kind<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.980> probably<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.430> number<00:00:59.670> one<00:00:59.850> plastic

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
kind of probably the number one plastic

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.170 
kind of probably the number one plastic
overall<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.920> new<00:01:02.100> introduction<00:01:02.789> from<00:01:02.940> be

fishin is called the Moxie ISE Moxie
okay<00:01:07.830> your<00:01:08.700> cure<00:01:10.310> or<00:01:11.310> slow<00:01:11.700> fishin<00:01:12.240> okay<00:01:12.780> and

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
okay your cure or slow fishin okay and

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.380 
okay your cure or slow fishin okay and
if<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.080> compare<00:01:13.700> you<00:01:14.700> can<00:01:14.909> see<00:01:15.090> there's<00:01:15.330> a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
if you compare you can see there's a

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.210 
if you compare you can see there's a
need<00:01:15.689> there's<00:01:16.110> quite<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> difference<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
need there's quite a difference in the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.149 
need there's quite a difference in the
tail<00:01:17.460> size<00:01:17.850> yes<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:19.080> profile<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> same

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
tail size yes the profile is the same

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.359 
tail size yes the profile is the same
and<00:01:20.430> just<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.729> little<00:01:20.909> bit<00:01:21.150> bulkier<00:01:21.689> and

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
and just a little bit bulkier and

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.429 
and just a little bit bulkier and
forecasting<00:01:23.369> with<00:01:23.610> all<00:01:23.909> say<00:01:24.479> lethargic<00:01:25.259> or

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
forecasting with all say lethargic or

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.340 
forecasting with all say lethargic or
slow<00:01:25.799> presentations<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.970> haven't<00:01:27.869> perhaps<00:01:28.170> we

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
slow presentations I haven't perhaps we

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.950 
slow presentations I haven't perhaps we
have<00:01:28.439> lower<00:01:28.680> flow<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.729> Mach<00:01:30.000> seal<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.689> tail

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
have lower flow the Mach seal the tail

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.499 
have lower flow the Mach seal the tail
will<00:01:31.259> turn<00:01:31.500> much<00:01:31.740> easier<00:01:32.220> okay<00:01:32.670> also<00:01:32.909> prevents

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
will turn much easier okay also prevents

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.510 
will turn much easier okay also prevents
a<00:01:33.600> larger<00:01:34.079> profile<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.220> especially

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
a larger profile and especially

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.350 
a larger profile and especially
targeting<00:01:36.270> bigger<00:01:37.020> fish<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.970> off<00:01:38.970> bite

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
targeting bigger fish in off bite

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.170 
targeting bigger fish in off bite
conditions<00:01:39.990> or<00:01:40.290> dirty<00:01:41.189> water<00:01:41.549> conditions

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
conditions or dirty water conditions

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.660 
conditions or dirty water conditions
we're<00:01:42.689> gonna<00:01:42.810> find<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.439> lower<00:01:43.710> profile<00:01:44.310> it's

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
we're gonna find this lower profile it's

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.120 
we're gonna find this lower profile it's
really<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> great<00:01:45.509> soft<00:01:45.960> plastic<00:01:46.619> so

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
really a great soft plastic so

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.039 
really a great soft plastic so
unfortunately<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.149> many<00:01:48.210> products<00:01:48.899> out<00:01:48.990> there

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
unfortunately so many products out there

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.530 
unfortunately so many products out there
have<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.560> much<00:01:49.680> filler<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.360> get

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
have so much filler in it that you get

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.639 
have so much filler in it that you get
the<00:01:51.689> only<00:01:51.780> way<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.049> can<00:01:52.200> fish<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.619> is

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
the only way you can fish it is

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.950 
the only way you can fish it is
aggressive<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:54.060> put<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.509> water<00:01:54.689> and

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
aggressive you put it in the water and

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.300 
aggressive you put it in the water and
watch<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.380> current<00:01:55.590> move<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.130> tail

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310
