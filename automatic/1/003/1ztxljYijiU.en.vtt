00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello my friends how are you 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.350
 patrick here and welcome to 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.030
 a gate to devil fifa 14 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.519
 In this video I want to show you 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.809
 how to easily and effectively score in 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.880
 fifa can achieve 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.859
 if you have more important tutorials in 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.810
 you can now on the screen 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.850
 Click or the link in the video 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.930
 follow description 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.609
 basically there are different ways 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.330
 the ball in fifa 14 in goal 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.160
 accommodate 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.439
 I will tell you these now by means of 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.119
 explain and explain examples 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.640
 At first we have the normal one 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.930
 Powerful Vollspannschuss the can 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.790
 her with a simple press of the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.500
 shot button if he has one 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.170
 to do a header this works 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.300
 also with this key whether your player 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.920
 but ultimately a header or a 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.440
 shot with the foot power hangs but 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.719
 of course from the situation then there 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.300
 it still the treasury a shot with a lot 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.510
 You can do effet de by her 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.070
 heritage on the xbox or he once on the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.879
 Playstation while pressing the shot 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.190
 hold the key 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.170
 Furthermore, there are more special ones 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.570
 species a complete attack 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.930
 first the chip you can through the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.090
 holding lb key on the xbox or the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.130
 l1 key on the playstation at 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.229
 Press the shot button to execute one 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.299
 another special kind is acrobatic 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.090
 For example, by one 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.210
 a hackenschuss a hunter 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.710
 flying head or similar for it must 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.250
 her while pressing the shot button 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.509
 simply lt on the Xbox and l 2 on the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.430
 Keep playstation 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.320
 Last but not least, you can do the left 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.210
 stick to use the direction of the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.159
 It is very difficult to decide 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.930
 important because the left stick should 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.020
 always pointing in the direction where the 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.490
 shot should go so that's first 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.500
 the different types have been one 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.119
 attack in fifa 14 to finish 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.500
 Now I'll give you a few tips and 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.399
 tricks on different situations 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.530
 demonstrate 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.030
 in the first situation we are 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.920
 centrally in front of the gate 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.360
 Here you should always ensure with 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.290
 the strong foot of the player 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.689
 complete 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.100
 then it is important with a right foot 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.719
 in the right corner from the view of 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.030
 complete with a player 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.990
 left foot logically in the left corner 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.399
 complete 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.500
 At the conclusion you can get one 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.300
 powerful Vollspannschuss but also 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.040
 to apply a fitness shot 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.450
 that depends a bit on the player 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.790
 and the distance to the gate 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.260
 At more than 20 meters I would always 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.450
 a powerful full-power shot 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.100
 but you are closer to goal 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.910
 You can also shoot with a finesse 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.530
 to lock 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.570
 generally could be between one 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.120
 flat shot a half high and one 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.900
 high shot choose the execution is 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.670
 very easily 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.580
 the longer the shot button is pressed 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.410
 the higher the shot is also that 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.120
 individually dependent on the player and 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.830
 can not be generalized 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.720
 but if you get a feeling for it 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.020
 I want to recommend you training arena 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.700
 as in my case here on fifa 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.140
 I can tell you that gameplay 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.720
 flat shot within the sixteen 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.340
 very effective is the goalkeeper first 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.880
 has to come down to the ball 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.950
 hold 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.930
 for larger distances is one himself 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.950
 shallow shot usually not at most 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.480
 when he is covered 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.070
 otherwise I would always have one 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.560
 powerful and placed shot 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.270
 recommend a half-high shot is 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.520
 generally always with a small risk 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.830
 because he is very easy to hold 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.170
 if the goalie is good the 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.990
 next situation looks like this 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.030
 Run sideways onto the gate in mine 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.780
 eyes the perfect situation around a gate 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.810
 to achieve 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.880
 always closes in the long corner 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.530
 are from the left side 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.420
 conclusion in the right corner 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.489
 and logically you should if you 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.450
 from the right side comes in the left 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.520
 shoot down 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.620
 very important is before the shot too 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.510
 try the direction exactly 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.820
 to align the long post 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.290
 this increases the chances of success 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.000
 personally always use one here 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.010
 powerful shot if you but better 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.570
 can handle a miss 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.790
 Of course, you also use these 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.620
 In addition, I should say that you 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.209
 such a situation, of course, too 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.400
 close the short post 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.820
 then the shot but very powerful 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.320
 his 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.150
 The whole is not so 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.800
 oberbauer vienna fifa 13 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.570
 and if you have other game modes than 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.270
 ultimate team plays that affects 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.670
 not so strong from such friends anyway 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.860
 these were two typical situations 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.840
 The goal continues with the fitness 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.480
 Shots related to television shots 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.280
 here are two special spots of 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.170
 those from a fitness shot very much 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.019
 effective is this is approximately on 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.380
 sixteen to about 20 to 25 meters before 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.419
 gate 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.780
 Here you should always have the ball in the 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.790
 long corner circle 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.250
 best coming from the left with a 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.840
 circle the right foot into the right corner and 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.330
 if you come from the right with one 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.160
 left foot in the left corner 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.770
 This turns the ball around the goalkeeper 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.600
 encircles all other positions 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.860
 I would do it all at larger distances 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.419
 always with a powerful 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.430
 complete the full-span shot 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.630
 if they see a far shot tutor 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.650
 you want it in the comments 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.139
 Post 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.850
 on with head balls here 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.160
 it is also a simple but very 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.169
 effective trick if a flank of 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.300
 comes on the left heads the ball in the 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.400
 left corner of the gate comes a flank 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.240
 from the right also heads the ball into the 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.180
 right corner 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.950
 why the whole thing if the simple 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.050
 ball against the direction of the goalkeeper 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.210
 beheaded he has problems properly 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.340
 React because he just does not balance 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.200
 has by the mind against the 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.030
 So you hear the direction of the goalkeeper 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.460
 the chances to score a very high 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.320
 Just try it very hard 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.200
 effectively, of course, that works 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.240
 whole with square balls just now come 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.500
 we the special financial statements when 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.240
 your beginner I would be you 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.890
 First, only the previously recommend 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.610
 to the above-mentioned standard financial statements 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.830
 use 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.900
 So if you have a chip over the goalie 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.440
 off if bolt must be given a thing 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.090
 his 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.250
 The goalkeeper may no longer be on the 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.289
 line stand the power you have to be yourself 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.240
 find out because this depends very much 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:39.550
 very much from the player and off 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.100
 especially from the distance to the gate 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.840
 but if the goalkeeper is just out 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.090
 a chip is always available 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.039
 since it can not run back in time 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.050
 A chip can pass even after a high pass 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:52.120
 or something similar can be done here 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.789
 but less power is needed than at 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.100
 a chip from the ground then there is 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:59.320
 still fall-puller pull-back hook 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.510
 shots and more special shots these 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.580
 could hold on with the l key 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.110
 the xbox and l2 button on the 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.270
 Playstation at the shot process 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.440
 If you are boring of the tower 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.780
 you have enough to try 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.820
 to achieve a fancy goal 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.919
 to hack for detailed information 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.840
 shots no look shots and the like 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:18.729
 I recommend this tutorial here 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.500
 just click on the screen or 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:23.140
 the link in the video description 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.970
 Follow something in the end 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.880
 bit with Torabschluss but also with 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.120
 dribbling has to do with the 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.250
 one-on-one situation with the 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.320
 Goalkeeper here will be in the future 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.969
 Detailed tutorial will follow 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.009
 time in advance 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:37.199
 to offer the goalkeeper to play 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:39.449
 skills, for example, the 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:40.979
 just three meters from the top 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:41.819
 tor wait skill and execute them 

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:43.979
 to fool with it 

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:45.449
 in the ideal case, you are in front of it 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:46.379
 empty gate would only have to 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:49.499
 insert
