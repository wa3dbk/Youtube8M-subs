00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
going to share how many pieces in each

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.759 
going to share how many pieces in each
portion<00:01:02.899> so<00:01:03.899> what<00:01:04.080> we're<00:01:04.199> going<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.379> do<00:01:04.559> is

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
portion so what we're going to do is

we're going to defy the 12 pieces of

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:17.320 
we're going to defy the 12 pieces of
pizza<00:01:09.229> by<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.260> number<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.860> friends<00:01:15.890> 12/4<00:01:16.890> is

three pieces per friend you could also

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.170 
three pieces per friend you could also
show<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:32.280> drawing<00:01:32.729> by<00:01:33.439> splitting<00:01:35.180> the

let's say we're going to give you

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.710 
let's say we're going to give you
another<00:02:08.300> example<00:02:09.700> $24<00:02:10.700> was<00:02:10.879> donated<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.540> a

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
another example $24 was donated to a

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.000 
another example $24 was donated to a
charity<00:02:12.080> by<00:02:12.440> six<00:02:12.830> different<00:02:13.610> students<00:02:14.269> if

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
charity by six different students if

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.210 
charity by six different students if
they<00:02:16.010> donated<00:02:16.519> the<00:02:16.700> same<00:02:16.970> amount<00:02:17.950> how<00:02:18.950> much

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
they donated the same amount how much

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.820 
they donated the same amount how much
did<00:02:19.459> each<00:02:19.670> donate<00:02:20.239> so<00:02:21.230> what<00:02:21.410> we're<00:02:21.560> going<00:02:21.709> to

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
did each donate so what we're going to

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.960 
did each donate so what we're going to
do<00:02:22.010> is<00:02:22.280> split<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:24.140> 24<00:02:24.799> hours<00:02:25.250> or<00:02:25.430> divide<00:02:25.790> the

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
do is split the 24 hours or divide the

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.280 
do is split the 24 hours or divide the
twenty-four<00:02:26.540> dollars<00:02:26.860> by<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.610> six<00:02:29.290> students

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
twenty-four dollars by the six students

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.860 
twenty-four dollars by the six students
and<00:02:30.940> we<00:02:31.940> get<00:02:32.209> each<00:02:32.930> student<00:02:33.650> paid<00:02:34.870> four

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
and we get each student paid four

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.539 
and we get each student paid four
dollars<00:02:36.730> now<00:02:37.730> how<00:02:37.970> do<00:02:38.030> we<00:02:38.150> know<00:02:38.390> this<00:02:38.599> is<00:02:38.780> true

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.780 

we<00:02:43.549> can<00:02:43.760> prove<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.299> by<00:02:44.569> saying<00:02:44.959> well<00:02:45.319> if<00:02:45.790> one

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
we can prove it by saying well if one

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.000 
we can prove it by saying well if one
student<00:02:47.090> donated<00:02:47.690> four<00:02:48.019> dollars<00:02:48.380> how<00:02:48.769> many

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
student donated four dollars how many

student donated four dollars how many
did<00:02:49.250> six<00:02:49.610> students<00:02:50.030> donate<00:02:50.450> and<00:02:50.750> we<00:02:51.650> can<00:02:51.860> check

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
did six students donate and we can check

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.080 
did six students donate and we can check
our<00:02:52.819> answer<00:02:53.209> by<00:02:53.329> multiplying<00:02:53.569> six<00:02:55.090> students

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
four dollars and why do I know this

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.980 
four dollars and why do I know this
because<00:03:03.920> I'm<00:03:04.480> Tenley<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:06.500> penguin
