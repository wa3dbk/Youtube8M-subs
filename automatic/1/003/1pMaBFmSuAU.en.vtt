see the movie and then see the game was
the<00:00:46.450> yeah<00:00:46.660> these<00:00:46.990> are<00:00:47.050> really<00:00:47.320> together<00:00:47.590> this

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
the yeah these are really together this

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.850 
the yeah these are really together this
really<00:00:48.220> works<00:00:48.400> nicely<00:00:48.730> so<00:00:49.630> far<00:00:49.660> as<00:00:50.380> whilst<00:00:50.650> we

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
really works nicely so far as whilst we

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.560 
really works nicely so far as whilst we
take<00:00:51.070> those<00:00:51.310> environments<00:00:51.940> that<00:00:52.210> you<00:00:52.390> will

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
take those environments that you will

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.600 
take those environments that you will
see<00:00:52.750> in<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:52.960> movie<00:00:53.320> we<00:00:53.740> then<00:00:53.890> fill<00:00:54.220> them<00:00:54.460> and

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
see in the movie we then fill them and

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.280 
see in the movie we then fill them and
populate<00:00:55.060> them<00:00:55.240> with<00:00:55.540> all<00:00:55.870> sorts<00:00:56.110> of

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
populate them with all sorts of

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.260 
populate them with all sorts of
interactive<00:00:56.950> things<00:00:57.250> through<00:00:57.640> breakable

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270 
interactive things through breakable

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.630 
interactive things through breakable
things<00:00:58.300> things<00:00:58.960> you<00:00:59.080> can<00:00:59.230> move<00:00:59.410> around<00:00:59.640> things

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
things things you can move around things

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.850 
things things you can move around things
that<00:01:01.030> will<00:01:01.210> really<00:01:01.420> create<00:01:01.750> an<00:01:02.380> interesting

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
that will really create an interesting

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.300 
that will really create an interesting
game<00:01:03.040> experience<00:01:03.730> for<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.000> player<00:01:05.130> one<00:01:06.130> big

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
game experience for the player one big

they'll push me off this building so far

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.289 
they'll push me off this building so far
as<00:01:20.499> the<00:01:20.710> game<00:01:20.890> is<00:01:21.189> really<00:01:21.340> about<00:01:21.609> being<00:01:21.850> a<00:01:22.060> true

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
as the game is really about being a true

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.599 
as the game is really about being a true
ninja<00:01:22.539> and<00:01:22.929> we<00:01:23.560> define<00:01:23.859> that<00:01:24.009> in<00:01:24.070> three<00:01:24.460> ways

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:24.609 
ninja and we define that in three ways

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:26.910 
ninja and we define that in three ways
the<00:01:25.030> first<00:01:25.299> is<00:01:25.600> fast-paced<00:01:26.109> acrobatic

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
the first is fast-paced acrobatic

navigation across rooftops through
sewers<00:01:29.499> through<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.399> jungle<00:01:30.819> in<00:01:30.939> fact

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
sewers through the jungle in fact

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.239

anywhere<00:01:31.780> that<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.079> turtles<00:01:32.469> go<00:01:32.710> we<00:01:33.039> want

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:33.249 
anywhere that the turtles go we want

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:35.809 
anywhere that the turtles go we want
them<00:01:33.369> to<00:01:33.579> use<00:01:33.819> this<00:01:34.210> ninja<00:01:34.840> like<00:01:35.170> acrobatics

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
them to use this ninja like acrobatics

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:38.609 
them to use this ninja like acrobatics
secondly<00:01:36.819> of<00:01:36.909> course<00:01:36.939> is<00:01:37.329> the<00:01:37.420> combat<00:01:37.869> being

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
secondly of course is the combat being

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.899 
secondly of course is the combat being
very<00:01:39.329> powerful<00:01:41.009> considerate<00:01:42.009> using<00:01:42.490> lots<00:01:42.729> of

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
very powerful considerate using lots of

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.209 
very powerful considerate using lots of
combo<00:01:43.420> moves<00:01:43.749> using<00:01:44.139> environment<00:01:45.039> as<00:01:45.130> a

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
combo moves using environment as a

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:47.760 
combo moves using environment as a
weapon<00:01:45.399> and<00:01:45.819> finally<00:01:46.600> of<00:01:46.689> course<00:01:46.719> being<00:01:47.439> part

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
weapon and finally of course being part

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.370 
weapon and finally of course being part
of<00:01:47.859> a<00:01:47.950> family<00:01:47.979> which<00:01:48.819> is<00:01:49.119> using<00:01:50.020> lots<00:01:50.200> of

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
of a family which is using lots of

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.499 
of a family which is using lots of
cooperative<00:01:51.009> move<00:01:51.219> tagging<00:01:51.819> in<00:01:51.939> and<00:01:52.030> out<00:01:52.210> so

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
cooperative move tagging in and out so

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.450 
cooperative move tagging in and out so
that<00:01:52.659> you<00:01:52.810> get<00:01:53.049> the<00:01:53.109> benefits<00:01:53.649> of<00:01:53.799> each<00:01:53.979> total

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
that you get the benefits of each total

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.789 
that you get the benefits of each total
individual<00:01:55.359> abilities<00:01:55.869> really<00:01:56.350> working<00:01:56.679> as<00:01:56.770> a

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
individual abilities really working as a

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.410 
individual abilities really working as a
family<00:01:57.249> and<00:01:57.369> I<00:01:57.490> think<00:01:57.729> that's<00:01:57.880> what<00:01:58.119> the<00:01:58.240> game

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
family and I think that's what the game

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.129 
family and I think that's what the game
is<00:01:58.450> all<00:01:58.719> about<00:02:00.359> so<00:02:01.359> what<00:02:01.509> we<00:02:01.600> were<00:02:01.659> able<00:02:01.749> to<00:02:01.899> do

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:02.139 
is all about so what we were able to do
