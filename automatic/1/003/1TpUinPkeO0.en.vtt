00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.430
 the transmission is the passage of 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.000
 relay in my opinion a very beautiful 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.010
 purely artistic experience on one side 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.800
 and purely professional from the other he 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.000
 there is an approach to the craft can say 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.500
 my opinion very very important because 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.250
 that she is on the ground so they 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.810
 see they can perceive what we're going 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.760
 ask them later when we want to 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.760
 performs in orchestras guides 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:47.000
 at the base it is a listening profession and 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:51.020
 so debt with that he's next to 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.600
 people to hear them from to see how 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.390
 it's done I hope it's okay 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.430
 bring a little vision of the job myself 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.470
 I learned a lot just one by following 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.610
 listening to what that what you 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.320
 are the person next to me by 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.960
 example with jennyfer it was a 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.869
 wonderful experience as much at the level 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.490
 personal work as a whole already 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.840
 I hear myself playing right next to me 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.130
 and I see that she is all the time 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.570
 all the time listening to all the 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.670
 instruments she and not just on her 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.330
 score is a real activity 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.330
 aggregate 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.830
 we are fortunate to have a 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.520
 orchestrate their national fund of lyon 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.830
 who has among his musicians a lot 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.980
 teachers who also have 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.710
 some been trained at the conservatory and 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.320
 so there are very strong links that 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.510
 already exists trust links ago 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.970
 exchange of professional leagues 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.040
 this is a real experience actually 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.630
 a professional that is to say that I 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.360
 plays next to a musician who is paid 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.220
 to play and who is it in 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.030
 this room henri thorium lyon 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.030
 do not have any that 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.980
 m 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.980
 for 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:38.930
 translated and nico is a musician 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.440
 relief besides there is a pipeau the 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.920
 segway 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.739
 they are welcomed as their father by 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.739
 repeat their elders but at the same time 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.819
 they are accompanied for fast 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.209
 adapt to the circumstances 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.209
 special 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.970
 I think in general it's pretty 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.550
 difficult to live together on stage 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.290
 professionals and students because the 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:19.310
 scene first belongs to those who are 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.900
 already out of the cycle of studies and there 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.150
 it's an operation totally 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.130
 exceptional but very rewarding 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.480
 for all I think I think it's 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.360
 important to have this contact 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:44.020
 they are really in the music is 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:44.020
 it's not an experience
