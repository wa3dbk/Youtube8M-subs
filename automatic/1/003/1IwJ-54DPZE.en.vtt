I'm<00:01:41.480> pretty<00:01:41.750> good<00:01:41.930> at<00:01:41.990> guessing<00:01:42.230> what<00:01:42.500> other

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
I'm pretty good at guessing what other

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.649 
I'm pretty good at guessing what other
critics<00:01:43.010> will<00:01:43.100> think<00:01:43.310> about<00:01:43.520> it<00:01:43.700> and<00:01:43.850> I<00:01:44.330> really

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
critics will think about it and I really

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:45.940 
critics will think about it and I really
thought<00:01:44.840> this<00:01:45.140> movie<00:01:45.320> was<00:01:45.470> gonna<00:01:45.680> hover

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
thought this movie was gonna hover

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.640 
thought this movie was gonna hover
around<00:01:46.130> a<00:01:46.370> 55%<00:01:47.120> rating<00:01:47.780> as<00:01:47.990> I<00:01:48.140> knew<00:01:48.260> it<00:01:48.380> wasn't

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
around a 55% rating as I knew it wasn't

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.620 
around a 55% rating as I knew it wasn't
for<00:01:48.770> everybody<00:01:49.100> I<00:01:49.340> was<00:01:50.090> surprised<00:01:50.450> by<00:01:50.600> how

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
for everybody I was surprised by how

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.570 
for everybody I was surprised by how
lowly<00:01:50.990> it<00:01:51.200> rated<00:01:51.409> I<00:01:51.620> was<00:01:51.920> surprised<00:01:52.310> by<00:01:52.520> the

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
lowly it rated I was surprised by the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.800 
lowly it rated I was surprised by the
twenty<00:01:52.850> five<00:01:52.940> percent<00:01:53.090> rating<00:01:53.390> cuz<00:01:53.510> I<00:01:53.540> liked

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
twenty five percent rating cuz I liked

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.870 
twenty five percent rating cuz I liked
this<00:01:53.960> film<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:54.380> I<00:01:54.590> thought<00:01:54.920> others<00:01:55.340> a<00:01:55.520> lot<00:01:55.729> of

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
this film and I thought others a lot of

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.800 
this film and I thought others a lot of
others<00:01:56.060> would<00:01:56.090> like<00:01:56.360> it<00:01:56.479> too

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
others would like it too

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.350 
others would like it too
apparently<00:01:57.409> not<00:01:57.500> as<00:01:57.620> much<00:01:57.790> did<00:01:58.790> okay<00:01:59.120> on<00:01:59.270> the

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
apparently not as much did okay on the

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.550 
apparently not as much did okay on the
opening<00:01:59.630> weekend<00:01:59.870> box<00:02:00.020> office<00:02:00.229> something<00:02:00.440> he

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
opening weekend box office something he

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.170 
opening weekend box office something he
made<00:02:00.680> about<00:02:00.770> 18<00:02:01.220> million<00:02:01.400> opening<00:02:01.729> weekend

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
made about 18 million opening weekend

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.180 
made about 18 million opening weekend
but<00:02:02.600> that's<00:02:02.780> not<00:02:02.990> enough

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
but that's not enough

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.280 
but that's not enough
so<00:02:04.520> everything<00:02:05.360> combined<00:02:05.690> from<00:02:05.900> the<00:02:06.049> critic

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
so everything combined from the critic

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.539 
so everything combined from the critic
reaction<00:02:06.680> to<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.860> fact<00:02:07.010> that<00:02:07.220> it<00:02:07.340> didn't

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
reaction to the fact that it didn't

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.359 
reaction to the fact that it didn't
quite<00:02:07.610> make<00:02:07.790> enough<00:02:08.179> to<00:02:08.360> justify<00:02:08.660> a<00:02:09.170> sequel<00:02:10.160> I

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
quite make enough to justify a sequel I

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.309 
quite make enough to justify a sequel I
don't<00:02:10.729> think<00:02:10.940> we're<00:02:11.030> gonna<00:02:11.120> see<00:02:11.450> one<00:02:11.660> Dennis

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
don't think we're gonna see one Dennis

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.369 
don't think we're gonna see one Dennis
I'm<00:02:13.129> not<00:02:13.459> sure<00:02:13.819> if<00:02:14.060> we're<00:02:14.209> gonna<00:02:14.269> see<00:02:14.629> one<00:02:14.900> i<00:02:14.930> I

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
I'm not sure if we're gonna see one i I

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.559 
I'm not sure if we're gonna see one i I
would<00:02:15.709> tend<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.069> say<00:02:16.159> no<00:02:16.760> but<00:02:17.090> I<00:02:17.120> think<00:02:17.269> there

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
would tend to say no but I think there

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.050 
would tend to say no but I think there
is<00:02:17.689> a<00:02:17.719> possibility<00:02:18.290> just<00:02:18.530> because<00:02:19.099> it<00:02:19.790> did

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
is a possibility just because it did

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.879 
is a possibility just because it did
okay<00:02:20.359> in<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.599> foreign<00:02:20.870> market<00:02:20.989> it<00:02:21.439> made<00:02:21.680> more

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:21.889 
okay in the foreign market it made more

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:24.129 
okay in the foreign market it made more
money<00:02:22.099> I<00:02:22.280> think<00:02:22.489> it's<00:02:22.730> around<00:02:22.939> 63<00:02:23.870> million

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:24.139 
money I think it's around 63 million

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:26.830 
money I think it's around 63 million
worldwide<00:02:24.530> with<00:02:24.859> a<00:02:24.889> budget<00:02:25.129> of<00:02:25.340> 66<00:02:25.999> still<00:02:26.659> got

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
worldwide with a budget of 66 still got

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.379 
worldwide with a budget of 66 still got
you<00:02:27.260> know<00:02:27.379> some<00:02:27.829> weeks<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.249> go<00:02:28.430> yeah<00:02:28.849> maybe<00:02:29.150> if

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:29.389 
you know some weeks to go yeah maybe if

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:31.119 
you know some weeks to go yeah maybe if
they<00:02:29.569> can<00:02:29.810> at<00:02:30.079> least<00:02:30.260> make<00:02:30.560> back<00:02:30.829> their<00:02:31.099> money

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
they can at least make back their money

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.729 
they can at least make back their money
they<00:02:31.700> might<00:02:31.879> look<00:02:32.659> at<00:02:32.840> because<00:02:33.439> even<00:02:33.650> though

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
they might look at because even though

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.949 
they might look at because even though
the<00:02:33.829> critics<00:02:34.219> don't<00:02:34.400> didn't<00:02:35.000> like<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:35.420> I<00:02:35.569> am<00:02:35.840> I

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.869 
audience themselves enjoyed it so the

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
studio might look at that and say hey

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.429

they<00:03:07.879> actually<00:03:08.299> liked<00:03:08.510> it<00:03:08.629> maybe<00:03:08.870> in<00:03:09.019> a<00:03:09.079> second

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:09.439 
they actually liked it maybe in a second

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.069 
they actually liked it maybe in a second
one<00:03:09.560> will<00:03:09.799> be<00:03:10.099> more<00:03:10.699> fruitful<00:03:11.629> for<00:03:11.780> them<00:03:11.930> I

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
one will be more fruitful for them I

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.629 
one will be more fruitful for them I
think<00:03:12.349> if<00:03:12.409> they<00:03:12.530> hit<00:03:12.620> like<00:03:12.769> 120<00:03:13.430> million

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
think if they hit like 120 million

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:16.539 
think if they hit like 120 million
worldwide<00:03:14.269> it's<00:03:15.019> a<00:03:15.169> possibility<00:03:15.769> I<00:03:16.129> just<00:03:16.400> I

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
worldwide it's a possibility I just I

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:17.890 
worldwide it's a possibility I just I
just<00:03:16.579> don't<00:03:17.060> see<00:03:17.239> getting<00:03:17.449> to<00:03:17.599> that<00:03:17.720> number

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
just don't see getting to that number
