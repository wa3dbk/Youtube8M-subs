00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.230
 I'm great are today for 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.030
 testing the power mode to 1 on a 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.010
 so hollow to a lot of people who have me 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.110
 do yeah china it's good to make 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.030
 heads but we want a little pvp so 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.010
 here I liked this mode so I 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.099
 you promise that there will be pvp 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.469
 just after this episode there so that's 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.629
 party for the discovery of the mode 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.690
 so today I'm in 11.5 mode 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:43.370
 peace msp at 5pm in any case I can 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.140
 sneak in the proof 6 so hop hop 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.800
 hop 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.839
 and here you are 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.449
 are we in soft mode 6 or not 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:56.399
 so that's perfect I can stay 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.100
 like that if I want but hey we do not 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.859
 passed to us so because I you 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.839
 explain why after that 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.290
 room 5 it suits me so if I want some 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.390
 pvp I will go into 12.6 mode then 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.720
 today I rented I bought them at 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.360
 60 million I recroise acrobats note 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.150
 a top I took the breakdown she monster 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.260
 it's really a property breakdown but 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.610
 in fact what is negative is 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.310
 the initiative and yet I got 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.260
 unraveled for at 1900 initiative this is 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.240
 not bad without having two trophies 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.150
 so that's where moon wing panels 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.930
 stars here so you'll do it's a 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.080
 slow motion hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.570
 so 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.340
 ep the pony so pau is not it 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.630
 give up an upi not bad especially she 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.050
 gives a lot of initiatives and that it has me 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.690
 really it is cool so jealous 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.980
 a pea a bad blood stone pm does I 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.270
 wanted to take an exo but I got 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.650
 recalled that I already had a janot iso 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.409
 so nothing for nothing so jfl belt 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:59.100
 so here is baude alister 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.450
 So here i know minimal and that's 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.009
 I think I have to show everything 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.020
 now we are eleven places compact pme 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:09.539
 3200 of life and of course I can pass 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:15.120
 in 3400 with the ddt 323 sagette 128 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:17.280
 luck and 661 agility but of course I 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.739
 can remove the cube and put their 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.620
 ravages in water instead that the 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:26.430
 robust major takes me away sweet and that's it 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.599
 it's boring so here I think I have 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.140
 shown so I show you a very small 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:37.290
 little my power so she is 135 89 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:39.450
 damage r so no in contrast g60 and 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.110
 some with him pest in major 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.599
 but hey we have to do with what we have 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.519
 so here I am putting it off so 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.890
 for the boom I mounted schedules l 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.690
 boom orange know him a judge of 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.980
 recoil face one would like to build so 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.959
 it's gone for this test so we're going 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.040
 start right away with ex pia 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.389
 so do that I pass my turn I 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.310
 ironed again for a long time so I 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:07.079
 prefers to start with hope it is that 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.370
 after that it's really perfect that you 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.769
 shows to say that gives you directly 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.269
 an idea about the trick 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.739
 do not forget that I do not have the pest 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:22.420
 to major and that's new jean to say 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:24.580
 critical control of tears powerful shot 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:30.190
 take a quick look at the recoils 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:34.900
 holds 545 on lamballe so the leche 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:38.860
 1500 league league normally I 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.220
 step over so clech harassing and e2 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.300
 early 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.910
 so that's a nice combo so it's 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.190
 2500 with the little tricks including 2600 to 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.140
 almost everywhere and that's just booming 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.910
 and all that really huge 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.110
 this is me I pass my turn and I you 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.630
 shows a little bit the other gold 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:02.200
 jeans licking slow motion feel more 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:05.110
 back arrow and a small arrow 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.000
 harassing me so what I find 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.930
 shame is that I would have liked 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.700
 do the mode r damage grows t and I 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.319
 think it would have made huge 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.090
 damage but hey it's not for a spell 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.040
 still I 'm going to do that 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.019
 this mode then we will say rather than 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.810
 I lost a lot of cammas on this mode 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:26.110
 there especially look is really silly 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.030
 so I was at 170 million on the other 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.650
 video I had other items in hd 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.289
 vimeo I reached 5 or 10 million 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.380
 but hey it's for you is not serious 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:37.150
 so in fact is something else so I 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.220
 shows you a little bit tears this 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.950
 that she does so at the up 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.870
 I spend my turn so manageable and 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.560
 just level 4 but hey it's okay 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:52.180
 we will do with his thiers critically 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:54.550
 control and so here I am not on 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.210
 two i believe yeah i'm a on 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.440
 four 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:03.100
 so finished first couple so 716 no 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.020
 stop we're going to redo another while 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.940
 hoping that this time I can do 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.860
 it's still not going to be 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.500
 shit 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:18.039
 will you pass your turn oh no 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:19.659
 the apron to the name to the whore has so hop 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.270
 good words buddy try we went 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:23.680
 for cons I'm them 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.240
 hurt and go I redo 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.939
 i just hope will not kill hourglasses 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.139
 go hop hop as much I would like 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:32.680
 see what that thought to you 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:34.210
 Besides, it's a shame that the trophy 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.199
 single all but all my shots 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.669
 critics but hey it's okay 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:42.610
 oh well it's actually shit 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:45.320
 so I'm coming back 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:48.790
 I'm coming back and I'm going to do a little 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:51.530
 test to show you something so 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:54.560
 flex to lens i believe you're going 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.910
 guess up 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.600
 good I think you've already guessed 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:01.850
 one so augustin the bitter hourglass is 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:05.060
 not get dressed not so much for 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:07.820
 me so hop we will try to me I 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:12.200
 pass quickly so third criticism 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:14.620
 powerful arc control and 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.640
 absorbent arrows 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.220
 so I just wanted to show a whole 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.360
 little bit regeneration 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.970
 I think it's really 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.340
 not bad it's a huge thing this mode 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:28.790
 I type millet and what is good is 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:31.370
 that if you are in 12 pea mode I can 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.500
 to make a combo and that it can be great 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:37.660
 you can do for example explain 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:40.580
 that they type that taps about 1500 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.870
 +2 absorbant who is typing a thousand so 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.550
 made 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.770
 2500 and that's a good day tapes 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:49.319
 and I can treat you right after 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.330
 so it's huge but in any case the 

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:53.310
 friends I tell you very soon 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.229
 take care of yourself and let the 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.180
 maximum of the right eye for this mode there 

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:58.770
 I hope in any case that you liked it 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.639
 see you soon and leave the maximum 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.639
 believes worse 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.180
 Oh 

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.670
