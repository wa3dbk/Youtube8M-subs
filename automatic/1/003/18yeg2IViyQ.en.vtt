30<00:01:38.610> seconds<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.240> then<00:01:40.140> he'll<00:01:40.560> uh<00:01:40.590> he'll

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
30 seconds and then he'll uh he'll

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.249 
30 seconds and then he'll uh he'll
basically<00:01:41.579> start<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.210> phase<00:01:42.360> over<00:01:42.720> again<00:01:42.960> so

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
basically start the phase over again so

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.499 
basically start the phase over again so
just<00:01:43.470> make<00:01:44.040> sure<00:01:44.070> when<00:01:44.549> he's<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.210> jail

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
just make sure when he's in that jail

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.870 
just make sure when he's in that jail
thing<00:01:45.810> you're<00:01:46.470> dpsing<00:01:46.920> down<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.369> bot<00:01:47.579> when

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
thing you're dpsing down the bot when

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.210 
thing you're dpsing down the bot when
he's<00:01:48.030> not<00:01:48.270> dps<00:01:49.079> down<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.829> boss<00:01:50.009> himself

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
he's not dps down the the boss himself

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.130 
he's not dps down the the boss himself

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the reason you have to wait until he's

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.870 
the reason you have to wait until he's
in<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.439> thing<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.130> he<00:01:53.280> does<00:01:53.460> like<00:01:53.640> have

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
that's about it there is actually a

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.810 
that's about it there is actually a
trick<00:02:49.680> method<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.160> don't<00:02:50.370> show<00:02:50.580> in<00:02:50.730> this

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
trick method that I don't show in this

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.390 
trick method that I don't show in this
video<00:02:50.970> where<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:52.590> pull<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.920> boss<00:02:53.100> back

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
video where you you pull the boss back

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.700 
video where you you pull the boss back
to<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.730> boxes<00:02:54.630> towards<00:02:54.960> the<00:02:55.080> front<00:02:55.410> of<00:02:55.560> the

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
to the boxes towards the front of the

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.490 
to the boxes towards the front of the
landing<00:02:56.040> pad<00:02:56.270> it<00:02:57.270> actually<00:02:57.480> takes<00:02:57.840> longer<00:02:58.380> in

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
landing pad it actually takes longer in

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.110 
landing pad it actually takes longer in
my<00:02:58.620> opinion<00:02:58.860> because<00:02:59.190> you<00:02:59.550> have<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.790> take<00:02:59.940> down

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
my opinion because you have to take down

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.090 
my opinion because you have to take down
all<00:03:00.150> those<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:01.080> little<00:03:01.290> piggies<00:03:01.620> afterwards

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
all those the little piggies afterwards

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.220 
all those the little piggies afterwards
but<00:03:03.000> basically<00:03:03.360> if<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:03.780> want<00:03:03.960> to<00:03:04.050> try<00:03:04.200> that

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
but basically if you want to try that

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.050 
but basically if you want to try that
you<00:03:04.560> don't<00:03:04.710> want<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:04.890> take<00:03:05.220> as<00:03:05.490> much<00:03:05.760> damage

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
you don't want to take as much damage

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.110 
you don't want to take as much damage
jump<00:03:06.960> up<00:03:07.080> on<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.320> boxes<00:03:07.830> have<00:03:08.430> let<00:03:08.820> your<00:03:08.910> tank

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
jump up on the boxes have let your tank

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.210 
jump up on the boxes have let your tank
like<00:03:09.300> intercede<00:03:09.720> up<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.110> boxes<00:03:10.560> or<00:03:10.710> sort

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
like intercede up to the boxes or sort

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.760 
like intercede up to the boxes or sort
can<00:03:11.400> pull<00:03:11.610> them<00:03:11.760> or<00:03:11.910> something<00:03:12.030> like<00:03:12.270> that<00:03:12.770> but

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
can pull them or something like that but

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.410 
can pull them or something like that but
it's<00:03:14.160> not<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.370> big<00:03:14.610> of<00:03:14.670> a<00:03:14.820> deal<00:03:14.940> it's<00:03:15.240> not<00:03:15.330> a

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
it's not that big of a deal it's not a

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.120 
it's not that big of a deal it's not a
tough<00:03:15.600> fight<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:16.110> I<00:03:16.140> don't<00:03:16.440> really<00:03:16.590> recommend

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
tough fight so I don't really recommend

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.030 
tough fight so I don't really recommend
going<00:03:17.430> through<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.620> glitching<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.709> out<00:03:19.830> it's

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
going through and glitching it out it's

those uh those Rockets the the other

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.320 
those uh those Rockets the the other
little<00:05:31.980> trick<00:05:32.280> though<00:05:32.490> is<00:05:32.730> that<00:05:32.760> he<00:05:33.030> does<00:05:33.180> this

little trick though is that he does this

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.410 
little trick though is that he does this
move<00:05:33.720> called<00:05:34.050> shackle<00:05:34.620> shackle<00:05:35.610> is<00:05:35.760> a<00:05:35.820> pain<00:05:36.150> in

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
move called shackle shackle is a pain in

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.890 
move called shackle shackle is a pain in
the<00:05:36.540> dick<00:05:36.620> basically<00:05:37.620> he'll<00:05:38.160> uh<00:05:38.780> you<00:05:39.780> know

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
the dick basically he'll uh you know

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.050 
the dick basically he'll uh you know
glue<00:05:40.320> you<00:05:40.470> to<00:05:40.620> the<00:05:40.710> ground<00:05:40.890> so<00:05:41.460> you<00:05:41.490> can't<00:05:41.850> move

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060

glue you to the ground so you can't move
and<00:05:42.330> that's<00:05:43.050> a<00:05:43.410> good<00:05:43.680> way<00:05:43.830> to<00:05:43.890> get<00:05:44.220> launched<00:05:45.210> by

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
and that's a good way to get launched by

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.810 
and that's a good way to get launched by
the<00:05:45.420> rocket<00:05:45.960> so<00:05:46.200> make<00:05:46.530> sure<00:05:46.640> it'll<00:05:47.640> basically

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
the rocket so make sure it'll basically

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.810 
the rocket so make sure it'll basically
to<00:05:48.120> flash<00:05:48.450> on<00:05:48.690> screen<00:05:49.110> and<00:05:49.560> it<00:05:50.010> will<00:05:50.070> you'll

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
to flash on screen and it will you'll

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.230 
to flash on screen and it will you'll
see<00:05:51.060> little<00:05:51.270> blue<00:05:52.020> you<00:05:52.740> know<00:05:53.030> loops<00:05:54.030> around

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 
obviously can't use it very free

only<00:06:39.710> the<00:06:40.710> other<00:06:41.160> trick<00:06:41.460> to<00:06:41.610> it<00:06:41.760> is<00:06:41.880> basically

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:42.420 
only the other trick to it is basically

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.500 
only the other trick to it is basically
if<00:06:43.020> you<00:06:43.620> spread<00:06:43.950> out<00:06:44.010> I've<00:06:44.340> heard<00:06:44.550> it<00:06:44.730> uses<00:06:45.090> it

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:45.510 
if you spread out I've heard it uses it

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.390 
if you spread out I've heard it uses it

applies the shackles less frequently
into<00:06:47.700> fewer<00:06:48.120> people<00:06:48.450> if<00:06:49.140> you're<00:06:49.290> stacked<00:06:49.680> I

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:49.980 
into fewer people if you're stacked I

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.830 
into fewer people if you're stacked I
have<00:06:50.070> seen<00:06:50.340> people<00:06:50.370> like<00:06:51.060> a<00:06:51.150> hooker<00:06:51.360> before
