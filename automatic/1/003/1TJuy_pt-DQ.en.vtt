00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
and also around the world really the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.380 
and also around the world really the
systems<00:01:26.340> are<00:01:26.460> not<00:01:26.580> working<00:01:26.610> around<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.210> world

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
systems are not working around the world

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.999 
systems are not working around the world
that<00:01:27.659> was<00:01:27.810> what<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.110> discussed<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.740> my<00:01:28.829> last

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
that was what I discussed in my last

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.490 
that was what I discussed in my last
video<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.210> can<00:01:30.360> use<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:30.630> Aquarian<00:01:31.140> energy

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
video so we can use this Aquarian energy

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.450 
video so we can use this Aquarian energy
to<00:01:31.860> innovate<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:33.409> troubleshoot<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.680> discuss

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
that way the Age of Aquarius and also

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.290 
that way the Age of Aquarius and also
it's<00:05:38.980> interesting<00:05:39.190> that<00:05:39.370> this<00:05:39.730> full<00:05:40.000> moon<00:05:40.180> in

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
it's interesting that this full moon in

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.390 
it's interesting that this full moon in
July<00:05:40.540> is<00:05:40.600> in<00:05:40.810> Aquarius<00:05:41.260> and<00:05:41.380> next<00:05:41.740> full<00:05:41.950> the

July is in Aquarius and next full the
next<00:05:42.610> full<00:05:42.730> moon<00:05:42.850> on<00:05:43.030> August<00:05:43.360> twentieth<00:05:43.660> is

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
next full moon on August twentieth is

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.270 
next full moon on August twentieth is
also<00:05:44.140> in<00:05:44.260> Aquarius<00:05:44.710> so<00:05:44.830> there's<00:05:45.010> a<00:05:45.070> lot<00:05:45.220> of
