to<00:01:48.210> get<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.540> kill<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.680> think<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.340> is

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
to get the kill and I think this is

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.910 
to get the kill and I think this is
about<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.939> end<00:01:51.090> in<00:01:51.750> two<00:01:52.170> shakes<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.710> lamb's

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
about to end in two shakes of a lamb's

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.740 
about to end in two shakes of a lamb's
tail<00:01:53.189> they're<00:01:53.399> good<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.850> know<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:54.329> boring<00:01:54.659> and

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
tail they're good I know it's boring and

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.120 
tail they're good I know it's boring and
everything<00:01:55.049> like<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.200> because<00:01:55.470> i<00:01:55.619> only<00:01:55.770> had

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
everything like that because i only had

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.289 
everything like that because i only had
the<00:01:56.250> one<00:01:56.369> killed<00:01:56.640> but<00:01:56.790> that's<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.149> whole

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
the one killed but that's the whole

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.609 
the one killed but that's the whole

the place so we're going to do this one
more<00:03:29.490> time<00:03:30.320> I<00:03:31.320> think<00:03:31.860> this<00:03:31.920> third<00:03:32.220> round<00:03:32.459> same

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
more time I think this third round same

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.250 
more time I think this third round same

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
game this is the same game so I'm just

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.920 
game this is the same game so I'm just
showing<00:03:34.380> you<00:03:34.530> that<00:03:34.709> I<00:03:34.770> do<00:03:34.890> switch<00:03:35.250> it<00:03:35.400> up<00:03:35.930> if

even this is a mistake that I'm making

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.810 
even this is a mistake that I'm making
right<00:03:39.959> here<00:03:40.170> though<00:03:40.320> okay<00:03:40.650> same<00:03:41.010> thing<00:03:41.040> we're

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
right here though okay same thing we're

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.390 
right here though okay same thing we're
going<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.030> throw<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.240> flash<00:03:42.890> but<00:03:43.890> I<00:03:43.920> return

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
going to throw that flash but I return

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.400 
going to throw that flash but I return
to<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:44.730> same<00:03:44.910> spot<00:03:45.090> normally<00:03:45.900> I<00:03:45.930> would<00:03:46.230> say

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
to the same spot normally I would say

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.500 
to the same spot normally I would say
don't<00:03:46.650> do<00:03:46.980> that<00:03:47.190> once<00:03:47.520> you<00:03:47.730> make<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.940> kill<00:03:48.330> from

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
don't do that once you make a kill from

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.630 
don't do that once you make a kill from
a<00:03:48.660> certain<00:03:48.989> position<00:03:49.290> that<00:03:50.010> position<00:03:50.459> then

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
a certain position that position then

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.460 
a certain position that position then
becomes<00:03:50.970> compromised<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.720> I<00:03:51.780> think<00:03:51.989> that's

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
becomes compromised and I think that's

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.449 
becomes compromised and I think that's
actually<00:03:52.680> why<00:03:52.920> I'm<00:03:53.010> showing<00:03:53.190> you<00:03:53.340> this

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
actually why I'm showing you this

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.220 
actually why I'm showing you this
exactly<00:03:54.060> right<00:03:54.180> there<00:03:54.420> so<00:03:54.780> these<00:03:54.870> people

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
exactly right there so these people

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.949 
exactly right there so these people
become<00:03:55.530> aware<00:03:55.800> they<00:03:56.310> become<00:03:56.610> you<00:03:57.390> know<00:03:57.540> like

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
become aware they become you know like

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.810 
become aware they become you know like
this<00:03:58.170> guy's<00:03:58.350> just<00:03:58.620> gotta<00:03:59.160> sites<00:03:59.459> up<00:03:59.640> any

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
this guy's just gotta sites up any

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.490 
this guy's just gotta sites up any
slowly<00:04:00.270> creeping<00:04:00.600> out<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:00.989> that<00:04:01.110> was<00:04:01.260> an

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
slowly creeping out and that was an

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.530 
slowly creeping out and that was an
error<00:04:01.890> on<00:04:02.010> my<00:04:02.370> part<00:04:02.400> it<00:04:02.850> was<00:04:03.030> really<00:04:03.270> dumb<00:04:03.510> of

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
error on my part it was really dumb of

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.380 
error on my part it was really dumb of
me<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:03.840> do<00:04:04.020> that<00:04:04.070> it's<00:04:05.070> very<00:04:05.550> important<00:04:06.300> that

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
me to do that it's very important that

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.390 
me to do that it's very important that
you<00:04:06.600> move<00:04:07.080> after<00:04:07.410> you<00:04:07.620> make<00:04:07.770> it<00:04:07.920> kill<00:04:08.070> from<00:04:08.250> one

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
you move after you make it kill from one

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.590 
you move after you make it kill from one
of<00:04:08.520> these<00:04:08.610> positions<00:04:09.090> because<00:04:09.390> there's

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
of these positions because there's

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.540 
of these positions because there's
static<00:04:09.930> because<00:04:10.560> you're<00:04:10.680> not<00:04:10.770> dynamic<00:04:11.400> you're

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
static because you're not dynamic you're

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.800 
static because you're not dynamic you're
not<00:04:11.670> rushing<00:04:12.000> around<00:04:12.209> and<00:04:12.510> doing<00:04:12.630> all<00:04:12.780> sorts

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
not rushing around and doing all sorts

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.780 
not rushing around and doing all sorts
of<00:04:13.110> stuff<00:04:13.170> so<00:04:13.800> when<00:04:13.950> you<00:04:14.070> do<00:04:14.250> that<00:04:14.430> and<00:04:14.610> by<00:04:14.730> the

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
of stuff so when you do that and by the

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.190 
of stuff so when you do that and by the

through the wall they're gonna know that
you're<00:04:33.090> actually<00:04:33.240> I<00:04:33.659> guess<00:04:33.900> there<00:04:34.199> for<00:04:34.469> a<00:04:34.499> lack

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
you're actually I guess there for a lack

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.529 
you're actually I guess there for a lack
of<00:04:34.680> better<00:04:34.860> word<00:04:35.159> but<00:04:35.370> it<00:04:35.520> still<00:04:35.879> does<00:04:36.360> not

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
of better word but it still does not

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.149 
of better word but it still does not
help<00:04:36.779> them<00:04:36.990> even<00:04:37.349> if<00:04:37.469> they<00:04:37.620> know<00:04:37.889> you're<00:04:38.129> there

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:38.159 
help them even if they know you're there

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:40.100 
help them even if they know you're there
it<00:04:38.580> puts<00:04:39.029> them<00:04:39.150> at<00:04:39.240> a<00:04:39.270> disadvantage<00:04:39.509> you<00:04:39.960> can

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
it puts them at a disadvantage you can

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.510 
it puts them at a disadvantage you can
also<00:04:40.259> look<00:04:40.590> through<00:04:40.650> that<00:04:40.830> window<00:04:40.949> see<00:04:41.400> the

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
also look through that window see the

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.760 
also look through that window see the
window<00:04:41.819> that's<00:04:42.029> right<00:04:42.270> to<00:04:42.419> my<00:04:42.539> left<00:04:42.569> just<00:04:43.529> left

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
window that's right to my left just left

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.619 
window that's right to my left just left
in<00:04:43.919> my<00:04:44.039> radical<00:04:44.610> there<00:04:44.909> you<00:04:45.270> can<00:04:45.389> actually

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:45.629 
in my radical there you can actually

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:47.600 
in my radical there you can actually
look<00:04:45.749> right<00:04:46.020> through<00:04:46.050> that<00:04:46.319> glass<00:04:46.710> and<00:04:47.009> kill

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
look right through that glass and kill

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.309 
look right through that glass and kill
people<00:04:47.759> through<00:04:48.509> there<00:04:48.719> before<00:04:49.020> they<00:04:49.139> can

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:49.319 
people through there before they can

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:51.350 
people through there before they can
even<00:04:49.349> spot<00:04:49.860> you<00:04:50.099> it's<00:04:50.520> not<00:04:50.729> more<00:04:50.999> of<00:04:51.090> a<00:04:51.150> head

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
even spot you it's not more of a head

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.899 
even spot you it's not more of a head
glitch<00:04:51.599> it's<00:04:51.810> more<00:04:52.050> of<00:04:52.169> a<00:04:52.340> tollbooth<00:04:53.340> Willy

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:53.909 
glitch it's more of a tollbooth Willy

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:56.390 
glitch it's more of a tollbooth Willy
glitch<00:04:54.330> because<00:04:54.930> I<00:04:55.199> have<00:04:55.560> no<00:04:55.770> idea<00:04:55.860> why<00:04:56.219> he's

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
glitch because I have no idea why he's

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.249 
glitch because I have no idea why he's
in<00:04:56.430> there<00:04:56.699> so<00:04:57.330> I<00:04:57.360> mean<00:04:57.599> I<00:04:57.629> think<00:04:57.719> this<00:04:57.990> is<00:04:58.139> the

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 
in there so I mean I think this is the

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:01.070 
in there so I mean I think this is the
end<00:04:58.289> of<00:04:58.889> the<00:04:58.979> round<00:04:59.129> here<00:04:59.490> and<00:04:59.639> we<00:05:00.629> maybe<00:05:00.840> do

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
end of the round here and we maybe do

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.740 
end of the round here and we maybe do
one<00:05:01.110> more<00:05:01.590> round<00:05:01.889> after<00:05:02.310> this<00:05:02.479> so<00:05:03.479> I'll<00:05:03.569> show

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
one more round after this so I'll show

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.290 
one more round after this so I'll show
you<00:05:03.810> a<00:05:03.900> member<00:05:04.259> this<00:05:04.349> is<00:05:04.529> a<00:05:04.560> different<00:05:04.860> game

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
you a member this is a different game

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.480 
you a member this is a different game
and<00:05:06.300> I<00:05:06.479> believe<00:05:06.750> I<00:05:06.779> return<00:05:07.229> to<00:05:07.259> the<00:05:07.500> same<00:05:07.889> place

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
and I believe I return to the same place

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.999 
and I believe I return to the same place
in<00:05:08.879> this<00:05:09.029> one<00:05:09.300> this<00:05:10.139> was<00:05:10.319> an<00:05:10.439> earlier<00:05:10.889> game

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:11.009 
in this one this was an earlier game

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:13.879 
in this one this was an earlier game
here<00:05:11.669> again<00:05:12.150> not<00:05:12.360> smart<00:05:12.870> you<00:05:13.169> can<00:05:13.469> do<00:05:13.680> it<00:05:13.800> in

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
here again not smart you can do it in

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.409 
here again not smart you can do it in
the<00:05:14.009> other<00:05:14.219> place<00:05:14.400> there<00:05:14.699> although<00:05:14.849> I<00:05:15.000> in

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
the other place there although I in

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.149 
the other place there although I in
almost<00:05:15.810> any<00:05:16.080> other<00:05:16.289> search<00:05:16.560> and<00:05:16.680> destroy<00:05:16.800> game

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:17.159 
almost any other search and destroy game

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:19.550 
almost any other search and destroy game
i<00:05:17.310> would<00:05:17.580> say<00:05:17.759> once<00:05:18.270> you<00:05:18.449> make<00:05:18.629> a<00:05:18.659> kill<00:05:19.020> that

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
i would say once you make a kill that

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.469 
i would say once you make a kill that
position<00:05:20.009> has<00:05:20.039> then<00:05:20.430> been<00:05:20.460> compromised<00:05:21.240> you

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
position has then been compromised you

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.929 
position has then been compromised you
need<00:05:21.750> to<00:05:21.900> move<00:05:22.080> because<00:05:22.610> someone<00:05:23.610> will<00:05:23.789> look

00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:23.939 
need to move because someone will look

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:25.579 
need to move because someone will look
for<00:05:24.150> you<00:05:24.180> i<00:05:24.270> mean<00:05:24.599> if<00:05:24.839> you<00:05:25.050> make<00:05:25.259> it<00:05:25.289> and<00:05:25.499> they

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:25.589 
for you i mean if you make it and they

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:26.809 
for you i mean if you make it and they
watch<00:05:25.740> the<00:05:25.949> killcam<00:05:26.339> they're<00:05:26.460> going<00:05:26.580> like<00:05:26.699> all

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:26.819 
watch the killcam they're going like all

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:28.399 
watch the killcam they're going like all
right<00:05:26.969> I'm<00:05:27.210> going<00:05:27.449> to<00:05:27.509> anticipate<00:05:28.199> that

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:28.409 
right I'm going to anticipate that

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:29.959 
right I'm going to anticipate that
you're<00:05:28.919> either<00:05:29.039> going<00:05:29.279> to<00:05:29.370> get<00:05:29.490> stunned<00:05:29.849> a

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:29.969 
you're either going to get stunned a

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:31.700 
you're either going to get stunned a
crap<00:05:30.210> or<00:05:30.479> they're<00:05:30.839> going<00:05:30.930> to<00:05:30.990> rush<00:05:31.229> you<00:05:31.379> before

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
crap or they're going to rush you before

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:32.950 
crap or they're going to rush you before
you<00:05:31.800> even<00:05:31.830> know<00:05:32.099> what<00:05:32.219> the<00:05:32.310> hell<00:05:32.430> is<00:05:32.550> going<00:05:32.789> on

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
you even know what the hell is going on

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.899 
you even know what the hell is going on
the<00:05:33.960> only<00:05:34.169> reason<00:05:34.289> why<00:05:34.500> I<00:05:34.529> didn't<00:05:34.919> throw<00:05:35.069> stuns

00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:35.909 
the only reason why I didn't throw stuns

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:37.670 
the only reason why I didn't throw stuns
there's<00:05:36.240> because<00:05:36.449> two<00:05:36.900> of<00:05:36.930> my<00:05:37.050> teammates<00:05:37.469> were

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
there's because two of my teammates were

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.559 
there's because two of my teammates were
there<00:05:37.860> and<00:05:38.039> they<00:05:38.159> were<00:05:38.219> chucking<00:05:38.729> chucking

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:39.569 
there and they were chucking chucking

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:41.779 
there and they were chucking chucking
bombs<00:05:39.839> so<00:05:40.680> there's<00:05:40.979> no<00:05:41.039> need<00:05:41.159> for<00:05:41.339> me<00:05:41.490> to<00:05:41.580> waste

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789 
bombs so there's no need for me to waste

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:44.839 
bombs so there's no need for me to waste

00:05:58.369 --> 00:05:58.379 
amazing sight line right through that

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:01.070 
amazing sight line right through that
glass<00:05:58.680> and<00:05:59.039> i'm<00:05:59.310> pretty<00:05:59.759> sure<00:06:00.240> that<00:06:00.569> i<00:06:00.599> use<00:06:00.899> it

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
glass and i'm pretty sure that i use it

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.679 
glass and i'm pretty sure that i use it
in<00:06:01.199> this<00:06:01.349> case<00:06:01.589> here<00:06:02.089> so<00:06:03.089> now<00:06:03.210> you<00:06:03.270> got<00:06:03.449> to<00:06:03.569> be

00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:03.689 
in this case here so now you got to be

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:05.450 
in this case here so now you got to be
patient<00:06:04.379> because<00:06:04.830> it's<00:06:05.099> all<00:06:05.250> about

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
patient because it's all about

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.639 
patient because it's all about
positioning<00:06:05.759> and<00:06:06.300> there<00:06:06.449> you<00:06:06.539> go<00:06:06.599> even<00:06:07.439> with

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:07.649 
positioning and there you go even with

00:06:07.649 --> 00:06:09.469 
positioning and there you go even with
that<00:06:07.889> even<00:06:08.759> though<00:06:08.849> they<00:06:09.000> know<00:06:09.180> you<00:06:09.240> there

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 
that even though they know you there

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:10.369
