00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.849
 Hello dear friends 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:14.070
 I will write down numerous requests today 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:17.520
 and rightly a little video radik and panov 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.560
 Well, we are not xev to taste pretty 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.910
 after a long time and most of its 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.539
 time i spend in competence games this 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.330
 mean that I have a team and we 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:33.809
 we play a lot together so what if 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:39.050
 see we profile I played enough 150 and 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:43.200
 hormones and probably understand something 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:49.700
 about this character let's go to 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:52.170
 Store I write here a lot and go 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.510
 let 's take a little bit of her talent 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.809
 which catching on offered 4 talents 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.539
 one of them riga is not on the shaman 2 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.149
 increases range by increasing already 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.720
 kushki by 20 30 when you get out 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.119
 Inviz and not only if for and 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.549
 a second after but not pay for it 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.690
 attention and offer to increase the apollo 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:19.250
 4 make it 4 seconds 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:21.530
 in disrupting horse racing I choose ambush site and but 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.230
 I'll start as much damage as possible for 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.220
 try still vanshota someone on 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.500
 fourth caught 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.030
 There are two wonderful plants that we 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.910
 We will consider this kazarin around the world 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.980
 and actually or us on the right deals 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.260
 very much damage power shop 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.360
 I personally buy kazarin goods 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.670
 but sensible countries from this front 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.190
 have to play 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.190
 less aggressively you don't want to lose 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.410
 with still in the game but if you don't like 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.260
 This is an-2 and because swept edwin I 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.720
 I do not think that it will be colossal 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.510
 difference 2 4 left you put sylven it 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.960
 much stronger meaning does not give you 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.030
 of choice 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.400
 as the developers want new 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.880
 it was precisely the hero of which vanshot us 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.610
 offer one talent to find armor he 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.420
 gives two hundred fifty percent damage from 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.760
 Your auto attacks but slower beat but 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.840
 at the expense of this particular talent you can 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.650
 quickly 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.220
 almost every enemy 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.030
 cary 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.130
 you go out let know that is a bit 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.260
 then attack and 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.209
 and measles flies half block to on 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.239
 It remains to give the tower and and try 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:35.180
 hook the enemy ultima this flock on 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.940
 account this or asked a lot of 20 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.020
 nasty it is prestigious 43 cutter triplet 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:44.690
 about very controversial ults and many people of his 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:48.140
 don't take it from the other side with this 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.640
 plan there you can make minus 1 and the very 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.310
 is there a lot to be very strong 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.680
 but still my choice falls on the pressure 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:59.130
 strike it does good sinful damage and 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.910
 support team 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:07.140
 due to the fact that global that is to them 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.850
 you can beat all over the map after 3 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.160
 seconds 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.710
 certain damage is pretty good 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:19.350

 Bek's speeds for a couple of genes 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.380
