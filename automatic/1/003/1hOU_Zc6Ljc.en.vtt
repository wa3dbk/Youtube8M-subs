it's<00:00:48.780> one<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.079> top<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.739> range<00:00:49.890> as

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
it's one of the top of the range as

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.060 
it's one of the top of the range as
system-on-chips<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:52.079> get<00:00:52.230> right<00:00:52.410> now<00:00:52.440> so

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
system-on-chips you can get right now so

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.240 
system-on-chips you can get right now so
it's<00:00:53.190> got<00:00:53.340> awesome<00:00:53.699> graphics<00:00:54.059> as<00:00:54.180> well<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:55.250> so

display here now you guys can't see it
but<00:01:18.810> there<00:01:19.110> are<00:01:19.229> actually<00:01:19.500> free<00:01:19.740> capacitive

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
but there are actually free capacitive

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.830 
but there are actually free capacitive
buttons<00:01:20.250> below<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.060> screen<00:01:21.240> but<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.509> think

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
buttons below the screen but I think

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.450

about a month's time so check it out oh
by<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.580> way<00:02:27.900> since<00:02:28.900> we<00:02:29.019> have<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.470> other<00:02:29.620> big

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
by the way since we have the other big

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.800 
by the way since we have the other big
phones<00:02:30.310> here<00:02:30.610> you<00:02:30.700> can<00:02:30.850> see<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.480> phone<00:02:31.660> it's

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
phones here you can see the phone it's

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.620 
phones here you can see the phone it's
defined<00:02:32.560> five<00:02:32.769> is<00:02:33.640> at<00:02:34.030> eight<00:02:34.269> point<00:02:34.510> eight

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
defined five is at eight point eight

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.259 
defined five is at eight point eight
millimeters<00:02:35.170> thick<00:02:35.470> so<00:02:36.070> if<00:02:36.400> you<00:02:36.580> so<00:02:36.940> we've<00:02:37.090> got

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
millimeters thick so if you so we've got

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.509 
millimeters thick so if you so we've got
the<00:02:37.420> open<00:02:37.930> finder<00:02:38.170> on<00:02:38.320> right<00:02:39.040> here<00:02:39.250> so

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
the open finder on right here so

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.470 
the open finder on right here so
obviously<00:02:40.390> it's<00:02:40.570> not<00:02:40.950> quite<00:02:41.950> as<00:02:42.250> thin<00:02:42.790> as<00:02:43.180> its

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
obviously it's not quite as thin as its

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.170 
obviously it's not quite as thin as its
predecessor<00:02:43.660> but<00:02:44.260> it's<00:02:45.100> certainly<00:02:45.489> pretty

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
predecessor but it's certainly pretty

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.720 
predecessor but it's certainly pretty
much<00:02:46.450> thinner<00:02:46.840> than<00:02:47.200> what's<00:02:47.950> about<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.370> same

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
much thinner than what's about the same

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.560 
much thinner than what's about the same
as<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.510> xiaomi<00:02:50.019> phone<00:02:50.350> too<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:51.120> then<00:02:52.120> there's

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
as the xiaomi phone too and then there's

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.400 
as the xiaomi phone too and then there's
the<00:02:52.840> major<00:02:53.440> mx2<00:02:54.040> there<00:02:54.400> so<00:02:55.000> for<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:55.840> quad<00:02:56.200> core

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
the major mx2 there so for a quad core

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.060 
the major mx2 there so for a quad core
phone<00:02:56.739> a<00:02:56.910> 55<00:02:57.910> inch<00:02:57.940> device<00:02:58.600> it<00:02:59.110> is<00:02:59.350> it's<00:02:59.860> done<00:03:00.040> a

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
phone a 55 inch device it is it's done a

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.630 
phone a 55 inch device it is it's done a
pretty<00:03:00.250> good<00:03:00.370> job<00:03:00.579> at<00:03:01.120> keeping<00:03:01.209> its<00:03:01.750> slim

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
pretty good job at keeping its slim

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.180 
pretty good job at keeping its slim
obviously<00:03:03.640> a<00:03:03.670> lot<00:03:03.850> of<00:03:03.970> these<00:03:04.060> features<00:03:04.360> are

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
obviously a lot of these features are

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.199 
obviously a lot of these features are
software<00:03:06.190> centric<00:03:06.640> so<00:03:06.880> we<00:03:07.180> shall<00:03:08.940> wait<00:03:09.940> till

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
software centric so we shall wait till

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.060 
software centric so we shall wait till
we<00:03:10.329> get<00:03:10.480> hold<00:03:10.690> of<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:10.900> review<00:03:11.290> unit<00:03:11.470> at<00:03:11.739> some

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
we get hold of a review unit at some

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.229 
we get hold of a review unit at some
point<00:03:12.340> in<00:03:13.150> a<00:03:13.750> month's<00:03:14.049> time<00:03:14.430> so<00:03:15.430> basically

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
point in a month's time so basically

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.019 
point in a month's time so basically
stay<00:03:16.630> tuned
