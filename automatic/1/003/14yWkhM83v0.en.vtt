 the pinnacle because it's going to be 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.309
 rotten but it was a good secondhand 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.109
 to announce that at home front 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.180

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.769
 2 I have not tested video on the channel 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.540
 that's my case what broke so I 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.140
 was saying before my helmet broke 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.300
 yes because the break so if there 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.629
 helmet designers send some 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.320
 helmets 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.730
 no I'm kidding short you know I 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.649
 I am not very good at versions 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.059
 official I'm bored on the 1 and 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.230

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.760
 chain because I got bored yes 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.010
 yes it may sound confusing but 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.719
 yes I got bored and I take more 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.270
 from fun to recques on versions 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.680
 what the fuck fan versions made that 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.739
 on official versions it's a 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.180
 little weird I assured you but I 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.580
 have more fun with what the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.640
 fuck was fan made the 3g makes a video 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.479
 disappointed I liked it was funny I had 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.270
 fear etc 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.340
 he was really flipper but it's me 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.720
 do not want to redo videos 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.670
 on it I have not even finished one for 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.140
 tell you that would have even had a 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.640
 conversation it's ross recently 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.229
 on twitter and he said the same 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.659
 thing as well as the official versions 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.400
 it was the five nights in global there 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.049
 was bored on actually they are 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.299
 bored now it's true that at one 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.409
 story too late yesterday that I the 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.579
 designs are a lot of people who 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.979
 say yes to the rieffel you inquire 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.750

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.799
 I do not know the story at all 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.840

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.380
 points to eghezÃ©e good I still expect 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.790
 at worst on the points to eghezÃ©e because 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.820
 that it's always the carnage of all 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.620
 way 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.090

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.740
 graphics as mini games in 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.870
