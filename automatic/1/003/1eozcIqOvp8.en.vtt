00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.170 
common ground then you can create
uncommon<00:01:53.820> results<00:01:54.680> so<00:01:55.680> how<00:01:56.460> do<00:01:56.520> we<00:01:56.700> make<00:01:56.909> the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
uncommon results so how do we make the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.569 
uncommon results so how do we make the
connections<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.960> matter<00:01:58.530> well<00:01:59.130> we<00:01:59.340> have<00:01:59.460> to

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
connections that matter well we have to

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.429 
connections that matter well we have to
start<00:01:59.880> with<00:02:00.090> what<00:02:00.420> investors<00:02:00.990> are<00:02:01.110> thinking

start with what investors are thinking

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.399 
start with what investors are thinking
