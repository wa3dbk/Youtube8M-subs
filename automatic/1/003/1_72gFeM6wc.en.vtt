00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.870 
collection but I just think in my
previous<00:00:10.469> video<00:00:10.889> my<00:00:11.099> voice<00:00:11.250> sounded<00:00:11.759> very

previous video my voice sounded very

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.079

stupid and I didn't like it so I decided
to<00:00:15.299> make<00:00:15.509> it<00:00:15.540> but<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.470> isn't<00:00:16.949> actually<00:00:17.460> a

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
to make it but it isn't actually a

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.269 
to make it but it isn't actually a
remake<00:00:17.880> it's<00:00:18.260> another<00:00:19.260> video<00:00:19.680> was<00:00:19.920> made<00:00:20.070> about
