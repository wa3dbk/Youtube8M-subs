spins<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:12.700> deer<00:04:13.700> her<00:04:13.880> head<00:04:14.210> here<00:04:18.609> trick<00:04:19.609> is<00:04:19.760> to

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
spins and deer her head here trick is to

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.490 
spins and deer her head here trick is to
kind<00:04:20.120> of<00:04:20.180> measure<00:04:20.420> this<00:04:20.750> kind<00:04:21.109> of<00:04:21.230> how<00:04:21.320> much

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
kind of measure this kind of how much

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.810 
kind of measure this kind of how much
you<00:04:21.650> want<00:04:21.920> and<00:04:22.280> then<00:04:22.430> I'm<00:04:22.520> gonna<00:04:22.640> trim<00:04:23.090> it<00:04:24.820> how

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
you want and then I'm gonna trim it how

you want and then I'm gonna trim it how
much<00:04:26.030> I'm<00:04:26.180> gonna<00:04:26.270> use

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.330 

so<00:04:33.300> usually<00:04:33.540> due<00:04:33.840> to<00:04:34.110> loose<00:04:34.440> wraps<00:04:34.830> then<00:04:35.160> just

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
so usually due to loose wraps then just

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:47.210 
so usually due to loose wraps then just
spin<00:04:35.640> it<00:04:35.760> right<00:04:35.940> around<00:04:45.800> you<00:04:46.800> use<00:04:47.040> your

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
spin it right around you use your

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.510 
spin it right around you use your
thumbnail<00:04:47.520> that<00:04:48.860> keep<00:04:49.860> it<00:04:49.980> a<00:04:50.040> little<00:04:50.070> tighter

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
thumbnail that keep it a little tighter

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.130 
thumbnail that keep it a little tighter
there<00:04:50.880> I<00:04:51.170> can<00:04:52.170> add<00:04:52.320> more<00:04:52.790> or<00:04:53.790> have<00:04:54.000> less<00:04:54.450> I<00:04:54.900> kind
