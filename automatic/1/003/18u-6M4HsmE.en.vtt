00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.030
 hello to all that so welcome to a 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.910
 very quick video 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.589
 in this video I'm going to tell you something very 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.900
 special during the past week 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:15.549
 We hold a contest in conjunction with 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.039
 fanatics vineyard of the sea that is a store 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.320
 very nice prints of T-shirts 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.029
 design also the point is that we 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.339
 we form an alliance is a time ago 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.230
 and I was giving away a shirt whose 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:27.970
 design I also used for a long time 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.949
 and you liked it a lot and I 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.990
 they made it known through facebook 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.059
 through the install that he liked 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.160
 very much that design that was very like that 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.530
 that we finally decided with the guys 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.050
 of healthy tics to give you a 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.550
 unisex t-shirt obviously so that some 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.829
 of you could win this winery 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.649
 with this beautiful design I made this 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:51.100
 draw for my surprise we had more than 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.989
 300 shared in the image which is 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.030
 beautiful because I did not think I was going to 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:59.360
 so many people were going to share the photo 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.579
 more than 300 not now I do not remember 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.469
 ok but the air but the list was more 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.080
 of 300 what happens there are many people 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.600
 who did not read the instructions well 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.369
 he clearly said that they had to put the 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.430
 publication in public mode so that 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.710
 You could see that they had shared it 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.200
 then of those 500 and so shared 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.310
 there were only 300 that I could see so 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.390
 thank you very much to all who 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.100
 they understood 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.260
 the contest the bases of the contest 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.580
 also obviously ask for many 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.610
 apologize to all the people from abroad 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.030
 but it is very difficult for me to send a 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.070
 t-shirt to mexico to colombia wherever 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.170
 you are and I want to win from 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.180
 true at some point maybe we could 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.610
 make a more international contest but 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.680
 for now only for the people of 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.940
 chivas I will tell you a bit how 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.229
 do the contest basically I 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.610
 I learned until after I did the 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.830
 contest that there is an application 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.470
 to make contests which does not occupy it 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.090
 so I did it the old- fashioned way I took 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.119
 all the people who had shared 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.220
 the publication I put all his name in 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.840
 a list and to each name you assign a 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.460
 number the people who had most 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.869
 shared were more likely to 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.970
 win because they had more or less 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.100
 assigned to his name and in total the 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.769
 list gave me a total so that the 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.500
 redundancy of 300 people who had 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.390
 shared 300 shared posts 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.660
 there were people who shared the image in 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.610
 20 bs 15 bs 5 is going to increase the 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.230
 chances of winning thanks to that 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.610
 they were more likely to have their 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.700
 name would come out 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.100
 of those selected to win the 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.840
 T-shirt then I took a page that many 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.540
 they know that grabbing a point now 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.030
 I put the number 1 to 300 and both have 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.520
 the publications and generate three numbers 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.350
 of which two went to the water but 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.960
 I'm going to tell you why I think so 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.910
 he revealed them with an almost so is because in 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.650
 It really sucks to get out on the water in 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.330
 another course I say it because without evidence 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.650
 I have never won anything in my life 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.960
 and I'm always the number to the water and the 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.550
 last person that came out is a boy 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.400
 as I told you on facebook is a 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.890
 very lucky man a boy who won 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.330
 this shirt whose name I will say to 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.680
 continuation so please double roll 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.680
 of drums to the public present 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:20.269
