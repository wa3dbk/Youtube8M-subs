what we have but right off the bat this

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.060 
what we have but right off the bat this
case<00:00:53.940> itself<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.780> actually<00:00:54.990> quite<00:00:55.410> thin<00:00:55.830> for

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
case itself is actually quite thin for

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.650 
case itself is actually quite thin for
the<00:00:56.160> amount<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.490> protection<00:00:56.700> that<00:00:57.060> it<00:00:57.270> offers

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
the amount of protection that it offers

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.830

I roll anyway let's go ahead and take a
closer<00:01:25.979> look<00:01:26.130> at<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.429> case<00:01:26.609> by<00:01:26.969> taking<00:01:27.479> it

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
closer look at the case by taking it

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.020 
closer look at the case by taking it
apart<00:01:27.840> first<00:01:28.280> so<00:01:29.280> we<00:01:29.399> have<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.700> front

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
apart first so we have this front

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.389 
apart first so we have this front
portion<00:01:30.659> Attell<00:01:31.439> together<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.069> rest<00:01:32.280> of

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
portion Attell together to the rest of

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.910 
portion Attell together to the rest of
the<00:01:32.490> case<00:01:32.700> thanks<00:01:32.969> to<00:01:33.179> these<00:01:33.329> four<00:01:33.749> as<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
the case thanks to these four as the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.879 
the case thanks to these four as the
list<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.249> calls<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.700> active<00:01:36.420> latches<00:01:36.929> so<00:01:37.710> this

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:37.889 
list it calls it active latches so this

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:39.349 
list it calls it active latches so this
keeps<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.310> front<00:01:38.579> portion<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.179> case

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:39.359 
keeps the front portion of the case

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:42.889 
keeps the front portion of the case
latched<00:01:39.960> on<00:01:40.289> to<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.679> actual<00:01:41.549> case<00:01:42.030> itself<00:01:42.450> and

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
latched on to the actual case itself and

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.230 
latched on to the actual case itself and

you'll then be able to start using

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.110 
you'll then be able to start using
everything<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.980> it<00:02:36.400> could<00:02:36.580> be<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.730> little<00:02:36.940> bit

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
everything so it could be a little bit

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.310 
everything so it could be a little bit
tricky<00:02:37.360> but<00:02:37.630> you<00:02:37.750> just<00:02:37.870> need<00:02:38.050> to<00:02:38.140> make<00:02:38.260> sure

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
tricky but you just need to make sure

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.190 
tricky but you just need to make sure
that<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.740> four<00:02:39.010> corners<00:02:39.459> are<00:02:39.900> snapped<00:02:40.900> into

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
that the four corners are snapped into

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.260 
that the four corners are snapped into
place<00:02:41.380> like<00:02:43.319> so<00:02:44.319> and<00:02:45.040> this<00:02:45.700> is<00:02:45.850> what<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.090> case

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
place like so and this is what the case

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.790 
place like so and this is what the case
looks<00:02:46.540> like<00:02:46.720> once<00:02:46.930> it's<00:02:47.080> installed<00:02:47.170> onto<00:02:47.590> your

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
looks like once it's installed onto your

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
iphone 5 from the side it actually

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.620 
iphone 5 from the side it actually
doesn't<00:02:50.800> add<00:02:51.070> too<00:02:51.340> much<00:02:51.519> bulk<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.150> with<00:02:52.450> this

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
doesn't add too much bulk and with this

about<00:03:30.370> fine<00:03:31.260> moving<00:03:32.260> towards<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.650> top<00:03:32.920> we

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
about fine moving towards the top we

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.250 
about fine moving towards the top we
have<00:03:33.280> a<00:03:33.400> power<00:03:33.790> button<00:03:34.000> nub<00:03:34.420> it<00:03:34.900> takes<00:03:35.170> a

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
have a power button nub it takes a

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.080 
have a power button nub it takes a
little<00:03:35.380> bit<00:03:35.530> of<00:03:35.590> extra<00:03:35.769> effort<00:03:36.489> to<00:03:36.640> press<00:03:36.880> but

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
little bit of extra effort to press but

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.190 
little bit of extra effort to press but
you'd<00:03:37.209> still<00:03:37.239> get<00:03:37.690> a<00:03:37.750> fair<00:03:37.959> amount<00:03:38.049> of

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
you'd still get a fair amount of

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.949 
you'd still get a fair amount of
feedback<00:03:38.380> when<00:03:38.709> pressing<00:03:38.950> it<00:03:39.810> along<00:03:40.810> the

there's not too much room surrounding
the<00:03:51.100> headphone<00:03:51.400> jack<00:03:51.640> so<00:03:51.670> if<00:03:51.970> you<00:03:52.060> use

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
might encounter there's also the

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.229 
might encounter there's also the
ballistic<00:04:08.170> logo<00:04:08.500> the<00:04:09.370> black<00:04:09.609> portion<00:04:10.030> here<00:04:10.209> is

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
ballistic logo the black portion here is

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.050 
ballistic logo the black portion here is
actually<00:04:10.480> black<00:04:11.470> and<00:04:11.769> glossy<00:04:12.160> so<00:04:12.670> this<00:04:12.880> will

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
actually black and glossy so this will

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.870 
actually black and glossy so this will
attract<00:04:13.480> scratches<00:04:14.290> quite<00:04:14.680> well<00:04:14.920> as<00:04:15.190> well<00:04:15.670> as

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
attract scratches quite well as well as

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.330 
attract scratches quite well as well as
fingerprints<00:04:16.539> and<00:04:16.780> on<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.829> bottom<00:04:17.950> as<00:04:18.250> you

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
fingerprints and on the bottom as you

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.539 
fingerprints and on the bottom as you
can<00:04:18.459> tell<00:04:18.640> we<00:04:18.820> have<00:04:18.970> a<00:04:19.209> little<00:04:19.570> kickstand

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
can tell we have a little kickstand

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.520 
can tell we have a little kickstand
this<00:04:21.060> actually<00:04:21.269> worries<00:04:21.720> me<00:04:21.870> a<00:04:21.900> little<00:04:22.199> bit<00:04:22.379> in

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
this actually worries me a little bit in

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.110 
this actually worries me a little bit in
terms<00:04:22.650> of<00:04:22.860> longevity<00:04:23.099> because<00:04:23.819> this<00:04:24.000> is

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
terms of longevity because this is

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.029 
terms of longevity because this is
basically<00:04:24.599> a<00:04:24.629> thin<00:04:24.750> piece<00:04:25.169> of<00:04:25.229> plastic<00:04:25.409> that

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
basically a thin piece of plastic that

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:30.320 
basically a thin piece of plastic that
comes<00:04:26.789> out<00:04:26.970> from<00:04:27.120> your<00:04:27.319> back<00:04:28.319> of<00:04:28.500> your<00:04:28.650> case<00:04:29.330> to

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
comes out from your back of your case to

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.570 
comes out from your back of your case to
extend<00:04:30.750> it<00:04:30.870> all<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.530> way<00:04:31.650> just<00:04:31.680> have<00:04:32.159> to<00:04:32.280> pull

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
extend it all the way just have to pull

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.779 
extend it all the way just have to pull
it<00:04:32.669> back<00:04:32.819> until<00:04:33.030> it<00:04:33.240> snaps<00:04:33.419> into<00:04:33.629> place<00:04:33.810> like

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
it back until it snaps into place like

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.430 
it back until it snaps into place like
that<00:04:35.789> if<00:04:36.389> you're<00:04:36.629> able<00:04:36.750> to<00:04:36.990> use<00:04:37.139> it<00:04:37.169> in

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
that if you're able to use it in

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.740 
that if you're able to use it in
landscape<00:04:37.740> orientation<00:04:38.099> like<00:04:38.789> so<00:04:39.030> landscape

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
landscape orientation like so landscape

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.550 
landscape orientation like so landscape
right<00:04:40.169> and<00:04:40.699> you<00:04:41.699> could<00:04:41.819> also<00:04:41.970> use<00:04:42.090> it<00:04:42.360> in

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
right and you could also use it in

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.450 
right and you could also use it in
portrait<00:04:43.560> if<00:04:43.680> you<00:04:43.770> would<00:04:43.889> like<00:04:44.039> although<00:04:44.340> it's

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
portrait if you would like although it's

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.490 
portrait if you would like although it's
not<00:04:44.520> as<00:04:44.789> stable<00:04:45.030> so<00:04:45.659> using<00:04:45.930> it<00:04:46.169> in<00:04:46.319> the

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
not as stable so using it in the

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.469 
not as stable so using it in the
landscape<00:04:46.889> orientation<00:04:47.220> is<00:04:47.819> recommended

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
landscape orientation is recommended

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.119 
landscape orientation is recommended
there's<00:04:49.139> also<00:04:49.259> a<00:04:49.379> little<00:04:49.590> piece<00:04:49.830> of<00:04:49.979> that

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:50.129 
there's also a little piece of that

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:51.770 
there's also a little piece of that

cutout<00:05:16.050> at<00:05:16.289> the<00:05:16.379> bottom<00:05:16.650> so<00:05:16.680> that<00:05:16.830> when<00:05:17.069> you

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:17.159 
cutout at the bottom so that when you

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:18.980 
cutout at the bottom so that when you
get<00:05:17.280> a<00:05:17.310> phone<00:05:17.520> call<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:18.090> audio<00:05:18.479> will<00:05:18.659> still<00:05:18.870> be

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
get a phone call the audio will still be

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.170 
get a phone call the audio will still be
able<00:05:19.169> to<00:05:19.319> come<00:05:20.039> out<00:05:20.280> of<00:05:20.340> the<00:05:20.639> belt<00:05:20.909> clip

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
able to come out of the belt clip

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.379 
able to come out of the belt clip
without<00:05:21.300> any<00:05:21.629> issues<00:05:22.520> the<00:05:23.520> clip<00:05:23.789> itself<00:05:24.120> is

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:24.389 
without any issues the clip itself is

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.040 
without any issues the clip itself is
very<00:05:24.509> strong<00:05:25.020> it<00:05:25.639> can<00:05:26.639> also<00:05:26.849> rotate<00:05:27.240> 180

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
very strong it can also rotate 180

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.779 
very strong it can also rotate 180
degrees<00:05:28.199> so<00:05:28.710> if<00:05:28.830> you<00:05:28.919> need<00:05:29.069> to<00:05:29.190> rotate<00:05:29.340> it<00:05:29.639> you

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
degrees so if you need to rotate it you

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:33.769 
degrees so if you need to rotate it you
are<00:05:29.880> free<00:05:30.120> to<00:05:30.270> do<00:05:30.419> so<00:05:30.599> I<00:05:32.120> actually<00:05:33.120> didn't<00:05:33.659> use

00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:33.779 
are free to do so I actually didn't use

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:34.969 
are free to do so I actually didn't use
the<00:05:33.900> belt<00:05:34.080> clip<00:05:34.319> because<00:05:34.500> it's<00:05:34.770> just

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
the belt clip because it's just

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:36.350 
the belt clip because it's just
something<00:05:35.279> that<00:05:35.310> I<00:05:35.430> personally<00:05:35.550> don't<00:05:36.240> use

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
something that I personally don't use

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.290 
something that I personally don't use
the<00:05:37.169> case<00:05:37.380> itself<00:05:37.770> is<00:05:38.039> very<00:05:38.190> cool<00:05:38.669> I<00:05:38.880> wish<00:05:39.150> they

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
the case itself is very cool I wish they

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.909 
the case itself is very cool I wish they
offered<00:05:39.449> a<00:05:39.690> version<00:05:39.990> without<00:05:40.110> the<00:05:40.319> integrated

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
offered a version without the integrated

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:42.559 
offered a version without the integrated
screen<00:05:41.159> protector<00:05:41.580> it's<00:05:41.759> just<00:05:42.060> a<00:05:42.180> little<00:05:42.479> bit

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:42.569 
screen protector it's just a little bit

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:44.330 
screen protector it's just a little bit
annoying<00:05:42.810> to<00:05:43.050> me<00:05:43.080> although<00:05:43.860> it<00:05:43.949> works<00:05:44.130> just

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
annoying to me although it works just

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.800 
annoying to me although it works just
fine<00:05:44.580> there's<00:05:44.909> no<00:05:45.000> issues<00:05:45.360> in<00:05:45.509> terms<00:05:45.539> of

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
fine there's no issues in terms of

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.249 
fine there's no issues in terms of
sensitivity<00:05:46.500> or<00:05:46.650> anything<00:05:47.069> like<00:05:47.099> that<00:05:47.279> and

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:48.259 
sensitivity or anything like that and

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:51.140 
sensitivity or anything like that and
what's<00:05:49.259> good<00:05:49.800> about<00:05:49.889> this<00:05:50.039> is<00:05:50.219> actually<00:05:50.969> that

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
what's good about this is actually that

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.820 
what's good about this is actually that
you<00:05:51.210> don't<00:05:51.539> have<00:05:51.750> a<00:05:51.990> bit<00:05:52.199> of<00:05:52.229> a<00:05:52.379> gap<00:05:52.560> between

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
you don't have a bit of a gap between

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.649 
you don't have a bit of a gap between
the<00:05:53.219> screen<00:05:53.430> protector<00:05:54.000> and<00:05:54.210> your<00:05:54.330> actual

00:05:54.649 --> 00:05:54.659 
the screen protector and your actual

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:57.050 
the screen protector and your actual
display<00:05:55.169> a<00:05:55.440> lot<00:05:55.949> of<00:05:56.069> cases<00:05:56.250> with<00:05:56.550> the<00:05:56.669> these

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
display a lot of cases with the these

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.269 
display a lot of cases with the these
integrated<00:05:57.659> screen<00:05:57.990> protectors<00:05:58.440> when<00:05:59.190> you

00:05:59.269 --> 00:05:59.279 
integrated screen protectors when you

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:01.279 
integrated screen protectors when you
push<00:06:00.090> down<00:06:00.120> on<00:06:00.360> your<00:06:00.629> display<00:06:00.870> you<00:06:01.050> can

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
push down on your display you can

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:04.129 
push down on your display you can
actually<00:06:01.529> feel<00:06:02.129> the<00:06:02.930> integrated<00:06:03.930> screen

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 
actually feel the integrated screen

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:05.480 
actually feel the integrated screen
protector<00:06:04.529> moved<00:06:04.740> down<00:06:04.979> a<00:06:05.009> little<00:06:05.279> bit

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
protector moved down a little bit

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.459 
protector moved down a little bit
because<00:06:05.669> there's<00:06:05.969> an<00:06:06.180> ever<00:06:06.479> so<00:06:06.629> small<00:06:07.139> gap

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:07.469 
because there's an ever so small gap

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:09.320 
because there's an ever so small gap
between<00:06:08.099> that<00:06:08.460> screen<00:06:08.699> protector<00:06:09.120> in<00:06:09.210> your

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
between that screen protector in your

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.709 
between that screen protector in your
display<00:06:09.659> so<00:06:09.719> with<00:06:10.500> this<00:06:10.590> particular<00:06:11.129> case<00:06:11.340> I

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:11.719 
display so with this particular case I

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:14.959 
display so with this particular case I
haven't<00:06:12.740> experienced<00:06:13.740> that<00:06:13.819> might<00:06:14.819> be

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:14.969 
haven't experienced that might be

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:16.100 
haven't experienced that might be
because<00:06:15.090> I<00:06:15.389> already<00:06:15.539> have<00:06:15.779> a<00:06:15.810> screen

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
because I already have a screen

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.080 
because I already have a screen
protector<00:06:16.259> installed<00:06:16.710> I<00:06:17.069> don't<00:06:17.430> know<00:06:17.580> but

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
protector installed I don't know but

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.290 
protector installed I don't know but
that's<00:06:18.659> not<00:06:18.810> the<00:06:18.960> case<00:06:18.990> here<00:06:19.849> like<00:06:20.849> I<00:06:20.969> said<00:06:21.029> the

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
that's not the case here like I said the

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.240 
that's not the case here like I said the
home<00:06:21.449> button<00:06:21.629> cutter<00:06:21.930> is<00:06:22.289> just<00:06:22.740> fine<00:06:23.009> and

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
home button cutter is just fine and

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.029 
home button cutter is just fine and
around<00:06:24.000> that<00:06:24.150> is<00:06:24.419> some<00:06:24.870> black<00:06:25.080> glossy

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 
around that is some black glossy

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:28.399 
around that is some black glossy
material<00:06:26.400> just<00:06:26.940> like<00:06:27.120> on<00:06:27.270> the<00:06:27.389> back<00:06:27.599> so<00:06:28.229> this

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:28.409 
material just like on the back so this

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:30.050 
material just like on the back so this
area<00:06:28.620> here<00:06:29.009> will<00:06:29.190> probably<00:06:29.669> get<00:06:29.759> a<00:06:29.820> lot<00:06:30.000> of

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
area here will probably get a lot of

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.010 
area here will probably get a lot of
fingerprints<00:06:30.690> so<00:06:30.839> over<00:06:31.169> time<00:06:31.440> this<00:06:31.649> case

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
fingerprints so over time this case

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.210 
fingerprints so over time this case
definitely<00:06:32.949> probably<00:06:33.629> definitely<00:06:34.629> probably

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220 
definitely probably definitely probably

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.950 
definitely probably definitely probably
probably<00:06:36.220> will<00:06:36.639> not<00:06:36.819> look<00:06:37.060> as<00:06:37.210> nice<00:06:37.389> as<00:06:37.660> it<00:06:37.690> did

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
probably will not look as nice as it did

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:38.969 
probably will not look as nice as it did
when<00:06:38.080> you<00:06:38.199> first<00:06:38.349> took<00:06:38.590> it<00:06:38.740> out<00:06:38.830> of<00:06:38.949> the

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:38.979 
when you first took it out of the

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:41.129 
when you first took it out of the
packaging<00:06:39.550> so<00:06:39.819> therefore<00:06:40.449> mine<00:06:40.629> there's<00:06:40.930> a

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:41.139 
packaging so therefore mine there's a

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:42.839 
packaging so therefore mine there's a
fair<00:06:41.379> amount<00:06:41.409> of<00:06:41.740> smudges<00:06:42.220> around<00:06:42.550> the<00:06:42.610> back

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:42.849 
fair amount of smudges around the back

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:45.659 
fair amount of smudges around the back

definitely some scratches fingerprints

ballistic every1 series is definitely an

interested<00:07:06.250> in<00:07:06.580> this<00:07:06.699> case<00:07:06.909> and<00:07:07.210> I<00:07:07.479> like<00:07:07.750> this

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:07.870 
interested in this case and I like this

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.080 
interested in this case and I like this
quite<00:07:08.169> a<00:07:08.199> bit<00:07:08.500> one<00:07:09.400> thing<00:07:09.550> I<00:07:09.639> need<00:07:09.819> to<00:07:09.849> note

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.090 
quite a bit one thing I need to note

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.610 
quite a bit one thing I need to note
though<00:07:10.300> is<00:07:10.330> that<00:07:10.479> it<00:07:10.750> does<00:07:10.900> add<00:07:11.169> a<00:07:11.199> bit<00:07:11.470> in

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:11.620 
though is that it does add a bit in

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.860 
though is that it does add a bit in
terms<00:07:11.800> of<00:07:11.979> width<00:07:12.280> to<00:07:12.580> your<00:07:12.699> iPhone<00:07:13.030> 5<00:07:13.330> so<00:07:13.659> it's

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:13.870 
terms of width to your iPhone 5 so it's

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.899 
terms of width to your iPhone 5 so it's
it<00:07:14.349> feels<00:07:14.800> a<00:07:14.949> little<00:07:15.069> bit<00:07:15.280> wider<00:07:15.490> when<00:07:15.759> you're

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:15.909 
it feels a little bit wider when you're

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:17.070 
it feels a little bit wider when you're
holding<00:07:16.150> the<00:07:16.240> phone<00:07:16.389> in<00:07:16.539> your<00:07:16.569> hand<00:07:16.690> I<00:07:17.050> think

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.080 
holding the phone in your hand I think

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.610 
holding the phone in your hand I think
that's<00:07:18.069> just<00:07:18.340> fine<00:07:18.490> though<00:07:18.990> so<00:07:19.990> that's<00:07:20.409> a

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:20.620 
that's just fine though so that's a

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.140 
that's just fine though so that's a
