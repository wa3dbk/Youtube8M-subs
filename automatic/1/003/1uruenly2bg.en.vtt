00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
still kind of a rat's nest for now ECU

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.240 
still kind of a rat's nest for now ECU
battery<00:01:11.890> extra<00:01:12.370> filter<00:01:12.760> laying<00:01:12.940> around<00:01:14.250> crap

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
battery extra filter laying around crap

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.750 
battery extra filter laying around crap
here

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
here

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.660 
here
it's<00:01:16.480> about<00:01:16.720> it<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:18.040> is<00:01:18.220> really<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:18.520> only

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
it's about it this is really the only

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.490 
it's about it this is really the only
thing<00:01:18.760> right<00:01:19.150> here<00:01:19.330> I<00:01:19.390> had<00:01:19.600> to<00:01:19.750> modify<00:01:20.080> these

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
thing right here I had to modify these

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.990 
thing right here I had to modify these
are<00:01:20.620> the<00:01:20.740> turn<00:01:21.670> signals<00:01:22.120> and<00:01:22.650> tail<00:01:23.650> light<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
are the turn signals and tail light the

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.270 
are the turn signals and tail light the
Met<00:01:25.240> has<00:01:25.480> plugs<00:01:25.900> whereas<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.620> ruckus<00:01:26.980> has<00:01:27.100> the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
Met has plugs whereas the ruckus has the

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.310 
Met has plugs whereas the ruckus has the
bullet<00:01:27.610> connectors<00:01:27.760> so<00:01:28.540> all<00:01:28.720> I<00:01:28.750> did<00:01:28.930> was

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
bullet connectors so all I did was

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.550 
bullet connectors so all I did was
extend<00:01:29.620> the<00:01:29.770> wires<00:01:29.950> and<00:01:30.940> add<00:01:31.900> in<00:01:32.050> some<00:01:32.080> female

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
extend the wires and add in some female

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.200 
extend the wires and add in some female
bullet<00:01:32.830> connector<00:01:33.220> so<00:01:33.430> it<00:01:33.490> everything<00:01:34.090> would

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
bullet connector so it everything would

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.410 
bullet connector so it everything would
just<00:01:34.240> wire<00:01:34.570> up<00:01:34.780> and<00:01:35.080> that's<00:01:35.260> about<00:01:35.440> it

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
just wire up and that's about it

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.270 
just wire up and that's about it
see<00:01:39.150> disconnected<00:01:40.150> the<00:01:40.930> rear<00:01:41.440> brake<00:01:41.890> when<00:01:42.190> you

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
see disconnected the rear brake when you

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.400 
see disconnected the rear brake when you
combine<00:01:42.490> braking<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.880> just<00:01:46.180> ran<00:01:46.479> a<00:01:46.510> standard

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
combine braking and just ran a standard

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.670 
combine braking and just ran a standard
cable<00:01:48.060> all<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.119> way<00:01:49.450> down<00:01:50.340> back<00:01:51.340> a<00:01:52.680> little

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
cable all the way down back a little

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.780 
cable all the way down back a little
lean<00:01:53.950> right<00:01:54.250> now<00:01:55.410> that<00:01:56.410> it's<00:01:56.830> pretty<00:01:57.130> much<00:01:57.220> it

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
lean right now that it's pretty much it

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:27.290 
lean right now that it's pretty much it
let's<00:01:57.940> take<00:01:58.090> away

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.730 

really<00:02:28.300> nimble<00:02:28.480> on<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.870> skinny<00:02:29.200> front<00:02:29.500> tire

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740
