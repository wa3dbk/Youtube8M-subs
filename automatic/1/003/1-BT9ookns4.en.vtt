which<00:02:31.830> sneaky<00:02:32.250> made<00:02:32.430> this<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:34.100> thus<00:02:35.100> you

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
which sneaky made this and thus you

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.950 
which sneaky made this and thus you

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.500 
region am three times if it's detected
well<00:02:53.160> i<00:02:53.190> can't<00:02:53.670> do<00:02:53.790> that<00:02:53.880> right<00:02:53.940> now<00:02:54.120> because

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
well i can't do that right now because

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.920 
well i can't do that right now because
I'm<00:02:54.690> much<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.440> tagging<00:02:55.740> on<00:02:55.830> xbox<00:02:56.690> yeah<00:02:57.690> that's

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
I'm much a tagging on xbox yeah that's

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.580 
I'm much a tagging on xbox yeah that's
pretty<00:02:58.110> straightforward<00:02:58.380> and<00:03:00.170> also<00:03:01.170> if<00:03:01.410> you

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
pretty straightforward and also if you

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.850 
pretty straightforward and also if you
have<00:03:01.740> a<00:03:02.870> x.x<00:03:03.870> br3<00:03:04.620> already<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.340> made<00:03:06.300> this<00:03:06.450> tool

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
have a x.x br3 already I made this tool

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.230 
have a x.x br3 already I made this tool
which<00:03:07.860> helps<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:08.250> convert<00:03:08.459> it<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.730> freeboot

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
which helps you convert it to freeboot

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.170 
which helps you convert it to freeboot
in<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:09.600> matter<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.990> minute<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.880> it<00:03:11.880> pretty

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
in a matter of a minute and it pretty

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.530 
in a matter of a minute and it pretty
much<00:03:12.300> works<00:03:12.540> on<00:03:12.810> any<00:03:13.050> motherboard<00:03:13.830> so<00:03:14.010> far<00:03:14.540> but

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
much works on any motherboard so far but

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.180 
much works on any motherboard so far but
obviously<00:03:15.959> this<00:03:16.170> is<00:03:16.350> a<00:03:16.380> beta<00:03:16.590> so<00:03:16.980> there's<00:03:17.130> a

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
obviously this is a beta so there's a

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.020 
obviously this is a beta so there's a
lot<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.370> bug<00:03:17.550> fixes<00:03:17.580> to<00:03:18.120> come<00:03:20.540> before<00:03:21.540> cigar

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
lot of bug fixes to come before cigar

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.970 
lot of bug fixes to come before cigar
except<00:03:24.030> well<00:03:24.239> as<00:03:24.450> pre<00:03:24.860> complications<00:03:25.860> or

flasher<00:03:32.820> where<00:03:33.750> this<00:03:33.870> you<00:03:34.050> convert<00:03:34.380> a<00:03:34.560> debian

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
flasher where this you convert a debian

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.210 
flasher where this you convert a debian
on<00:03:35.670> your<00:03:35.910> xbox<00:03:36.120> 360<00:03:36.840> but<00:03:37.290> has<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:37.709> be<00:03:37.800> jtag

can even spell so cpu key which dont

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.860 
can even spell so cpu key which dont
leavee<00:03:58.800> select<00:03:59.370> that<00:04:01.850> not<00:04:02.850> length<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.780> you

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
leavee select that not length and you

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.870 
leavee select that not length and you
just<00:04:04.019> save<00:04:04.230> it<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:05.040> there<00:04:05.250> you<00:04:05.310> go<00:04:05.340> if<00:04:05.610> you<00:04:05.670> can

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
just save it and there you go if you can

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.100 
just save it and there you go if you can
now<00:04:06.560> view<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.620> cpu<00:04:08.239> and<00:04:09.239> that<00:04:09.540> will<00:04:09.720> still<00:04:09.959> be

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
now view a cpu and that will still be

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.310 
now view a cpu and that will still be
there<00:04:10.250> every<00:04:11.250> time<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:11.549> open<00:04:11.610> the<00:04:11.940> program

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
there every time you open the program

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.060 
there every time you open the program
because<00:04:13.320> it<00:04:13.410> saves<00:04:13.680> TM<00:04:13.980> computer's<00:04:14.970> registry

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
because it saves TM computer's registry

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.270 
because it saves TM computer's registry
so<00:04:17.070> that's<00:04:17.220> that<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:18.890> so<00:04:19.890> there's<00:04:20.070> one

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
so that's that and so there's one

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.000 
so that's that and so there's one
exclusive<00:04:21.269> section<00:04:21.780> there<00:04:22.109> are<00:04:22.229> two<00:04:22.440> has<00:04:22.680> and

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
exclusive section there are two has and

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.750 
exclusive section there are two has and
the<00:04:23.789> second<00:04:24.270> is<00:04:24.750> our<00:04:25.440> title<00:04:25.890> at<00:04:26.100> each<00:04:26.400> database

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
the second is our title at each database

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.720 
the second is our title at each database
and<00:04:27.150> IX

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
and IX

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.900 
and IX
ik<00:04:28.480> database<00:04:28.960> now<00:04:29.950> I<00:04:29.980> made<00:04:30.370> this<00:04:30.580> and<00:04:30.880> this

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
ik database now I made this and this

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.220 
ik database now I made this and this
took<00:04:31.270> quite<00:04:31.570> a<00:04:31.630> lot<00:04:31.900> of<00:04:32.020> time<00:04:32.230> to<00:04:32.980> make<00:04:34.230> so

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
took quite a lot of time to make so

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.530 
took quite a lot of time to make so
let's<00:04:36.220> open<00:04:36.490> those<00:04:36.640> it<00:04:36.880> takes<00:04:37.090> a<00:04:37.180> while<00:04:37.330> to

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
let's open those it takes a while to

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.540 
let's open those it takes a while to
load<00:04:37.690> because<00:04:38.050> it's<00:04:38.200> got<00:04:38.320> a<00:04:38.380> load<00:04:38.620> all<00:04:39.010> the
