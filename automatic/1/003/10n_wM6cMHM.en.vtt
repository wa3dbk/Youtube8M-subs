I guess he's saying can help us make us
feel<00:03:57.570> younger<00:03:58.079> and<00:03:58.350> so<00:03:58.890> but<00:03:59.190> you<00:03:59.310> also<00:03:59.760> also<00:04:00.060> do

of good things to stay healthy and

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.360 
of good things to stay healthy and
that's<00:04:07.140> how<00:04:07.290> you're<00:04:07.440> going<00:04:07.470> to<00:04:07.650> feel<00:04:08.070> younger
