00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.980
 and just like in career mode 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.800
 I already told you, they do not have much 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.390
 thing more as my commitment is to bring 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.070

 So let's go and see what they will 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.559
 Speak it to clubs today. Let's go. 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.950
 start with the fact that it stores the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.050
 your last position and since you leave there 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.520
 ready for time to finish the game that 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.530
 Are you already playing? 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.480
 automatically the team will return to the 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.289
 position he was already in the match 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.210
 previous 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.579
 This is so cool, he does not need you. 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.010
 All the time, stay up there written to 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.320
 position not over 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.809
 will be much more practical and well improved 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.090
 that way and those who do not 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.369
 are playing there are in the queue of 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.140
 wait for the next game that's what 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.909
 will appear will appear on this screen 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.020
 showing how many minutes to play in 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.259
 which position the player is playing 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.420
 while the result is pretty cool to see 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.130
 I like this too much if you are 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.009
 Hoping you'll have more. 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.070
 detail than in past raffles but the 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.750
 legal paranÃ¡ paranÃ¡ cool is this new 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.840
 that you can look for a 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.400
 player in the market where only in the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.320
 exposure you want her to do if you 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.630
 for example a side if you are looking for 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.360
 one side you will see the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.100
 statistics of him old is very nice 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.500
 this you will be able to see the progress 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.700
 how much did he score when he played 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.799
 when he has acted 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.630
 This is very cool. It's like growing up. 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.579
 market then you understood player 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.820
 an offer and a 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.649
 time there and you talk beauty he wants you 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.260
 I played there on the side I'm a flyer 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.830
 but it's alright 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.660
 there you can accept or not, I think 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.620
 that that is the big question is 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.229
 big thump and then an old search is 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.390
 as if this were the way the 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.790
 career there 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.620
 laine of this is phenomenal in opinion 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.320
 this is the best news that people 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.380
 I could hear the lovers there, right? 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.200
 we could hear something else is 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.690
 the last of the video is about editing the 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.030
 players have more options in addition to 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.250
 you are to customize the style that you 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.560
 hit the style you're missing 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.270
 penalty for example of robert's option 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.580
 carlos beating misses the one who gives 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.350
 that runner or who knows about bec 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.420
 then you can select which style 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.560
 What do you want besides new celebrations? 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.020
 etc 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.360
 will have more customization options 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.260
 your old character and this is very 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.300
 cool 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.610
 Unfortunately, that's all we have to do. 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.130
 today the club is not much I know 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.200
 but it was what he released the old man then 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.030

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.800
 let's talk one of the career mode 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.320
 most played modes of the fifa but 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.660
 unfortunately what is and has not been released 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.239
 So much so, but let's start there. 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.150
 growth and development 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.700
 player inside the big change game 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.680
 big news is in the player question 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.080
 evolve faster as you go 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.150
 having more chance for it within the 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.459
 for example if you just leave 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.650
 he in the bank his evolution will be more 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.350
 late than if you start playing 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.890
 with him every game then evolution there 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.890
 stayed
