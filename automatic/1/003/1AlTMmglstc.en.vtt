 could build china 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:35.010
 it says floating on the water with a 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.700

 Chinese engineering company csc 46 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.540
 consists of hexagonal blocks 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.340
 connected by submarine tunnels that 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.900
 they will serve streets and pedestrian zones 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.480

 electric rockets or other modes of 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.030
 transport that do not emit monoxide 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.820
 carbon the city ​​is designed as 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.729
 independent with its own production 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.200
 of food and energy and a system of

 if this city is going to exist what 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.680
 what the future holds for us is that in 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.050
 reality the human being has capacity 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.410
