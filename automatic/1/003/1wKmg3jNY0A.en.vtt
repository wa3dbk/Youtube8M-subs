00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.059
 good day here but the movie lounge 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.190
 Today there is a star wars special 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.380
 because here in Cologne in the museum there are off 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.240

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.690
 Exhibition under we were allowed before 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.920
 Of course, just a look in and Libra 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.480
 just join in and see 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.619
 a few impressions and maybe 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.619
 you also have to come over sometimes 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.059
 we sit staring arrived and looking for 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.789
 first with his crazy 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.859
 tie off a figure here and 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:46.789
 managed with his standard types 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:47.930
 but I chose me and 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.510
 with this figure I will now mine 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.510
 travel through the star wars universe 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.510
 compete 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.239
 u 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.820
 photo 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:24.050
 the costume of chewbacca from ours 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.600
 rookie and you know everything 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.790
 from all my facts videos from 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.340
 In the past, that was really everything 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.720
 real people's hair 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.460
 So you did not take anything 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.229
 be really out of this costume 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.310
 also tinkered if you have to say hansa 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.750
 I remember a little differently 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.140
 but I would have loved it too 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.000
 I saw the movie for the first time 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.200
 is the printing costs before it is the same 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.360
 Going on comments I think of everyone 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.470
 case pretty cool you have now too 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.650
 just seen that all this 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.210
 spaceships stand here and beats that 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.840
 heart in any case higher for each star 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.840
 wars fans 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.810
 you can also see really strong 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.310
 First of all, how cheap are the costumes 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.440
 have been glued together and 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.060
 recommends therefore great and that 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.470
 then makes the movie even from getting everything 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.210
 so somehow handcrafted yourself 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.720
 quickly stitched together and then see it 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.430
 just look like scratched spacesuit and im 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.690
 you do not notice film of it so already 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.020
 I am fascinated by everything 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.020
 to look 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.829
 Now I have to finish 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.000
 I reject the offer of the 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.870
 imperators or I go with him 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.950
 and I always think so 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.430
 what would happen if you did 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.430
 go with him 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:16.700
 i follow you an imperator my master 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.470
 arrived at the exit you have to say it 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.870
 Definitely worth it 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.120
 all fans look the right way 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.010
 many of the costumes also showed that way 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.420
 a few inside story then this too 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.920
 whole thing with the bracelet or that 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.630
 to his character is the one located 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.090
 then looking at it is correct 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.820
 Unfortunately he cool the musicians in the sound 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.340
 makes mega much fun on the 22 times on 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.160
 my birthday here now in no one 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.080
 museum definitely worth a look 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.480
 like passing info in the infobox and 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.380
 I'm going a little bit now 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.800
 I am also mad at music now 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.800
 Musician
