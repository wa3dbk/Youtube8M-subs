00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
vehicle we're driving now is a v8 it

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.840 
vehicle we're driving now is a v8 it
feels<00:01:49.759> good<00:01:50.000> when<00:01:50.179> you<00:01:50.299> accelerate<00:01:50.569> then<00:01:51.380> if<00:01:51.590> I

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
feels good when you accelerate then if I

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.669 
feels good when you accelerate then if I
would<00:01:52.850> like<00:01:52.969> to<00:01:53.090> give<00:01:53.209> it<00:01:53.240> more<00:01:53.479> power<00:01:53.719> I<00:01:53.899> use

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
would like to give it more power I use

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.359 
would like to give it more power I use
this<00:01:54.860> command<00:01:55.759> shift<00:01:56.000> option<00:01:56.799> the<00:01:57.799> gearbox<00:01:58.189> is

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
this command shift option the gearbox is

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.699 
this command shift option the gearbox is
a<00:01:58.399> 6-speed<00:01:58.969> automatic<00:01:59.539> it's<00:01:59.959> well<00:02:00.229> engineered

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:00.709 
a 6-speed automatic it's well engineered

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:02.249 
a 6-speed automatic it's well engineered
it's<00:02:00.920> it's<00:02:01.340> one<00:02:01.549> of<00:02:01.609> the<00:02:01.700> best<00:02:01.880> in<00:02:02.030> class

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
it's it's one of the best in class

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.709 
it's it's one of the best in class
gearboxes<00:02:03.259> out<00:02:03.500> there<00:02:03.859> it<00:02:04.579> also<00:02:04.759> has<00:02:05.119> adaptive

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
gearboxes out there it also has adaptive

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.199 
gearboxes out there it also has adaptive
shift<00:02:06.020> control<00:02:06.439> and<00:02:07.220> what<00:02:07.340> I<00:02:07.369> mean<00:02:07.549> by<00:02:07.729> that<00:02:07.759> is

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
shift control and what I mean by that is

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.680 
shift control and what I mean by that is
it<00:02:09.110> adapts<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:10.069> to<00:02:10.549> your<00:02:10.729> driving<00:02:11.120> patterns

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
it adapts the to your driving patterns

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.910 
it adapts the to your driving patterns
so<00:02:12.140> if<00:02:12.829> the<00:02:13.069> driver<00:02:13.310> is<00:02:13.489> a<00:02:13.549> more<00:02:13.760> sporty<00:02:14.090> driver

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
so if the driver is a more sporty driver

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.289 
so if the driver is a more sporty driver

traveling across anything lr3 for me is

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.680 
traveling across anything lr3 for me is
a<00:03:28.220> highly<00:03:28.550> intelligent<00:03:28.820> vehicle<00:03:29.480> that's

the surface if you're driving across and
terrain<00:03:36.320> response<00:03:36.940> really<00:03:37.940> gives<00:03:38.420> you

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
terrain response really gives you

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:45.110 
terrain response really gives you
phenomenal<00:03:40.069> performance

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.910
