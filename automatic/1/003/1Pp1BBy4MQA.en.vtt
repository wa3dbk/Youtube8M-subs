00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:33.000

Nan:  I watch her from Youtube. 
You just click and watch her there!

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:19.000
Nan:  Dhoom machale Dhoom machale Dhoom
Hernfah:   Stop..stop. Showing crawling gesture.

00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:23.000
Nan:  In DhoomDhoom, there was a verse 
you have to crawl. 

00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:27.000
Nan: And she asked me to train her this gesture. 
But this isn't not my cup of tea indeed. 
Hernfah: Not your cup of tea, really?  Alright. 

00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:30.000
So you taught her with your not too good gesture? 

00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:34.000
NHYFans:  [Cheering] 

00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:38.000

Hernfah: Yes, they are

00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:46.000

Hernfah: But Naen will be a little bit better.

00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:49.000
HNFans:  [Screaming] 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Nan:  Hongyok will not be a little bit better..
but MUCH better.
NHYFans:  [Cheering] 

00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:02.000
Nan:  Excuse me, you and I also have to battle as well. 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Nan: But I think hey....our handsomeness is not equal.
NHYFans:  [Cheering] 

00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:13.000
Nan:  Kru Donut said that 'Hernfah....'
(imitate Kru's Donut speaking way)

00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:17.000
'Hernfah, you are not handsome at all'

00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:21.000
How about KruRoj saying?
(Voice's head trainner in the house)

00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:25.000
Hernfah:  KruRoj said All student, 
I want you to make 3 levels of voice; Ki, Kii, Kee

00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:28.000
But if your voice flipped, it will be
Ki, Kii, Kaheeeee

00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:33.000
Nan:  If your voice flipped, how would it be?
Hernfah:  It will be Ki, Kii, Kaheeeee

00:03:33.001 --> 00:03:36.000
You can ask Kru Aey who's sitting there

00:03:36.001 --> 00:03:39.000
Nan:  It'd not be Kaheeeee. No, it shouldn't
Hernfah: Not like that?

00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:41.000
Nan: It'd be Ki, Kii, Kaeeee
Hernfah:  Right

00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:44.000
Nan:  Alright, it's flipped one.
Hernfah:  Yes, it flipped

00:03:44.001 --> 00:03:47.000
Nan:  Would you like to tell them about our battle round?

00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:50.000
Hernfah:  I want to 'release myself'

00:03:51.001 --> 00:03:53.000
Nan:  He uses 'release' word
Fans:  [Laughing] 

00:03:53.001 --> 00:03:55.000
Hernfah: That's right. I want to show my potential

00:03:55.001 --> 00:04:00.000
Nan: May I tell you the side story first? 
I just remember it when Hern talked about himself.

00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:03.000
When we studied acting class together, there was a test

00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:09.000
Like there was one plot, everyone will get it and
has to do acting following this plot one by one.

00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:11.000
The conversation in the plot is 

00:04:11.001 --> 00:04:17.000
Dad..you said that I make you pleasant and feel lively when we are together

00:04:17.001 --> 00:04:19.000
Do you know what Hernfah said?
He said...

00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:26.000
Dad..you said that when we are together you feel like...reaching climax 

00:04:26.001 --> 00:04:30.000
Fans:  [Laughing] 
Hernfah:  No. Not like that.

00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:36.000
Nan:  Really, he said like this.
Hernfah:  In the plot, it noted that 
'feel lively like you were at the mountain peak'

00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:38.000
Nan:  Ah..'feel lively like you were at 
the mountain peak'

00:04:38.001 --> 00:04:42.000
Hernfah:  So I said 'Dad..you made me lively    and...reach climax' That's it.

00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:46.000
Fans:  [Laughing] 
Hernfah:  The meaning is quite similar.

00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:51.000
Nan:  Oh..reach climax of the mountain
Hernfah:  That's right. That's climax. 

00:04:51.001 --> 00:04:56.000
Hernfah: What?
Nan:  I'm frightened, almost can't get back 
to normal conversation.

00:04:57.001 --> 00:04:59.000
Hernfah:  Shall we go prepare for our battle?
Nan:  What?

00:04:59.001 --> 00:05:03.000
Hernfah:  What song do we choose?
Nan:  Shall we go to prepare...nowww?

00:05:03.001 --> 00:05:06.000
Right, are we leaving for preparing... now?

00:05:06.001 --> 00:05:09.000
Hernfah:  Next song battle will be
Hongyok vs Naen, right?

00:05:09.001 --> 00:05:12.000
Nan:  Are you ready for this battle?
Hernfah:  Are you?
Fans:  [Ready] 

00:05:12.001 --> 00:05:14.000
Nan:  I don't hear any voices
Fans:  [Ready] 

00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:17.000
Hernfah:  May I ask for your voices for Naen?
HNFans:  [Screaming]

00:05:17.001 --> 00:05:22.000
Nan:  May I ask for your voices for Hongyok?
NHYFans:  [Screaming] 

00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:34.000
Nan:  Too much emotion
Too emotional from watching football last night 

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:38.000
Nan:  Is that your house cheering's gesture?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Hernfah:  What did you say?
Have you seen Brazil last night?

00:05:41.001 --> 00:05:43.000
Nan:  We won't talk about football

00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:45.000
Nan:  Ah..are you ready to meet Naen and Hongyok?
Hernfah:  Are you ready to meet Naen and Hongyok?

00:05:45.001 --> 00:05:50.000
Nan:  May I ask for louder voices for
Naen and Hongyok?
Hernfah:  Louder voices please!
