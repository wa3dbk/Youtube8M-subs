00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
difference between organic and

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.330 
difference between organic and
non-organic<00:00:20.810> vegetables<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.020> fruits<00:00:22.740> so

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340

oops<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.800> really<00:00:31.800> see<00:00:32.250> if<00:00:33.210> there<00:00:33.480> was<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.690> big

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
oops and really see if there was a big

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.700 
oops and really see if there was a big
difference<00:00:34.790> once<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.969> study<00:00:36.210> accurate<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
difference once the study accurate the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.060 
difference once the study accurate the
study<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.250> raw<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.559> here's<00:00:40.559> why

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
study is raw and here's why

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.180 
study is raw and here's why
although<00:00:41.550> nutritionally<00:00:42.239> similar<00:00:42.600> although

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
although nutritionally similar although

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.619 
although nutritionally similar although
basically<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.340> same<00:00:44.579> vitamins<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.300> minerals

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
basically the same vitamins and minerals

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.970 
basically the same vitamins and minerals
between<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.289> organic<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.860> non-organic

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
between the organic and non-organic

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.729 
between the organic and non-organic
there's<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.820> big<00:00:48.120> differentiation<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.200> that

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
there's a big differentiation and that

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.119 
there's a big differentiation and that
is<00:00:49.980> what's<00:00:50.820> put<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.210> these<00:00:51.390> things<00:00:51.710> 1<00:00:52.710> billion

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
is what's put on these things 1 billion

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.330 
is what's put on these things 1 billion
pounds<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.969> pesticides<00:00:54.030> are<00:00:54.750> dumped<00:00:55.020> on

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
pounds of pesticides are dumped on

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.680 
pounds of pesticides are dumped on
non-organic<00:00:56.340> vegetables<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.300> fruits<00:00:57.510> every

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
non-organic vegetables and fruits every

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.729 
non-organic vegetables and fruits every
single<00:00:58.320> year

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
single year

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.069 
single year

side effects especially for our younger

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.870 
side effects especially for our younger
generation<00:01:03.270> kids<00:01:03.989> are<00:01:04.260> more<00:01:04.470> susceptible<00:01:05.339> to

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
generation kids are more susceptible to

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.950 
generation kids are more susceptible to
these<00:01:06.450> toxins<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.710> are<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:07.950> our<00:01:08.040> environment
