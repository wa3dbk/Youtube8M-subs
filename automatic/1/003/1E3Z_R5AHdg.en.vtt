00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.610
 What I want to do in this video is to think 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.900
 In the difference between two different ways to explain the oligarchs in g 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:14.380
 As we talked earlier, many books give you 9.81 mts per second box 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.070
 Down or towards the center of the earth 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.950
 Or sometimes gives you a negative amount which indicates direction 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.260
 Necessarily lower, 9.81 m / s ^ 2 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.100
 Probably the most common way to interpret this value 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:44.680
 Of acceleration due to the acceleration of gravity near Earth's surface 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.510
 For a body falling free fall, this is what we will focus on in this video 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.120
 For a body falling free fall 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.350
 The reason for the emphasis on this last part 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.240
 Because we know many objects close to the earth's surface 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.000
 Which is not in the case of free fall 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.170
 For example, near the surface of the floor right now I am not in a free fall state 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.610
 What happens to me now is that I sit on a chair 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.490
 This is the chair 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.500
 This is Na 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.240
 Let's say that the chair bears all my weight 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.810
 My legs fly in the air 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.000
 If this is what I am, what happens to the right here? 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.270
 If you fall in a free fall, you will rush toward the center of the earth 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.500
 By 9.81 m / square two 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.780
 But that is because of gravity due to gravity 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:54.200
 It is fully equated by vertical contact strength from the surface of the chair 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:01.890
 And this vertical force, I will make both vector 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:10.430
 If the total sum in this situation is equal to zero, especially in the vertical direction 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.260
 Because the force is zero 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.140
 I'm not rushing toward the center of the earth, I'm not in a free fall 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.480
 Because of this 9.8 m / s ^ 2 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.400
 I'll talk about it in a second, but I'm not an object in a free fall 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.850
 Another way to explain this 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.290
 It is not accelerated by gravity near the surface of the earth 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.740
 For body fall falls free, though 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.750
 Perhaps in general I can explain this, it is the field of earth gravity 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.510
 Or actually the average acceleration 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.780
 It actually changes slightly around the surface of the earth 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:03:02.290
 But another way to show the average ground area of ​​the Earth's surface 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.630
 I will talk what the field means in the context of physics in seconds 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:14.380
 Gravity field on Earth 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.880
 This is something more abstract, and we will talk about it in a second 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:24.080
 But it will help us think of g based on this scenario as I am not in a free fall state 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.660
 The field when you think about the context of physics 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.140
 A little more abstract than a concept in the context of mathematics 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.940
 But in the context of physics 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.270
 The sphere is the amount associated with each point in the vacuum 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:47.950
 If this is the exact amount with each point in the vacuum 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.830
 It is actually a standard quantity, if we call this a quantitative area 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.640
 This is the value 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.530
 Or it will be a quantity destined for its amount and direction 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.570
 Tied to each point in space 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.000
 In case we are dealing with the vector field 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.400
 The reason why we call this area because of proximity to the surface of the earth 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.180
 So if you give me a block, for example, maybe a mass in kilograms 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:21.020
 If we are near the surface of the earth, you are given a mass. Let's say this mass is 10 kg 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:27.950
 You can use g to explain the force on them, from gravity to the body 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.630
 At any point in the vacuum 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.270
 For example, if this mass of 10 kg 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.640
 This is the surface of the earth 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.170
 And so the land center 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.520
 If in reality it is a vector and its direction towards the center of the earth 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:51.710
 The amount of the directed quantity will be mass multiplied by g 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:58.540
 This roughly determines the direction, you can say 9.81 meters per second square towards the center of the ground 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:07.770
 In this situation will be 10 kg hit 9.81 meters per second square 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:19.110
 Which is about 98.1 kg / m2 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.490
 Which unit power is Newton, or 98.1 Newton 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.080
 This is probably not in the case of a free fall, so this is why it becomes 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.910
 What is the connection to the body is not in the case of free fall 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:43.980
 g gives us the force effect of gravity per unit of mass on an object near the Earth's surface 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.830
 Let me think about it, if this is the rate of the ground 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:55.010
 Which gives strength to each block 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.100
 So if you give me a block near the surface of the earth. Whether the body is in a free fall or not 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.970
 The hit block will hit g because it gives you strength for each block 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:10.040
 Will give you the force of gravity affect the body 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.690
 Near the surface of the earth whether it is a free fall or not 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.870
 So I want to do this for a little distinction 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.950
 Because g will go back to this way right over here 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.200
 Sometime you might encounter this saying, no no no no no no 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.390
 But there is a connection to g even if there is no free fall 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:30.960
 Obviously you can not say that the acceleration when I'm sitting on the chair is 9.81 meters per second square 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.860
 Towards the center of the earth. I'm not rushing toward the center of the earth 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:38.690
 So they can say no no no. You can call this acceleration 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.810
 It accelerates when the body is in a free fall state near the surface of the earth 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:49.470
 If there is no resistance to the air, if the force is the force of gravity 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.780
 Then in fact the body will accelerate 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.320
 But becomes irrelevant, we know that many objects are not in a free fall state 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.840
 And that the body in the case of free fall does not remain long in the case of free fall because it collides with something 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.710
 However, we know that G actually has a link to all objects 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.690
 It tells us the power of each block 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:11.010
 It is tempting to call it always an acceleration due to the unity of acceleration 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.820
 But even if you speak the term ground, it's still the same amount 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.930
 It's still exactly the same units, the same amount 

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.990
 And the same trend, it's a different way to show it 

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.520
 Here the acceleration for a body falls free fall 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.240
 Here, something to hit the block to explain the force because of gravity
