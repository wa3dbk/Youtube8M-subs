00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
disadvantages so we all know that iOS 7

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.360 
disadvantages so we all know that iOS 7
is<00:04:28.980> simple<00:04:29.880> to<00:04:30.090> use<00:04:30.330> it<00:04:30.690> looks<00:04:31.050> good<00:04:31.380> but<00:04:32.010> you

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
is simple to use it looks good but you

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.850 
is simple to use it looks good but you
can't<00:04:32.730> fully<00:04:33.180> customize<00:04:33.900> it<00:04:34.200> like<00:04:34.410> you<00:04:34.560> can

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
can't fully customize it like you can

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.390 
can't fully customize it like you can
with<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:35.669> Google<00:04:36.180> OS<00:04:36.570> because<00:04:37.530> Android<00:04:38.190> we

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
with the Google OS because Android we

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.070 
with the Google OS because Android we
know<00:04:38.580> that<00:04:38.760> we<00:04:38.850> can<00:04:39.000> customize<00:04:39.180> it<00:04:39.780> it<00:04:39.900> has

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
know that we can customize it it has

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.530 
know that we can customize it it has
good<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:40.740> multitasking<00:04:41.669> especially<00:04:41.820> on<00:04:42.419> the

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
good and multitasking especially on the

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.930 
good and multitasking especially on the
tablets<00:04:42.990> but<00:04:43.590> it's<00:04:43.890> not<00:04:44.070> as<00:04:44.220> smooth<00:04:44.640> and

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
tablets but it's not as smooth and

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.560 
tablets but it's not as smooth and
good-looking<00:04:45.780> and<00:04:45.930> easy<00:04:46.169> to<00:04:46.410> use<00:04:46.680> as<00:04:46.890> iOS<00:04:47.580> 7<00:04:48.120> so

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
good-looking and easy to use as iOS 7 so

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.000 
good-looking and easy to use as iOS 7 so
that<00:04:48.720> is<00:04:48.840> definitely<00:04:49.080> something<00:04:49.440> to<00:04:49.860> think

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
that is definitely something to think

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.930 
that is definitely something to think
about<00:04:50.340> I<00:04:50.850> use<00:04:51.630> both<00:04:52.020> os's<00:04:52.470> each<00:04:52.890> day<00:04:53.280> because<00:04:53.550> I

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
about I use both os's each day because I

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.780
