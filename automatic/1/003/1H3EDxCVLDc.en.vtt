00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.439
 and lack of god 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.410
 from sabina 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.110
 hello, we 're going to play 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.780
 of the wines 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.150
 I have been asked for many songs from the 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.710
 and viruses and because of that I'm going to make a 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.170
 series of videos with their best 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.110
 songs let's start today 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.000
 with this great theme and five we started 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.130
 with the part of the introduction for the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.440
 first round we will use re 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.140
 held in gold 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.800
 D major in this position 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.290
 do sharp if the minor 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.500
 for the second round we return to re 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.329
 sustained minor 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.079
 higher 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.320
 my minor 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.870
 and the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:17.490
 let's make four radios down 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:19.619
 for each I agreed in this way those two 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.520
 parts joined with the letter would be heard 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.520
 in this way 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.420
 now we will learn the part of the core that 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.220
 is divided into several stanzas all 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.650
 the stanzas carry the same structure 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.510
 of chords with a small change in the 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.850
 chords at the end of each stanza 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.840
 we start with the first one we're going to 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:02.290
 use major and minor re 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:07.230
 F sharp minor my minor 77 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.230
 in the end chords would be greater re 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.710
 and the 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.900
 the rodeo that we do in the part of the 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:19.510
 choir is super easy we only do 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.510
 down up down down up this way 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.410
 now if we put the letter of the first 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.410
 ifai stanza 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.890
 yes 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:54.420
 more and you're 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:59.330
 streets 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.330
 All my people 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.250
 A) Yes 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.680
 for the second verse we make the same 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:11.400
 chord circle and we introduce in the 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:16.890
 end of verse 7 sun 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:19.020
 one major welder and seven 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.620
 see how it would look with fins and 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.620
 fachas 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.750
 where 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.810
 two 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:39.470
 others 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.470
 larger 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.510
 the actors 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.290
 to drink 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.290
 heras 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.300
 I 'm sorry 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.470
 the third part is completely the same 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.470
 that the previous one observe 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.209
 nothing 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:18.410
 and I can more 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:22.030
 over to take care of you 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.030
 the actors 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.020
 we repeat the third part a 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.950
 again and we complete the song with the 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.120
 final part we will use minor sun and re 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.340
 higher 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.970
 observe how it would fit with the letter and 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.970
 easy 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.140
 the afternoon 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.850
 good friends that would be the video tutorial 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.360
 for today I hope there will be 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.510
 liked 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.040
 do not forget to like the video 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.280
 share it on your social networks and for 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.889
 course subscribe to this channel 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.170
 that way it helps me keep pressure 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:12.070
 that would be all part of the verbs 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.070
