00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.069
 the next mayor asks 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.019
 benÃª barbosa there is restriction for the purchase 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.330
 of arms and ammunition in the United States 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.570
 could reduce murders in 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:20.850
 mass we accompany the media 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:24.180
 good first forget 99% of everything 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.369
 you read about restrictions on sale 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.099
 purchase of weapons in the United States and 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.650
 it just will not happen right? 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.989
 you may eventually have in a state the 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.079
 other in another city â€‹â€‹some restriction 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.780
 a little bigger but there was already a 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.280
 restriction that called the law brad that the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.100
 restriction is exactly what is being 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.440
 proposed today that the issue of rifles 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.649
 similar in the asphalt plants and the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.110
 number of ammunition carriers and this 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.469
 law was measured for ten years 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.949
 after ten years it was verified that 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.500
 it was the FBI that the law did not bring any 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:04.890
 impact on reducing this type of 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.159
 occurrence is therefore a useless law and 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.869
 It did not have to continue to be 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.240
 an intelligence of the American legislation 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.010
 very interesting is something that does not 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.590
 Happens in Brazil, right? 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.320
 once a law has been adopted for those who 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.960
 passed that law and did not take a 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.229
 awareness and said look really did 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.780
 a huge bullshit takes advantage of a law 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.509
 that does not work that worsened the situation 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.640
 of what was already bad so we need 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.049
 go back not here in brazil 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.240
 unfortunately our legislators 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.189
 they ended up signing it was not me who 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.110
 Enjoy going to stay until the end and will 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.530
 continue and will not be worth the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.329
 reviewed the issue of the famous massacres 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.189
 in the United States 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.470
 we have to take into account that 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.439
 when this happens first to a 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.560
 massification through the media 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.130
 in this type of occurrence making it appear 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.219
 of which occurs much more often or with 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.340
 more intensity than in reality 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:06.420
 occurs in the last massacre that occurred 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.489
 in the united states 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.340
 Ah, I ended up writing an article 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.710
 that the title was not blood on the tip of 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.230
 a knife is less red 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.510
 why this type of attack is 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.670
 extremely recurrent and more 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.730
 applicant in china 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.460
 only there as the governmental restriction 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.880
 for being a communist country the guns escape 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.730
 gigantic they use machetes axes 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.210
 and knives 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.880
 only in 2010 more than 160 children and 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.870
 adults have been stabbed in 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.990
 China 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.660
 this happens often remembering 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.250
 although often the news even 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.030
 go to the media because the Chinese government 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.250
 is now holding back in an attempt to 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.350
 not to create what was conventionally called 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.850
 someone who sees that 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.100
 news talk I will draw attention 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.220
 too and I'll do the same 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.280
 so it's not the firearm restriction until 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.850
 because the latest attacks on people is the 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.950
 I use crazy crazy psychopaths 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.050
 had legally purchased these weapons 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.080
 they did it through another way 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.120
 We had here in Brazil already, right? 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.760
 the only case to date but there has already been 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.750
 case that was there in rio de janeiro that 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.810
 he was also a person completely 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:30.780
 psychotic no crazy and as the 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.150
 Prime Minister Cameron after a 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.480
 Similar massacre in England and he 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.940
 that it is not possible to legislate 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.700
 about madness, that is to say when someone 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.340
 determines whether it makes it available to 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.450
 attack if he will use one he 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.190
 will use gas 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.260
 he will use poison will use 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.740
 gasoline or will use what it 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.280
 have hands and it will hardly be 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.280
 impeded
