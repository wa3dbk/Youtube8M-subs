00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.849 

I'm<00:00:00.719> trying<00:00:01.170> out<00:00:01.290> the<00:00:01.469> dyson<00:00:01.949> DC<00:00:02.460> 78<00:00:03.859> model

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
I'm trying out the dyson DC 78 model

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.299 
I'm trying out the dyson DC 78 model
here<00:00:05.339> it's<00:00:05.940> right<00:00:06.210> out<00:00:06.330> of<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.540> box<00:00:07.309> this

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
here it's right out of the box this

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.150 
here it's right out of the box this
vacuum<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.240> only<00:00:09.540> vacuum<00:00:10.200> with<00:00:10.830> no

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
vacuum is the only vacuum with no

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.480 
vacuum is the only vacuum with no
filters<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:12.150> wash<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.420> replace<00:00:13.019> no<00:00:13.620> bags<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.340> buy

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
filters to wash a replace no bags to buy

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.680 
filters to wash a replace no bags to buy
and<00:00:15.379> no<00:00:16.379> loss<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.859> suction<00:00:17.510> which<00:00:18.510> is

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
and no loss of suction which is

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.019 
and no loss of suction which is
interesting<00:00:18.990> because<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.859> have<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.369> central<00:00:20.789> vac

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
interesting because I have a central vac

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.480 
interesting because I have a central vac
in<00:00:21.270> my<00:00:21.420> home<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.410> was<00:00:22.439> very<00:00:22.769> curious<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.460> see

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
in my home so I was very curious to see

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.330 
in my home so I was very curious to see
how<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:25.199> Dyson<00:00:25.769> would<00:00:26.310> compare<00:00:28.250> coming<00:00:29.250> out

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
how the Dyson would compare coming out

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.189 
how the Dyson would compare coming out
of<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> box<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.269> very<00:00:30.510> easy<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.840> set<00:00:31.140> up

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
of the box this is very easy to set up

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.459 
of the box this is very easy to set up
all<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.279> had<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.430> do<00:00:32.669> was<00:00:32.820> click<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.480> to

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
all you had to do was click in this to

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.880 
all you had to do was click in this to
here<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.070> then<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.969> attachment<00:00:36.710> to<00:00:37.710> there

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
here and then the attachment to there

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.780 
here and then the attachment to there
and<00:00:38.160> that's<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.239> plug<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:40.040> has<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> long<00:00:41.340> cord

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
and that's it plug it in has a long cord

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.680 
and that's it plug it in has a long cord
and<00:00:41.989> you're<00:00:42.989> ready<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.290> go<00:00:44.239> comes<00:00:45.239> also<00:00:45.450> with

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
and you're ready to go comes also with

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.180 
and you're ready to go comes also with
some<00:00:45.809> other<00:00:45.960> attachments<00:00:46.620> including<00:00:47.010> this

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
some other attachments including this

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.760 
some other attachments including this
one<00:00:47.370> here<00:00:47.640> which<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.750> guess<00:00:48.989> would<00:00:49.170> be<00:00:49.320> good<00:00:49.559> for

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
one here which I guess would be good for

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.840 
one here which I guess would be good for
carpet<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:51.660> then<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:53.190> one<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.520> put<00:00:53.730> on

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
carpet and then the one that I put on

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.160 
carpet and then the one that I put on
right<00:00:54.030> now<00:00:54.180> for<00:00:54.210> floors<00:00:56.239> so<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.300> will<00:00:57.780> turn<00:00:58.020> it

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
right now for floors so I will turn it

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.229 
right now for floors so I will turn it
on<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.530> can<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> listen<00:00:59.129> but<00:00:59.460> one

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
on so you can have a listen but one

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.819 
on so you can have a listen but one
thing<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.600> noticed<00:01:00.989> right<00:01:01.020> away<00:01:01.170> was<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
thing that I noticed right away was the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.039 
thing that I noticed right away was the
suction<00:01:02.309> it's<00:01:02.940> very<00:01:03.270> very<00:01:03.570> strong<00:01:03.870> and

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
suction it's very very strong and

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.160 
suction it's very very strong and
powerful<00:01:04.199> compared<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.129> my<00:01:05.280> central<00:01:05.909> vac

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
powerful compared to my central vac

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:28.260 
powerful compared to my central vac
there<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.320> quite<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> difference

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:40.810 

and<00:01:30.369> here<00:01:31.369> is<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.700> Dyson<00:01:31.909> on<00:01:32.299> carpet<00:01:39.789> you<00:01:40.789> can

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
and here is the Dyson on carpet you can

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.950 
and here is the Dyson on carpet you can
see<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.360> suction

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.860 

very<00:01:44.440> very<00:01:44.740> good
