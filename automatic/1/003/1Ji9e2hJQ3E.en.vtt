giving me the footage because they were

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.529 
giving me the footage because they were
the<00:01:51.530> guys<00:01:51.709> that<00:01:51.739> went<00:01:52.069> to<00:01:52.190> e3<00:01:52.580> and<00:01:52.789> got<00:01:53.390> to<00:01:53.509> play

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
the guys that went to e3 and got to play

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.059 
the guys that went to e3 and got to play
this<00:01:53.810> game<00:01:53.989> and<00:01:54.200> really<00:01:54.379> jealous<00:01:54.860> of<00:01:54.979> them

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
this game and really jealous of them

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:57.070 
this game and really jealous of them
they<00:01:55.190> got<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:55.429> play<00:01:55.550> this<00:01:55.670> game<00:01:55.849> but<00:01:56.690> I<00:01:56.720> can't

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
they got to play this game but I can't

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.080 
they got to play this game but I can't
tell<00:01:57.289> if<00:01:57.530> it<00:01:57.619> was<00:01:57.739> recorded<00:01:58.220> on<00:01:58.310> a<00:01:58.369> console<00:01:58.879> if

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
tell if it was recorded on a console if

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.389 
tell if it was recorded on a console if
it<00:01:59.209> was<00:01:59.300> recorded<00:01:59.690> on<00:01:59.750> PC<00:02:00.259> but<00:02:00.470> you<00:02:00.920> can<00:02:01.160> see

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
it was recorded on PC but you can see

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:02.830 
it was recorded on PC but you can see
from<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.759> player<00:02:01.970> movement<00:02:02.509> when<00:02:02.690> they're

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
from the player movement when they're

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.150 
from the player movement when they're
moving<00:02:03.170> their<00:02:03.319> aim<00:02:03.470> around<00:02:03.800> that<00:02:03.920> it<00:02:04.009> is

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
moving their aim around that it is

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.400 
moving their aim around that it is
controlled<00:02:04.670> by<00:02:04.759> a<00:02:04.910> console<00:02:05.509> so<00:02:05.780> you<00:02:06.229> know<00:02:06.379> I

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
controlled by a console so you know I

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.199 
controlled by a console so you know I
have<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.739> assume<00:02:06.920> this<00:02:07.099> is<00:02:07.280> console<00:02:07.789> gameplay

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
have to assume this is console gameplay

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.790 
have to assume this is console gameplay
so<00:02:08.270> this<00:02:08.450> is<00:02:08.539> probably<00:02:08.840> not<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.349> best<00:02:09.379> the

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
so this is probably not the best the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.979 
so this is probably not the best the
game<00:02:09.979> could<00:02:10.220> look<00:02:10.489> that's<00:02:11.180> what<00:02:11.330> PC<00:02:11.780> will

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
game could look that's what PC will

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.839 
game could look that's what PC will
bring<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:12.440> table<00:02:12.620> but<00:02:12.980> it<00:02:13.280> still<00:02:13.670> looks

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
bring to the table but it still looks

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.930 
bring to the table but it still looks
really<00:02:14.000> good<00:02:14.540> if<00:02:14.720> this<00:02:14.900> is<00:02:15.050> on<00:02:15.200> console<00:02:15.940> going

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
really good if this is on console going

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.250 
really good if this is on console going
back<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:17.360> thing<00:02:17.540> I<00:02:17.660> mentioned<00:02:17.900> about

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
back to the thing I mentioned about

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.350 
back to the thing I mentioned about
having<00:02:18.620> different<00:02:18.830> locations<00:02:19.760> for<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.150> Far

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
having different locations for the Far

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.850 
having different locations for the Far
Cry<00:02:20.510> game<00:02:20.780> that<00:02:20.959> basically<00:02:21.349> meant<00:02:21.590> that<00:02:21.709> it

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
Cry game that basically meant that it

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.800 
Cry game that basically meant that it
was<00:02:21.980> a<00:02:22.010> different<00:02:22.459> story<00:02:22.730> each<00:02:23.090> time<00:02:23.450> that<00:02:23.690> you

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
was a different story each time that you

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.880 
was a different story each time that you
were<00:02:23.930> playing<00:02:24.140> through<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:24.470> different

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
were playing through a different

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.040 
were playing through a different
character<00:02:25.430> or<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:26.420> stories<00:02:26.750> were<00:02:26.870> never

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
character or the stories were never

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.570 
character or the stories were never
connected<00:02:27.530> between<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.920> first<00:02:28.129> three<00:02:28.310> Far

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
connected between the first three Far

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.700 
connected between the first three Far
Cry<00:02:28.760> games<00:02:29.090> but<00:02:29.390> it<00:02:29.900> looks<00:02:30.080> as<00:02:30.230> if<00:02:30.260> one<00:02:30.530> of<00:02:30.650> the

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
Cry games but it looks as if one of the

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.620 
Cry games but it looks as if one of the
pre-order<00:02:31.220> bonuses<00:02:31.760> is<00:02:32.000> going<00:02:32.330> to<00:02:32.390> give<00:02:32.510> you

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
pre-order bonuses is going to give you

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.030 
pre-order bonuses is going to give you
access<00:02:32.810> to<00:02:33.110> her

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
access to her

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.640 
access to her
from<00:02:34.340> Far<00:02:34.579> Cry<00:02:34.790> 3<00:02:35.019> and<00:02:36.019> this<00:02:36.110> is<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.349> first

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
from Far Cry 3 and this is the first

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.899 
from Far Cry 3 and this is the first
time<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.099> developers<00:02:37.579> have<00:02:37.700> bought

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:37.909 
time the developers have bought

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:39.670 
time the developers have bought
something<00:02:38.209> from<00:02:38.480> an<00:02:38.629> older<00:02:38.930> game<00:02:39.109> or<00:02:39.469> another

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
something from an older game or another

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.699 
something from an older game or another
game<00:02:40.459> within<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.849> franchise<00:02:41.359> into<00:02:41.750> another

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
game within the franchise into another

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.000 
game within the franchise into another
Far<00:02:43.069> Cry<00:02:43.219> game<00:02:43.549> so<00:02:44.239> could<00:02:44.510> we<00:02:44.689> see<00:02:44.930> Far<00:02:45.319> Cry<00:02:45.469> 3<00:02:45.620> &amp;

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
Far Cry game so could we see Far Cry 3 &amp;

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.920 
Far Cry game so could we see Far Cry 3 &amp;
4<00:02:46.159> actually<00:02:46.549> being<00:02:46.790> linked<00:02:47.120> together<00:02:47.239> maybe

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
4 actually being linked together maybe

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.869 
4 actually being linked together maybe
it's<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.260> possibility<00:02:48.409> or<00:02:48.890> maybe<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:49.849> just

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
it's a possibility or maybe it just

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.759 
it's a possibility or maybe it just
happens<00:02:50.390> and<00:02:50.480> so<00:02:50.629> those<00:02:50.870> shoehorned<00:02:51.500> him<00:02:51.620> in

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
happens and so those shoehorned him in

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.140 
happens and so those shoehorned him in
but<00:02:51.950> I'm<00:02:52.069> sure<00:02:52.310> there's<00:02:52.549> a<00:02:52.609> reason<00:02:52.939> why<00:02:53.090> this

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
but I'm sure there's a reason why this

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.360 
but I'm sure there's a reason why this
guy's<00:02:53.569> gonna<00:02:53.780> be<00:02:53.870> in<00:02:54.079> the<00:02:54.170> game<00:02:54.349> and<00:02:54.590> be<00:02:55.069> really

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
guy's gonna be in the game and be really

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.440 
guy's gonna be in the game and be really
interesting<00:02:55.819> to<00:02:55.909> play<00:02:56.000> through<00:02:56.299> the<00:02:56.420> campaign

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
interesting to play through the campaign

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.630 
interesting to play through the campaign
and<00:02:57.049> and<00:02:57.200> see<00:02:57.650> what's<00:02:57.890> what<00:02:58.129> would<00:02:58.310> this<00:02:58.430> guy

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640

and sort of distract the enemy AI which

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.680 
and sort of distract the enemy AI which
i<00:03:37.129> think<00:03:37.189> is<00:03:37.400> a<00:03:37.430> really<00:03:37.760> cool<00:03:38.120> touch<00:03:38.389> and

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
i think is a really cool touch and

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.119 
i think is a really cool touch and
that's<00:03:39.199> probably<00:03:39.530> another<00:03:39.769> thing<00:03:39.979> I<00:03:40.099> should

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129 
that's probably another thing I should

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:41.979 
that's probably another thing I should
touch<00:03:40.459> on<00:03:40.639> the<00:03:40.760> AI<00:03:40.909> seem<00:03:41.389> to<00:03:41.479> be<00:03:41.599> much<00:03:41.780> more

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
touch on the AI seem to be much more

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.319 
touch on the AI seem to be much more
intelligent<00:03:42.319> in<00:03:42.709> Far<00:03:42.979> Cry<00:03:43.159> 4<00:03:43.519> than<00:03:43.760> than<00:03:44.209> they

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
intelligent in Far Cry 4 than than they

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.719 
intelligent in Far Cry 4 than than they
do<00:03:44.389> in<00:03:44.510> Far<00:03:44.870> Cry<00:03:45.079> 3<00:03:45.199> and<00:03:45.739> in<00:03:46.129> fact<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:46.489> base

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:46.729 
do in Far Cry 3 and in fact the base

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:49.509 
do in Far Cry 3 and in fact the base
that<00:03:47.120> is<00:03:47.419> in<00:03:47.659> the<00:03:47.750> gameplay<00:03:47.959> now<00:03:48.440> is<00:03:49.040> probably

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
that is in the gameplay now is probably

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.309 
that is in the gameplay now is probably
one<00:03:49.729> of<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:49.909> biggest<00:03:50.329> ones<00:03:50.540> I've<00:03:50.720> ever<00:03:50.750> seen

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
one of the biggest ones I've ever seen

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:52.960 
one of the biggest ones I've ever seen
that<00:03:51.620> you<00:03:51.709> have<00:03:51.889> to<00:03:52.010> take<00:03:52.159> over<00:03:52.370> in<00:03:52.549> a<00:03:52.609> Far<00:03:52.819> car

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
that you have to take over in a Far car

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.909 
that you have to take over in a Far car
game<00:03:53.180> because<00:03:53.329> in<00:03:53.449> Far<00:03:53.659> Cry<00:03:53.780> 3<00:03:53.900> some<00:03:54.709> of<00:03:54.799> those

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 
game because in Far Cry 3 some of those

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.189 
game because in Far Cry 3 some of those
little<00:03:55.190> like<00:03:55.370> village<00:03:56.060> huts<00:03:56.329> and<00:03:56.659> sort<00:03:56.900> of<00:03:56.959> out

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:57.199 
little like village huts and sort of out

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:58.629 
little like village huts and sort of out
houses<00:03:57.769> and<00:03:57.919> things<00:03:58.010> that<00:03:58.129> you<00:03:58.280> have<00:03:58.400> to<00:03:58.489> take

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
houses and things that you have to take

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.819 
houses and things that you have to take
over<00:03:58.849> really<00:03:59.810> weren't<00:04:00.019> that<00:04:00.199> sort<00:04:00.769> of

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
over really weren't that sort of

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.339 
over really weren't that sort of
engaging<00:04:01.340> and<00:04:01.879> the<00:04:02.030> fact<00:04:02.269> that<00:04:02.419> this<00:04:02.989> is<00:04:03.139> much

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
engaging and the fact that this is much

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.140 
engaging and the fact that this is much
bigger<00:04:03.620> there<00:04:03.919> are<00:04:04.069> more<00:04:04.220> enemies<00:04:04.400> because

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
bigger there are more enemies because

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.670 
bigger there are more enemies because
they're<00:04:05.479> sort<00:04:05.840> of<00:04:05.900> a<00:04:05.989> little<00:04:06.109> bit<00:04:06.199> more<00:04:06.409> clever

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
they're sort of a little bit more clever

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.649 
they're sort of a little bit more clever
they<00:04:07.280> can<00:04:07.459> climb<00:04:07.639> up<00:04:07.699> to<00:04:07.879> higher<00:04:08.150> level<00:04:08.479> so<00:04:08.569> it

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:08.659 
they can climb up to higher level so it

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:09.849 
they can climb up to higher level so it
makes<00:04:08.810> it<00:04:08.900> difficult<00:04:08.959> for<00:04:09.319> you<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.650> stay

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
makes it difficult for you to stay

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.920 
makes it difficult for you to stay
hidden<00:04:10.069> all<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.430> time<00:04:10.609> it<00:04:11.389> means<00:04:11.569> that<00:04:11.720> it's

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
hidden all the time it means that it's

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.180 
hidden all the time it means that it's
going<00:04:12.019> to<00:04:12.079> present<00:04:12.290> more<00:04:12.590> of<00:04:12.680> a<00:04:12.739> challenge<00:04:13.129> to

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
going to present more of a challenge to

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.009 
going to present more of a challenge to
actually<00:04:13.400> play<00:04:13.790> this<00:04:13.970> game<00:04:14.030> and<00:04:14.449> auras<00:04:14.780> play<00:04:14.989> a

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
actually play this game and auras play a

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.170 
actually play this game and auras play a
stealth<00:04:15.470> through<00:04:15.739> this<00:04:15.859> game<00:04:16.070> at<00:04:16.250> least<00:04:16.280> it's

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
stealth through this game at least it's

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.520 
stealth through this game at least it's
going<00:04:17.299> to<00:04:17.359> be<00:04:17.449> much<00:04:17.630> harder<00:04:17.870> to<00:04:18.079> do<00:04:18.199> that<00:04:18.229> this

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
going to be much harder to do that this

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:19.089 
going to be much harder to do that this
time<00:04:18.590> around

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
time around

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:21.370 
time around
of<00:04:19.639> course<00:04:19.880> you<00:04:20.060> don't<00:04:20.269> actually<00:04:20.539> have<00:04:21.019> to<00:04:21.079> be

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
of course you don't actually have to be

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.129 
of course you don't actually have to be
stealthy<00:04:21.859> at<00:04:21.979> all<00:04:22.190> and<00:04:22.630> I'm<00:04:23.630> going<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:23.930> switch

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
stealthy at all and I'm going to switch

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.290 
stealthy at all and I'm going to switch
to<00:04:24.349> zoom<00:04:24.530> gameplay<00:04:25.010> here<00:04:25.310> of<00:04:25.490> getting<00:04:26.090> on<00:04:26.270> the

to zoom gameplay here of getting on the

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.420 
to zoom gameplay here of getting on the

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
running right inside the base this looks

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.890 
running right inside the base this looks
ultimately<00:04:31.300> amazingly<00:04:32.300> fun

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
ultimately amazingly fun

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.899 
ultimately amazingly fun
you<00:04:33.470> just<00:04:33.650> get<00:04:33.800> a<00:04:33.830> machine-gun<00:04:34.430> and<00:04:34.550> slap<00:04:34.759> it

you just get a machine-gun and slap it

it<00:04:44.910> doesn't<00:04:45.120> actually<00:04:45.180> seem<00:04:45.479> to<00:04:45.569> have<00:04:45.690> a

it doesn't actually seem to have a
health<00:04:45.960> meter<00:04:46.169> so<00:04:46.560> you<00:04:46.620> just<00:04:46.830> carry<00:04:47.039> on

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
health meter so you just carry on

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.800 
health meter so you just carry on
running<00:04:47.400> around<00:04:47.580> until<00:04:48.000> you<00:04:48.210> get<00:04:48.419> shot<00:04:48.690> off

really see you ever getting bored and

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.830 
really see you ever getting bored and
the<00:05:35.250> repai<00:05:35.580> ability<00:05:36.030> does<00:05:36.210> look<00:05:36.419> quite<00:05:36.630> good

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
the repai ability does look quite good

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.110 
the repai ability does look quite good
in<00:05:36.960> this<00:05:37.080> game<00:05:37.280> and<00:05:38.280> probably<00:05:38.430> the<00:05:38.729> final

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
in this game and probably the final

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.270 
in this game and probably the final
thing<00:05:39.300> for<00:05:39.330> me<00:05:39.599> is<00:05:39.780> that<00:05:40.020> that<00:05:40.259> Far<00:05:40.740> Cry<00:05:40.949> has

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
thing for me is that that Far Cry has

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.710 
thing for me is that that Far Cry has
always<00:05:41.460> been<00:05:41.970> a<00:05:42.000> little<00:05:42.150> bit<00:05:42.360> of<00:05:42.449> a<00:05:42.509> letdown

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
always been a little bit of a letdown

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.330 
always been a little bit of a letdown
when<00:05:42.990> it<00:05:43.080> comes<00:05:43.229> to<00:05:43.319> the<00:05:43.409> multiplayer<00:05:43.800> you

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
when it comes to the multiplayer you

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.399 
when it comes to the multiplayer you
mainly<00:05:44.610> buy<00:05:45.000> this<00:05:45.060> game<00:05:45.539> just<00:05:46.139> for<00:05:46.319> the

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:46.409 
mainly buy this game just for the

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:47.510 
mainly buy this game just for the
single-player<00:05:46.860> so

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
single-player so

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.950 
single-player so
the<00:05:47.699> multiplayer<00:05:48.030> is<00:05:48.270> just<00:05:48.479> sort<00:05:48.599> of<00:05:48.659> like<00:05:48.840> an

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
the multiplayer is just sort of like an

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.540 
the multiplayer is just sort of like an
added<00:05:49.320> extra<00:05:49.469> and<00:05:49.770> if<00:05:49.830> it's<00:05:49.979> any<00:05:50.099> good<00:05:50.190> then

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
added extra and if it's any good then

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.330

through<00:06:10.530> the<00:06:10.770> single-player<00:06:11.340> at<00:06:11.639> like<00:06:12.389> a

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
through the single-player at like a

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:14.779 
through the single-player at like a
co-op<00:06:12.870> campaign<00:06:13.199> which<00:06:13.770> i<00:06:13.919> think<00:06:13.979> is<00:06:14.250> a<00:06:14.280> really

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:14.789 
co-op campaign which i think is a really

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:17.240 
co-op campaign which i think is a really
good<00:06:14.969> idea<00:06:15.000> and<00:06:15.630> the<00:06:16.560> player<00:06:16.770> doesn't<00:06:17.039> even

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
good idea and the player doesn't even

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.189 
good idea and the player doesn't even

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 
actually have to have the game in order

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:21.469 
actually have to have the game in order
to<00:06:19.380> play<00:06:19.560> with<00:06:20.039> you<00:06:20.250> you<00:06:20.460> just<00:06:20.880> need<00:06:21.000> one<00:06:21.030> copy

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
to play with you you just need one copy

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:23.029 
to play with you you just need one copy
of<00:06:21.630> the<00:06:21.780> game<00:06:21.990> and<00:06:22.199> the<00:06:22.259> other<00:06:22.289> guy<00:06:22.590> can<00:06:22.830> just

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 
of the game and the other guy can just

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:25.399 
of the game and the other guy can just
join<00:06:23.280> in<00:06:23.520> with<00:06:23.699> you<00:06:23.909> and<00:06:24.120> end<00:06:24.780> up<00:06:24.960> stomping

somebody<00:06:31.680> halfway<00:06:31.919> across<00:06:32.310> the<00:06:32.870> across<00:06:33.870> the

somebody halfway across the across the

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.050 
somebody halfway across the across the
location<00:06:34.710> then<00:06:34.860> you<00:06:34.889> can<00:06:35.190> do<00:06:35.400> that<00:06:35.610> I<00:06:35.849> think

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
location then you can do that I think

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.580 
location then you can do that I think
that's<00:06:36.330> a<00:06:36.389> really<00:06:36.659> cool<00:06:36.810> step<00:06:37.080> from<00:06:37.259> Sony<00:06:37.500> it

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
that's a really cool step from Sony it

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:38.719 
that's a really cool step from Sony it
remains<00:06:37.830> to<00:06:37.919> be<00:06:37.949> seen<00:06:38.069> as<00:06:38.370> to<00:06:38.460> whether<00:06:38.610> that's

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:38.729 
remains to be seen as to whether that's

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:40.309 
remains to be seen as to whether that's
going<00:06:38.880> to<00:06:38.940> be<00:06:39.000> implemented<00:06:39.449> with<00:06:39.719> the<00:06:39.750> Xbox
