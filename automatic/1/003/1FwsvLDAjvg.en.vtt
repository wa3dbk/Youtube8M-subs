the Lord crow and this is Sabourin this

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.239 
the Lord crow and this is Sabourin this
truck<00:01:34.369> is<00:01:34.399> very<00:01:34.939> bumpy<00:01:35.209> track<00:01:35.539> so<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.920> setup

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:37.249 
truck is very bumpy track so the setup

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:39.279 
truck is very bumpy track so the setup
is<00:01:37.789> very<00:01:37.850> important<00:01:38.509> to<00:01:38.539> overall<00:01:38.840> for<00:01:39.200> the

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
is very important to overall for the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.379 
is very important to overall for the
race<00:01:39.439> distance<00:01:39.950> this<00:01:40.639> is<00:01:40.789> the<00:01:40.939> mine<00:01:41.119> straight

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:41.389 
race distance this is the mine straight

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:44.410 
race distance this is the mine straight
that<00:01:42.159> will<00:01:43.159> bring<00:01:43.340> us<00:01:43.520> on<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:43.850> first<00:01:44.090> time<00:01:44.389> a

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
that will bring us on the first time a

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.809 
that will bring us on the first time a
left-hander<00:01:45.229> very<00:01:45.469> fast<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:45.979> very<00:01:46.039> bumpy<00:01:46.399> so

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
left-hander very fast and very bumpy so

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:49.090 
left-hander very fast and very bumpy so
be<00:01:46.999> careful<00:01:47.450> on<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:48.259> head<00:01:48.409> seat<00:01:48.649> overall

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
be careful on the head seat overall

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.160 
be careful on the head seat overall
don't<00:01:49.340> use<00:01:49.490> much<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:50.060> curve<00:01:50.270> then<00:01:50.959> we<00:01:51.079> are

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
don't use much the curve then we are

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.709 
don't use much the curve then we are
right<00:01:51.289> to<00:01:51.469> the<00:01:51.590> first<00:01:51.799> she<00:01:52.039> can<00:01:52.479> very<00:01:53.479> slow

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
right to the first she can very slow

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:55.239 
right to the first she can very slow
shika<00:01:54.109> don't<00:01:54.380> use<00:01:54.529> much<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:54.950> curb<00:01:55.130> because

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:55.249 
shika don't use much the curb because

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:59.080 
shika don't use much the curb because
they<00:01:55.639> are<00:01:55.819> very<00:01:56.119> high<00:01:56.450> for<00:01:57.409> this<00:01:58.099> left-hander

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
they are very high for this left-hander

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.270 
they are very high for this left-hander
stay<00:01:59.359> inside<00:01:59.689> here<00:02:00.049> and<00:02:00.380> try<00:02:01.249> to<00:02:01.310> have<00:02:01.520> a<00:02:01.579> good

will let us always see it busy we all
have<00:02:18.209> to<00:02:18.240> defend<00:02:18.660> your<00:02:18.870> complex<00:02:19.319> of<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.709> truck

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
have to defend your complex of the truck

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.750 
have to defend your complex of the truck
to<00:02:20.130> disease<00:02:20.489> rate<00:02:20.910> so<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.230> we<00:02:22.230> bleed<00:02:22.500> us<00:02:22.760> to

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
to disease rate so that we bleed us to

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.150 
to disease rate so that we bleed us to
the<00:02:23.880> next<00:02:24.000> time<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.600> coming<00:02:24.959> up<00:02:25.140> inside<00:02:25.800> there

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
the next time the coming up inside there

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.430 
the next time the coming up inside there
and<00:02:26.400> pay<00:02:27.000> attention<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.840> acceleration

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
and pay attention to the acceleration

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.530 
and pay attention to the acceleration
because<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:29.040> truck<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.459> very<00:02:29.819> slippery<00:02:30.270> and

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
because the truck is very slippery and

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.949 
because the truck is very slippery and
it<00:02:30.989> is<00:02:31.230> easy<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.830> OST<00:02:32.520> we<00:02:33.480> are<00:02:33.569> like<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.840> the

carbon<00:02:49.260> both<00:02:49.470> this<00:02:49.860> time<00:02:50.100> because<00:02:50.280> they<00:02:50.489> are

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
carbon both this time because they are

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.660 
carbon both this time because they are
