00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.460
 I want to bring how you are welcome to 

00:00:02.239 --> 00:00:08.060
 I had it today's way this 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:11.630
 Thursday, September 12, 2013 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:14.799
 I am a kid and we are going to talk about what 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.799
 we are doing on the screen 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:26.110
 slang studios just announced that 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.110
 they are preparing the game of xavi card 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.359
 the boy of eight 'in 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.359
 carts 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.610
 let's see 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.090
 is based on the animated series that is 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.650
 coming out now with the original voices 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.720
 of animated making 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.600
 what is obviously is to do is based 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.950
 in the spirit program and that year 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.340
 past had a game in 2012 this had 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.250
 a game that looked like a mario paris 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.320
 wrong done by the way and this year 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.320
 They intend to take out a mario kart 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.310
 reasonably well done 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.030
 He's been talking to friends for a while 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.780
 in whatsapp and in greeting to Korea 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.780
 north by the way 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.860
 We were seeing who was going to choose 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.070
 what or rather they were discussing who 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.750
 has to choose which one and the net as 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.750
 Mexican unless we grew up with this 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.150
 program if it feels like that world 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.400
 it can be fun you can have things 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.630
 good you can grab a cure a 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.800
 mouse 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.800
 the priest have fun 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.900
 I do not think it's a failure like the kid 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.950
 previous in the game of chavo for wii 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:52.580
 earlier it also seems that they are 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.440
 focusing on place on playstation 3 and on 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.860
 xbox 360 which is a platform on which 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.310
 is going to come out no longer so much for wii and for 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.280
 another side looks good you see that you play 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.120
 well that is the weird thing is done with the 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.369
 threshold in game 3 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.440
 as for the mechanics I do not think that 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.990
 someone does not know them at this point 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.760
 of the match 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.390
 your racing game with cars 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.580
 customized for each character 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.160
 you grab items along the tracks 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.910
 the clues obviously with obstacles the 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.010
 items range from bowling balls to piÃ±atas 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.250
 pillows to protect your butt 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.180
 as the shells did in mario kart 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.079
 Newspaper 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.670
 spicy chili peppers that are the turbos 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:42.030
 all this kind of things the powers that 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.060
 we already know adapted to the world of the show 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.940
 so 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.670
 It does not look bad 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.830
 it does not look bad the detail that I see them 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:56.590
 it is the price 60 dollars 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:03:00.280
 800 pesos 799 pesos I do something high 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.980
 for what it is whether or not I say that a 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.680
 Mario Kart must cost 800 pesos or a 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.540
 thousand pesos but it is a car or neighborhood 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.610
 we know there is a lot of work and 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.440
 back right now we are trusting that 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.660
 it's white is going to be a good job with 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.790
 the organ already in three the license of the 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:20.410
 kid and copying mario's formula 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:25.160
 kart let's hope so but there's nothing 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:28.220
 original here then because 800 pesos 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.200
 when he sends that is what I bring 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.320
 for today there are 12 characters 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.050
 choose this there are different circuits 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.600
 obviously they go from chapultepec to 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.530
 tangamandapio the small town of jaimito el 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.930
 postman 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:47.810
 and well I do not have an exit date but 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.810
 There they can check what 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.810
 but for the note 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.540
 Goodnight
