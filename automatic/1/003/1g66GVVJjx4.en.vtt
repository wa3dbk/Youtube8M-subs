the<00:00:16.660> reason<00:00:17.080> we<00:00:17.410> want<00:00:17.920> to<00:00:18.010> show<00:00:18.190> this<00:00:18.369> is<00:00:18.550> we

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:18.700 
the reason we want to show this is we

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.430 
the reason we want to show this is we
want<00:00:18.910> to<00:00:18.970> show<00:00:19.240> that<00:00:19.270> first<00:00:20.020> of<00:00:20.140> all<00:00:20.260> there

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:20.440 
want to show that first of all there

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.320 
want to show that first of all there
naturally<00:00:20.650> it<00:00:21.099> was<00:00:21.250> a<00:00:21.279> therapeutic<00:00:21.760> paddock

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
naturally it was a therapeutic paddock

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.210 
naturally it was a therapeutic paddock
which<00:00:22.480> would<00:00:22.660> look<00:00:22.869> that<00:00:23.080> let<00:00:23.650> that<00:00:23.830> tree<00:00:24.099> up

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
which would look that let that tree up

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.359 
which would look that let that tree up
off<00:00:24.400> the<00:00:24.580> back<00:00:24.869> considerably<00:00:25.869> more<00:00:26.140> but<00:00:26.859> the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369 
off the back considerably more but the

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.130 
off the back considerably more but the
bear<00:00:27.580> tree<00:00:27.939> and<00:00:28.119> of<00:00:28.269> course<00:00:28.300> how<00:00:28.750> the<00:00:28.810> weight

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
bear tree and of course how the weight

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.130 
bear tree and of course how the weight
is<00:00:29.320> distributed<00:00:29.500> evenly<00:00:30.250> along<00:00:30.939> the<00:00:30.970> bars<00:00:31.689> on

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
is distributed evenly along the bars on

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.530 
is distributed evenly along the bars on
both<00:00:32.169> sides<00:00:32.830> without<00:00:33.700> any<00:00:33.970> kind<00:00:34.390> of

interference or pressing into the loin

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.900 
interference or pressing into the loin
however<00:00:37.899> we<00:00:38.590> placed<00:00:38.950> that<00:00:39.070> saddle<00:00:39.670> far

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
however we placed that saddle far

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.119 
however we placed that saddle far
forward<00:00:40.480> so<00:00:40.660> we've<00:00:40.840> designed<00:00:41.260> it<00:00:41.950> with<00:00:42.100> a

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
forward so we've designed it with a

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.520 
forward so we've designed it with a
tremendous<00:00:42.520> amount<00:00:43.059> of<00:00:43.180> flare<00:00:43.539> at<00:00:44.079> the<00:00:44.140> front

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
tremendous amount of flare at the front

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.350 
tremendous amount of flare at the front

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
the tree bar so the bad horses shoulder

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.990 
the tree bar so the bad horses shoulder
really<00:00:49.750> can<00:00:50.050> rotate<00:00:50.410> freely<00:00:51.129> without<00:00:51.489> any

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.100 
now if we ask Amanda and we're going to
here<00:03:12.770> to<00:03:13.610> assume<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.150> correct<00:03:14.540> equitation

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.430 
going to be moving three or four inches
further<00:03:19.670> back<00:03:20.060> so<00:03:20.420> that's<00:03:21.019> where<00:03:21.290> this

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
further back so that's where this

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.740 
further back so that's where this
typical<00:03:21.950> saddle<00:03:22.400> actually<00:03:22.910> places<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.510> rider

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
right in the weak point you see how

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.930 
right in the weak point you see how
Belle<00:03:25.760> suddenly<00:03:26.269> doesn't<00:03:26.660> want<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:27.140> move<00:03:27.940> over

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
and and you see how Amanda doesn't stay

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.009 
and and you see how Amanda doesn't stay
very<00:03:31.430> well<00:03:31.760> balanced<00:03:32.209> she<00:03:32.420> hasn't<00:03:32.630> got<00:03:32.989> the

very well balanced she hasn't got the

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.590 
very well balanced she hasn't got the

stirrups or the cantle or the reins to

stirrups or the cantle or the reins to
really<00:03:36.050> depend<00:03:36.470> upon<00:03:36.769> for<00:03:36.800> balance<00:03:37.400> and<00:03:37.640> so

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
really depend upon for balance and so

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.970 
really depend upon for balance and so
it's<00:03:38.300> very<00:03:38.420> difficult<00:03:38.750> for<00:03:39.230> her<00:03:39.380> to<00:03:39.410> balance

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
it's very difficult for her to balance

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.830 
it's very difficult for her to balance

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:56.990 
let's see where those we have the
stirrup<00:05:55.710> so<00:05:56.039> that<00:05:56.220> they<00:05:56.370> follow<00:05:56.580> exactly

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
stirrup so that they follow exactly

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.570 
stirrup so that they follow exactly
where<00:05:57.419> the<00:05:57.570> riders<00:05:57.960> foot<00:05:58.229> wants<00:05:58.590> to<00:05:58.710> fall<00:05:58.979> if

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
where the riders foot wants to fall if

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.430 
where the riders foot wants to fall if
she<00:05:59.880> were<00:06:00.000> riding<00:06:00.449> without<00:06:00.750> the<00:06:00.930> support<00:06:01.349> of

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
she were riding without the support of

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.580 
she were riding without the support of
stirrups<00:06:01.860> and<00:06:02.180> that's<00:06:03.180> the<00:06:03.330> idea<00:06:03.720> is<00:06:04.020> to<00:06:04.289> not

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
stirrups and that's the idea is to not

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.939 
stirrups and that's the idea is to not
count<00:06:04.949> on<00:06:05.220> your<00:06:05.370> stirrups<00:06:05.789> for<00:06:05.909> support<00:06:06.949> but

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:07.949 
count on your stirrups for support but

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:10.790 
count on your stirrups for support but
merely<00:06:08.280> to<00:06:08.580> have<00:06:08.789> them<00:06:09.090> there<00:06:09.360> for<00:06:09.800> the

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
merely to have them there for the

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.240 
merely to have them there for the
Elektra<00:06:11.430> stability

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
Elektra stability

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.760 
Elektra stability
now<00:06:14.250> if<00:06:14.550> Amanda<00:06:15.030> were<00:06:15.180> to<00:06:15.539> want<00:06:16.260> to<00:06:16.470> pick<00:06:16.650> her

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
now if Amanda were to want to pick her

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.040 
now if Amanda were to want to pick her
stirrups<00:06:17.159> up<00:06:17.340> again<00:06:17.669> she<00:06:18.449> wouldn't<00:06:18.750> have<00:06:18.870> any

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
stirrups up again she wouldn't have any

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.719 
stirrups up again she wouldn't have any
problem<00:06:19.409> doing<00:06:19.680> so<00:06:19.860> because<00:06:20.159> the<00:06:20.370> stirrups

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
problem doing so because the stirrups

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:33.010 
problem doing so because the stirrups
right<00:06:20.970> where<00:06:21.210> her<00:06:21.449> leg<00:06:21.630> wants<00:06:21.960> to<00:06:21.990> fall

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.080
