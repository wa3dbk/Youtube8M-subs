00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Hi, friends, you are welcome to another 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.330
 recipe from the university cook today 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.300
 we are going to eat some egg baskets 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.220
 creamy for that we need two sheets 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.430
 of pasta brick butter in ointment 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:20.000
 Three fresh eggs 2 cloves of garlic 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:24.740
 minced as you are seeing 4 gambones 1 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:29.480
 without peeling half a glass of liquid cream 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:32.110
 cream of the prawns oil paprika 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.420
 sweet and salt 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.280
 we make a space the table we take the 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.630
 sheets of pasta brick and what are we going to 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.510
 to do is put butter on it 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.670
 ointment butter 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.769
 and what we are going is to go throwing 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.710
 butter to the whole leaf we already have 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:53.289
 the entire sheet of pasta brick with the 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.019
 butter and we put another one in the 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.489
 what we do is hit him while 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.089
 let's do this we preheat the 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.860
 180 degree oven worth we take another 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.010
 little bit of butter and we put it on 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.920
 at the bottom 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.400
 of our bowl and what we do is already 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.410
 very easy we put the sheet on top and what 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.500
 what are we going to do is a basket you have 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:19.050
 that get a thing like this and 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.180
 we put it in the oven for 34 minutes 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:26.370
 they are very aware because it is very 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:29.200
 quickly we take the chocolates and we're going to 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.810
 remove the black part 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.799
 and it's where he has the dirt we make him 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.750
 a small cut you are seeing for 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.090
 the tip of the knife is removed jce 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.070
 while I do this, tell you the cream of 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.670
 AmbÃ³n is the one I've made of the following 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.939
 way I've picked the husks from those who 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.740
 I have peeled both the head and the part 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.929
 I put it in a pot 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.350
 like the cup of that of the beatles that 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:58.569
 I have water I have left cooking 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.490
 for about 58 minutes and it happened to the 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.799
 blender and after the blender I 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.409
 past a cone and it has stayed like 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.329
 you are well past those 3 minutes and 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.729
 being very careful according to the oven and 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:14.269
 this is the result of the fed 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.340
 a pan and we give it a flame 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.170
 we have the hot pan and we add 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.090
 like a spoonful of olive oil 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.909
 we put in the center and what we're going to 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.100
 do is make charcoal grilled le 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:28.250
 we turn around 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.200
 do it a lot we remove it and like smell 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.950
 we do not have it hot we are going to leave it 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.360
 there so that it does not cool we add a 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.440
 little bit more olive oil 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.550
 we toss the garlic 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.850
 and fry them a little bit, chop the 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.850
 gambones 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.100
 and we laugh another little 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.690
 we already have all but let that together 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.330
 a little bit this is one of the secrets 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.640
 of this dish that is a little bit and 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.640
 we add 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.680
 we put a little bit of paprika and 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.130
 we mix everything is cream reduced a 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.790
 little that does not reduce much and we throw the 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.600
 Huev a little bit of salt and a little 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.600
 Modena vinegar 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.010
 there it is like a spoonful more or less 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.439
 and now what we do 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.120
 It is to mix it up and make a scrambled and 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:24.400
 we have it set and now what 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:28.209
 we make another pan 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.400
 and we add the cream is I have it already 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.659
 linked to the only thing that I will do will be 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.129
 heat it up a little that it reduce so that 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:35.049
 I thickened if the time very liquid that 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.939
 you have to pour a mixture of flour and 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.269
 oil you have to throw what little by little 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:43.349
 until you get the thickness you want 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:50.200
 we have a dish salseamos in the center 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:53.500
 we put the tulip add the scrambled 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.800
 we put the shrimp on it we are a 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.300
 little parsley 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:04.400
 and we would have the dish recipe 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.400
 of the university cook until then 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.010
