00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:24.410
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:28.369
 there are more others today 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:32.570
 breaks in again and that's what I do 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:35.360
 never wanted to act with yogurt the culprit 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.010
 I had the okay to do the most popular 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.790
 I'm not really me right now 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.739
 so referent of broccoli trial 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.739
 equivalent may surprise us 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:54.680
 not ready to talk but that 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.680
 Just go ahead and sound 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.140
 just add directly to barroso 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.759
 for the broccoli minced meat with noodles 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:09.939
 yogurt we need the following ingredients 

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:11.940
 of course, broccoli noodle some butter 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:16.320
 minced meat 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:21.150
 yogurt small cut onion small 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.570
 chopped garlic salt and pepper and 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.620
 also some paprika powder yes thats 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.140
 preparing the ingredients is always going to be that way 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.560
 First we mix the yoghurt with it 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.560
 the garlic 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:45.530
 Stir the set quite well that 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.610
 in the fridge to the other too 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.020
 I'm done 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.290
 then I have the butter in one 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.210
 Heat the pan and fry in it 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.369
 now the onions on so they glazed 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.600
 become 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.549
 I have to say I have it now 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.560
 in my opinion, as a recipe 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.399
 is that a bit too much butter and me 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.780
 that will also be noted in the recipe but 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.140
 I just do it the way it does 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.650
 stands and changes one can 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.650
 always do 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.850
 In any case, I find something too much 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.010
 also like to noodle the normal after 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.980
 cooking instructions 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.610
 they are now boiling in the water too 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.670
 while I'm doing this but that 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.489
 is in the recipe even today will be 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.950

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.190
 to the believing onion comes to that 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.190
 minced meat 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.930
 and that is fried then nice 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.930
 cheerfully 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:06.099
 the whole is then seasoned with salt and 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.099
 pepper 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.910
 the noodles we still continue cooking 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:21.480
 in the water and where the last seven 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:25.550
 eight minutes are the only the 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.870
 broccoli florets with the 1 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.370
 I have to say I have that now 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.370
 had finally made public the 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.980

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.890
 I can sometimes a bit more 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.620

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.220

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:57.120
 cover it up and leave that alone 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.950
 the rest of the time and then cook 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.970

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.109
 remaining butter will melt it 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.270
