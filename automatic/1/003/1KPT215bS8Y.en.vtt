00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.510
 hello girls guys how are we good 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.270
 because today I bring you a video very very very 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.420
 very strange then and I will explain the 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.420
 reason 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.890
 and good morning that the people of the street 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.180
 People who come here to the store etc 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.180
 etc etc to my business 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.000
 but let's go back they say yes I've 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.370
 put in my hair if I made wicks 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.150
 he gave me sodas and so on and so forth 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:36.449
 etcetera and I'm going to teach you because to 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:39.900
 that you see my hair with light is worth 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:42.090
 that I do not cut it like a river that gets 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.489
 since summer I'm not cutting myself 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.310
 but I do not go to the hairdresser and I 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.590
 Well, I have just a lock here 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:53.460
 He cited caritas but then the rest is 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:57.210
 my natural hair as you can see is the 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.940
 tone that you saw so my hair color 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.570
 natural and what is where is the 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.660
 tip to tip yes that I have some reflection 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.820
 of when good in summer tells me of 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.880
 those reflections with blond I say with 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.720
 with cap and ruby by God the strip 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.370
 the blonde to be seen I admit that they put a 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.760
 blond in your life 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.730
 well then total that have occurred 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.860
 a series of I'm in puberty girls 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.720
 that I'm in puberty let's see if 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.130
 are producing in my person some 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.750
 hormonal changes of the mother so 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.180
 I went to the doctor and said to myself 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.160
 will have done a complete analytics for 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.990
 see how progesterone was like 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.270
 I was on estrogen et cetera etcetera 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.980
 etcetera then it turns out that the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.680
 Progesterone levels have to be 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.000
 if the estrogen levels are very 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.250
 highs can lower the levels of 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.220
 progesterone and it will be progesterone is 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.260
 very high because he also has that technique 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.420
 that is regulated but that I have some 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.670
 indications of progesterone so a little 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.070
 elevated 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.540
 it has its good part and its part in bad 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.220
 Then I clearly told the doctor how 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.050
 probe that those who attend you but 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.000
 right away they do not give you more explanations 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.430
 do not worry are you a little 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.910
 elevated progesterone but quiet 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.730
 because it's normal in type changes 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.150
 hormone and apart from that he asks me if 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.400
 I look like stress, I say a lot of good 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.500
 I've been living a little bit I'll see 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.730
 if I have the beginnings of progesterone 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.280
 they are so high I say to see what can be 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.550
 good first a high excess of 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.550
 stress 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:44.230
 can cause a good or the other way around or a 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.810
 high level of progesterone can elevate 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.060
 the one that I have moments that I am like 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.960
 a motorbike that seems to be the age of 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.000
 puberty and then physical changes already 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.970
 you remember that you are talking about 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.700
 body odor is because I'm noticing 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.940
 physical changes in my person ie 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.640
 first the skin the skin can have a 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.890
 consequence I have a super good skin 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.110
 that is, I see photographs of myself 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.180
 ten years and yes it shows that I have 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.500
 that someone else has a change my skin 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.130
 is 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.020
 really super glowing even 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.610
 with my face washed I look great and 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.130
 it's not that I presume about it is that the 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.850
 true but it is also true that my 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.910
 hair is getting more blonde 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.780
 Of course I am myopic lost then of 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:37.240
 near or very well and since the year 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.060
 1988 I wear contact lenses and the 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.720
 glasses that I have around here is that if 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.610
 I see well from afar then up close no 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.350
 of others in ungur so I have to 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.960
 walk around putting on my contact lenses 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.820
 to be able to see from afar because they are 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.060
 myopia lenses because I have myopia 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:58.120
 but clear close then then for 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.730
 sew me my glasses if I do not see it 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.950
 well because the glasses I do not like 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.770
 then the glasses I refuse and the 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.690
 progressive -9 what happens then can you 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.630
 cause part of these things well 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.890
 as to stay of the hair then also 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.900
 may occur at moments 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.030
 determined you can have a vision of 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.770
 lynx and get up by branch say that 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.770
 good I see or blurred vision 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.190
 not this because I know because I noticed 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:28.160
 very strange things in my body is to say 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:31.610
 a feeling that fuck the 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.080
 spring will be the menopause that will be is 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.870
 say everyone is cold and I 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:40.400
 I have good heat because this girls is a 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:43.040
 symptom of having high progesterone is 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:47.480
 say to see if I get the balance 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.640
 between progesterone and estrogen but 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.770
 theoretically I have the same effects 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.470
 that I can have a babe in the age of 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:58.030
 puberty yes because sometimes I also 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:01.370
 it comes out or I have skin super well but 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:04.660
 depending on the revolution I can 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.680
 leave the odd granite so that 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.050
 I have never liked it on top 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.650
 dye my hair my natural color 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:15.170
 It has always been the one you see here 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.210
 that today dyes that I really go 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.430
 to make some reflections but what is it 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.740
 impressive what has been clarified to me 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.590
 hair 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.090
 and I said I say but what shampoo if I 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.080
 I use the fruit of the arn and all the 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.379
 life yes yes 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.750
 the one that I'm going back to puberty 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:36.509
 my mother is but this is the part 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:39.900
 positive of the estrogen 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:43.580
 high but of course I do not tell you the part 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.580
 negative that is when they are put 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:50.529
 or you swell or hold fluid a 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:53.139
 very rare thing they say it's like 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:55.809
 door at the entrance to menopause that 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:58.059
 first it's as if you went back 

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:58.989
 or around forwards after 

00:05:58.059 --> 00:06:02.139
 Sudden back 

00:05:58.989 --> 00:06:05.499
 I read so much on the subject that a mess 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:08.319
 Now that's what the hair is more 

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:11.780
 clear or I guarantee it and that the skin 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:14.389
 I have the divine of death too 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:18.950
 and I use the usual tabs more 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:21.880
 long and strengthens lashes with iu and 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.880
 there are people who have to put 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.229
 progesterone indices 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:32.320
 or I would be a solution for 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.320
 get what terms a little kiss
