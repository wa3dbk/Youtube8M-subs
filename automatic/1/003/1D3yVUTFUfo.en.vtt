00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.869 
it's a funky one a five D for G 2 and B
3<00:00:51.230> but<00:00:52.230> if<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.800> don't<00:00:53.070> feel<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:53.489> playing

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
3 but if you don't feel like playing

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:04.729 
3 but if you don't feel like playing
that<00:01:02.390> right<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.570> that's<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.899> intro<00:01:04.199> night<00:01:04.470> I

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
that right and that's the intro night I

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.200 
that right and that's the intro night I
think<00:01:05.100> they<00:01:05.159> also<00:01:05.280> play<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.580> couple<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.970> times

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
think they also play a couple of times

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.609 
think they also play a couple of times
in<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> middle<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> song<00:01:07.140> but<00:01:07.380> I'm<00:01:07.500> not

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.250 

and<00:02:12.320> then<00:02:12.470> you<00:02:12.590> go<00:02:12.740> up<00:02:12.770> to<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.280> 8th<00:02:13.400> fret<00:02:14.260> and

and then you go up to the 8th fret and

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.040 
and then you go up to the 8th fret and
you<00:02:15.680> put<00:02:15.860> your<00:02:15.950> finger<00:02:16.130> of<00:02:16.460> the<00:02:16.880> a<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:18.020> D

you put your finger of the a and D

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:33.070 
you put your finger of the a and D
strings<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:20.080> I'll<00:02:21.080> just<00:02:21.320> move<00:02:21.470> my<00:02:21.530> guitar<00:02:32.080> I'm

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
strings and I'll just move my guitar I'm

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.280 
strings and I'll just move my guitar I'm
doing<00:02:33.350> that<00:02:33.470> but<00:02:33.800> essentially<00:02:34.780> it's<00:02:35.780> pretty

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
doing that but essentially it's pretty

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.750 
doing that but essentially it's pretty
similar<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.740> what<00:02:36.860> we<00:02:37.070> were<00:02:37.160> doing<00:02:37.400> up<00:02:37.490> in<00:02:37.610> the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
similar to what we were doing up in the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.070 
similar to what we were doing up in the
sixth<00:02:38.060> fret<00:02:38.209> at<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.510> beginning<00:02:38.840> of<00:02:38.900> this

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
sixth fret at the beginning of this

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.770 
sixth fret at the beginning of this
phrase<00:02:39.490> but<00:02:40.490> you're<00:02:41.150> adding<00:02:41.270> your<00:02:41.450> little

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
phrase but you're adding your little

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:55.060 
phrase but you're adding your little
finger<00:02:42.080> in<00:02:42.200> on<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:52.570> like<00:02:53.570> that<00:02:53.830> and<00:02:54.830> then

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
finger in on the like that and then

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.130 
finger in on the like that and then
you'll<00:02:55.550> do<00:02:55.790> a<00:02:56.000> similar<00:02:56.330> slide<00:02:56.720> to<00:02:56.900> what<00:02:57.019> you

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
you'll do a similar slide to what you

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.930 
you'll do a similar slide to what you
were<00:02:57.230> doing<00:02:57.260> before<00:02:57.500> that's<00:02:57.920> on<00:02:58.160> six<00:02:58.519> and

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
were doing before that's on six and

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.550 
were doing before that's on six and
eight

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.800 

and<00:03:04.250> that's<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:05.800> spirit<00:03:06.800> of<00:03:07.160> verse<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:08.690> then

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
and that's the spirit of verse and then

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.210 
and that's the spirit of verse and then
this<00:03:08.959> kind<00:03:09.140> of<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.260> chorus<00:03:09.620> II<00:03:09.800> bitch<00:03:10.010> which

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
the 8th fret and then you go into the

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.340 
the 8th fret and then you go into the
same<00:04:24.370> chord<00:04:25.370> again<00:04:25.750> unless<00:04:26.750> I<00:04:27.110> think<00:04:27.289> you

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
same chord again unless I think you

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.070 
same chord again unless I think you
repeat<00:04:27.560> that<00:04:27.650> four<00:04:27.950> times<00:04:28.220> in<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:28.669> chorus<00:04:29.080> and

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
repeat that four times in the chorus and

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.189 
repeat that four times in the chorus and
then<00:04:30.229> you'll<00:04:30.410> just<00:04:30.740> go<00:04:30.860> into<00:04:30.979> the<00:04:31.160> verse

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
then you'll just go into the verse

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.899 
then you'll just go into the verse
that<00:04:34.300> pretty<00:04:35.300> much<00:04:35.689> most<00:04:35.990> of<00:04:36.169> the<00:04:36.289> song<00:04:36.529> there

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:36.909 
that pretty much most of the song there

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.300 
that pretty much most of the song there
I<00:04:37.909> think<00:04:38.599> again<00:04:39.439> that<00:04:39.710> this<00:04:39.830> is<00:04:39.889> the<00:04:40.159> only

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
I think again that this is the only

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.189 
I think again that this is the only
tutorial<00:04:40.969> out<00:04:41.090> there<00:04:41.330> and<00:04:41.539> I'm<00:04:41.629> willing<00:04:41.870> to<00:04:41.990> be
