what we're looking at here is a
mechanical<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.629> diesel<00:00:07.379> lift<00:00:07.560> pump<00:00:07.849> this<00:00:08.849> is

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
mechanical the diesel lift pump this is

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.990 
mechanical the diesel lift pump this is
engine<00:00:09.300> driven<00:00:09.540> off<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.139> can<00:00:10.670> sucks<00:00:11.670> fuel

engine driven off the can sucks fuel

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.220 
engine driven off the can sucks fuel
from<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:12.960> fuel<00:00:13.110> tank<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.860> pushes<00:00:14.820> it<00:00:14.849> through

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
from the fuel tank and pushes it through

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.950 
from the fuel tank and pushes it through
the<00:00:16.230> diesel<00:00:16.560> filter<00:00:16.800> into<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.960> diesel

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
the diesel filter into the diesel

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:28.040 
the diesel filter into the diesel
injector<00:00:19.740> pump<00:00:25.970> it's<00:00:26.970> retained<00:00:27.330> by<00:00:27.480> two<00:00:27.539> bolts

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
injector pump it's retained by two bolts

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.580 
injector pump it's retained by two bolts
on<00:00:28.340> the<00:00:29.340> side<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.449> cylinder<00:00:31.080> block<00:00:33.590> okay

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
on the side of the cylinder block okay

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.840 
on the side of the cylinder block okay
now<00:00:34.860> we're<00:00:35.010> going<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.219> pull<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.430> out<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.730> have

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
now we're going to pull it out and have

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.540 
now we're going to pull it out and have
a<00:00:35.880> look<00:00:36.000> at<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:37.100> what<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.219> notice<00:00:38.399> here

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
a look at this and what you notice here

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.260 
a look at this and what you notice here
is<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.239> lever<00:00:39.980> which<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.010> operated<00:00:41.790> by<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.940> cam

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
is a lever which is operated by the cam

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.979 
is a lever which is operated by the cam
and<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.930> hand<00:00:43.140> pull<00:00:43.789> use<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.969> hand<00:00:45.180> primer<00:00:45.420> to

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
and the hand pull use the hand primer to

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.459 
and the hand pull use the hand primer to
prime<00:00:46.320> up<00:00:46.680> diesel<00:00:46.950> fill<00:00:47.390> such<00:00:48.390> an<00:00:48.539> action<00:00:48.719> okay

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
prime up diesel fill such an action okay

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.740 
prime up diesel fill such an action okay
you<00:00:49.530> can<00:00:49.800> see<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:49.980> lever<00:00:50.280> moving<00:00:50.700> there<00:00:50.879> now

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
you can see the lever moving there now

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.720 
you can see the lever moving there now
if<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.320> lever<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.770> upward<00:00:53.039> position

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
if the lever is in the upward position

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.680 
if the lever is in the upward position
it<00:00:53.789> won't<00:00:54.239> prime<00:00:54.949> the<00:00:55.949> reason<00:00:56.280> for<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.579> if<00:00:57.570> we

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
it won't prime the reason for this if we

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.860 
it won't prime the reason for this if we
look<00:00:57.840> at<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> cam<00:00:58.289> right<00:00:59.100> in<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.329> middle<00:01:00.539> of

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
look at a cam right in the middle of

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.850 
look at a cam right in the middle of
those<00:01:01.379> three<00:01:02.059> is<00:01:03.059> what's<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.840> lever<00:01:04.110> then<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
those three is what's the lever then the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.460 
those three is what's the lever then the
lift<00:01:05.010> pump<00:01:05.250> runs<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.210> right<00:01:07.020> you've<00:01:07.260> got<00:01:07.439> a

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
lift pump runs on right you've got a

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.149 
lift pump runs on right you've got a
high<00:01:07.650> point<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:09.030> low<00:01:09.150> point<00:01:09.799> now<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.860> can

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
high point and a low point now you can

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.700 
high point and a low point now you can
see<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.430> high<00:01:11.520> point<00:01:11.820> coming<00:01:12.090> up<00:01:12.299> here<00:01:12.710> okay

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
see the high point coming up here okay

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.450 
see the high point coming up here okay
as<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.920> turn<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.310> cam<00:01:14.549> around<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:16.189> at<00:01:17.189> that

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
as I turn the cam around and at that

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.289 
as I turn the cam around and at that
point<00:01:18.590> that<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.830> where<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.580> lever<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:20.970> up

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
point that is where the lever is in up

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.700 
point that is where the lever is in up
position

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.740 

so<00:01:28.640> when<00:01:29.420> priming<00:01:30.400> you<00:01:31.400> want<00:01:31.700> to<00:01:31.970> have<00:01:32.240> you

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
so when priming you want to have you

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.140 
so when priming you want to have you
leave<00:01:33.200> it<00:01:33.380> which<00:01:33.500> runs<00:01:33.799> on<00:01:33.920> a<00:01:33.979> cam<00:01:34.340> on<00:01:34.610> the

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
leave it which runs on a cam on the

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.980 
leave it which runs on a cam on the
lowest<00:01:35.630> point<00:01:35.930> of<00:01:36.140> account<00:01:37.600> so<00:01:38.600> how<00:01:38.930> you

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
lowest point of account so how you

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.680 
lowest point of account so how you
achieve<00:01:39.409> this<00:01:39.619> is<00:01:40.150> voiding<00:01:41.150> your<00:01:41.360> engine

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
achieve this is voiding your engine

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.730 
achieve this is voiding your engine
around<00:01:42.640> until<00:01:43.640> you<00:01:44.509> get<00:01:44.690> positive<00:01:45.020> action<00:01:45.560> on

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
around until you get positive action on

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.850 
around until you get positive action on
the<00:01:46.070> hand<00:01:46.250> prime<00:01:46.520> 11th<00:01:47.149> all<00:01:47.810> right<00:01:48.520> now<00:01:49.520> a

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
the hand prime 11th all right now a

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.639 
the hand prime 11th all right now a
little<00:01:51.970> sneak<00:01:52.970> peek<00:01:53.420> behind<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:54.140> plate<00:01:54.380> here

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
little sneak peek behind the plate here

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.670 
little sneak peek behind the plate here
is<00:01:54.740> the<00:01:54.860> gasket<00:01:55.430> lower<00:01:55.970> part<00:01:56.270> is<00:01:56.360> raised<00:01:56.690> that

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
is the gasket lower part is raised that

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.940 
is the gasket lower part is raised that
provides<00:01:58.070> an<00:01:58.490> autotroph<00:01:58.940> for<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.630> pump<00:02:00.530> oil

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
provides an autotroph for the pump oil

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:15.050 
provides an autotroph for the pump oil
