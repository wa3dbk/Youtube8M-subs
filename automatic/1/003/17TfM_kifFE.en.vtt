00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.410 
I don't know but it took a significant
amount<00:02:48.070> of<00:02:48.250> time<00:02:48.459> but<00:02:49.360> on<00:02:49.660> a<00:02:50.070> good<00:02:51.070> note<00:02:51.420> this

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
amount of time but on a good note this

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.140 
amount of time but on a good note this
is<00:02:52.600> this<00:02:53.049> should<00:02:53.350> last<00:02:53.590> me<00:02:53.799> for<00:02:54.220> about<00:02:54.370> two
