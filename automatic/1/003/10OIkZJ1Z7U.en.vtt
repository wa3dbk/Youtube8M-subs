00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.880
 is requested by a user friend of mine from 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.040
 mayo.el gÃ³mez 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.530
 and then I will do it you can 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.160
 ask for tutorials but if I do not know how to do 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.890
 the d 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.480
 I will have to master that trick to be able to 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.610
 do the tutorial 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.850
 so if it's not authorial it's because that 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.460
 trick I do not have it dominated 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.960
 good 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:06.760
 this trick is very simple is level 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:10.390
 half beginner 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:13.770
 and it's about taking our foot off 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:17.280
 on top of the box to the other side 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.110
 to start as tip since it's not a 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:25.230
 trick that is required 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:27.480
 an essential skill you can do it 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:33.080
 on the normal floor with the feet in 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.080
 pedals and start to take something like that 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.360
 well as tips we could do to 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:54.950
 start this type then at the time of 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:58.130
 make bread and take out the foot we should do 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.390
 the bunny raise the wheel and when it's 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:05.040
 raising the wheel pass the foot 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.220
 here 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.040
 which foot we must pass good if you 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.770
 you ride with the left foot in front 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.590
 As it is my case, I should take my foot 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.260
 left to the other side 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.840
 if you mount with the right foot in front 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.790
 should take the right foot towards the 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:29.260
 another side always being as it is worth 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.260
 with the front foot 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.690
 good as advice we have this 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.980
 as other achievements I can give would be 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.730
 practicing going out on a ramp 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.049
 above all you do not see much the front 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.530
 do not have all the strength to the front 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:15.730
 and little the back as we should 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.500
 do something like that 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.500
 ask a little and one this 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:27.159
 we give him to take out his foot 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:30.030
 we move a little to the handlebar we throw a 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.030
 slightly up 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:39.820
 to pick up the foot again simply 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:42.550
 is to remove it and at the same time return to 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:46.380
 put you will already have the pedal 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:49.530
 your up and we will only have 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.530
 place it here 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.910
 I'll leave you a couple more examples for 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.910
 that you see it and above all practice
