00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.520
 the team from tijuana defeated the america 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.229
 de gustavo matosas today a goal 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.799
 by zero benedetto appeared a court 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:12.750
 synthetic where he played with the deaf only 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:16.350
 three Mexicans by birth pulling off 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.850
 with the america muñoz aguilar and peralta and 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.940
 here are the scenes of a good 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.190
 nice open felipe party is 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.440
 also us tonight and lost 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.810
 delicate there on the border lost 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.570
 trying to try to become 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.870
 front we are for an offensive team 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:39.379
 offensive now we see prefer a team 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.379
 defensive do not lose for being a little 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:44.940
 what we said gol you like this 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.399
 The most serious thing for mexico is that 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.350
 does goal now does not lose the intention of 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.719
 look for the rival framework and now do it 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.159
 the careless wanted a lot after winning 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.929
 more stopped you make a goal and if the 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:57.210
 opposing team is ordered as it was 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:59.629
 tijuana costs you a lot but if you fail 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.629
 a penalty 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.600
 because this tells you all cheerfully 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.210
 attack does not work anymore in face that you 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.310
 it arrived the same always looks at it every time 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.230
 I was watching tiguan soto when a 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.910
 backlash was imminent danger because 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.850
 no dialing is the great entrust 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:23.040
 of matosas was balancing this big 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:25.070
 what do you have with the defense and talk to 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.790
 his defensive zone to try to be 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.790
 marking in attack 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:43.740
 part of the army because it defines the two 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:50.360
 not be very clear 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.360
 benedetto but it seems little 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.130
 but it's easy for a goalkeeper because 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.630
 those heights not if it's down higher is 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.430
 complicates the goalkeeper for services 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.600
 you and american tried at the end here 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.600
 darwin quintero what's left 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:17.180
 On the left, give right because 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.180
 it is out of place 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.340
 now we must also say that just 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.769
 have 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.459
 the paseíto of the month is the game in 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:31.370
 team new players and an idea not 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.209
 it was a style hector must be rules 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.209
 let's talk 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.569
 unlike we do for others 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.120
 teams in which the technician when 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.680
 comes to the first thing he wants to do is 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.530
 arming defensively well that's not the 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.959
 note in goal try to understand your 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.879
 defensive aspect with different matosas 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.250
 with matos is different is to try to go 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.930
 towards the front try to be very 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.819
 offensive try to create the means 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.140
 goal opportunities and it's true being 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.220
 you have to work a little bit of 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.440
 defensive aspect 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.510
 but in the defensive part that what to 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.579
 sometimes people call him and in what the 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.590
 people like it and that surely a 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.410
 party decides which in the america 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.129
 action that lives in an america that goes 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.129
 overflowed to attack 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.340
 allows me to see people will have to work 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.780
 his country after science in three we said 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.340
 you have the computer transported and you do not 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.049
 they are going to make goals we already say it but 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.239
 also the 0 ordered forward to 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.799
 attacking american is attacking with much 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.490
 idea that good here is here that because 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.750
 propose 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.220
 the lack now let's hurry 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.380
 because we have little time left 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.840
 arbitration this match antonio pérez 7 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.570
 that if it sanctions the criminal well on this 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.610
 verdict is very well sanctioned there are 2 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.070
 you miss two very clear penalties one 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.930
 about pellerano we're going to see that 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.400
 it is very clear I do not understand why it is not 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.280
 they sanction because the player in fact 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.770
 goes totally over this summer 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.540
 he does not even look for the ball does not charge it 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:57.530
 in the back nobody is to see 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:00.070
 how is it so clear you think it's very 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.630
 slow but the play 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.250
 this one also wait because before 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.510
 throw away see how you get this can 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.510
 avoid it 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.880
 the one that has contact with the ball this 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.010
 it's a very clear penalty unfortunately 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.590
 Jorge's work is very irregular 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.540
 antonio pérez in this match they knew 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.070
 the pause because there is a scandalous error 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.910
 in the match of querétaro thus it is 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.910
 We will return to follow
