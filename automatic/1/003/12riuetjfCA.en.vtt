inspired<00:00:06.899> notebook<00:00:07.439> I<00:00:07.740> took<00:00:08.309> four<00:00:08.550> sheets<00:00:08.820> of

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
inspired notebook I took four sheets of

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.700 
inspired notebook I took four sheets of
cardstock<00:00:09.330> paper<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.140> glued<00:00:10.350> them<00:00:10.470> together

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
cardstock paper and glued them together

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.610 
cardstock paper and glued them together
with<00:00:11.190> this<00:00:11.370> spray<00:00:11.850> adhesive<00:00:12.480> this<00:00:13.170> will<00:00:13.410> help

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
with this spray adhesive this will help

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.010 
with this spray adhesive this will help
create<00:00:13.800> the<00:00:14.070> 3d<00:00:14.520> effect<00:00:14.940> later<00:00:15.240> on<00:00:15.450> I'll<00:00:15.720> leave

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
create the 3d effect later on I'll leave

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.960 
create the 3d effect later on I'll leave
some<00:00:16.260> alternatives<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.130> cardstock<00:00:17.430> down

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
some alternatives to the cardstock down

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.480 
some alternatives to the cardstock down
below<00:00:18.300> I'll<00:00:18.810> also<00:00:19.080> list<00:00:19.470> other<00:00:19.710> materials<00:00:20.310> and

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.750 

take<00:00:32.020> a<00:00:32.050> notebook<00:00:32.349> and<00:00:32.740> trace<00:00:33.100> it<00:00:33.310> on<00:00:33.490> the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
take a notebook and trace it on the

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.930 
take a notebook and trace it on the
cardstock<00:00:34.360> and<00:00:34.660> cut<00:00:35.080> it<00:00:35.200> with<00:00:35.320> your<00:00:35.440> scissors

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.729 

since<00:00:41.940> I'm<00:00:42.120> using<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.510> composition<00:00:43.170> notebook<00:00:43.200> I

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
since I'm using a composition notebook I

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.350 
since I'm using a composition notebook I
measured<00:00:44.130> the<00:00:44.250> width<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.790> solid<00:00:45.180> black

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
measured the width of the solid black

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.000 
measured the width of the solid black
piece<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.020> cut<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.500> piece<00:00:46.739> off<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
piece and cut that piece off the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.880 
piece and cut that piece off the
cardstock<00:00:47.700> as<00:00:47.940> well<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.840> will<00:00:49.170> help<00:00:49.230> make

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
cardstock as well this will help make

00:00:49.890 --> 00:01:00.270 
cardstock as well this will help make
the<00:00:50.129> gluing<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.550> process<00:00:51.090> easier<00:00:51.540> later<00:00:51.750> on

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.700 

once<00:01:01.270> you're<00:01:01.420> done<00:01:01.540> cutting<00:01:01.840> go<00:01:02.260> ahead<00:01:02.500> and

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
once you're done cutting go ahead and

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.410 
once you're done cutting go ahead and
see<00:01:02.860> if<00:01:02.890> it<00:01:03.280> fits<00:01:03.310> on<00:01:03.730> your<00:01:03.850> composition

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
see if it fits on your composition

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.940 
see if it fits on your composition
notebook<00:01:04.750> well<00:01:04.930> and<00:01:05.199> if<00:01:05.290> it<00:01:05.440> does<00:01:05.620> let's

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
notebook well and if it does let's

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.210 
notebook well and if it does let's
continue<00:01:06.870> get<00:01:07.870> a<00:01:07.900> ruler<00:01:08.320> and<00:01:08.470> a<00:01:08.560> pencil<00:01:08.590> and

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
continue get a ruler and a pencil and

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.950 
continue get a ruler and a pencil and
start<00:01:09.340> to<00:01:09.729> measure<00:01:09.940> out<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.210> details<00:01:10.780> of<00:01:10.900> the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
start to measure out the details of the

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.020 
start to measure out the details of the
door<00:01:11.260> I<00:01:11.470> kind<00:01:11.860> of<00:01:11.950> wing<00:01:12.220> this<00:01:12.430> process

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
door I kind of wing this process

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.610 
door I kind of wing this process
basically<00:01:13.720> you're<00:01:13.870> going<00:01:14.050> to<00:01:14.140> make<00:01:14.320> six

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
basically you're going to make six

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.969 
basically you're going to make six
squares<00:01:15.010> or<00:01:15.640> rectangles<00:01:15.720> shapes<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:17.710> first

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
squares or rectangles shapes the first

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.790 
squares or rectangles shapes the first
set<00:01:18.190> of<00:01:18.220> squares<00:01:18.670> are<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:20.020> width<00:01:20.290> of<00:01:20.500> the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
set of squares are the width of the

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.190 
set of squares are the width of the
ruler<00:01:21.100> I<00:01:21.130> used<00:01:21.520> and<00:01:21.910> an<00:01:22.119> inch<00:01:22.330> and<00:01:22.540> a<00:01:22.600> half<00:01:22.630> wide

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
ruler I used and an inch and a half wide

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.859 
ruler I used and an inch and a half wide
all<00:01:23.619> squares<00:01:24.280> and<00:01:24.580> rectangles<00:01:24.640> are<00:01:25.420> all

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
all squares and rectangles are all

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.650 
all squares and rectangles are all
roughly<00:01:26.320> an<00:01:26.590> inch<00:01:26.830> from<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.160> edges<00:01:27.430> and<00:01:27.940> about

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
roughly an inch from the edges and about

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.370 
roughly an inch from the edges and about
an<00:01:28.960> inch<00:01:29.290> and<00:01:29.560> a<00:01:29.680> half<00:01:29.710> apart<00:01:30.369> from<00:01:30.580> each<00:01:30.729> other

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
an inch and a half apart from each other

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.830 
an inch and a half apart from each other
then<00:01:32.380> my<00:01:32.530> second<00:01:32.920> set<00:01:33.130> of<00:01:33.160> rectangular<00:01:34.030> shapes

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
then my second set of rectangular shapes

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.469 
then my second set of rectangular shapes
are<00:01:35.200> two<00:01:36.040> times<00:01:36.369> the<00:01:36.640> width<00:01:36.820> of<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.210> ruler<00:01:37.450> I

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
are two times the width of the ruler I

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.450 
are two times the width of the ruler I
used<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.380> rest<00:01:38.560> is<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:38.920> same<00:01:38.950> as<00:01:39.310> the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
used and the rest is the same as the

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.310 
used and the rest is the same as the
first<00:01:39.670> set<00:01:39.940> you<00:01:40.390> can<00:01:40.570> always<00:01:40.720> pull<00:01:41.050> up<00:01:41.200> a

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
first set you can always pull up a

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.260 
first set you can always pull up a
reference<00:01:41.530> photo<00:01:41.979> of<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.399> door<00:01:42.610> in<00:01:42.880> Sherlock

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
reference photo of the door in Sherlock

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.650 
reference photo of the door in Sherlock
so<00:01:43.600> it<00:01:43.810> can<00:01:43.930> help<00:01:44.110> guide<00:01:44.470> you<00:01:44.800> in<00:01:44.860> this<00:01:45.070> process

longer<00:01:56.630> than<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:57.230> first<00:01:57.410> set<00:01:57.650> of<00:01:57.800> squares

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
longer than the first set of squares

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
squares whatever that I made have no

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.999 
squares whatever that I made have no
idea<00:02:08.420> if<00:02:08.600> I<00:02:08.750> explained<00:02:09.320> that<00:02:09.350> right<00:02:09.740> but<00:02:09.979> I

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009
