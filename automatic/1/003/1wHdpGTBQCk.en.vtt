00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
chewing on it and only thing I can think

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.870 
chewing on it and only thing I can think
of<00:00:40.450> it<00:00:40.660> is<00:00:41.140> that<00:00:41.440> on<00:00:41.800> it<00:00:42.010> could<00:00:42.190> be<00:00:42.310> the<00:00:42.400> acetone

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 
of it is that on it could be the acetone

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.479 
of it is that on it could be the acetone
I<00:00:42.910> used<00:00:43.270> to<00:00:44.050> take<00:00:44.230> off<00:00:44.470> you<00:00:44.950> know<00:00:45.070> my<00:00:45.190> builder

just like them don't have to be perfect
and<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:48.870> break<00:02:49.050> up<00:02:49.290> their<00:02:49.530> white<00:02:49.770> you<00:02:50.070> can

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
and to break up their white you can

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.000 
and to break up their white you can
leave<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.400> just<00:02:50.580> like<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:51.590> what<00:02:52.590> would<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:52.980> be

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
leave it just like that what would I be

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.660 
leave it just like that what would I be
also<00:02:53.430> i<00:02:54.060> like<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.290> off<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.920> i<00:02:56.010> went<00:02:56.250> back<00:02:56.370> in

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
also i like that off and i went back in

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.000 
also i like that off and i went back in
with<00:02:57.300> my<00:02:57.420> black<00:02:58.160> and<00:03:00.080> where<00:03:01.080> there's<00:03:01.440> white<00:03:01.740> i

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
with my black and where there's white i

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.010 
with my black and where there's white i
just<00:03:02.220> put<00:03:02.400> like<00:03:02.490> a<00:03:02.550> small<00:03:02.940> dot<00:03:03.300> on<00:03:03.540> top<00:03:03.780> of<00:03:03.900> the
