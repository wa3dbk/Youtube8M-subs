leave<00:02:40.270> it<00:02:40.390> plain<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:40.990> then<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:42.190> inside<00:02:42.640> i<00:02:42.670> did

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
leave it plain and then the inside i did

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.520 
leave it plain and then the inside i did
a<00:02:43.030> bit<00:02:43.210> different<00:02:43.510> because<00:02:43.570> Susie<00:02:44.200> had

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
a bit different because Susie had

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.840 
a bit different because Susie had
booklets<00:02:45.010> inside<00:02:45.460> her<00:02:45.820> two<00:02:46.720> minis<00:02:47.080> I<00:02:47.850> decided

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
booklets inside her two minis I decided

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.900 
booklets inside her two minis I decided
to<00:02:49.060> just<00:02:49.090> create<00:02:49.900> this<00:02:50.230> flap<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:53.910> there's

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
to just create this flap and and there's

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.220 
to just create this flap and and there's
so<00:02:55.000> much<00:02:55.120> of<00:02:55.270> room<00:02:55.420> for<00:02:55.540> journaling<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.110> know

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
so much of room for journaling you know

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.870 
so much of room for journaling you know
I<00:02:56.260> could<00:02:56.560> I<00:02:56.710> was<00:02:57.130> thinking<00:02:57.400> of<00:02:57.460> having<00:02:57.610> this

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
I could I was thinking of having this

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.450 
I could I was thinking of having this
waterfall<00:02:58.480> kind<00:02:59.020> of<00:02:59.140> style<00:02:59.410> but<00:02:59.740> I<00:02:59.980> ended<00:03:00.370> up

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
waterfall kind of style but I ended up

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.540 
waterfall kind of style but I ended up
with<00:03:00.520> just<00:03:00.640> one<00:03:00.910> flap<00:03:01.210> and<00:03:02.280> then<00:03:03.280> these<00:03:03.490> two

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
with just one flap and then these two

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.930 
with just one flap and then these two
journaling<00:03:04.390> cards<00:03:05.230> as<00:03:05.410> well<00:03:05.520> so<00:03:06.520> mine<00:03:06.730> is<00:03:06.760> a

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
journaling cards as well so mine is a

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.210 
journaling cards as well so mine is a
bit<00:03:07.120> different<00:03:07.300> to<00:03:07.540> Susie's<00:03:07.990> and<00:03:08.320> then<00:03:09.100> of

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
bit different to Susie's and then of

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.100 
bit different to Susie's and then of
course<00:03:09.250> you<00:03:09.610> know<00:03:09.730> because<00:03:10.030> you've<00:03:10.720> got<00:03:10.990> that

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
course you know because you've got that

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.190 
course you know because you've got that
room<00:03:11.380> there<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:12.790> know<00:03:12.910> you<00:03:12.970> could<00:03:13.390> embellish

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
room there you know you could embellish

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.260 
room there you know you could embellish
if<00:03:14.470> you<00:03:14.590> wanted<00:03:15.070> but<00:03:15.310> I<00:03:15.340> thought<00:03:15.880> that<00:03:16.150> this

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
if you wanted but I thought that this

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.040 
if you wanted but I thought that this
was<00:03:16.420> already<00:03:17.700> beautiful<00:03:18.700> as<00:03:19.090> this<00:03:19.330> so<00:03:19.959> you

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
was already beautiful as this so you

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.810 
was already beautiful as this so you
could<00:03:20.290> have<00:03:20.410> had<00:03:20.620> I<00:03:20.980> could<00:03:21.340> have<00:03:21.430> added<00:03:21.580> some

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
could have had I could have added some

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.550 
could have had I could have added some
flowers<00:03:22.120> and<00:03:22.360> that<00:03:22.720> sort<00:03:22.959> of<00:03:23.020> stuff<00:03:23.080> but<00:03:23.530> I

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
flowers and that sort of stuff but I

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.650 
flowers and that sort of stuff but I
didn't<00:03:23.860> want<00:03:23.920> it<00:03:24.400> to<00:03:24.430> be<00:03:24.640> too<00:03:24.670> fussy<00:03:25.620> and

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
didn't want it to be too fussy and

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.060 
didn't want it to be too fussy and
actually<00:03:28.660> I<00:03:28.870> was<00:03:29.050> thinking<00:03:29.110> of<00:03:29.440> using<00:03:29.680> this

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
actually I was thinking of using this

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.390 
actually I was thinking of using this
for<00:03:30.340> something<00:03:30.820> but<00:03:31.209> unfortunately<00:03:32.400> the

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
for something but unfortunately the

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.550 
for something but unfortunately the
occasion<00:03:33.850> in<00:03:34.360> oh<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:36.760> idea<00:03:37.150> for<00:03:37.480> using<00:03:37.690> it<00:03:37.990> for

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
occasion in oh the idea for using it for

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.900 
occasion in oh the idea for using it for
this<00:03:38.800> this<00:03:39.310> thing<00:03:39.610> I<00:03:39.910> had<00:03:40.180> in<00:03:40.209> mind<00:03:40.480> is

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
this this thing I had in mind is

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.180 
this this thing I had in mind is
scratched<00:03:42.910> it's<00:03:43.720> not<00:03:44.080> going<00:03:44.260> to<00:03:44.380> work<00:03:44.470> out<00:03:44.800> so

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190

mind life goes on so this one I just
left<00:03:57.370> a<00:03:57.520> plane<00:03:57.760> because<00:03:58.240> the<00:03:58.360> paper<00:03:58.570> was<00:03:58.810> so

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
left a plane because the paper was so

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:09.360 
left a plane because the paper was so
lovely<00:03:59.640> and<00:04:04.470> this<00:04:05.470> is<00:04:05.650> how<00:04:05.770> it<00:04:05.920> lives<00:04:08.130> so<00:04:09.130> yes

you<00:04:09.610> know<00:04:09.760> I<00:04:09.790> could<00:04:10.150> do<00:04:10.300> the<00:04:10.480> waterfall

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
you know I could do the waterfall

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.900 
you know I could do the waterfall
eventually<00:04:11.770> when<00:04:11.950> I<00:04:11.980> decide<00:04:12.550> what<00:04:12.790> I

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
eventually when I decide what I

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.360 
eventually when I decide what I
to<00:04:14.030> do<00:04:14.150> with<00:04:14.330> this<00:04:14.860> you<00:04:15.860> know<00:04:15.980> that's<00:04:16.190> plenty

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
to do with this you know that's plenty

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.300 
to do with this you know that's plenty
of<00:04:16.640> room<00:04:16.820> you<00:04:16.940> could<00:04:17.090> do<00:04:17.239> it<00:04:17.360> that<00:04:17.390> way<00:04:17.870> or

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
of room you could do it that way or

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.940 
of room you could do it that way or
landscape<00:04:19.310> style<00:04:19.610> it<00:04:20.300> would<00:04:20.510> work<00:04:20.540> and<00:04:21.050> you

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
landscape style it would work and you

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.630 
landscape style it would work and you
know<00:04:22.070> there's<00:04:22.280> a<00:04:22.990> margin<00:04:23.990> of<00:04:24.200> I<00:04:24.860> think<00:04:25.520> it's

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
know there's a margin of I think it's

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.120 
know there's a margin of I think it's
half<00:04:26.120> an<00:04:26.300> inch<00:04:26.450> so<00:04:27.260> there's<00:04:27.650> plenty<00:04:27.740> of<00:04:28.040> room

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
half an inch so there's plenty of room

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.340 
half an inch so there's plenty of room
in<00:04:28.640> a<00:04:28.820> way<00:04:29.000> if<00:04:29.270> you<00:04:29.330> wanted<00:04:29.780> to<00:04:29.840> add<00:04:29.960> more<00:04:30.110> pages

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
in a way if you wanted to add more pages

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:36.250 
in a way if you wanted to add more pages
it<00:04:30.830> could<00:04:31.130> work<00:04:33.400> so<00:04:34.400> this<00:04:35.120> is<00:04:35.150> how<00:04:35.870> it<00:04:36.080> turned

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
it could work so this is how it turned

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:43.150 
it could work so this is how it turned
out<00:04:36.500> and<00:04:40.330> kudos<00:04:41.330> to<00:04:41.540> Susie<00:04:41.960> for<00:04:42.170> doing<00:04:42.410> a
