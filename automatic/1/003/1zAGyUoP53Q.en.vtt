00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
crash site on wall street here and the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.160 
crash site on wall street here and the
idea<00:00:22.109> with<00:00:22.289> crash<00:00:22.619> site<00:00:22.949> it's<00:00:23.279> like<00:00:24.019> it's<00:00:25.019> like

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
idea with crash site it's like it's like

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.859 
idea with crash site it's like it's like
a<00:00:25.289> headquarters<00:00:25.949> game<00:00:26.160> there's<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.869> dropship

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
a headquarters game there's a dropship

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.540 
a headquarters game there's a dropship
that<00:00:28.109> kind<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.619> flies<00:00:28.830> around<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.160> map<00:00:29.369> and

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
that kind of flies around the map and

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.939 
that kind of flies around the map and
they'll<00:00:29.640> drop<00:00:29.910> down<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.359> capsule<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.740> when

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
they'll drop down this capsule and when

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.010 
they'll drop down this capsule and when
it<00:00:32.040> hits<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.399> ground<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.880> extends<00:00:33.690> out<00:00:33.840> this

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
it hits the ground it extends out this

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.319 
it hits the ground it extends out this
radius<00:00:34.559> then<00:00:34.800> as<00:00:35.100> long<00:00:35.219> as<00:00:35.640> your<00:00:35.820> team<00:00:36.120> is

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
radius then as long as your team is

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.490 
radius then as long as your team is
inside<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.840> radius<00:00:37.200> you're<00:00:37.380> actually

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
inside that radius you're actually

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.760 
inside that radius you're actually
capturing<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.340> crash<00:00:38.790> site<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.559> you<00:00:40.559> get

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
capturing that crash site and you get

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.010 
capturing that crash site and you get
points<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.790> maximum<00:00:42.180> amount<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.629> points<00:00:42.809> is

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
points the maximum amount of points is

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.979 
points the maximum amount of points is
like<00:00:43.170> 150<00:00:44.030> once<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.390> know<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.600> first<00:00:45.780> team<00:00:45.960> to

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
like 150 once you know the first team to

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.510 
like 150 once you know the first team to
reach<00:00:46.110> 150<00:00:46.820> wins<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.149> game<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.989> i<00:00:49.489> forget<00:00:50.489> i

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
reach 150 wins the game so i forget i

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.160 
reach 150 wins the game so i forget i
don't<00:00:50.730> know<00:00:50.820> exactly<00:00:50.969> how<00:00:51.360> many<00:00:51.420> points<00:00:51.750> until

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
don't know exactly how many points until

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.959 
don't know exactly how many points until
you<00:00:52.620> know<00:00:52.710> eventually<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.250> crash<00:00:53.550> site<00:00:53.789> will

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
you know eventually the crash site will

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.119 
you know eventually the crash site will
explode<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.719> pot<00:00:54.930> overheats<00:00:55.559> or<00:00:55.800> something

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
explode the pot overheats or something

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.340 
explode the pot overheats or something
and<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.370> explodes<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.600> dropship<00:00:58.109> will

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
and it explodes it in the dropship will

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.830 
and it explodes it in the dropship will
drop<00:00:58.890> another<00:00:59.160> pod<00:00:59.489> somewhere<00:01:00.000> down<00:01:00.180> but<00:01:00.510> and

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
drop another pod somewhere down but and

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.990 
drop another pod somewhere down but and
this<00:01:01.260> game<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.859> much<00:01:02.070> fun<00:01:02.340> i<00:01:02.370> tell<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.820> why

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
because what happens if you start

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.090 
because what happens if you start
shooting<00:01:36.689> while<00:01:36.869> you're<00:01:37.020> cloaked<00:01:37.409> your

shooting while you're cloaked your

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.550 
shooting while you're cloaked your
screen<00:01:38.490> will<00:01:38.640> flash<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.360> your<00:01:39.840> energy<00:01:40.020> meter

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
screen will flash and your energy meter

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.380 
screen will flash and your energy meter
will<00:01:40.770> drain<00:01:41.070> all<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.310> way<00:01:41.460> down<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.670> zero<00:01:42.060> and

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
will drain all the way down to zero and

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.410 
will drain all the way down to zero and
the<00:01:43.079> energy<00:01:43.290> meter<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.250> tied<00:01:44.850> into<00:01:45.060> your

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
the energy meter is tied into your

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.929 
the energy meter is tied into your
sprinting<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.710> your<00:01:46.829> cloak<00:01:47.100> ability<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.759> your

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.600 
sprinting to your cloak ability and your
armor<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.780> it's<00:01:48.930> really<00:01:49.170> important<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:50.100> keep

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
armor so it's really important to keep

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.920 
armor so it's really important to keep
an<00:01:50.790> eye<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:50.939> your<00:01:51.149> energy<00:01:51.360> me

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
an eye on your energy me

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.500 
an eye on your energy me
you<00:01:52.680> know<00:01:52.800> while<00:01:53.370> you're<00:01:53.520> moving<00:01:53.760> around<00:01:54.150> or
