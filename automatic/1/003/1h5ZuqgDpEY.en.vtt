00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:09.990
 hello everyone this is a weapon at 512 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:13.710
 we find ourselves for some tips in 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.690
 animal crossing so we read there I want 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.730
 no it's a trick it would take full 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.949
 other videos 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:25.320
 asus so you see that video I 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:31.320
 do it rather late here so mass tus 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:35.190
 regards as to have Lille will be able 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.780
 see lille you have to have the boat then 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.170
 as you see here it's the driver 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.270
 of the flagship that if you notice 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.410
 well alone and taxi driver in wild 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.450
 world is not very interesting then 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.170
 if it's the basket of what you are 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:59.449
 may report to deal then why 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.449
 to unlock 7 seven islands 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:18.930
 so wait for this one then it's my 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.930
 House 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:28.690
 to see this island you have to pay back 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.690
 twice the loan to tom nook 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:37.729
 as you see pretty nice my house 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:42.470
 that normal we do not find it is it 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:43.700
 although it must pay twice a 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.380
 like me because I'm the big island 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.229
 once again at the beginning you have a 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.590
 try to pay you back to have a 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.380
 House 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.229
 I had once provost grew up 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.909
 it's the very small room not like that 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:03.220
 a little less and these are cases that 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:06.429
 gets going all the day you get your 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.429
 big house 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.729
 well when you talk to the beginnings at marie 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.510
 and will tell you will not receive the visit 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:17.810
 36 years old came out mr turtle mr 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:23.090
 g is so he speaks to us he tells us 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:26.209
 I had ten join us join me 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:31.910
 in the pontoon the stuff where there is the 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:34.400
 boat tells us about an island all that he 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.400
 says if we are jealous all this is not 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.260
 a problem 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.170
 after he will say that the next admiral 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.480
 will come to our city for us 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:50.590
 take to Lille so you have to take it 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.590
 must have a thousand bells 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.130
 what I do not find much that we 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:03.440
 quickly made them anyway speaking of which 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:05.299
 you have 80 80 we're going to say 80 miles and 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:12.019
 well after when you have paid 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:13.850
 will have 79000 so I hope this 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.079
 trick you will have liked and we end up 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.660
