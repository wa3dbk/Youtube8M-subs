00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
was a really good idea that was she can

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.649

keep<00:00:54.559> on<00:00:54.710> as<00:00:54.800> well<00:00:54.979> so<00:00:55.300> anyway<00:00:56.300> that's<00:00:56.390> what<00:00:56.600> I

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:56.659 
keep on as well so anyway that's what I

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.020 
keep on as well so anyway that's what I
did<00:00:56.899> let<00:00:57.199> me<00:00:57.260> just<00:00:57.440> share<00:00:57.589> now<00:00:58.129> her<00:00:58.429> mini<00:00:58.699> album

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
did let me just share now her mini album

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.779 
did let me just share now her mini album
is<00:00:59.239> basically<00:01:00.199> it's<00:01:00.979> a<00:01:01.069> little<00:01:01.309> bit<00:01:01.399> different

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
is basically it's a little bit different

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:03.189 
is basically it's a little bit different
because<00:01:01.879> I<00:01:02.030> wanted<00:01:02.239> it<00:01:02.359> to<00:01:02.449> be<00:01:02.539> unique<00:01:02.690> for<00:01:03.019> her

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
because I wanted it to be unique for her

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.770 
because I wanted it to be unique for her
but<00:01:03.409> basically<00:01:04.400> the<00:01:04.760> page<00:01:05.030> components<00:01:05.690> and

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.649 
but basically the page components and
everything<00:01:06.140> are<00:01:06.380> identical<00:01:07.130> so<00:01:07.600> anyway<00:01:08.600> it

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
everything are identical so anyway it

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.020 
everything are identical so anyway it

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
is basically the same it is unique in

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.059 
is basically the same it is unique in
its<00:02:11.989> own<00:02:13.450> respect<00:02:14.450> but<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:15.019> wanted<00:02:15.379> to

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
its own respect but I wanted to

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.369 
its own respect but I wanted to
basically<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.909> same<00:02:17.090> components<00:02:17.780> this<00:02:18.319> is

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
basically the same components this is

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.229 
basically the same components this is
just<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.769> tag<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.249> put<00:02:19.549> in<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:19.909> I<00:02:19.969> haven't

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
just a tag that I put in and I haven't

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.929 
just a tag that I put in and I haven't

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
then mine just has one file folder but

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.399 
then mine just has one file folder but
hers<00:02:34.969> actually<00:02:35.180> has<00:02:35.569> another<00:02:35.840> insert<00:02:36.290> in

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
still in there for that I just made it

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.800 
still in there for that I just made it
library<00:03:37.699> pocket<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:38.269> I've<00:03:38.329> gotten<00:03:38.629> questions

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
library pocket and I've gotten questions

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.740 
library pocket and I've gotten questions
about<00:03:39.319> my<00:03:39.470> library<00:03:39.859> pockets<00:03:40.310> I<00:03:40.599> may<00:03:41.599> do<00:03:41.659> a

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
about my library pockets I may do a

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.349 
about my library pockets I may do a
tutorial<00:03:41.959> on<00:03:42.379> it<00:03:42.500> but<00:03:42.620> it's<00:03:42.709> really<00:03:42.889> so<00:03:43.159> simple

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
tutorial on it but it's really so simple

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.179 
tutorial on it but it's really so simple
I<00:03:44.359> think<00:03:44.720> I<00:03:44.989> basically<00:03:45.379> just<00:03:45.500> cut<00:03:45.889> two<00:03:46.159> inches

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:46.189 
I think I basically just cut two inches

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:49.210 
I think I basically just cut two inches
a<00:03:46.879> two<00:03:47.329> inch<00:03:47.479> piece<00:03:47.540> of<00:03:47.720> cardstock<00:03:48.049> by<00:03:48.889> 4

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
a two inch piece of cardstock by 4

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.210 
a two inch piece of cardstock by 4
inches<00:03:49.669> score<00:03:50.329> it<00:03:50.479> at<00:03:50.629> 2<00:03:50.659> inches<00:03:51.290> and<00:03:51.620> then

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
inches score it at 2 inches and then

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.819 
inches score it at 2 inches and then
scored<00:03:52.639> a<00:03:52.729> 1/2<00:03:52.939> inch<00:03:53.180> in<00:03:53.540> on<00:03:53.780> either<00:03:53.989> side<00:03:54.470> and

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
scored a 1/2 inch in on either side and

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.429 
scored a 1/2 inch in on either side and
then<00:03:55.400> of<00:03:55.639> course<00:03:55.849> you'll<00:03:55.970> need<00:03:56.000> to<00:03:56.209> trim<00:03:56.540> one

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:57.439 
then of course you'll need to trim one

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:01.899 
then of course you'll need to trim one
of<00:03:57.739> your<00:03:59.049> short<00:04:00.049> sides<00:04:00.349> off<00:04:00.669> yeah<00:04:01.669> that

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:01.909 
of your short sides off yeah that

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:03.849 
of your short sides off yeah that
probably<00:04:02.030> sounds<00:04:02.419> confusing<00:04:02.810> so<00:04:03.469> I<00:04:03.500> may<00:04:03.709> end

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.870 
attached the four petal die to just the
bottom<00:06:23.930> portion<00:06:24.139> so<00:06:24.740> you<00:06:25.219> can<00:06:25.340> actually<00:06:25.639> slide

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
bottom portion so you can actually slide

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.350 
bottom portion so you can actually slide
these<00:06:26.120> two<00:06:26.300> tags<00:06:26.620> behind<00:06:27.620> and<00:06:28.550> so<00:06:29.180> you<00:06:29.270> don't

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 
these two tags behind and so you don't

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.090 
these two tags behind and so you don't
lose<00:06:29.569> that<00:06:29.659> extra<00:06:30.169> space<00:06:30.409> on<00:06:30.680> the<00:06:30.740> page<00:06:30.979> there

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:33.100 
lose that extra space on the page there

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.620 
lose that extra space on the page there
here<00:06:33.760> is<00:06:33.940> just<00:06:34.210> a<00:06:34.710> photo<00:06:35.710> mat<00:06:36.010> and<00:06:36.910> journaling

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.300 
here is just a photo mat and journaling
spot<00:06:38.970> and<00:06:39.970> then<00:06:40.360> this<00:06:40.960> page<00:06:41.320> I<00:06:41.590> just<00:06:41.620> put<00:06:42.010> a<00:06:42.040> top

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
spot and then this page I just put a top

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.950 
spot and then this page I just put a top
note<00:06:42.670> and<00:06:43.420> I<00:06:44.200> put<00:06:44.440> a<00:06:44.610> acrylic<00:06:45.610> tag<00:06:45.970> in<00:06:46.540> there

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 
note and I put a acrylic tag in there

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.230 
note and I put a acrylic tag in there
that<00:06:47.860> I<00:06:47.890> have<00:06:48.250> embossed<00:06:48.580> this<00:06:48.850> is<00:06:48.970> a<00:06:49.000> really

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
that I have embossed this is a really

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.030 
that I have embossed this is a really
thick<00:06:49.480> one<00:06:49.510> I<00:06:49.690> actually<00:06:49.930> used<00:06:50.440> some<00:06:50.650> of<00:06:50.920> the

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:51.040 
thick one I actually used some of the

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.060 
thick one I actually used some of the
packaging<00:06:51.640> from<00:06:52.000> one<00:06:52.150> of<00:06:52.240> my<00:06:52.330> Sizzix<00:06:53.320> dyes<00:06:53.560> and

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.070 
packaging from one of my Sizzix dyes and

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.370 
packaging from one of my Sizzix dyes and
so<00:06:54.340> it's<00:06:54.490> a<00:06:54.580> nice<00:06:54.700> thick<00:06:55.090> acrylic<00:06:55.540> there<00:06:56.140> and

then<00:06:56.470> just<00:06:56.500> embossed<00:06:57.100> oh<00:06:57.310> it<00:06:57.820> did<00:06:58.150> um<00:06:58.420> want<00:06:59.050> to

00:06:59.250 --> 00:06:59.260 
then just embossed oh it did um want to

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.010 
then just embossed oh it did um want to
curl<00:06:59.560> a<00:06:59.620> little<00:07:00.040> bit<00:07:00.220> so<00:07:00.610> if<00:07:00.760> you<00:07:00.940> do<00:07:01.120> try<00:07:01.810> that

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.020 
curl a little bit so if you do try that

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.680
