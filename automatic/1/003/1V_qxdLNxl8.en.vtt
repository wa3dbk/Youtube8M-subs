00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.390
 umberto 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.470
 sight 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.470
 I have dedicated my heart for many years 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.470
 looking if we can say so 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.399
 for the swallowed life 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:33.160
 both of cutlery and crying 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.680
 once I believe that when the pots were born the fires we needed 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.230
 add element and form cooking materials 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.380
 with the advent of the beautiful kitchen 9 spies in mind 1965 68 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.790
 the parts overturned the cook I wanted to place on the plate 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.690
 the things he prepares 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.140
 arval no longer rely on franciana for the meter installed 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.920
 and that he had his pleasure 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.870
 wanted to become responsible for which I felt responsible also for 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.140
 the form of crying is necessary 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.870
 because the content was 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.250
 strictly related to the shape of the dish in my opinion they even have to 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.390
 color 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.700
 so much so that by attending the artists they explained to me the concept of 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.870
 all complementary colors 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.250
 and I will even buy me a colorful plate for 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.920
 put it in context when it seemed to me that I was missing a little 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.160
 experience your mind then taught me so many things and. more need 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.420
 naturally in the color plate even though I am back now 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.920
 rediscover this need. the dishes 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.360
 I always thought that even the cutlery should have an intimacy task 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.230
 not just a drawn thing 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.480
 to give an object shape 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.100
 but something that was particularly suitable for things that are not 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.940
 it was a long time since I was looking for someone who understands my concept of 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.160
 develop a series of cutlery 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.849
 that they rained 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.329
 that beautiful also because beauty should also be useful vice versa 

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:18.719
 hey with the g in the race with brogi naturally light this relationship was 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.010
 and we finally succeeded, at least I finally succeeded in making my own 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.869
 dream 

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:26.019
 riccardo 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.019
 from 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:38.279
 free but 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.299
 first the service company 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.760
 the italian fork which with i have been using while the other mini dresses 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.179
 short 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:55.719
 the middle European fork so as I like to roll to send you 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:03:00.149
 helping with the spoon I drew on the spaghetti fork combining it 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:01.289
 to a spoon 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:04.289
 great that it was then also comes to me 

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:07.049
 she 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.049
 back what is very important as you see my mail 

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:13.899
 who wants to be a fish. will also serve for the rooms 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:16.899
 naturally atp double cut let's call it that 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.379
 all the cutlery over time the pc knife the fork also for the tour tyler 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:23.799
 of cakes 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.879
 Right-handed characters have always been designed 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.730
 image once could not use the left amusement nemam bike 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.129
 baton 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.310
 now it has become freer so that people who eat with 

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:40.739
 left would be prevented let's say as the cutlery was marked 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.739
 strictly for right-handed people 

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:49.379
 I have always wondered why we eat cereals underneath with a fork 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.849
 it seems to me that it doesn't really make sense is not that we want the tricks rows 

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:57.409
 when the spoon is so comfortable but then think about it the spoon is 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:00.759
 always been so great 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:04.959
 probably the fork was a choice for nothing to gather too much stuff 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.060
 at one time I thought of a small spoon that was not very deep 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.669
 that he could suffer 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.999
 to the fork 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:15.419
 Rome bar 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:18.419
 but for many, but not least, pizza 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.659
 why are you spying on me the Japanese who eat everything minced with i 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:24.860
 chopsticks 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.030
 - I understand why you don't have to eat even with pliers you need to 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.830
 eat a salad that you 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.509
 you ask me how to eat a salad with a fork you will see that 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:35.879
 emits in difficult 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:38.409
 so with the pliers it can be received 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:40.710
 as well as a plate of rigatoni 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.600
 that instead of totally good finch fork binging is presented 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.310
 a trap riot takes but which is not, however, sometimes one eats with violence a 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.099
 fried many other things 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:56.229
 where you can use the plier I fear hollow success 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:07.349
 umberto 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.479
 my 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:22.680
 bar 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.790
 one year
