highlight for you what well the
competition<00:01:22.229> it's<00:01:22.770> just<00:01:23.159> completely

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
competition it's just completely

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.140 
competition it's just completely
different<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.490> european<00:01:26.490> store<00:01:26.820> works

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
different to a european store works

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.980 
different to a european store works
because<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.640> main<00:01:29.850> olympic<00:01:30.750> games

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
because it just the main olympic games

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.240 
because it just the main olympic games
it<00:01:31.380> happens<00:01:31.920> only<00:01:32.130> once<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.329> four<00:01:34.140> years<00:01:34.850> so

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
it happens only once in four years so

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.310 
it happens only once in four years so
it's<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.759> really<00:01:39.060> different<00:01:39.450> comparison

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
it's it's really different comparison

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.899 
it's it's really different comparison
than<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.680> others<00:01:40.950> because<00:01:41.189> we<00:01:41.400> have<00:01:41.700> them

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
than the others because we have them

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.730 
than the others because we have them
every<00:01:42.180> year<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.470> was<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.799> first<00:01:43.979> thing<00:01:45.740> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
every year so it was the first thing the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.910 
every year so it was the first thing the
second<00:01:47.159> one<00:01:47.310> was<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.790> got<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.390> see<00:01:48.920> not
