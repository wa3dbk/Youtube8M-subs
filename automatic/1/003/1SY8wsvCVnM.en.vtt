outside<00:00:35.829> the<00:00:35.949> map<00:00:36.100> afgan<00:00:36.640> I'm<00:00:36.760> all<00:00:36.940> for<00:00:37.120> to

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
outside the map afgan I'm all for to

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.810 
outside the map afgan I'm all for to
fully<00:00:37.719> without<00:00:37.989> using<00:00:38.320> any<00:00:38.530> hacks<00:00:38.860> which<00:00:39.670> is

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
way to get outside of this map is with

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.840 
way to get outside of this map is with
hacks<00:00:43.089> at<00:00:43.329> the<00:00:43.449> current<00:00:43.750> moment<00:00:43.930> so<00:00:44.769> now<00:00:45.640> we're

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
hacks at the current moment so now we're

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:47.979 
straight-up glitching and to do that

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:49.049 
straight-up glitching and to do that
you're<00:00:48.159> gonna<00:00:48.250> want<00:00:48.430> to<00:00:48.489> come<00:00:48.579> over<00:00:48.640> here<00:00:48.940> on

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.180 
you're gonna want to come over here on
the<00:00:49.149> map<00:00:49.300> where<00:00:49.479> the<00:00:49.600> radiation<00:00:49.899> is<00:00:50.320> and<00:00:50.589> how

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
the map where the radiation is and how

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.740 
the map where the radiation is and how
guys<00:00:51.430> I'm<00:00:51.610> not<00:00:51.699> trying<00:00:52.000> to<00:00:52.059> show<00:00:52.210> you<00:00:52.269> like<00:00:52.540> how

to<00:00:52.930> get<00:00:53.079> inside<00:00:53.229> the<00:00:53.470> radiation<00:00:53.890> area<00:00:53.979> I

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
to get inside the radiation area I

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.919 
to get inside the radiation area I
wouldn't<00:00:54.340> do<00:00:54.399> that<00:00:54.429> to<00:00:54.760> you<00:00:54.850> I'm<00:00:55.090> actually<00:00:55.660> I'm

going to show you how to get something
that<00:00:57.129> fully<00:00:57.489> I<00:00:57.789> don't<00:00:58.210> really<00:00:58.329> consider<00:00:58.510> this

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
that fully I don't really consider this

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.259 
that fully I don't really consider this
out<00:00:59.050> of<00:00:59.140> the<00:00:59.199> map<00:00:59.379> right<00:00:59.649> now<00:00:59.859> it's<00:01:00.190> just<00:01:00.429> just

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
out of the map right now it's just just

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:02.549 
out of the map right now it's just just
so<00:01:01.420> happens<00:01:01.870> that<00:01:01.929> to<00:01:02.140> get<00:01:02.289> out<00:01:02.379> something

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
so happens that to get out something

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.380 
so happens that to get out something
that<00:01:02.679> fully<00:01:03.010> happens<00:01:03.460> to<00:01:03.550> be<00:01:03.670> in<00:01:03.699> this<00:01:04.119> section

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
on search destroy you always spawn in

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.219 
on search destroy you always spawn in
the<00:01:12.220> same<00:01:12.460> area<00:01:12.789> which<00:01:13.509> mall<00:01:13.780> so<00:01:13.960> makes<00:01:14.110> it

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
the same area which mall so makes it

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.440 
the same area which mall so makes it
easy<00:01:14.440> to<00:01:14.590> boost<00:01:14.860> for<00:01:15.009> care<00:01:15.250> packages<00:01:15.450> and

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
easy to boost for care packages and

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.490 
easy to boost for care packages and
right<00:01:16.600> here<00:01:16.810> I<00:01:16.840> just<00:01:17.050> want<00:01:17.170> to<00:01:17.229> show<00:01:17.350> you<00:01:17.440> guys

how to throw the Care Bears like where

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.490 
how to throw the Care Bears like where
we<00:01:19.149> usually<00:01:19.420> throw<00:01:19.750> them<00:01:19.840> to<00:01:20.020> breach<00:01:20.289> we

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
we usually throw them to breach we

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.320 
we usually throw them to breach we
preach<00:01:20.770> raid<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.069> bottom<00:01:21.310> that<00:01:21.399> hill<00:01:21.640> it

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
preach raid the bottom that hill it

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.540 
preach raid the bottom that hill it
works<00:01:22.539> up<00:01:22.720> perfectly<00:01:23.170> and<00:01:23.470> I'll<00:01:24.009> explain<00:01:24.280> why

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
works up perfectly and I'll explain why

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.399 
works up perfectly and I'll explain why
we<00:01:24.729> use<00:01:24.880> this<00:01:25.000> area<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:25.659> later<00:01:25.899> on<00:01:26.080> the<00:01:26.200> video

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
we use this area and later on the video

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.499 
we use this area and later on the video
but<00:01:26.680> for<00:01:26.710> now<00:01:26.950> they<00:01:27.579> make<00:01:27.970> sure<00:01:28.149> you<00:01:28.240> have<00:01:28.390> it

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
but for now they make sure you have it

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:29.850 
but for now they make sure you have it
on<00:01:28.600> search<00:01:28.780> destroy<00:01:29.049> because<00:01:29.439> as<00:01:29.530> soon<00:01:29.649> as<00:01:29.799> you

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
on search destroy because as soon as you

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.280 
on search destroy because as soon as you
spawn<00:01:30.479> basically<00:01:31.479> how<00:01:31.600> it<00:01:31.630> works<00:01:32.020> for<00:01:32.200> the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
spawn basically how it works for the

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.630 
spawn basically how it works for the
people<00:01:32.500> who<00:01:32.530> don't<00:01:32.799> know<00:01:32.860> what<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.189> radiation

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
people who don't know what the radiation

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.160 
people who don't know what the radiation
thing<00:01:33.820> is<00:01:34.000> that<00:01:34.210> basically<00:01:34.420> it's<00:01:34.780> a<00:01:34.840> timed

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
thing is that basically it's a timed

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.679 
thing is that basically it's a timed
amount<00:01:35.829> of<00:01:35.979> damage<00:01:36.369> so<00:01:36.579> like<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:37.149> damage<00:01:37.420> will

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
amount of damage so like the damage will

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:39.359 
amount of damage so like the damage will
stop<00:01:37.960> after<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.380> certain<00:01:38.560> amount<00:01:38.649> of<00:01:38.829> time<00:01:39.009> and

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
stop after a certain amount of time and

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.580 
stop after a certain amount of time and
order<00:01:40.149> survive<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.869> damage<00:01:41.259> you<00:01:41.380> need<00:01:41.530> to

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
order survive the damage you need to

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.440 
order survive the damage you need to
have<00:01:41.680> pain<00:01:41.950> killer<00:01:42.189> on<00:01:42.369> so<00:01:43.030> make<00:01:43.210> sure<00:01:43.240> you

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
have pain killer on so make sure you

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.300 
have pain killer on so make sure you
have<00:01:43.570> pain<00:01:43.810> killer<00:01:44.049> on<00:01:44.229> as<00:01:44.500> your<00:01:44.680> killer<00:01:45.040> you

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
have pain killer on as your killer you

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.039 
have pain killer on as your killer you
can<00:01:45.460> have<00:01:45.729> it<00:01:45.909> like<00:01:46.180> gold<00:01:46.450> your<00:01:46.600> destory

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
can have it like gold your destory

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.980 
can have it like gold your destory

you're<00:03:15.400> pretty<00:03:15.579> much<00:03:15.700> safe<00:03:16.030> now<00:03:16.390> you're

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
you're pretty much safe now you're

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.259 
you're pretty much safe now you're
actually<00:03:16.750> fully<00:03:17.170> outside<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.650> map<00:03:17.859> this<00:03:18.640> area

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
actually fully outside the map this area

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.720 
actually fully outside the map this area
is<00:03:19.480> not<00:03:19.720> possible<00:03:20.019> that<00:03:20.590> like<00:03:20.799> hacks<00:03:21.400> at<00:03:21.609> all

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
is not possible that like hacks at all

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.119 
is not possible that like hacks at all
because<00:03:21.879> like<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.180> whole<00:03:22.390> map<00:03:22.750> of

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
because like the whole map of

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.190 
because like the whole map of
Afghanistan<00:03:24.129> except<00:03:24.489> one<00:03:25.030> small<00:03:25.599> small<00:03:25.900> gap

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
Afghanistan except one small small gap

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.680 
Afghanistan except one small small gap
which<00:03:26.890> was<00:03:27.069> possible<00:03:27.609> speed<00:03:27.940> hack<00:03:28.180> or<00:03:28.420> jump

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
which was possible speed hack or jump

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.599 
which was possible speed hack or jump
back<00:03:28.750> to<00:03:28.930> get<00:03:29.170> outside<00:03:29.440> of<00:03:29.680> but<00:03:30.400> other<00:03:30.549> than

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
back to get outside of but other than

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.280 
back to get outside of but other than
that<00:03:30.730> is<00:03:31.030> impossible<00:03:31.329> to<00:03:31.810> do<00:03:31.959> it<00:03:32.079> just

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
that is impossible to do it just

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.599 
that is impossible to do it just
straight<00:03:32.440> up<00:03:32.470> pushing<00:03:32.859> you<00:03:32.980> outside<00:03:33.129> that<00:03:33.280> gap

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
straight up pushing you outside that gap

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.339 
straight up pushing you outside that gap
so<00:03:33.940> we<00:03:34.030> had<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.329> resort<00:03:34.690> to<00:03:34.840> care<00:03:35.019> package

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
so we had to resort to care package

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.559 
so we had to resort to care package
breaching<00:03:35.769> and<00:03:35.950> for<00:03:36.849> those<00:03:36.940> people<00:03:37.120> who<00:03:37.269> know

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
breaching and for those people who know

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.479 
breaching and for those people who know
like<00:03:37.900> wondering<00:03:38.440> why<00:03:38.650> we<00:03:38.859> use<00:03:38.980> care<00:03:39.190> by<00:03:39.310> for

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
like wondering why we use care by for

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.250 
like wondering why we use care by for
you<00:03:39.579> so<00:03:39.730> much<00:03:39.910> it's<00:03:40.120> usually<00:03:40.540> cuz<00:03:40.780> it's<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:41.019> last

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
you so much it's usually cuz it's a last

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.620 
you so much it's usually cuz it's a last
resort<00:03:41.769> like<00:03:42.010> literally<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:43.030> only<00:03:43.180> way<00:03:43.450> we

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
resort like literally the only way we

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.330 
resort like literally the only way we
get<00:03:43.810> these<00:03:43.989> areas<00:03:44.470> is<00:03:44.500> because<00:03:45.040> we're<00:03:45.190> using

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
get these areas is because we're using

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.039 
get these areas is because we're using
care<00:03:45.579> about<00:03:45.760> is<00:03:45.970> otherwise<00:03:46.389> you<00:03:46.690> wouldn't<00:03:46.900> see

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
care about is otherwise you wouldn't see

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.140 
care about is otherwise you wouldn't see
these<00:03:47.230> videos<00:03:47.530> at<00:03:47.680> all<00:03:47.829> because<00:03:48.220> it<00:03:48.880> would<00:03:49.060> be

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
these videos at all because it would be

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.720 
these videos at all because it would be
possible<00:03:49.329> without<00:03:49.630> care<00:03:50.019> packages<00:03:50.530> so<00:03:51.310> Cara

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
possible without care packages so Cara

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.099 
possible without care packages so Cara
has<00:03:52.000> always<00:03:52.299> been<00:03:52.419> a<00:03:52.480> really<00:03:52.630> important<00:03:52.959> thing

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
has always been a really important thing

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:54.629 
has always been a really important thing
but<00:03:53.230> as<00:03:53.319> you<00:03:53.410> can<00:03:53.500> see<00:03:53.709> like<00:03:53.919> the<00:03:54.130> area<00:03:54.579> outside

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
but as you can see like the area outside

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.059 
but as you can see like the area outside
of<00:03:55.030> this<00:03:55.120> map<00:03:55.329> is<00:03:55.359> just<00:03:55.900> like<00:03:56.049> immensely<00:03:56.680> huge

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
of this map is just like immensely huge

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.729 
of this map is just like immensely huge
like<00:03:57.310> it's<00:03:57.489> just<00:03:57.760> you<00:03:57.940> can<00:03:58.060> go<00:03:58.239> so<00:03:59.109> far<00:03:59.349> out<00:03:59.410> in

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
like it's just you can go so far out in

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.830 
like it's just you can go so far out in
so<00:04:00.010> many<00:04:00.130> more<00:04:00.430> areas<00:04:00.669> in<00:04:01.030> just<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.329> radiation

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
so many more areas in just the radiation

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.780 
so many more areas in just the radiation
section<00:04:02.319> that<00:04:02.950> everyone<00:04:03.220> kept<00:04:03.430> posting

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
section that everyone kept posting

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.220 
section that everyone kept posting
before<00:04:04.120> cuz<00:04:04.359> I<00:04:04.419> really<00:04:04.690> didn't<00:04:04.900> even<00:04:05.019> consider

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
before cuz I really didn't even consider

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.530 
before cuz I really didn't even consider
that<00:04:05.380> outside<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:05.799> map<00:04:05.980> and<00:04:06.849> the<00:04:06.940> reason<00:04:07.299> why

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
that outside the map and the reason why

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.150 
that outside the map and the reason why
we<00:04:07.810> breach<00:04:08.079> in<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.319> radiation<00:04:08.859> area<00:04:08.950> is

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
we breach in the radiation area is

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.370 
we breach in the radiation area is
because<00:04:09.489> there's<00:04:09.669> that<00:04:09.819> brown<00:04:10.540> below<00:04:10.959> the<00:04:11.169> map

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
because there's that brown below the map

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.259 
because there's that brown below the map
that<00:04:11.650> isn't<00:04:12.010> death<00:04:12.190> berry<00:04:12.459> but<00:04:12.880> you<00:04:12.970> can<00:04:13.060> still

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
that isn't death berry but you can still

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.569 
that isn't death berry but you can still
stand<00:04:13.510> out<00:04:13.690> without<00:04:13.989> dying<00:04:14.349> and<00:04:14.680> that<00:04:14.709> ground

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
stand out without dying and that ground

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.159 
stand out without dying and that ground
was<00:04:15.880> the<00:04:16.000> only<00:04:16.120> reason<00:04:16.419> why<00:04:16.510> we<00:04:16.630> had<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:16.840> breach

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
was the only reason why we had to breach

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:18.509 
was the only reason why we had to breach
there<00:04:17.410> it's<00:04:17.560> nowhere<00:04:17.950> else<00:04:18.160> in<00:04:18.370> the<00:04:18.459> entire

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
there it's nowhere else in the entire

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.029 
there it's nowhere else in the entire
map<00:04:19.030> so<00:04:19.060> it<00:04:19.450> made<00:04:19.599> it<00:04:19.630> really<00:04:20.010> important<00:04:21.010> for

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
map so it made it really important for

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.950 
map so it made it really important for
us<00:04:21.130> to<00:04:21.220> do<00:04:21.400> that<00:04:21.579> and<00:04:22.120> just<00:04:22.240> put<00:04:22.450> on<00:04:22.599> search<00:04:22.870> and

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
us to do that and just put on search and

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.779 
us to do that and just put on search and
destroy<00:04:23.139> because<00:04:24.070> when<00:04:24.310> you<00:04:24.370> put<00:04:24.490> on<00:04:24.520> search

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
destroy because when you put on search

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.430 
destroy because when you put on search
and<00:04:24.849> destroy<00:04:25.030> you<00:04:25.450> can<00:04:25.599> literally<00:04:25.840> just<00:04:26.080> spawn

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
and destroy you can literally just spawn

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.440 
and destroy you can literally just spawn
back<00:04:26.680> in<00:04:26.979> on<00:04:27.160> that<00:04:27.490> site<00:04:27.820> you<00:04:27.849> have<00:04:28.120> a<00:04:28.210> specific

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
back in on that site you have a specific

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.900 
back in on that site you have a specific
spawn<00:04:28.960> point<00:04:29.229> so<00:04:29.860> you'll<00:04:29.979> always<00:04:30.070> spawn<00:04:30.639> right

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
spawn point so you'll always spawn right

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.430 
spawn point so you'll always spawn right
there<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.419> then<00:04:31.510> from<00:04:31.780> that<00:04:31.840> spot<00:04:32.229> you<00:04:32.289> can

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
there and then from that spot you can

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.350 
there and then from that spot you can
just<00:04:32.680> turn<00:04:32.889> around<00:04:33.039> do<00:04:33.340> a<00:04:33.370> 180<00:04:33.789> and<00:04:33.880> sprint

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
just turn around do a 180 and sprint

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.900 
just turn around do a 180 and sprint
right<00:04:34.510> in<00:04:34.690> just<00:04:35.260> make<00:04:35.470> sure<00:04:35.500> you<00:04:35.710> always<00:04:36.610> going

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
right in just make sure you always going

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.310 
right in just make sure you always going
right<00:04:37.150> away<00:04:37.270> don't<00:04:37.539> point<00:04:37.780> your<00:04:37.840> attack<00:04:38.080> down

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
right away don't point your attack down

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.870 
right away don't point your attack down
and<00:04:38.500> jump<00:04:38.710> in<00:04:38.889> you<00:04:39.070> won't<00:04:39.280> a<00:04:39.430> half<00:04:39.580> time

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
and jump in you won't a half time

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.120 
and jump in you won't a half time
because<00:04:40.720> the<00:04:40.900> damage<00:04:41.169> will<00:04:41.500> end<00:04:41.650> up<00:04:41.740> lasting

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
because the damage will end up lasting

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.119 
because the damage will end up lasting
longer<00:04:42.370> than<00:04:42.460> the<00:04:42.640> time<00:04:42.849> you

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:43.129 
longer than the time you
