don't know if you can see it but way off

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.310 
don't know if you can see it but way off
in<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.760> distance<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.960> Golden<00:00:19.230> Gate

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
in the distance is the Golden Gate

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.109 
in the distance is the Golden Gate
Bridge<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.980> fog<00:00:20.189> which<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.760> very<00:00:20.939> unusual

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
Bridge in the fog which is very unusual

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.849 
Bridge in the fog which is very unusual
for<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.810> angle<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:23.840> way<00:00:24.840> off<00:00:25.050> in<00:00:25.320> that

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
for this angle and way off in that

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.990 
for this angle and way off in that
direction<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:28.460> Transamerica<00:00:29.460> building<00:00:29.490> which

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
direction is Transamerica building which

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.299 
direction is Transamerica building which
we<00:00:30.179> can't<00:00:30.390> even<00:00:30.570> see<00:00:30.720> from<00:00:30.900> here<00:00:31.080> but<00:00:31.309> with

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
we can't even see from here but with

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.479 
we can't even see from here but with
this<00:00:32.780> telescope<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.020> lens<00:00:34.489> everything

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
this telescope of a lens everything

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.389 
this telescope of a lens everything
comes<00:00:35.730> into<00:00:35.969> view<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.540> let's<00:00:36.780> give<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.770> whirl

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
comes into view so let's give it a whirl

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.680 
comes into view so let's give it a whirl
and<00:00:38.700> we'll<00:00:39.420> see<00:00:39.600> what<00:00:39.750> we<00:00:39.870> can<00:00:41.420> or<00:00:42.420> at<00:00:42.510> least

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
and we'll see what we can or at least

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.619 
and we'll see what we can or at least
I'll<00:00:42.840> see<00:00:42.989> what<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.170> can<00:00:43.200> show<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:44.450> so<00:00:45.450> here's

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
I'll see what I can show you so here's

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.440 
I'll see what I can show you so here's
the<00:00:45.780> lens<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.219> Wimberly<00:00:47.640> tripod<00:00:48.000> head<00:00:48.239> and

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
the lens on the Wimberly tripod head and

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.799 
the lens on the Wimberly tripod head and
the<00:00:48.660> side<00:00:48.899> view<00:00:49.460> nicely<00:00:50.460> lit<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.660> lens

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
the side view nicely lit and the lens

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.689 
the side view nicely lit and the lens
was<00:00:52.140> lighter<00:00:52.559> than<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.860> 600<00:00:53.340> millimeter

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
was lighter than the 600 millimeter

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.220 
was lighter than the 600 millimeter
canon<00:00:54.300> lens<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.660> i've<00:00:54.780> used<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.170> past

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
canon lens that i've used in the past

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.200 
canon lens that i've used in the past
but<00:00:55.860> still<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.160> was<00:00:56.250> pretty<00:00:56.430> nice<00:00:56.610> using<00:00:57.090> it

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
but still it was pretty nice using it

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.470 
but still it was pretty nice using it
with<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.629> Wimberly<00:00:58.609> hmm<00:00:59.699> looking<00:01:00.180> at<00:01:00.359> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
with the Wimberly hmm looking at the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.729 
with the Wimberly hmm looking at the
Golden<00:01:00.750> Gate<00:01:00.840> Bridge<00:01:00.899> way<00:01:01.379> off<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.680> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
Golden Gate Bridge way off in the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.609 
Golden Gate Bridge way off in the
distance<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:02.520> filled<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:04.019> frame<00:01:04.199> nicely

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
distance it filled the the frame nicely

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.359 
distance it filled the the frame nicely
with<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.830> bridge<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:06.030> was<00:01:06.210> at<00:01:06.799> an<00:01:07.799> 800

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
with the bridge this was at an 800

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.000 
with the bridge this was at an 800
millimeter<00:01:09.049> focal<00:01:10.049> distance<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.799> no

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
millimeter focal distance so no

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.710 
millimeter focal distance so no
extenders<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.729> there<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.119> then<00:01:12.210> looking<00:01:12.510> off

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
extenders on there and then looking off

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.640 
extenders on there and then looking off
in<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.049> other<00:01:13.290> direction<00:01:14.450> you<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:16.170> could<00:01:16.439> see

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
in the other direction you you could see

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.840 
in the other direction you you could see
the<00:01:16.770> Transamerica<00:01:17.100> building<00:01:17.369> although<00:01:17.790> it

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
the Transamerica building although it

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.179 
the Transamerica building although it
was<00:01:17.939> really<00:01:18.270> really<00:01:18.570> fogged<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.439> then

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
was really really fogged in and then

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.560 
was really really fogged in and then
looking<00:01:20.490> back<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.909> Golden<00:01:21.180> Gate<00:01:21.270> Bridge<00:01:21.330> a

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
looking back the Golden Gate Bridge a

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.690 
looking back the Golden Gate Bridge a
little<00:01:22.080> bit<00:01:22.200> later<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.740> little<00:01:23.280> bit<00:01:23.369> different

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
little bit later a little bit different

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.820 
little bit later a little bit different
light<00:01:23.880> again<00:01:24.600> filled<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.080> scene<00:01:25.290> nicely<00:01:25.680> and

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
light again filled the scene nicely and

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.340 
light again filled the scene nicely and
still<00:01:26.070> made<00:01:26.280> use<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:27.600> fog<00:01:27.840> shrouding<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
still made use of the fog shrouding the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.010 
still made use of the fog shrouding the
base<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.770> bridge<00:01:29.869> looking<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:30.990> a

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
base of the bridge looking in a

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.319 
base of the bridge looking in a
completely<00:01:31.409> different<00:01:31.650> direction<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.520> wanted

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
completely different direction I wanted

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.530 
completely different direction I wanted
to<00:01:33.479> see<00:01:33.600> how<00:01:33.840> much<00:01:33.960> detail<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.710> could<00:01:35.220> capture

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
to see how much detail I could capture

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.850 
to see how much detail I could capture
with<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.570> lens<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.079> again<00:01:37.259> at<00:01:37.409> 800

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
with the lens and again at 800

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.039 
with the lens and again at 800
millimeters<00:01:38.280> these<00:01:38.610> are<00:01:38.939> tourists<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.630> top<00:01:39.840> of

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
millimeters these are tourists on top of

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.289 
millimeters these are tourists on top of
Twin<00:01:40.680> Peaks<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.790> other<00:01:41.909> side<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.210> this

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
Twin Peaks on the other side of this

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.490 
Twin Peaks on the other side of this
hill<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.810> downtown<00:01:43.290> San<00:01:43.560> Francisco

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
hill is downtown San Francisco

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.899 
hill is downtown San Francisco
so<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.590> give<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.740> an<00:01:46.860> idea<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.430> different

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
so to give you an idea of the different

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.910 
so to give you an idea of the different
options<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.540> have<00:01:48.720> with<00:01:48.930> extenders<00:01:49.530> this

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
options you have with extenders this

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.660 
options you have with extenders this
image<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:52.200> Waldo<00:01:52.560> tunnel<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.159> Marin

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
image is of the Waldo tunnel in Marin

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.149 
image is of the Waldo tunnel in Marin
actually<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.360> Marin<00:01:54.540> Headlands<00:01:54.899> at<00:01:55.170> 800

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
actually the Marin Headlands at 800

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.090 
actually the Marin Headlands at 800
millimeters<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:57.020> here<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.380> another<00:01:58.740> version

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
millimeters and here is another version

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.569 
millimeters and here is another version
of<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.520> with<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.750> 1.4<00:02:01.500> teleconverter<00:02:02.219> on<00:02:02.399> there

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
of it with a 1.4 teleconverter on there

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.580 
of it with a 1.4 teleconverter on there
so<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.850> brings<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.180> up<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.299> about

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
so that brings it up to about

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.010 
so that brings it up to about
I<00:02:04.710> don't<00:02:05.219> know<00:02:05.310> 1,100<00:02:05.939> 1,100<00:02:06.359> 20<00:02:06.600> millimeters

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
I don't know 1,100 1,100 20 millimeters

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.859 
I don't know 1,100 1,100 20 millimeters
or<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.649> then<00:02:08.280> swapping<00:02:09.000> out<00:02:09.179> that

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
or so and then swapping out that

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.530 
or so and then swapping out that
extender<00:02:10.649> for<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.920> two<00:02:11.280> time<00:02:11.489> extender<00:02:12.000> this

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
extender for a two time extender this

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.640 
extender for a two time extender this
shows<00:02:13.200> what's<00:02:13.830> possible<00:02:13.950> with<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.550> two<00:02:14.700> time

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
shows what's possible with the two time

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.960 
shows what's possible with the two time
extender

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
extender

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.940

now<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.030> downside<00:02:18.629> to<00:02:19.019> this<00:02:19.140> this<00:02:19.500> day<00:02:19.709> was

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
now the downside to this this day was

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.020 
now the downside to this this day was
that<00:02:20.160> there<00:02:20.310> was<00:02:20.400> quite<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:20.640> bit<00:02:20.849> of

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
that there was quite a bit of

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.000 
that there was quite a bit of
atmospheric<00:02:21.750> distortion<00:02:22.290> but<00:02:22.470> ultimately

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
atmospheric distortion but ultimately

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.740 
atmospheric distortion but ultimately
gives<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.340> an<00:02:23.400> idea<00:02:23.549> of<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:24.000> magnification

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
gives you an idea of the magnification

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.430 
gives you an idea of the magnification
capabilities<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.739> the<00:02:26.160> lens<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:27.290> without<00:02:28.290> the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
capabilities of the lens and without the

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.990 
capabilities of the lens and without the
fog<00:02:28.650> this<00:02:28.860> is<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.190> view<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.640> Golden<00:02:29.910> Gate

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
fog this is the view of the Golden Gate

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.240 
fog this is the view of the Golden Gate
Bridge<00:02:30.060> from<00:02:30.360> this<00:02:30.510> very<00:02:30.690> same<00:02:31.049> viewpoint<00:02:34.250> now

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
Bridge from this very same viewpoint now

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.030 
Bridge from this very same viewpoint now
a<00:02:35.280> little<00:02:35.849> later<00:02:36.060> I<00:02:36.540> went<00:02:37.290> over<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.769> Legion

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
a little later I went over to the Legion

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.890 
a little later I went over to the Legion
of<00:02:38.099> Honor<00:02:38.310> when<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.269> weather<00:02:39.420> was<00:02:39.599> a<00:02:39.630> little

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
of Honor when the weather was a little

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.420 
of Honor when the weather was a little
bit<00:02:40.019> different<00:02:40.380> I<00:02:40.530> kind<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:40.920> had<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.069> tough<00:02:41.130> time

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
bit different I kind of had a tough time

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.740 
bit different I kind of had a tough time
with<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.640> weather<00:02:41.819> this<00:02:42.030> one<00:02:42.239> weekend<00:02:42.599> that<00:02:42.720> I

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
with the weather this one weekend that I

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.259 
with the weather this one weekend that I
was<00:02:42.989> using<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.650> lens<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.130> this<00:02:44.790> is<00:02:44.940> about<00:02:45.150> the

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
was using the lens so this is about the

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.289 
was using the lens so this is about the
extent<00:02:45.599> of<00:02:45.720> my<00:02:45.780> wildlife<00:02:46.410> photography

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
extent of my wildlife photography

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.020 
extent of my wildlife photography
unfortunately<00:02:48.299> and<00:02:48.510> this<00:02:49.230> black<00:02:49.530> bird<00:02:50.030> was

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
unfortunately and this black bird was

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.470 
unfortunately and this black bird was
basically<00:02:51.420> at<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:52.049> edge<00:02:52.349> of<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:54.180> nearest

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
basically at the edge of the nearest

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.869 
basically at the edge of the nearest
focal<00:02:54.870> distance<00:02:55.200> of<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.410> lens<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:55.950> there's

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
focal distance of the lens and there's

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.789 
focal distance of the lens and there's
quite<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.120> great<00:02:57.329> deal<00:02:57.360> of<00:02:57.599> detail<00:02:58.140> this<00:02:58.590> is<00:02:58.650> I

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
quite a great deal of detail this is I

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.789 
quite a great deal of detail this is I
believe<00:02:58.950> it's<00:02:59.400> 1600<00:03:00.180> ISO<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.870> it's<00:03:01.500> really

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
believe it's 1600 ISO and it's really

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.100 
believe it's 1600 ISO and it's really
sharp<00:03:02.040> not<00:03:02.430> too<00:03:02.640> much<00:03:02.790> noise<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.329> then

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
sharp not too much noise and then

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.110 
sharp not too much noise and then
looking<00:03:04.680> up<00:03:04.860> there<00:03:05.099> was<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.220> red-tailed<00:03:05.610> hawk

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
looking up there was a red-tailed hawk

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.960 
looking up there was a red-tailed hawk
hovering<00:03:06.840> into<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.950> clouds<00:03:08.220> so<00:03:08.639> I<00:03:08.670> get<00:03:08.850> an

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
hovering into the clouds so I get an

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.110 
hovering into the clouds so I get an
idea<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.329> how<00:03:09.720> far<00:03:09.959> away<00:03:10.519> that<00:03:11.519> Hawk<00:03:11.700> was<00:03:11.940> I

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
idea of how far away that Hawk was I

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.900 
idea of how far away that Hawk was I
think<00:03:12.269> this<00:03:12.720> may<00:03:12.959> actually<00:03:13.200> be<00:03:13.590> at<00:03:14.069> 1600

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
think this may actually be at 1600

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.590 
think this may actually be at 1600
millimetres<00:03:15.319> and<00:03:16.400> then<00:03:17.400> also<00:03:17.609> to<00:03:17.850> give<00:03:18.359> you<00:03:18.480> an

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
millimetres and then also to give you an

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.199 
millimetres and then also to give you an
idea<00:03:18.720> of<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:22.849> magnification<00:03:23.849> of<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.000> lens

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
idea of the magnification of the lens

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.860 
idea of the magnification of the lens
this<00:03:24.930> is<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.950> Saint<00:03:26.519> Ignatius<00:03:26.730> Church<00:03:27.000> and

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
this is a Saint Ignatius Church and

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.199 
this is a Saint Ignatius Church and
that's<00:03:28.109> st.<00:03:28.440> Ignatius<00:03:29.040> Church<00:03:29.280> which<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:30.060> lot

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
that's st. Ignatius Church which a lot

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.720 
that's st. Ignatius Church which a lot
of<00:03:30.239> people<00:03:30.329> can<00:03:31.109> recognize<00:03:31.260> when<00:03:32.250> they<00:03:32.370> visit

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
of people can recognize when they visit

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.129 
of people can recognize when they visit
San<00:03:32.910> Francisco<00:03:33.389> and<00:03:33.709> at<00:03:34.709> sunset<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:36.139> the

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
San Francisco and at sunset and the

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.979 
San Francisco and at sunset and the
interesting<00:03:37.470> thing<00:03:37.500> about<00:03:37.650> this<00:03:38.040> was<00:03:38.430> that

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
interesting thing about this was that

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.780 
interesting thing about this was that
it's<00:03:39.989> about<00:03:40.319> and<00:03:41.069> again<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.370> didn't<00:03:41.639> really

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
it's about and again I didn't really

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.539 
it's about and again I didn't really
mention<00:03:41.910> this<00:03:42.120> in<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.329> previous<00:03:43.250> photos<00:03:44.250> but

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
mention this in the previous photos but

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.120 
mention this in the previous photos but
at<00:03:44.790> 800<00:03:45.299> millimetres<00:03:45.660> a<00:03:45.690> lot<00:03:45.840> of<00:03:45.930> these

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
at 800 millimetres a lot of these

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.009 
at 800 millimetres a lot of these
subjects<00:03:47.130> are<00:03:47.280> about<00:03:47.489> four<00:03:47.790> miles<00:03:48.000> away<00:03:48.269> so

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
subjects are about four miles away so

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.379 
subjects are about four miles away so
it's<00:03:49.169> a<00:03:49.230> great<00:03:49.410> deal<00:03:49.620> away<00:03:49.739> and<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:51.180> great

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
it's a great deal away and the great

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:52.849 
it's a great deal away and the great
thing<00:03:51.569> about<00:03:51.599> this<00:03:51.930> lens<00:03:52.109> also<00:03:52.500> is<00:03:52.650> that<00:03:52.769> it

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
thing about this lens also is that it

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.339 
thing about this lens also is that it
gives<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.849> option<00:03:54.269> to<00:03:54.480> create<00:03:54.870> some<00:03:55.169> very

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
gives you the option to create some very

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.339 
gives you the option to create some very
interesting<00:03:55.650> abstracts<00:03:56.459> and<00:03:57.139> here's<00:03:58.139> one

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
interesting abstracts and here's one

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:59.659 
interesting abstracts and here's one
with<00:03:58.560> a<00:03:58.620> full<00:03:59.099> moon

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
with a full moon

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.879 
with a full moon
that's<00:04:00.090> peeking<00:04:00.510> through<00:04:00.540> two<00:04:01.410> layers<00:04:01.680> of

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
that's peeking through two layers of

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.659 
that's peeking through two layers of
storm<00:04:02.370> clouds<00:04:02.669> at<00:04:02.910> sunset<00:04:03.329> and<00:04:04.099> a<00:04:05.099> little<00:04:05.579> bit

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
storm clouds at sunset and a little bit

I<00:04:12.550> would<00:04:13.300> definitely<00:04:13.450> rent<00:04:13.840> it<00:04:13.960> again<00:04:14.230> I<00:04:14.500> don't

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
I would definitely rent it again I don't

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.800 
I would definitely rent it again I don't
know<00:04:15.010> that<00:04:15.100> I<00:04:15.220> could<00:04:15.400> afford<00:04:15.670> it<00:04:15.850> but<00:04:16.269> I<00:04:16.299> really

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
know that I could afford it but I really

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.930 
know that I could afford it but I really
enjoyed<00:04:17.140> using<00:04:17.380> it<00:04:17.650> and<00:04:17.860> I<00:04:18.430> really<00:04:18.820> regret

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
enjoyed using it and I really regret

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:19.920 
enjoyed using it and I really regret
that<00:04:19.060> I<00:04:19.180> didn't<00:04:19.330> get<00:04:19.390> a<00:04:19.450> chance<00:04:19.600> to<00:04:19.750> use<00:04:19.900> it

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
that I didn't get a chance to use it

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.830 
that I didn't get a chance to use it
more<00:04:20.290> with<00:04:20.790> wildlife<00:04:21.790> I<00:04:22.030> did<00:04:22.210> get<00:04:22.330> to<00:04:22.510> use<00:04:22.540> it

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
more with wildlife I did get to use it

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.200 
more with wildlife I did get to use it
from<00:04:23.170> a<00:04:23.410> panning<00:04:23.890> perspective<00:04:24.460> but<00:04:24.790> because

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
from a panning perspective but because

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.990 
from a panning perspective but because
of<00:04:25.420> the<00:04:25.570> weather<00:04:25.900> and<00:04:26.350> air<00:04:26.560> conditions<00:04:27.010> the

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
of the weather and air conditions the

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.190 
of the weather and air conditions the
photos<00:04:28.270> really<00:04:28.390> weren't<00:04:28.630> worth<00:04:28.810> of<00:04:28.930> showing

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
photos really weren't worth of showing

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.930 
photos really weren't worth of showing
but<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.770> ease<00:04:29.890> of<00:04:29.920> use<00:04:30.250> with<00:04:30.280> the<00:04:30.520> lens<00:04:30.730> was

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
but the ease of use with the lens was

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.240 
but the ease of use with the lens was
great<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:32.200> image<00:04:32.440> stabilization<00:04:32.800> was

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
great the image stabilization was

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.870 
great the image stabilization was
excellent<00:04:33.730> and<00:04:34.000> overall<00:04:34.600> sharpness<00:04:35.130> was<00:04:36.130> very

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
excellent and overall sharpness was very

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.420 
excellent and overall sharpness was very
very<00:04:37.060> good<00:04:37.180> so<00:04:38.050> I<00:04:38.080> would<00:04:38.650> recommend<00:04:39.010> it<00:04:39.130> I<00:04:39.280> will
