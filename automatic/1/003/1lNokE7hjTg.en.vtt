00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:01.689
What’s up guys, hope you’re doing well.

00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:04.760
So this week I decided to make Top 100 Things
Modern Warfare 3 Players Say.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.770
Black Ops 2 is coming out soon and I thought
this would be the perfect time to release

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.770
this video.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.030
Make sure to leave a comment down below about
which number you’ve said or heard before,

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.630
as well as which Top 100 video you want to
see me make next.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.179

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:15.320
Press the like button.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.910
New videos Sundays and Wednesdays.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:17.910
No Jugamos Juegos.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:18.950
Throw me the alley.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.820
Top 100 Things Modern Warfare 3 Players Say.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.930
1) What are you, like twelve years old?

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.180
2) Is this guy really using the Riot Shield
right now?

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.310
3) This lag is ridiculous though!

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.840
4) I feel like these graphics haven’t changed
at all.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.460
5) What type of spawn was that?

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.850
6) How do you go 2-27?

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.720
7) Were you just running into death?

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.740
8) How did I miss him?

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.740
What the?

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.800
9) Boy, I am a beast with the MP-7.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.480
Ts ts ts ts ts ts ts ts ts ts ts ts ts ts
ts.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.480
Silent death.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.710
10) Man, this host has Wal-Mart connection.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.220
11) Yes man, I am black.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.720
OK, I may not sound black.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.720
That doesn’t mean I’m not black.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.210
12) I don’t have to prove myself to you.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.210
I don’t even know why I’m talking to you.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.210
13) Mission is the best map.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.210
14) I like Hardhat too.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.210
Hardhat is up there.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.210
15) You guys suck.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.870
No, I’m being dead serious, you guys suck.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.040
16) Mission, Hardhat, and Dome: those are
my top 3.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.040
17) DAHECK?

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.829
I’m not going to accept your friend request
you’re twelve years old and you just went

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:59.829
-14.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:00.829
18) Quickscoping is for noobs.

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:01.829
19) Panic Knife.

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:02.829
20) Someone get my Care Package.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:03.829
21) Battlefield sucks.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:04.829
What are you talking about?

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:05.829
22) Don’t get the Care Package.

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:06.829
That’s my Care Package!

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:07.829
23) Go to the A base.

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:08.829
I’m over here by myself.

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:10.590
24) Get DAHECK out of my way!

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.590
25) Stop rubbing up against me!

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.960
26) How DAHECK do they have an Osprey Gunner?

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.960
We just started!

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.750
27) If you’re so good then 1 v 1 me.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.750
28) Oh!

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.750
Oh yeah!

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:18.750
Mhmm.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.750
Come here.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:20.750
Take a seat sir.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:21.750
Please, please take a seat.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.750
29) I am playing with amateurs right now.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:23.750
You guys are scrubs.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.750
30) I bet all you do is play Team Deathmatch.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.750
Let me look this up.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.750
Mhmm.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.750
31) Who DAHECK uses heartbeat sensors?

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.030
32) Somebody shoot down the helicopter!

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.740
33) I was one kill away!

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.460
34) So no one is going to shoot down the helicopter?

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.689
No one is going to shoot down the helicopter?

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.970
35) Y’all need to lighten up a little bit.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:35.970
It’s just a game.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.970
36) I’m not hacking you.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:37.970
You just suck.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:38.970
37) Pfff.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.970
He rage quit.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:40.970
38) Where is he sniping from?

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:41.970
39) Mom!

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:42.970
Mom!

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:43.970
Can you make me a sandwich please?

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:44.970
40) Come on!

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:45.970
Mom!

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:46.970
41) Dang, new map pack already?

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:47.970
42) I just got good on the last maps.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.490
43) This man knifed me from 50 feet away!

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.290
44) There are so many glitches in this game.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.650
45) If I’m looking this way, you can’t
be looking the same way.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.729
46) What’s wrong with you?

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.030
Have you played this game before?

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.030
47) Nobody die.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.509
I got a Pave Low on the way.

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.200
48) I need some batteries.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.250
Mom!

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.400
Mom where are the batteries at?

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.400
Mom.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.400
Mom!

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.400
49) What are you doing running out in the
open like that?

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.400
I just said nobody die.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.670
50) It doesn’t matter how many kills you
had last round.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.690
We’re playing Capture the Flag.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.460
51) Why would you lie down in front of a doorway?

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.980
52) Why would you open that?

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.849
You think they are going to intentionally
throw a Care Package right next to our whole

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:16.849
team?

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.160
53) Did you guys seriously just up vote Downturn
over Dome?

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.470
54) Y’all don’t have any common sense.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.470
55) Look at my k-d.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.470
Look at my k-d.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.680
56) My little sister was playing last round
and not me.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.680
Did you know that?

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.310
You let my little sister kill you four times.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.310
57) You’re not even good.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.310
All you did was camp the whole game.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.310
58) How’s that even fun?

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.310
How do you even live with yourself?

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.590
59) What DAHECK are you guys doing?

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.810
Can you kill someone?

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.050
60) Are these guys really using a lag switch?

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.650
61) You can’t kill me and stay in the exact
same place and not expect me to find you.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.650
62) Hey guys, be careful.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.070
They got a guy running around with a shotgun.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.800
It’s golden too, that’s how you know he’s
a noob.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.790
63) You need some more friends…one would
be a start.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.770
64) I shot him like twenty-seven times.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:49.770
Are you serious?

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.150
65) You are not a grown man.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.349
You’re like twelve years old.

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.650
I bet you still live at home with your parents.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.650
Is that her calling you?

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.930
66) Tell her I said hi.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.010
No, for real…I’m not playing.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.599
Tell her I said hi.

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:59.599
67) Hey mom.

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:00.599
Hey mom.

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.060
I’m busy right now; I’m going to have
to call you back later, OK?

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.760
I’m just doing something…some homework
and some stuff.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.140
68) Man they got this guy using Akimbo FMGs.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.769
Why don’t you use a real gun.

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.810
69) Oh yeah, well I quickscoped your mom last
night.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.459
70) Why would you just take my kill like that?

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:13.459
I was one kill away!

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:14.459
71) How did he not see me?

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.500
72) No scope headshot.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.500
Bam!

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.500
73) Last kill!

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.500
Look at the kill cam.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.500
It’s so glorious…watch.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.500
Wait for it.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.500
Ohhhhhhh!

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.500
74) I hate Dead Man’s Hand.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.370
75) Are you a girl or a guy?

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.370
Be for real.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.370
I don’t know…I don’t know…that’s
why I’m asking.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.370
I don’t know!

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.450
76) Don’t run from your destiny.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.510
77) If you’re on my team next round…just
hide.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.770
78) Noob.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.530
79) Can you guys hear me?

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.790
Can you…hello?

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:38.790
You can hear me?

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:39.790
80) Man, you shut up!

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.410
81) This is my sixth time I got killed by
a random grenade.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.770
82) The Call of Duty servers are down?

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.020
What DAHECK?

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.020
Not again.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.020
83) This game is garbage.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.849
Halo is definitely better…said no one ever.

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:49.849
84) Ok.

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:50.870
I got something for this.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.200
I got something for this.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.200
Quickdraw!

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.629
Mhmm, try to shoot me first again.

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.780
I bet it won’t happen!

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.590
I…OK…so OK…so…OK.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.730
I didn’t see you that time.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.510
85) What is wrong with this controller?

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.890
It has to be the controller cause I know I
shot this man dead in his chest 47 times consecutively.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:08.890
86) Aww HECK NO!

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.629
There is no way he shot me first!

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:11.989
87) I have assassin.

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.500
Can you not come near me please?

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.530
88) Type 95 is so overpowered in this game!

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:16.819
89) Of course I’m going to camp.

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:17.999
I have a sniper!

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:18.999
90) Muted.

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:20.539
91) Auto-aim always messes me up!

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:21.539
92) Man, this game sucks!

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.400
93) They need to put Nuke Town in this game.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.400
94) U Mad Bro?

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.949
95) I just prestiged, of course I’m going
to suck.

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.569
96) This lag compensation was the worst idea
ever.

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:31.080
97) Mom, I cannot pause this mom!

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.080
98) My bad guys.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.550
99) Why’d they even bring back quickscoping?

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.229
100) Forget this game man!

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.080
I can’t wait til Black Ops 2 comes out!

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.879
You can’t find the remote.

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:41.919
Twitter is over capacity.

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:42.919
Ran out of toilet paper.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.129
Ran out of milk.

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:48.129
