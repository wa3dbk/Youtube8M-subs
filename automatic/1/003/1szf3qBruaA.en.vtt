goes it really did touch on hygiene for
me<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:21.930> need<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.380> see<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.800> science<00:00:23.369> behind<00:00:23.990> the

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
me I need to see the science behind the

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.420 
me I need to see the science behind the
laser<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.740> can<00:00:25.890> have<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.070> little<00:00:26.250> bit

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
laser so I can have a little bit

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.160 
laser so I can have a little bit
knowledge<00:00:26.580> myself<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.630> can<00:00:27.720> take<00:00:28.019> that

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
knowledge myself so that I can take that

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.509 
knowledge myself so that I can take that
knowledge<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.619> be<00:00:28.740> able<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.949> explain<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.340> to

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
knowledge and be able to explain it to

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.490 
knowledge and be able to explain it to
the<00:00:29.609> patient's<00:00:30.119> not<00:00:30.599> scientifically<00:00:31.199> but

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
the patient's not scientifically but

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.780 
the patient's not scientifically but
enough<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.800> they<00:00:32.009> understand<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.700> because

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
enough that they understand it because

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.180 
enough that they understand it because
if<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.059> patient<00:00:33.450> understands<00:00:34.200> what<00:00:34.920> you're

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
if a patient understands what you're

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.130 
if a patient understands what you're
trying<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.670> sell<00:00:35.969> them<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.809> they<00:00:36.930> are<00:00:37.020> not

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
trying to sell them and they are not

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.209 
trying to sell them and they are not
really<00:00:37.350> selling<00:00:37.620> them<00:00:37.920> you're<00:00:38.070> actually

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
really selling them you're actually

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.069 
really selling them you're actually
helping<00:00:38.550> them<00:00:38.879> out<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.329> you're<00:00:39.480> providing

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
helping them out and you're providing

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.990 
helping them out and you're providing
them<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.290> service<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:41.280> when<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.489> patient's<00:00:41.879> on

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
them a service and when the patient's on

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.119 
them a service and when the patient's on
board<00:00:42.300> they're<00:00:42.510> more<00:00:42.690> likely<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.140> have<00:00:43.320> more

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
board they're more likely to have more

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.500 
board they're more likely to have more
follow<00:00:44.399> through<00:00:44.700> when<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.059> comes<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.360> their

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
follow through when it comes to their

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.250 
follow through when it comes to their
own<00:00:45.629> there<00:00:46.489> so<00:00:47.489> for<00:00:47.820> me<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.210> needed<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.660> see<00:00:48.870> a

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
own there so for me I needed to see a

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.200 
own there so for me I needed to see a

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
knowledge so that they put their trust

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.990 
knowledge so that they put their trust
in<00:00:57.690> me<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.530> gained<00:00:58.890> their<00:00:59.100> trust<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.609> like

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
in me and I gained their trust and like

in me and I gained their trust and like
I<00:01:00.059> said<00:01:00.180> Billy<00:01:00.449> have<00:01:00.690> more<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.020> follow

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
I said Billy have more of a follow

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.860 
I said Billy have more of a follow
through<00:01:01.500> with<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.760> doctors<00:01:03.180> course<00:01:03.600> was

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
through with it the doctors course was

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.109

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
get into hygiene which was nice I was

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.310 
get into hygiene which was nice I was
afraid<00:01:08.520> sometimes<00:01:08.909> these<00:01:09.750> kind<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.080> courses

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
afraid sometimes these kind of courses

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.830 
afraid sometimes these kind of courses
pay<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> lot<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.010> tension<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.580> DDS<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.659> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
pay a lot of tension to the DDS and the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.380 
pay a lot of tension to the DDS and the
tissue<00:01:13.439> cutting<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.250> bone<00:01:14.490> cutting<00:01:15.000> and

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
tissue cutting and the bone cutting and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.850 
tissue cutting and the bone cutting and
all<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.630> sort<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.900> stuff<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.560> one<00:01:16.740> really

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
all that sort of stuff this one really

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.420 
all that sort of stuff this one really
didn't<00:01:17.220> focus<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:17.580> hygiene<00:01:18.000> which<00:01:18.119> was<00:01:18.330> nice

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
didn't focus on hygiene which was nice

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.560

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
this way i can actually use the laser

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.530 
this way i can actually use the laser
and<00:02:03.159> utilize<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.579> laser<00:02:03.759> for<00:02:04.149> you<00:02:04.360> know

and utilize the laser for you know

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.200 
and utilize the laser for you know
