00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
me a little bit about what it was that

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.109 
me a little bit about what it was that
you<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.710> think<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.130> was<00:00:26.250> was<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.699> pics<00:00:26.939> was

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.880 
like as much as possible we will fix our
stuff<00:02:41.310> with<00:02:41.610> travelling<00:02:42.349> in<00:02:43.349> the<00:02:43.500> beginning

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
stuff with travelling in the beginning

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.800 
stuff with travelling in the beginning
of<00:02:44.040> his<00:02:44.220> plate<00:02:44.459> so<00:02:44.819> it's<00:02:45.269> going<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.540> be<00:02:45.599> much

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
of his plate so it's going to be much

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.789

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
easier for us to get three wins and then

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.120 
easier for us to get three wins and then
I<00:02:50.209> just<00:02:51.209> think<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:51.510> we<00:02:52.200> failed<00:02:52.829> a<00:02:52.980> lot

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130

against<00:02:53.579> work<00:02:53.790> at<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.260> mmm<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:56.700> thought<00:02:56.910> that

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
against work at the mmm the thought that

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.250 
against work at the mmm the thought that
were<00:02:57.950> stronger<00:02:58.950> than<00:02:59.010> them<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.610> just<00:03:00.260> and

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
were stronger than them and just and

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.160 
were stronger than them and just and
things<00:03:02.040> just<00:03:02.250> went<00:03:02.459> wrong<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:03.060> that<00:03:03.840> Ellis

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
farm as much as possible that's why I

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.569 
farm as much as possible that's why I
was<00:03:45.660> late<00:03:45.870> first<00:03:46.230> level<00:03:46.440> 16<00:03:46.889> on<00:03:47.010> map<00:03:47.190> and<00:03:47.430> no

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
was late first level 16 on map and no

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.759 
was late first level 16 on map and no
one<00:03:47.730> was<00:03:47.970> around<00:03:48.120> me<00:03:48.480> that's<00:03:48.930> why<00:03:49.139> I<00:03:49.169> got<00:03:49.440> much

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
one was around me that's why I got much

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.409 
one was around me that's why I got much
more<00:03:49.950> damage<00:03:50.220> than<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.430> enemy<00:03:50.760> team<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.180> it

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
more damage than the enemy team and it

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.089 
more damage than the enemy team and it
was<00:03:51.630> much<00:03:51.930> easier<00:03:51.959> for<00:03:52.380> me<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.500> do<00:03:52.680> team<00:03:52.859> fights

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
was much easier for me to do team fights

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.720 
was much easier for me to do team fights
and<00:03:53.450> I<00:03:54.450> think<00:03:55.049> I<00:03:55.139> understand<00:03:55.650> this<00:03:55.950> pretty

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
and I think I understand this pretty

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.520 
and I think I understand this pretty
late<00:03:56.970> that<00:03:57.329> I<00:03:57.660> should<00:03:57.840> play<00:03:57.989> like<00:03:58.169> that<00:03:58.319> and

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
late that I should play like that and

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.949 
late that I should play like that and
that<00:03:58.620> was<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:59.310> main<00:03:59.459> problem<00:03:59.790> by<00:03:59.910> me<00:04:00.060> but<00:04:00.780> you

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
that was the main problem by me but you

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.690 
that was the main problem by me but you
understood<00:04:01.410> now<00:04:01.470> and<00:04:01.889> to<00:04:02.010> be<00:04:02.130> honest<00:04:02.400> you<00:04:02.519> guys

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700
