enough whenever I went to water show you
it<00:00:41.290> just<00:00:41.650> would<00:00:42.040> run<00:00:42.280> down<00:00:42.490> and<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:44.230> usually

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
it just would run down and it usually

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.650 
it just would run down and it usually
would<00:00:45.040> pull<00:00:45.340> all<00:00:45.490> the<00:00:45.640> soil<00:00:45.910> out<00:00:46.210> of<00:00:46.240> the<00:00:46.360> pots

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660

in<00:02:09.600> any<00:02:09.810> pot<00:02:10.200> just<00:02:11.190> use<00:02:11.370> different<00:02:11.549> sized

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
in any pot just use different sized

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.289 
in any pot just use different sized
plastic<00:02:12.360> bottles<00:02:13.220> whatever<00:02:14.220> suits<00:02:14.610> your

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
situation all right that's my tip for

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.700
