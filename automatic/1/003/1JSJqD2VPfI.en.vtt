 also because there must be a mass 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.910
 homogeneous but for this the brand is 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.910
 cold for you can add the 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.000

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.340
 one way and where with margarine and cornmeal 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.900
 so that the balls do not stick to the bottom 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.079
 the way we 're going to report the 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.079

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.470
 that we are going to shape the 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.720

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:27.000
 help to fix it I had to 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.000
 You make the shape of the little ball right 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.579
 This dough has yielded 50 sisters but that's all. 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.920
 depends on the size you make the 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.829
 province is too large for the 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.519
 kills will sell less good will sell 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.519
 less portions 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.659
 while you are doing the 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.060
 Do not forget to pre-heat the 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:02.489
 oven and after it's ready you 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:07.129
 takes the witch to bake in a 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.129
 temperature of 220 degrees for 20 minutes 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.009
