version of the AR 72 2 3 it's not a well
known<00:00:26.250> farm<00:00:26.609> but<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.119> think<00:00:27.570> it's<00:00:27.720> out<00:00:27.869> there<00:00:28.109> we

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
known farm but I think it's out there we

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.710 
known farm but I think it's out there we
have<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.830> blog<00:00:29.130> blog<00:00:29.730> article<00:00:30.240> on<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:30.660> you

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
have a blog blog article on it so you

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.930 
have a blog blog article on it so you
can<00:00:30.929> check<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.170> out<00:00:31.500> for<00:00:31.740> more<00:00:31.980> info<00:00:32.250> but

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
disagreement over the bolt system they

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.740 
disagreement over the bolt system they
agreed<00:00:56.430> they<00:00:56.579> wanted<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.910> have<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> long-stroke

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
agreed they wanted to have a long-stroke

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.209 
agreed they wanted to have a long-stroke
piston<00:00:57.870> much<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:58.949> on<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.660> on<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> K<00:01:01.620> but

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
piston much like on the on the a K but

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.810 
piston much like on the on the a K but
sig<00:01:02.879> wanted<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.539> use<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.750> roller<00:01:04.170> delay<00:01:04.820> whereas

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
sig wanted to use a roller delay whereas

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.899 
sig wanted to use a roller delay whereas
beretta<00:01:06.510> wanted<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.200> use<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.830> rotating<00:01:08.760> bolt

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
beretta wanted to use a rotating bolt

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.340 
beretta wanted to use a rotating bolt
with<00:01:09.060> two<00:01:09.240> lugs<00:01:09.450> for<00:01:09.720> getting<00:01:09.930> kind<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.320> a

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
with two lugs for getting kind of the a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.020 
with two lugs for getting kind of the a
K<00:01:10.650> style<00:01:11.119> so<00:01:12.119> they<00:01:12.270> split<00:01:12.479> up<00:01:12.689> over<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.080> and

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
K style so they split up over that and

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.609 
K style so they split up over that and
this<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.270> what<00:01:15.979> Italy<00:01:16.979> came<00:01:17.189> up<00:01:17.460> with<00:01:17.700> and

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
this is what Italy came up with and

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.899 
this is what Italy came up with and
interestingly<00:01:19.619> enough<00:01:19.950> sig<00:01:20.430> ended<00:01:20.790> up

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
interestingly enough sig ended up

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.080 
interestingly enough sig ended up
abandoning<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.869> SG<00:01:22.320> 530<00:01:23.009> with<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.670> rollers

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
abandoning the SG 530 with the rollers

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.230 
abandoning the SG 530 with the rollers
and<00:01:24.360> went<00:01:24.780> over<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.320> SG<00:01:25.770> 540<00:01:26.670> which<00:01:26.850> became

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
and went over to the SG 540 which became

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.069 
and went over to the SG 540 which became
the<00:01:27.509> CGW<00:01:28.049> 90<00:01:28.829> or<00:01:28.950> p90<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:30.150> ended<00:01:30.750> up<00:01:30.840> using

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
the CGW 90 or p90 and it ended up using

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.740 
the CGW 90 or p90 and it ended up using
the<00:01:31.290> same<00:01:31.619> mass<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.579> two<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:33.060> rotating<00:01:33.570> bolt

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
the same mass the two of rotating bolt

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.719 
the same mass the two of rotating bolt
that<00:01:34.020> beretta<00:01:34.380> had<00:01:34.650> been<00:01:34.890> advocating<00:01:35.610> all

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
that beretta had been advocating all

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.109 
that beretta had been advocating all
along<00:01:36.409> anyway<00:01:37.409> he<00:01:38.070> started<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.640> be<00:01:38.759> developed
