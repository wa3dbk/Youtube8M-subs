this area there's a map here that you

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.250 
this area there's a map here that you
have<00:02:42.690> bought<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.769> need<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.099> zoom<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:45.260> if

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
have bought you need to zoom in if

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.770 
have bought you need to zoom in if
you're<00:02:46.500> not<00:02:46.620> sure<00:02:46.920> where<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:47.910> start<00:02:48.120> looking

you're not sure where to start looking

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.390 
you're not sure where to start looking
because<00:02:48.930> at<00:02:49.140> some<00:02:49.349> point<00:02:49.380> everything's<00:02:50.160> going

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
because at some point everything's going

the email just sent you and I whatever
there's<00:02:57.299> the<00:02:57.630> basic<00:02:58.940> area<00:02:59.940> of<00:03:00.120> where<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.989> map

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
there's the basic area of where the map

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.280 
there's the basic area of where the map
is<00:03:01.380> so<00:03:02.090> 2926<00:03:03.090> south<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:04.319> 3024<00:03:05.310> east<00:03:06.079> so<00:03:07.079> let's

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
is so 2926 south and 3024 east so let's

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.740 
is so 2926 south and 3024 east so let's
go<00:03:07.560> there<00:03:08.000> you're<00:03:09.000> going<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.209> use<00:03:09.329> your<00:03:09.510> cursor

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
go there you're going to use your cursor

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:26.349 
go there you're going to use your cursor
t34<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:16.310> 26<00:03:18.410> 30<00:03:19.410> 34<00:03:20.420> and<00:03:22.280> start<00:03:23.280> zooming<00:03:23.489> in

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.800 

just<00:03:27.359> so<00:03:27.660> people<00:03:28.049> with<00:03:28.350> their<00:03:28.530> in<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.680> corner

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
just so people with their in the corner

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.800 
just so people with their in the corner
notice<00:03:30.810> as<00:03:31.440> you<00:03:32.010> start<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.459> zoom<00:03:32.639> in<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:33.600> map

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
notice as you start to zoom in the map

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.900 
notice as you start to zoom in the map
will<00:03:33.959> start<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.319> become<00:03:34.440> clearer<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.459> you'll

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
will start to become clearer and you'll

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.849 
will start to become clearer and you'll
start<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.239> see<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.450> white<00:03:36.690> points<00:03:37.109> and<00:03:37.290> the

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
start to see the white points and the

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:41.870 
start to see the white points and the
contours<00:03:39.980> might<00:03:40.980> seem<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.220> bit<00:03:41.310> cluttered<00:03:41.639> at

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
contours might seem a bit cluttered at

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.949 
contours might seem a bit cluttered at
this<00:03:42.000> point<00:03:42.299> but<00:03:42.569> once<00:03:42.840> you<00:03:42.959> zoom<00:03:43.019> in<00:03:44.959> you'll

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
this point but once you zoom in you'll

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.569 
this point but once you zoom in you'll
start<00:03:46.260> kneading<00:03:46.680> off<00:03:49.010> here<00:03:50.010> you<00:03:50.160> can<00:03:50.340> see

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
start kneading off here you can see

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.259 
start kneading off here you can see
these<00:03:51.480> depth<00:03:51.900> values<00:03:52.609> these<00:03:53.609> were<00:03:53.760> recorded

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
these depth values these were recorded

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.629 
these depth values these were recorded
at<00:03:54.420> 104<00:03:55.380> percent<00:03:55.560> on<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.430> dam<00:03:56.609> and<00:03:57.079> if<00:03:58.099> you<00:03:59.099> use

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
at 104 percent on the dam and if you use

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.170 
at 104 percent on the dam and if you use
meters<00:04:00.090> you<00:04:00.569> can<00:04:00.810> change<00:04:01.109> this<00:04:01.349> by<00:04:01.940> going<00:04:02.940> into

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
meters you can change this by going into

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.520 
meters you can change this by going into
your<00:04:03.470> system<00:04:04.470> setup<00:04:04.940> menu<00:04:05.940> in<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:06.989> units<00:04:07.319> of

your system setup menu in the units of

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.339 
your system setup menu in the units of
measure<00:04:08.130> and<00:04:10.069> not<00:04:11.069> under<00:04:11.400> depth<00:04:12.049> but<00:04:13.049> under

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
measure and not under depth but under

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:21.580 
measure and not under depth but under
speed<00:04:13.769> you<00:04:14.549> need<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:14.910> change<00:04:15.209> that

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:30.529 

you<00:04:22.590> need<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.889> change<00:04:23.130> that<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:24.169> metric<00:04:29.539> your

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
you need to change that to metric your

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:35.300 
you need to change that to metric your
map<00:04:30.750> should<00:04:30.990> now<00:04:31.139> be<00:04:31.319> in<00:04:32.479> meters<00:04:33.479> I<00:04:34.009> like<00:04:35.009> feet

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
map should now be in meters I like feet

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.870 
map should now be in meters I like feet
at<00:04:36.270> smaller<00:04:36.660> increments<00:04:37.130> so<00:04:38.130> let's<00:04:38.550> take<00:04:38.729> it

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
at smaller increments so let's take it

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:48.080 
at smaller increments so let's take it
back<00:04:39.060> to<00:04:39.389> to<00:04:40.020> that<00:04:46.460> statute<00:04:47.460> is<00:04:47.639> the<00:04:47.789> one<00:04:47.910> that

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
back to to that statute is the one that

00:04:48.090 --> 00:05:01.910 
back to to that statute is the one that
you<00:04:48.210> would<00:04:48.360> need<00:04:48.509> for<00:04:48.750> this

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.620 

you'll<00:05:02.920> see<00:05:03.160> 19<00:05:03.700> feet<00:05:04.200> now<00:05:06.090> you<00:05:07.090> can<00:05:07.270> zoom<00:05:07.480> in

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
you'll see 19 feet now you can zoom in

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.500 
you'll see 19 feet now you can zoom in
and<00:05:07.870> zoom<00:05:07.930> out<00:05:08.550> if<00:05:09.550> you<00:05:09.670> find<00:05:09.940> something<00:05:10.360> of

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
and zoom out if you find something of

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.080 
and zoom out if you find something of
interest<00:05:10.930> on<00:05:11.380> the<00:05:11.620> map<00:05:11.650> anything<00:05:12.610> okay<00:05:12.880> that's

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
interest on the map anything okay that's

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.970 
interest on the map anything okay that's
a<00:05:13.240> handy<00:05:13.570> little<00:05:13.720> spot<00:05:13.990> you<00:05:14.170> can<00:05:14.410> make<00:05:14.710> a

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
a handy little spot you can make a

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.680 
a handy little spot you can make a
