our the strength of our program the idea

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.190 
our the strength of our program the idea

natural this was a natural combination
we<00:01:55.420> also<00:01:55.600> had<00:01:56.409> a<00:01:56.440> two<00:01:56.680> million<00:01:56.890> dollar<00:01:57.220> grant

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
we also had a two million dollar grant

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.520 
we also had a two million dollar grant
to<00:01:57.850> set<00:01:58.090> up<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.390> first<00:01:58.570> doctoral<00:01:59.080> program<00:01:59.500> in

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
to set up the first doctoral program in

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.990 
to set up the first doctoral program in
the<00:01:59.710> country<00:01:59.860> well<00:02:00.130> this<00:02:00.280> is<00:02:00.400> in<00:02:00.520> a<00:02:00.580> field<00:02:00.850> in

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
the country well this is in a field in

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.340 
the country well this is in a field in
which<00:02:01.030> there's<00:02:01.390> not<00:02:01.570> even<00:02:01.600> a<00:02:01.840> doctoral<00:02:02.260> degree

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
which there's not even a doctoral degree

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.440 
which there's not even a doctoral degree
so<00:02:03.159> you've<00:02:03.370> got<00:02:03.400> to<00:02:03.790> be<00:02:03.880> able<00:02:03.909> to<00:02:04.210> establish

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
so you've got to be able to establish

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.990 
so you've got to be able to establish
relationships<00:02:05.350> trust<00:02:05.860> and<00:02:06.100> rapport<00:02:06.430> get

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
relationships trust and rapport get

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.540 
relationships trust and rapport get
people<00:02:07.299> to<00:02:07.360> relate<00:02:07.510> to<00:02:07.810> you<00:02:07.960> and<00:02:08.140> you

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
people to relate to you and you

activate really want something to happen

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.470 
activate really want something to happen
so<00:02:14.240> it's<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.630> me<00:02:15.750> this<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:15.960> also<00:02:16.410> logical<00:02:17.480> I'm

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
so it's to me this is also logical I'm

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
you know one of the thing that might be

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.350 
you know one of the thing that might be
helping<00:02:26.370> folks<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.850> don't<00:02:26.970> necessarily

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
helping folks that don't necessarily

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.850 
helping folks that don't necessarily
have<00:02:27.780> an<00:02:27.900> orientation<00:02:28.320> on<00:02:28.620> higher<00:02:28.830> education

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
have an orientation on higher education

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.030 
have an orientation on higher education
is<00:02:29.760> just<00:02:30.510> how<00:02:30.690> difficult<00:02:30.960> it<00:02:31.350> is<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.500> start<00:02:31.950> a

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
is just how difficult it is to start a

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.740 
is just how difficult it is to start a
new<00:02:32.190> program<00:02:32.490> so<00:02:32.880> when<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.030> think<00:02:33.300> about<00:02:33.390> you

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
new program so when I think about you

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.160 
new program so when I think about you
know<00:02:34.160> activator<00:02:35.210> ideation<00:02:36.210> I<00:02:36.390> mean<00:02:36.900> do<00:02:37.110> you

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170

feel<00:02:37.230> like<00:02:37.530> sometimes<00:02:37.770> you're<00:02:38.070> a<00:02:38.100> fish<00:02:38.280> out<00:02:38.460> of

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
feel like sometimes you're a fish out of

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.700 
feel like sometimes you're a fish out of
water<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:39.210> know<00:02:39.300> on<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.450> college<00:02:39.720> campus<00:02:39.750> well

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
water you know on a college campus well

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.290 
water you know on a college campus well
I<00:02:40.740> would<00:02:41.160> say<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.370> probably<00:02:41.460> feel<00:02:41.970> like<00:02:42.150> your

things you need to strengthen hang in
there<00:03:09.390> but<00:03:09.810> you<00:03:09.960> also<00:03:10.170> need<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.560> talents<00:03:11.070> to

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
there but you also need the talents to
