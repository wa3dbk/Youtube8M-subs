00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.240 

so<00:00:01.230> here<00:00:01.380> we<00:00:01.500> got<00:00:01.650> the<00:00:02.120> plate<00:00:03.120> mounted<00:00:04.250> you're

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
so here we got the plate mounted you're

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.270 
so here we got the plate mounted you're
gonna<00:00:05.339> be<00:00:05.580> hooking<00:00:06.000> up<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.720> batteries

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:07.280 
gonna be hooking up the the batteries

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.749 
gonna be hooking up the the batteries
hooking<00:00:08.280> up<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.490> pivot<00:00:10.519> and<00:00:11.519> then<00:00:11.639> we're

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
hooking up the pivot and then we're

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:26.220 
hooking up the pivot and then we're
gonna<00:00:11.849> be<00:00:12.059> testing<00:00:12.300> it<00:00:18.289> well

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:34.170 

how's<00:00:26.769> it<00:00:26.890> gonna<00:00:26.949> work<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:28.810> it<00:00:29.189> yeah<00:00:30.390> yes<00:00:33.180> see

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
how's it gonna work is it yeah yes see

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.490 
how's it gonna work is it yeah yes see
we<00:00:34.270> just

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.869 

we<00:00:36.949> just<00:00:37.219> tested<00:00:37.940> it<00:00:38.300> and<00:00:39.399> track<00:00:40.399> didn't<00:00:40.730> work

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
we just tested it and track didn't work

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.110 
we just tested it and track didn't work
so<00:00:41.180> we<00:00:41.930> determined<00:00:42.469> that<00:00:42.559> the<00:00:43.120> speed

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
so we determined that the speed

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.799 
so we determined that the speed
controller<00:00:44.600> was<00:00:44.870> bad<00:00:46.030> so<00:00:47.030> we<00:00:47.210> swapped<00:00:47.539> it<00:00:47.719> out

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
controller was bad so we swapped it out

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.899 
controller was bad so we swapped it out
now<00:00:48.170> it<00:00:48.409> works<00:00:49.930> so<00:00:50.930> let's<00:00:51.019> watch<00:00:51.230> it<00:00:51.289> move

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:51.909 
now it works so let's watch it move

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:54.280 
now it works so let's watch it move
alright<00:00:52.909> so<00:00:53.120> we<00:00:53.239> just<00:00:53.269> got<00:00:53.540> this<00:00:53.839> thing<00:00:53.899> all

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
alright so we just got this thing all

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:02.799 
alright so we just got this thing all
buttoned<00:00:55.219> up<00:00:55.339> and<00:00:56.769> there<00:00:57.769> we<00:00:57.890> go<00:01:01.360> the<00:01:02.360> bucket

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
buttoned up and there we go the bucket

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:03.630 
buttoned up and there we go the bucket
works

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
works

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.419 
works
we've<00:01:04.640> got<00:01:04.789> track<00:01:05.210> function<00:01:09.429> forward

00:01:10.419 --> 00:01:10.429 
we've got track function forward

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:17.499 
we've got track function forward
backwards<00:01:11.350> and<00:01:12.350> also<00:01:13.539> left<00:01:14.539> and<00:01:14.810> right<00:01:16.509> and

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
backwards and also left and right and

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.719 
backwards and also left and right and
kind<00:01:17.659> of<00:01:17.750> a<00:01:17.869> new<00:01:18.050> function<00:01:18.590> that<00:01:18.619> we<00:01:18.860> built

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
kind of a new function that we built

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:26.260 
kind of a new function that we built
into<00:01:19.970> this<00:01:23.110> whole<00:01:24.110> 360<00:01:24.729> obviously<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:25.850> speeds

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
into this whole 360 obviously the speeds

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.990 
into this whole 360 obviously the speeds
have<00:01:26.960> to<00:01:27.110> be<00:01:27.229> adjusted<00:01:27.490> but<00:01:28.490> this<00:01:28.700> thing<00:01:28.880> will

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
have to be adjusted but this thing will

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.910 
have to be adjusted but this thing will
go<00:01:29.149> around<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:29.659> round<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:30.050> round<00:01:30.229> until<00:01:30.380> the

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
go around and round and round until the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.109 
go around and round and round until the
battery<00:01:31.310> dies<00:01:36.310> again<00:01:37.310> we'll<00:01:37.549> get<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.759> speeds

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
battery dies again we'll get the speeds

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:44.350 
battery dies again we'll get the speeds
down<00:01:38.530> to<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:39.679> right<00:01:40.569> motion<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:43.030> we're<00:01:44.030> just

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
down to the right motion and we're just

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.749 
down to the right motion and we're just
perfecting<00:01:45.229> this<00:01:45.410> bucket<00:01:45.920> trip<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:49.640> it

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
perfecting this bucket trip and it

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.650 
perfecting this bucket trip and it
latches<00:01:49.970> back<00:01:50.330> up<00:01:50.979> so<00:01:51.979> there<00:01:52.160> you<00:01:52.280> go<00:01:52.539> it's<00:01:53.539> all

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
latches back up so there you go it's all

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.229 
latches back up so there you go it's all
set<00:01:54.020> we're<00:01:54.440> gonna<00:01:54.530> deliver<00:01:54.920> it<00:01:55.239> actually
