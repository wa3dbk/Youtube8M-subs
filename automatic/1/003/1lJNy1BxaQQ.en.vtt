a<00:02:12.860> few<00:02:12.980> last<00:02:13.370> year<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:14.120> what<00:02:14.720> you<00:02:14.840> need<00:02:14.989> to<00:02:15.140> do

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
is some of them they're about that sort

to<00:02:31.370> an<00:02:31.520> hour<00:02:31.640> depending<00:02:31.850> on<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:32.390> temperature

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
to an hour depending on the temperature

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.690 
to an hour depending on the temperature
and<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:32.930> sides<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:34.070> know<00:02:34.220> when<00:02:34.370> they're<00:02:34.520> done

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
and the sides you know when they're done

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.640 
and the sides you know when they're done
because<00:02:34.850> you<00:02:35.000> can<00:02:35.150> put<00:02:35.270> a<00:02:35.300> knife<00:02:35.650> straight

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
because you can put a knife straight

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.890 
because you can put a knife straight
through<00:02:36.890> them<00:02:37.100> and<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.580> feels<00:02:37.820> soft<00:02:38.150> inside<00:02:38.570> so

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
through them and it feels soft inside so

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.950 
through them and it feels soft inside so
cook<00:02:39.170> them<00:02:39.380> in<00:02:39.650> their<00:02:39.980> skin<00:02:40.340> just<00:02:40.640> be<00:02:41.570> careful

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
cook them in their skin just be careful

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.210 
cook them in their skin just be careful
when<00:02:42.050> you<00:02:42.170> open<00:02:42.200> them<00:02:42.770> because<00:02:43.040> obviously

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
when you open them because obviously

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.570 
when you open them because obviously
it's<00:02:43.520> very<00:02:43.730> steamy<00:02:44.030> inside<00:02:44.570> and<00:02:44.930> but<00:02:45.650> yes<00:02:46.370> then

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
it's very steamy inside and but yes then

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.790 
it's very steamy inside and but yes then
you<00:02:46.730> scrape<00:02:47.120> all<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.690> all<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.290> flesh<00:02:48.530> out
