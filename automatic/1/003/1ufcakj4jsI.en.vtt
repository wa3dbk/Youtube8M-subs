00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
but before that I stayed a lot of

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.460 
but before that I stayed a lot of
different<00:00:26.700> martial<00:00:27.090> arts<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:28.110> felt<00:00:28.380> that

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
different martial arts and I felt that

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.170

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
studying the martial arts really gave me

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.910 
studying the martial arts really gave me
the<00:00:30.270> focus<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:30.870> needed<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.350> get<00:00:31.470> through

help me get through that I tend to keep

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.750 
help me get through that I tend to keep
all<00:00:51.900> the<00:00:52.020> Japanese<00:00:52.379> culture<00:00:52.770> Japanese<00:00:53.460> names

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
all the Japanese culture Japanese names

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.090 
all the Japanese culture Japanese names
in<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.330> training<00:00:54.739> sometimes<00:00:55.739> when<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:55.949> go<00:00:56.040> to

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
in the training sometimes when you go to

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.100 
in the training sometimes when you go to
different<00:00:56.280> schools<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:57.030> America<00:00:57.690> for<00:00:58.020> example

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
different schools in America for example

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.290 
different schools in America for example
they<00:00:59.010> may<00:00:59.130> not<00:00:59.250> have<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.640> traditions<00:01:00.120> they

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
they may not have the traditions they

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.620 
they may not have the traditions they
may<00:01:00.480> not<00:01:00.680> build<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.950> Japanese<00:01:02.790> facility<00:01:03.390> to

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
may not build a Japanese facility to

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.810 
may not build a Japanese facility to
training<00:01:04.140> they<00:01:04.559> may<00:01:04.710> not<00:01:04.860> use<00:01:05.040> Japanese<00:01:05.520> names

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
training they may not use Japanese names

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.020 
training they may not use Japanese names
so<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.240> feel<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.600> if<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.259> take<00:01:07.500> out<00:01:07.649> the

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
so I feel that if you take out the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.249 
so I feel that if you take out the
cultural<00:01:09.030> aspects<00:01:09.570> from<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.960> training

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
cultural aspects from the training

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.230 
cultural aspects from the training
you're<00:01:10.920> actually<00:01:11.040> losing<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.580> lot<00:01:11.759> of<00:01:11.820> what's

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
you're actually losing a lot of what's

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.080 
you're actually losing a lot of what's
trying<00:01:12.509> to<00:01:12.690> be<00:01:12.750> taught<00:01:13.130> by<00:01:14.130> Misaki<00:01:14.580> onto<00:01:14.970> me

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
trying to be taught by Misaki onto me

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.200 
trying to be taught by Misaki onto me
and<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:16.080> think<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.100> many<00:01:17.310> people<00:01:17.399> tend<00:01:18.119> to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
and I think that many people tend to

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.969 
and I think that many people tend to
think<00:01:18.330> more<00:01:18.869> on<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.320> kicking<00:01:19.649> and<00:01:19.680> punching

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
think more on the kicking and punching

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.280 
think more on the kicking and punching
aspects<00:01:20.550> and<00:01:20.790> tend<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.149> leave<00:01:21.360> the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
aspects and tend to leave the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.350 
aspects and tend to leave the
philosophical<00:01:23.009> aspects<00:01:23.490> or<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> cultural

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
philosophical aspects or the cultural

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.190 
philosophical aspects or the cultural
aspects<00:01:24.810> out<00:01:25.310> from<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.119> for<00:01:27.330> instance<00:01:27.420> you

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
aspects out from it so for instance you

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.660 
aspects out from it so for instance you
know<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.560> use<00:01:28.679> of<00:01:28.709> weapons<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.429> very

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
know the use of weapons is very

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.210 
know the use of weapons is very
important<00:01:30.179> to<00:01:30.360> preserve<00:01:30.780> culture<00:01:31.500> right<00:01:31.950> so

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
important to preserve culture right so

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.550 
important to preserve culture right so
every<00:01:32.910> martial<00:01:33.300> art<00:01:33.450> has<00:01:33.660> their<00:01:33.869> own<00:01:33.899> culture

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
every martial art has their own culture

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.499 
every martial art has their own culture
and<00:01:34.709> every<00:01:35.369> martial<00:01:35.759> art<00:01:35.880> has<00:01:36.030> different

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
and every martial art has different

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.300 
and every martial art has different
weapons<00:01:36.899> that<00:01:37.200> preserves<00:01:37.649> that<00:01:37.800> specific

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
weapons that preserves that specific

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.520 
weapons that preserves that specific
culture<00:01:38.700> depending<00:01:39.149> on<00:01:39.270> where<00:01:39.959> it<00:01:40.050> is<00:01:40.170> that

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
culture depending on where it is that

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.770 
culture depending on where it is that
the<00:01:40.920> region<00:01:41.250> or<00:01:41.369> location<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.600> more

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
the region or location but that more

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.679 
the region or location but that more
short<00:01:43.020> developed

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.569 

lot<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.719> the<00:01:48.869> martial<00:01:49.170> arts<00:01:49.229> today<00:01:49.590> only<00:01:50.189> deal

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
lot of the martial arts today only deal

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.609 
lot of the martial arts today only deal
with<00:01:50.850> empty<00:01:51.270> handed<00:01:51.570> techniques<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.380> think

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
with empty handed techniques I think

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.080 
with empty handed techniques I think
there's<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.860> big<00:01:53.009> limit<00:01:53.369> there<00:01:53.549> especially

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
there's a big limit there especially

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.270 
there's a big limit there especially
because<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.780> street<00:01:55.110> most<00:01:55.380> people<00:01:55.770> use

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
because in the street most people use

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.359 
because in the street most people use
weapons<00:01:56.670> human<00:01:57.509> beings<00:01:57.869> we<00:01:58.350> use<00:01:58.590> weapons<00:01:58.920> and

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
weapons human beings we use weapons and

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.440 
weapons human beings we use weapons and
if<00:01:59.460> we're<00:01:59.579> not<00:01:59.610> using<00:01:59.820> weapons<00:02:00.030> were<00:02:00.240> using

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
if we're not using weapons were using

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.270 
if we're not using weapons were using
tools<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.470> that<00:02:01.500> makes<00:02:01.679> us<00:02:01.799> different<00:02:01.979> from

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
tools so that makes us different from

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.980 
tools so that makes us different from
animals<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.970> that<00:02:03.000> way<00:02:03.299> we<00:02:03.600> tend<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.929> use

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
animals in that way we tend to use

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.400 
animals in that way we tend to use
things<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:04.979> our<00:02:05.069> hand<00:02:08.989> so<00:02:09.989> there<00:02:10.110> are<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.229> lot<00:02:10.380> of

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
things in our hand so there are a lot of

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.620 
things in our hand so there are a lot of
self-improvement<00:02:11.370> aspects<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.269> martial

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
self-improvement aspects to the martial

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.059 
self-improvement aspects to the martial
arts<00:02:12.720> especially<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.470> martial<00:02:13.799> art<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:13.950> I

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
arts especially the martial art that I

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.449 
arts especially the martial art that I
studied<00:02:14.549> you<00:02:15.000> didn't<00:02:15.269> feel<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:17.340> know

I try to push them to their limits the
other<00:03:01.680> thing<00:03:01.889> too<00:03:02.069> is<00:03:02.100> in<00:03:02.400> my<00:03:02.549> system<00:03:02.940> the

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
other thing too is in my system the

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.690 
other thing too is in my system the
system<00:03:03.510> that<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:03.810> studied<00:03:04.319> you<00:03:04.920> learn<00:03:05.370> all

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
system that I studied you learn all

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.449 
system that I studied you learn all
aspects<00:03:06.420> of<00:03:06.600> training<00:03:07.350> all<00:03:07.470> aspects<00:03:08.459> of

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
aspects of training all aspects of

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.490 
aspects of training all aspects of
fighting<00:03:09.090> there<00:03:09.540> isn't<00:03:09.780> anything<00:03:09.959> that<00:03:10.109> we<00:03:10.319> do

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
fighting there isn't anything that we do

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.949 
fighting there isn't anything that we do
not<00:03:10.650> cover<00:03:11.069> so<00:03:11.370> we're<00:03:11.489> not<00:03:11.639> like<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:11.970> single

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
not cover so we're not like a single

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.849 
not cover so we're not like a single
specific<00:03:13.170> or<00:03:13.859> you<00:03:14.400> know<00:03:14.519> that<00:03:14.730> tight<00:03:15.000> closed

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859

specific or you know that tight closed
circuit<00:03:16.859> type<00:03:17.459> training<00:03:17.790> we<00:03:18.090> actually

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
circuit type training we actually

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.479 
circuit type training we actually
trained<00:03:18.959> on<00:03:19.230> all<00:03:19.709> types<00:03:20.250> of<00:03:20.370> different

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
trained on all types of different

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.849 
trained on all types of different
situations<00:03:21.209> so<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.720> idea<00:03:21.840> of<00:03:22.260> studying

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
situations so the idea of studying

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.699 
situations so the idea of studying
martial<00:03:23.489> arts<00:03:24.000> or<00:03:24.420> learning<00:03:24.660> self-defense<00:03:25.170> is
