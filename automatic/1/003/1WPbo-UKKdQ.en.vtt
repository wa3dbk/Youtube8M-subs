00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.630 
I made a cane of the flower here's a
glow<00:00:30.329> scene<00:00:30.739> but<00:00:31.739> to<00:00:32.099> be<00:00:32.220> honest<00:00:32.489> this

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
glow scene but to be honest this

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.190 
glow scene but to be honest this
flashlights<00:00:33.180> way<00:00:33.390> too<00:00:33.450> small

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
flashlights way too small

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.770 
flashlights way too small
I'll<00:00:35.070> try<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.309> figure<00:00:35.579> out<00:00:35.699> how<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.879> maybe<00:00:36.629> I'll

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
I'll try to figure out how to maybe I'll

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.240 
I'll try to figure out how to maybe I'll
get<00:00:36.929> another<00:00:37.019> flashlight<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.949> bigger

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
get another flashlight a bigger

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.680

flashlight<00:00:38.730> for<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.059> part<00:00:39.359> of<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.480> next

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
flashlight for this part of the next

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.450 
flashlight for this part of the next
video<00:00:40.250> this<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.489> part<00:00:41.850> 1<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.089> part<00:00:42.390> 2<00:00:43.460> because

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
video this is part 1 of part 2 because

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.029 
video this is part 1 of part 2 because
as<00:00:44.809> you've<00:00:45.809> seen<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.170> opening<00:00:46.559> video<00:00:46.800> it's

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
as you've seen in the opening video it's

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.369 
as you've seen in the opening video it's
not<00:00:47.129> finished<00:00:47.519> at<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.030> bottom<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.510> ran<00:00:49.109> out<00:00:49.289> of

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
not finished at the bottom I ran out of

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.310 
not finished at the bottom I ran out of
cane<00:00:49.969> but<00:00:50.969> anyhow<00:00:51.269> to<00:00:51.329> get<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:51.690> started<00:00:51.929> I

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
cane but anyhow to get this started I

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.290 
cane but anyhow to get this started I
basically<00:00:53.100> just<00:00:53.219> cut<00:00:53.550> some<00:00:53.760> sheets<00:00:54.059> of

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
basically just cut some sheets of

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.779 
basically just cut some sheets of
sculpey<00:00:55.019> original<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.620> think<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.429> was<00:00:56.579> on

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
sculpey original I think it was on

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.849 
sculpey original I think it was on
setting<00:00:57.449> 4<00:00:58.519> on<00:00:59.519> the<00:00:59.670> pasta<00:00:59.969> machine<00:01:00.649> which<00:01:01.649> is

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
setting 4 on the pasta machine which is

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.290 
setting 4 on the pasta machine which is
for<00:01:02.219> from<00:01:02.429> the<00:01:02.550> UM<00:01:03.019> smallest<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.940> know<00:01:05.940> some

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
for from the UM smallest I know some

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.539 
for from the UM smallest I know some
machines<00:01:06.630> are<00:01:06.780> different<00:01:07.140> than<00:01:07.259> others<00:01:07.549> but

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
machines are different than others but

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.210 
machines are different than others but
it's<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.570> it's<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.110> good<00:01:10.290> idea<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.799> get<00:01:10.920> them<00:01:11.009> all

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
it's a it's a good idea to get them all

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.100 
it's a it's a good idea to get them all
cut<00:01:11.490> first<00:01:11.850> before<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.540> start<00:01:12.570> putting<00:01:12.930> money

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
cut first before you start putting money

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.609 
cut first before you start putting money
on<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.500> vase<00:01:13.850> but<00:01:14.850> what<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.060> did<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.869> lined

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
on the vase but what I did is I I lined

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.050 
on the vase but what I did is I I lined
them<00:01:16.740> up<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.070> where<00:01:17.220> they're<00:01:17.310> touching<00:01:17.759> at<00:01:17.909> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
them up to where they're touching at the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.149 
them up to where they're touching at the
thickest<00:01:18.450> part<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.810> base<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.380> then

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
thickest part of the base and then

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.580 
thickest part of the base and then
pushed<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.210> evenly<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.960> know<00:01:22.079> vertically

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
pushed it to evenly you know vertically

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.630 
pushed it to evenly you know vertically
and<00:01:24.560> what<00:01:25.560> you'll<00:01:25.740> leave<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.310> cut

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
and what you'll leave you I like a cut

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.980 
and what you'll leave you I like a cut
you<00:01:26.820> have<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.090> make<00:01:27.240> at<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.509> top<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.899> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
you have to make at the top in the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.410 
you have to make at the top in the
bottom<00:01:28.520> and<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.610> course<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.969> last<00:01:30.149> piece<00:01:30.390> that

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
bottom and of course the last piece that

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.240 
bottom and of course the last piece that
goes<00:01:30.719> on<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.140> have<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.439> cut<00:01:31.619> all<00:01:31.740> around<00:01:32.070> it

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
goes on you have to cut all around it

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.830 
goes on you have to cut all around it
anyway<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:32.610> it's<00:01:33.270> no<00:01:33.450> big<00:01:33.479> deal

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
anyway so it's no big deal

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.590 
anyway so it's no big deal
but<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.710> thought<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:34.950> was<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.219> most

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
but I thought that was the most

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.679 
but I thought that was the most
efficient<00:01:36.600> way<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.810> get<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:38.270> clay<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.450> there

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
efficient way to get the clay on there

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.719 
efficient way to get the clay on there
it's<00:01:40.320> pretty<00:01:40.439> easy<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.890> do<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:43.579> for<00:01:44.579> cutting

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
it's pretty easy to do it for cutting

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.349 
it's pretty easy to do it for cutting
these<00:01:44.969> cane<00:01:45.270> slices<00:01:46.430> one<00:01:47.430> thing<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.759> noticed<00:01:48.180> is

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359 
these cane slices one thing I noticed is

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:51.620 
these cane slices one thing I noticed is
if<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.780> press<00:01:49.469> straight<00:01:49.920> down<00:01:49.979> on<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.390> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
if you press straight down on the on the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.420 
if you press straight down on the on the
cane<00:01:51.899> what's<00:01:52.320> your<00:01:52.469> tissue<00:01:52.710> slicer

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
cane what's your tissue slicer

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.340 
cane what's your tissue slicer
you're<00:01:54.000> gonna<00:01:54.210> squish<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.990> you're<00:01:55.229> gonna

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
you're gonna squish that you're gonna

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.880 
you're gonna squish that you're gonna
squish<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.609> it's<00:01:56.759> gonna<00:01:56.880> distort<00:01:57.329> it

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
squish it and it's gonna distort it

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.749 
squish it and it's gonna distort it
especially<00:01:58.890> if<00:01:58.979> you're<00:01:59.070> making<00:01:59.189> multiple

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
especially if you're making multiple

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:00.440 
especially if you're making multiple
cuts<00:01:59.969> on<00:02:00.179> it

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
cuts on it

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.440 
cuts on it
I<00:02:00.479> found<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.439> if<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.649> are<00:02:02.240> dragged<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
I found that if you are dragged the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.749 
I found that if you are dragged the
blade<00:02:03.659> as<00:02:03.840> you're<00:02:04.049> cutting<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:05.009> makes<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.609> a

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
blade as you're cutting it makes it a

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.749 
blade as you're cutting it makes it a
lot<00:02:06.119> better<00:02:06.590> there's<00:02:07.590> less<00:02:07.890> distortion<00:02:08.580> and

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
lot better there's less distortion and

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.610 
lot better there's less distortion and
it<00:02:09.330> keeps<00:02:09.840> your<00:02:10.310> came<00:02:11.310> from<00:02:11.520> squishing

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
it keeps your came from squishing

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.640 
it keeps your came from squishing
I<00:02:12.709> just<00:02:13.670> did<00:02:13.879> one<00:02:14.090> run<00:02:14.269> at<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.540> time<00:02:14.569> but<00:02:15.379> I<00:02:15.440> found

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
I just did one run at a time but I found

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.809 
I just did one run at a time but I found
it<00:02:16.659> once<00:02:17.659> you<00:02:17.780> get<00:02:17.930> to<00:02:18.049> the<00:02:18.140> end<00:02:18.319> of<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.500> row

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
it once you get to the end of the row

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.979 
it once you get to the end of the row
you<00:02:19.819> might<00:02:19.970> have<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:20.090> gap<00:02:20.330> that's<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.599> little<00:02:20.750> too

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
you might have a gap that's a little too

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.220 
you might have a gap that's a little too
small<00:02:21.319> for<00:02:21.379> a<00:02:21.620> cane<00:02:21.860> so<00:02:22.760> what<00:02:23.330> I<00:02:23.540> did<00:02:23.599> is<00:02:24.049> I<00:02:24.200> just

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
small for a cane so what I did is I just

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.820 
small for a cane so what I did is I just
basically<00:02:25.159> took<00:02:25.489> off<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:25.730> few<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.680> space<00:02:27.680> them

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
basically took off a few and space them

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.080 
basically took off a few and space them
out<00:02:28.010> a<00:02:28.069> little<00:02:28.250> bit<00:02:28.519> to<00:02:29.510> make<00:02:29.840> up<00:02:30.019> for<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:31.090> you

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
out a little bit to make up for that you

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.069 
out a little bit to make up for that you
know<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:32.420> little<00:02:32.569> gap<00:02:33.909> but<00:02:34.909> being<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.810> shape

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
know that little gap but being the shape

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:41.259 
know that little gap but being the shape
of<00:02:36.319> this<00:02:36.560> vase<00:02:36.860> is<00:02:37.159> awkward<00:02:38.260> I<00:02:40.120> recommend<00:02:41.120> that

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
of this vase is awkward I recommend that

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.300 
of this vase is awkward I recommend that
you<00:02:41.329> cut<00:02:41.599> your<00:02:41.780> slices<00:02:42.170> a<00:02:42.560> little<00:02:43.010> thicker

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
you cut your slices a little thicker

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.099 
you cut your slices a little thicker
than<00:02:43.610> what<00:02:43.940> I<00:02:43.970> did<00:02:44.269> I<00:02:44.299> was<00:02:44.540> trying<00:02:44.780> to<00:02:44.810> make<00:02:44.959> it

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
than what I did I was trying to make it

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.520 
than what I did I was trying to make it
go<00:02:45.260> a<00:02:45.290> long<00:02:45.620> ways<00:02:45.829> and<00:02:46.220> it<00:02:47.000> didn't<00:02:47.269> work<00:02:47.420> so<00:02:47.530> but

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
go a long ways and it didn't work so but

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.610 
go a long ways and it didn't work so but
what<00:02:48.680> happened<00:02:49.010> is<00:02:49.129> is<00:02:49.340> I<00:02:49.810> used<00:02:50.810> my<00:02:50.989> polymer

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
what happened is is I used my polymer

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.460 
what happened is is I used my polymer
clay<00:02:51.650> roller<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:52.640> you<00:02:53.540> know<00:02:53.629> press<00:02:53.930> them<00:02:54.200> down

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
clay roller to you know press them down

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.119 
clay roller to you know press them down
you<00:02:55.280> know<00:02:55.400> and<00:02:55.549> make<00:02:55.790> them<00:02:55.940> squish<00:02:56.239> together<00:02:57.129> I

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
you know and make them squish together I

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.930 
you know and make them squish together I
wound<00:02:58.760> up<00:02:58.909> getting<00:02:59.150> these<00:02:59.420> little<00:02:59.750> white

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
wound up getting these little white

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.860 
wound up getting these little white
patches<00:03:01.940> in<00:03:02.480> between<00:03:02.959> we're<00:03:03.170> all<00:03:04.480> not<00:03:05.480> many<00:03:05.629> of

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
patches in between we're all not many of

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.500 
patches in between we're all not many of
them<00:03:05.989> just<00:03:06.230> just<00:03:06.620> just<00:03:07.220> a<00:03:07.340> few<00:03:07.549> but<00:03:07.819> where<00:03:08.390> the

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
them just just just a few but where the

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.449 
them just just just a few but where the
slices<00:03:09.290> come<00:03:09.500> together<00:03:09.650> they'd<00:03:10.099> be<00:03:10.250> like

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
slices come together they'd be like

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.440 
slices come together they'd be like
white<00:03:11.030> mosaic<00:03:11.329> looking<00:03:12.079> patches<00:03:13.000> so<00:03:14.000> if<00:03:14.269> it

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
white mosaic looking patches so if it

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.650 
white mosaic looking patches so if it
was<00:03:14.599> a<00:03:14.629> little<00:03:14.840> bit<00:03:14.989> thicker<00:03:16.359> they<00:03:17.359> would<00:03:17.540> have

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
was a little bit thicker they would have

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.610 
was a little bit thicker they would have
reached<00:03:17.870> all<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.230> way<00:03:18.410> together<00:03:20.349> this<00:03:21.349> was<00:03:21.590> a

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
reached all the way together this was a

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.830 
reached all the way together this was a
learning<00:03:21.829> experience<00:03:22.060> now<00:03:23.060> I<00:03:23.090> know<00:03:23.269> that<00:03:23.720> you

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
learning experience now I know that you

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.210

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
way when you cut it you cut all your

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.300 
way when you cut it you cut all your
slices<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:33.650> everything<00:03:33.919> you<00:03:34.040> know<00:03:34.160> you're

gonna<00:03:34.400> have<00:03:34.609> the<00:03:34.730> whole<00:03:34.760> project<00:03:35.329> but<00:03:35.840> I'm

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
gonna have the whole project but I'm

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.009 
gonna have the whole project but I'm
actually<00:03:36.079> glad<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.919> I<00:03:36.950> ran<00:03:37.190> out<00:03:37.870> because<00:03:38.870> I

it's so far this is turning out to be
really<00:04:19.820> really<00:04:20.030> nice<00:04:20.329> it<00:04:21.260> glows<00:04:21.530> in<00:04:21.560> the<00:04:21.650> dark
