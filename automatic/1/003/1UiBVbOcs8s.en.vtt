00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.070
 it becomes urgent for the man to live 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.000
 in a rational and sustainable way on 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.870
 earth survival question 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.390
 the last hundred years of occupation 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.720
 human have made havoc pollution 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.490
 overall depletion of resources 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.609
 global warming decrease 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.920
 massive amount of biodiversity no longer 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.570
 exploit the land but are inspired 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.480
 to innovate in a sustainable way 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.120
 this must be our new challenge it's 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.680
 the close to biomimicry a science in 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.000
 booming under the impetus of the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.829
 american scientist janine benyus the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.840
 life on earth exists since 3 8 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.210
 billion years the man him he is not 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.800
 appeared that two hundred thousand years ago the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.809
 sustainability experts are all around 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.350
 from us they are the best models 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.579
 for our revolution 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.770
 thanks to extremely high technologies 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.500
 sophisticated life has learned to fly 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.870
 swim make resistant materials 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.479
 and non- polluting capture the energy of the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.850
 sun see at night create some 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.640
 smart ecosystems and all that without 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.750
 generate waste there are three 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.570
 levels of biomimicry 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.640
 we can draw inspiration from the forms of 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.369
 manufacturing process or 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.990
 ecosystems here are some examples 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.990
 revolutionary application 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.549
 the fins placed at the end of the 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.119
 airplane wings is inspired by the eagle 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.670
 Steppes 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.560
 it improves the efficiency of the flight while 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.650
 by reducing consumption and 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.650
 emissions 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.759
 lisbeth building is inspired by the 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.350
 air conditioning termite mounds 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.759
 clever technique that helps 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.780
 dramatically decrease the 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.460
 energy consumption to produce 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.020
 electricity or non-combustible 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.590
 pollutants are inspired by the 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.509
 photosynthesis of plants to limit 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.490
 greenhouse gas emissions on 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.679
 is inspired by coral or molluscs 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.190
 who use co2 as a material 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.390
 construction to reduce the impact of 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.729
 industry on the environment 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.519
 we are inspired by ecosystems is anchored 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.110
 industrial ecology the waste of 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:15.880
 some become the raw material of 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.530
 neighbor long exploited nature 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.090
 becomes a source of inspiration 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.090
 a living encyclopedia 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.180
 every day new applications 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.250
 see the day patents become 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.540
 increase the number of research teams 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.820
 meet and start working 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.650
 together suggesting a deposit 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.850
 of innovation that will be equally 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.850
 solutions to our contemporary challenges 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.230
 with biomimicry the adventurous does not 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.230
 that start
