I<00:03:10.060> think<00:03:10.090> every<00:03:10.510> little<00:03:10.750> white<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:11.290> know

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
I think every little white you know

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.160 
I think every little white you know
let's<00:03:11.530> see<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.769> white<00:03:11.950> little<00:03:12.190> um<00:03:12.959> indents<00:03:13.959> on

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
let's see the white little um indents on

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.289 
let's see the white little um indents on
the<00:03:14.260> bar<00:03:14.470> every<00:03:15.010> time<00:03:15.250> it<00:03:15.640> goes<00:03:15.819> past<00:03:15.970> one<00:03:16.269> of

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
the bar every time it goes past one of

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.059 
the bar every time it goes past one of
those<00:03:16.420> points<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:17.049> circle<00:03:17.409> gets<00:03:17.530> smaller<00:03:17.650> so

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
those points the circle gets smaller so

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:25.680 
those points the circle gets smaller so
he<00:03:18.400> has<00:03:18.519> a<00:03:18.579> smaller<00:03:18.939> radius<00:03:19.900> -<00:03:20.379> Serge<00:03:24.629> where<00:03:25.629> do

he has a smaller radius - Serge where do

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:26.009 
he has a smaller radius - Serge where do
you<00:03:25.750> go
