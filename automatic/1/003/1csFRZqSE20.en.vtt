use my body that pressed into him
that's<00:05:47.490> jamming<00:05:48.060> that's<00:05:48.210> a<00:05:48.330> trap<00:05:48.599> because<00:05:49.289> if

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
that's jamming that's a trap because if

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.950 
that's jamming that's a trap because if
you<00:05:49.800> go<00:05:49.979> back<00:05:50.009> to<00:05:50.460> the<00:05:50.610> idea<00:05:50.729> when<00:05:51.029> Clint<00:05:51.750> and<00:05:51.840> I

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960

you go back to the idea when Clint and I
did<00:05:52.139> the<00:05:52.229> trap<00:05:52.440> of<00:05:52.650> crab<00:05:52.800> video<00:05:53.099> if<00:05:53.639> Tony

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880

punches<00:05:54.360> and<00:05:54.630> then<00:05:54.930> I<00:05:55.229> got<00:05:55.469> a<00:05:55.500> pin<00:05:55.770> this<00:05:55.919> it

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
punches and then I got a pin this it

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:58.459 
punches and then I got a pin this it
didn't<00:05:56.969> affect<00:05:57.180> this<00:05:57.270> core<00:05:57.539> but<00:05:58.169> you<00:05:58.349> know<00:05:58.440> I

00:05:58.459 --> 00:05:58.469

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:00.980 
didn't affect this core but you know I
made<00:05:58.710> contact<00:05:58.949> I<00:05:59.430> have<00:06:00.240> to<00:06:00.330> affect<00:06:00.630> this<00:06:00.719> core

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
made contact I have to affect this core

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.260 
made contact I have to affect this core
and<00:06:01.469> that<00:06:01.620> all<00:06:01.830> comes<00:06:02.069> from<00:06:02.279> keeping<00:06:02.699> my<00:06:02.819> elbow

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
and that all comes from keeping my elbow

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.899 
and that all comes from keeping my elbow
now<00:06:03.690> moving<00:06:03.990> and<00:06:04.800> putting<00:06:05.069> this<00:06:05.130> energy<00:06:05.490> into

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:05.909 
now moving and putting this energy into

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:09.290 
now moving and putting this energy into
it<00:06:06.090> okay<00:06:06.539> so<00:06:07.080> gums<00:06:07.409> out<00:06:07.680> I<00:06:07.800> do<00:06:07.860> use<00:06:08.340> and<00:06:09.210> it's

want

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:16.700 
want
down<00:06:14.159> in<00:06:14.909> remember<00:06:15.630> it's<00:06:15.750> just<00:06:15.810> a<00:06:15.990> tool<00:06:16.229> but

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
down in remember it's just a tool but

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.749 
down in remember it's just a tool but
you're<00:06:16.860> learning<00:06:17.130> to<00:06:17.190> use<00:06:17.250> anywhere<00:06:17.520> you<00:06:17.610> want

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759 
you're learning to use anywhere you want

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:20.029 
you're learning to use anywhere you want
so<00:06:17.819> you<00:06:18.180> pin<00:06:18.630> into<00:06:18.840> them<00:06:18.960> down<00:06:19.469> in<00:06:19.650> them<00:06:19.740> it's

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 
so you pin into them down in them it's

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:21.769 
so you pin into them down in them it's
all<00:06:20.250> using<00:06:20.669> that<00:06:20.759> body<00:06:20.940> you<00:06:21.210> go<00:06:21.300> in

00:06:21.769 --> 00:06:21.779 
all using that body you go in

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:23.029 
all using that body you go in
that's<00:06:22.050> dumb<00:06:22.259> cells<00:06:22.500> asserted<00:06:22.860> in<00:06:22.949> their

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 
that's dumb cells asserted in their

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:25.790 
that's dumb cells asserted in their

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
balance those are the last two are gonna

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.769 
balance those are the last two are gonna
cover<00:06:26.069> on<00:06:26.250> those<00:06:26.430> a<00:06:26.460> real<00:06:26.849> brief<00:06:27.150> short<00:06:27.449> video

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:27.779 
cover on those a real brief short video

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.809 
young Sal and then gum sau and they all
have<00:06:31.229> to<00:06:31.319> have<00:06:31.440> forwarding<00:06:31.889> energy<00:06:32.219> so<00:06:32.639> your

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:32.819 
have to have forwarding energy so your

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:34.760 
have to have forwarding energy so your
body<00:06:33.029> has<00:06:33.150> to<00:06:33.389> come<00:06:33.509> behind<00:06:33.750> it<00:06:33.990> so<00:06:34.440> once<00:06:34.620> again

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
body has to come behind it so once again

movements particularly where they are
they<00:06:55.110> are<00:06:55.260> applicable<00:06:55.500> that<00:06:55.860> she's<00:06:56.070> cell

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.250 
they are applicable that she's cell

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.460 
they are applicable that she's cell
number<00:06:56.490> one<00:06:56.690> fighting<00:06:57.690> to<00:06:57.810> it<00:06:57.930> agreeing<00:06:58.260> if

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 
what they do teach you is that your body

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.320 
what they do teach you is that your body
always<00:07:01.950> has<00:07:02.490> to<00:07:02.640> move<00:07:02.820> forward<00:07:03.120> no<00:07:03.210> matter

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330 
always has to move forward no matter

always has to move forward no matter
what<00:07:03.600> you<00:07:03.720> do<00:07:03.870> so<00:07:04.350> I<00:07:04.380> think<00:07:04.500> Yun<00:07:04.950> cell<00:07:05.220> and<00:07:05.520> gum

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:05.700 
what you do so I think Yun cell and gum

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:06.680 
what you do so I think Yun cell and gum
cell<00:07:05.940> these<00:07:06.120> are<00:07:06.180> two<00:07:06.390> of<00:07:06.420> the<00:07:06.540> best

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:06.690 
cell these are two of the best

so<00:07:39.120> am<00:07:39.450> I<00:07:39.600> in<00:07:39.750> my<00:07:39.900> opinion<00:07:39.930> here<00:07:40.500> you're

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:40.770 
so am I in my opinion here you're

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.170 
so am I in my opinion here you're
pressing<00:07:41.130> down<00:07:41.310> and<00:07:41.580> in<00:07:41.700> you're<00:07:42.030> already

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.180 
pressing down and in you're already

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.390 
pressing down and in you're already
going<00:07:42.360> down<00:07:42.600> then<00:07:42.810> down<00:07:43.140> and<00:07:43.320> in<00:07:43.410> up<00:07:43.710> and<00:07:44.010> in<00:07:44.100> so

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 
going down then down and in up and in so

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.620 
going down then down and in up and in so
it's<00:07:44.490> gonna<00:07:44.580> be<00:07:44.670> two<00:07:44.790> different<00:07:44.910> motions<00:07:45.360> that

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:45.630 
it's gonna be two different motions that

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.990 
it's gonna be two different motions that
are<00:07:45.780> applied<00:07:45.960> by<00:07:46.170> sinking<00:07:47.010> and<00:07:47.160> going<00:07:47.340> down<00:07:47.520> or

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 
are applied by sinking and going down or

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.900 
are applied by sinking and going down or
rising<00:07:48.900> and<00:07:49.020> going<00:07:49.050> up<00:07:49.380> and<00:07:49.470> in<00:07:49.760> they<00:07:50.760> can

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:50.910 
rising and going up and in they can

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:52.280 
rising and going up and in they can
argue<00:07:51.150> to<00:07:51.180> be<00:07:51.330> the<00:07:51.480> same<00:07:51.690> but<00:07:52.020> in<00:07:52.110> my<00:07:52.200> opinion

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:52.290 
argue to be the same but in my opinion

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.290 
argue to be the same but in my opinion
no<00:07:53.040> we're<00:07:53.520> gonna<00:07:53.610> separate<00:07:53.910> them<00:07:54.030> just<00:07:54.090> for

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:54.300 
no we're gonna separate them just for

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.150 
no we're gonna separate them just for
say<00:07:54.420> get<00:07:54.660> them<00:07:54.750> down<00:07:54.870> okay<00:07:55.320> questions<00:07:55.950> no

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160 
say get them down okay questions no

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.600 
say get them down okay questions no
