00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 well these assassin invitations here at 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.060
 chibi i'm accompanied by my friend kane 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.160
 hi franck hi julien how are you 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.960
 then give an ad to you 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.280
 to do enough importance because there is the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.929
 next assassin's creed that was 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.910
 announced to be wary of 4 so that's it 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.550
 been formalized a few hours ago 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.109
 here you are all happy after good 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.730
 power apparently these are not the 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.600
 even though our team that is in the process of 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.460
 do it it's not the ones who have 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.180
 do this are written 3 expects new 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.500
 team new hero new era and 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.970
 maybe new fall 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.820
 we're not going to say we're going for a new 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.860
 because school is so good there is 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.760
 not much to his services that the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.680
 dance has just been done a few 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.730
 hours only everything we know 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.360
 it will be released during the year 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.489
 tax 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.350
 good I do not know if it's the year to 2013 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.590
 2014 how can we call it like that 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.870
 in fact it's between March 2013 and not in 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.920
 April 2013 and April 1, 2013 until 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.270
 March 2014 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.000
 so basically it could end 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.820
 of year as usual actually yes 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.260
 this is finally the end of the year 2013 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.399
 will be released at the end of 2013 surely 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.770
 early 2014 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.640
 it is besides general announced zola 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.920
 that big budget games kinds of which he 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.479
 will have to see after if it was done like 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.520
 assassin's creed iii with finally in 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.799
 several years or in a year like 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.420
 revelation as we will see but I 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.000
 think anyway for that there is everything that 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.939
 change is not that already started there is 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.009
 a few times anyway generosity that 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.840
 that's for sure yes finally we'll give you 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.520
 information fight when that will come 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.409
 especially our thoughts times do not forget 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.600
 that there is the e3 show that will start 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.560
 in the month of June the compoix finally there 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.159
 will surely have some information that will 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.409
 to be disclosed 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.570
 by then and especially since there are also 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.280
 the playstation 4 on February 20 that goes 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.590
 to make announcements maybe that the game 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.060
 also on so on this console there is 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.560
 maybe the next xbox will see 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.579
 well here is 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.549
 these muscular trailers so what 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.049
 we announce a little more particular 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.479
 there is a stream that will take place 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.869
 soon on the site of 1000th point org 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.729
 on assassin's creed iii in multi except 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.950
 that he will be more special than 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.270
 those that are usually done because there 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:09.149
 will have people the guys who created the 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.480
 multi of the skate scene 3 the guys of 8 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.580
 soft so ubisoft annecy who will come 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.100
 play with us stream is with us 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.040
 work with us so basically it's 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.980
 super there will be really guys a little 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.540
 of each specialty that will be there and 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.030
 you if you want you can ask 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.880
 all the questions but that concerns 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.220
 only obviously the multi 1 by the 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.940
 worth talking about the daring soil and 3 or 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.349
 solo of the next ac or sailing to what 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.459
 they paris viii can not answer they 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.190
 do not have the right anyway 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.190
 answer those kinds of questions and the 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.269
 multi that's what is concentration 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.120
 on multi so if you have any 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.890
 questions about the multi the c3 already 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.019
 do not hesitate to ask them like that 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.829
 I have an idea what to expect on 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.570
 on the stream and then also by the same 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.950
 opportunity 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:03.349
 and then it will be very much like that exact 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.069
 so here I think I can say he 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.780
 will be guests 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.890
 by the way I hope cash-ebit will be there 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.450
 yes I will try I think I have 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.370
 anything I would drop 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.550
 do not worry I think he'll have 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.959
 two three friends known with me here 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:23.150
 so we do not say more 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:25.790
 that's it for me it's good it's 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.049
 finished here is end of ads and here I am 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.060
 believe we'll leave you there 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.590
 people I hope the video will have you 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.580
 rained even if it was short-lived 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.140
 the announced was strong that's how it 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.250
 you're strong this ad was short and 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.780
 I hope it will unfold in 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.340
 french revolution or china voila 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.890
 veiled tomorrow we'll see where I said nothing 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.959
 I was there if I went where you can 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.579
 propose also times to make a 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.299
 little debate on excision 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.069
 China in France 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.319
 here you are talking to each other in order to 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.560
 do how to say a little debate there 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.150
 above 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.299
 and then that's how we argue 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.160
 wright or not it will be okay 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.569
