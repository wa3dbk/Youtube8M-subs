00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:03.889
 we went to know 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:05.149
 and you have to do 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:07.070
 of four engineers 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.269
 a biochemical genre 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.889
 who has dedicated his life 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.889
 in the last 40 years 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:18.579
 invent products to benefit him husband 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:20.359
 what determines this 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:21.930
 if he is a scientist 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.349
 or one modest percent 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.349
 an individual who has a complex current 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:32.889
 Knowledge coverage from the chemistry point of view 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.670
 and more in the natural aspect of plants 1 the products p 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.590
 e of last fire 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.530
 has been accepted 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.360
 from the fb down 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.190
 it is an extraordinary group 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.270
 he we refer to as jalal hosting 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.030
 it's a group that comes 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.410
 bonis 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.730
 and who has implications for the future very interesting unit 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.330
 produce formulas based on natural compounds capable of replacing 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.430
 products 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.290
 that carries years have affected the health of the human being due to its composition 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.760
 toxic chemicals has been a reality for a dedicated Panamanian scientist 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.050
 that for more than 40 years has done research with prior products 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.780
 chants this inventor has achieved one of his greatest successes by patenting his 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.680
 product the viotti a broad spectrum biocide able to sterilize 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.679
 100% without causing human diseases 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:34.729
 nor to the compounds treated with him this invention deserved him the prize of 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.819
 most outstanding inventor in 2007 because not only for the ministry of 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:39.850
 trade industry 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.659
 also received by the world property organization 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.330
 intellectual a medal in recognition of his invention this 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.270
 distinguished scientist and inventor has created more than 100 formulas all to 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.400
 base of organic compounds like the clever uncle 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.390
 which will be used to heal burns 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.320
 currently works at the chiguirí canning plant where it is processed 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.859
 and export natural products like noni 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.959
 which has healing properties capable of fighting diseases 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.659
 intractable 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.590
 his ingenuity has put it into practice to leave communist products before 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.829
 mentioned as a contribution to humanity 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:18.599
 to know the answer that we give account to the engineer can be or 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:19.499
 castellón 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:22.499
 interesting people 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:32.129
 but it's really I'm proud 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.080
 again 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.349
 in this program 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.079
 and it's because I've met one more Panamanian 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.059
 who has not been content with his profession 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:42.599
 that has not been content with 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.150
 get or a remuneration so to speak 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.219
 working 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:49.939
 modestly somewhere but that 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.749
 he has harnessed all his talent 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:54.339
 for him 

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:57.539
 know more to know more 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:59.009
 to invent 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:01.779
 and benefit many other people 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:04.810
 home engineer welcome to our program 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.910
 then he retracted 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.099
 thank you 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.749
 it is worth noting in editing like five programs to be able to speak with him 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:16.930
 because really you where you've been all this time I have not met him 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.239
 I wonder how much saving 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.789
 What you have done if you are not always 

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:22.449
 kept 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:24.589
 a low profile 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:26.199
 For security 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:27.879
 read for security 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:31.229
 but we have always been behind the camera 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:32.689
 percent what is 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:35.839
 exports of panama to do errands 

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:38.429
 as united states as europe 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:41.329
 and behind this is a chain success deportations 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.139
 she has been helping us 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.139
 transferring knowledge transferring technology 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:49.269
 the tip tea 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.040
 another one that is made for mara of the loss of puntín and that is seen in the 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.949
 site 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:57.280
 madness that surrounds you from other countries is here 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.650
 and with the raw material a raw material and with another heat or with another climate 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:06.389
 with this temperature the conatus person who has to properly trained 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:08.239
 it's interesting 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:09.319
 problems 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.459
 precisely from some is for sale in Latin for example 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.089
 hsbc touch elvio has sun is an organic product 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:20.909
 It is a stable disinfectant 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:23.659
 you stop an oil 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:25.740
 but it is not toxic 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.409
 is a friend of the current table 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:31.770
 Ecological previous of pleasant 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.069
 apart from that percent 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:37.069
 it is used in in different doses 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.050
 Either for 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.949
 kill bacteria 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:42.659
 to kill viruses 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:45.400
 to kill a few 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.219
 or nailed me to Rome 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:49.080
 to ensure paty aids 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.800
 for according to the police 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.830
 the product is so noble 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.229
 and it's made with fruits 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.809
 of the tropic more 

00:04:58.809 --> 00:05:02.620
 we have the need to eliminate the prologue 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:05.469
 the default with a little 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:09.270
 the chlorine was years of use in the use p 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.830
 feeding 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.740
 authorized by 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.589
 that area 

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:18.789
 authorized by the dome or European another state by the Japanese 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:23.150
 but eventually as it has happened 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.300
 as it happened with antibiotics 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.229
 medical panel 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:31.809
 yara bacteria become resistant national previous 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:35.360
 but the case ends all efe 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.439
 the tremor 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:37.870
 the chlorine 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.520
 he has intoxicated 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.999
 to the people 

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:42.620
 in excess 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.800
 apart 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.060
 that people who work in a closed place in an environment 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:52.270
 the asepsis when thus the previous cleaning of the beginning of operations 

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:56.339
 or when the operation of the slaughter ends 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:59.879
 the sea work demands 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:01.629
 pigeon 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:03.389
 clean 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.080
 the gown and then disinfect 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.999
 it is used for gold 

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:10.830
 but the people who were in that environment 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.240
 If you are hungry 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.430
 they fell they faint block that chrono without álava 

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:20.099
 ite affected the plasmo thing it affected the lining of the stomach 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:23.879
 because it is toxic 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:27.869
 We saw all that in the plants of the process that we manage 

00:06:27.869 --> 00:06:29.159
 advised 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:32.159
 that finally charged for not doing much damage 

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:36.139
 in the case of one we preserve the snapper that the kun 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:39.139
 it is a present and maximum of an intense red color 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.360
 if we use to extend this program that like him he has mounted a 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.159
 piece of laundry that is being washed 

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:48.430
 It is due to the layers of ash 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.100
 we use floro in food like unemployment 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.870
 the one that refers because he does not put camerano like Desdemona but for 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:01.289
 hundred and in him the love mara in the Galician norm and what there was in existence 

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:04.289
 to work all perishable products were metabisulfite 

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:08.069
 yera chlorine emanates 

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:11.460
 We knew that the choir did not hurt 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.949
 that everything has its limitations promise a harmful residual effect 

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:20.220
 the six of them were donors to us for there testing products 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:21.560
 percent 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.080
 biodegradable organics that have the capacity 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.349
 d disinfect or be demarcated from killing bacteria to kill viruses 

00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:35.149
 but that was not dalli do not stop the hands of the person 

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.480
 what I hope you can touch 

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.819
 and other than I could inhale it intoxicating cinquetti 

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:43.469
 and that we can achieve another one of can stop 

00:07:43.469 --> 00:07:44.290
 we try 

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.960
 doing tests for 10 years 

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:47.970
 ten years that
