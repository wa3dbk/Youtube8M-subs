00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
going and getting a haircut now I'm not

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.999 
going and getting a haircut now I'm not
getting<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:14.009> cut<00:01:14.900> I<00:01:15.900> just<00:01:16.590> want<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.800> get<00:01:16.890> it

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
getting it cut I just want to get it

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.469 
getting it cut I just want to get it
shaped<00:01:17.340> up<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.670> little<00:01:17.850> bit<00:01:17.940> around<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.180> sides

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
shaped up a little bit around the sides

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.120 
shaped up a little bit around the sides
and<00:01:18.690> stuff<00:01:18.960> just<00:01:19.259> clean<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.500> up<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.800> little<00:01:19.890> bit

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
and stuff just clean it up a little bit

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.800 
and stuff just clean it up a little bit
and<00:01:20.509> just<00:01:23.090> thin<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.210> out<00:01:24.300> a<00:01:24.360> little<00:01:24.570> bit

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
and just thin it out a little bit

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.090 
and just thin it out a little bit
because<00:01:24.900> my<00:01:25.020> hair<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.320> really<00:01:25.680> really<00:01:25.800> thick

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
because my hair is really really thick

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.120 
because my hair is really really thick
so<00:01:27.080> if<00:01:28.080> my<00:01:28.200> hair<00:01:28.350> looks<00:01:28.380> funny<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.920> next

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
so if my hair looks funny in the next

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.810 
so if my hair looks funny in the next
video<00:01:29.369> that's<00:01:30.210> why<00:01:30.540> but<00:01:31.440> it<00:01:32.040> shouldn't<00:01:32.520> so

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
video that's why but it shouldn't so

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.260

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
really don't think the quality is that

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.340 
really don't think the quality is that
bad<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:20.150> yeah<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.540> shouldn't<00:02:21.959> be<00:02:22.080> too<00:02:22.200> much<00:02:22.290> of

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
bad so yeah it shouldn't be too much of

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.119 
bad so yeah it shouldn't be too much of
a<00:02:22.530> problem

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.479
