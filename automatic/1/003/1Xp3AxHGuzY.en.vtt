00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
hotkeys here if you basically come up to

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.520 
hotkeys here if you basically come up to
the<00:04:31.940> profiles<00:04:32.360> make<00:04:32.629> a<00:04:32.659> new<00:04:32.810> profile<00:04:33.259> and

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
the profiles make a new profile and

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.719 
the profiles make a new profile and

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
change this to grant create is awesome

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.999 
change this to grant create is awesome
basically<00:04:37.729> you<00:04:38.060> can<00:04:38.389> find<00:04:38.659> your<00:04:38.810> your<00:04:39.500> keys<00:04:39.800> to

basically you can find your your keys to

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:43.960 
basically you can find your your keys to
a<00:04:40.039> very<00:04:40.310> small<00:04:40.539> amount<00:04:41.539> of<00:04:41.949> keys<00:04:42.949> that<00:04:43.789> makes

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
a very small amount of keys that makes

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.909 
a very small amount of keys that makes
sense<00:04:44.120> the<00:04:44.629> default<00:04:44.810> layout<00:04:45.199> is<00:04:45.470> fine<00:04:45.680> if

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919
