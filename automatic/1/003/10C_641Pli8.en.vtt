that's probably the thing I hate the

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.469 
that's probably the thing I hate the
most<00:02:03.979> about<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.520> stroller<00:02:04.760> is<00:02:05.030> that<00:02:05.210> if<00:02:05.360> you

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
most about the stroller is that if you

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.630 
most about the stroller is that if you
want<00:02:05.780> a<00:02:06.020> nice<00:02:06.560> sort<00:02:06.890> of<00:02:06.950> like<00:02:07.010> an<00:02:07.280> accessory

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
you have to buy it separate and

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.440 
you have to buy it separate and

everything is like 50 bucks it's it's

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.330 
everything is like 50 bucks it's it's
kind<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:11.750> ridiculous<00:02:12.080> but<00:02:12.440> we<00:02:12.799> got<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.100> snack

I really thought that these are using
super<00:04:46.190> entertaining<00:04:46.430> they<00:04:46.789> have<00:04:46.880> a<00:04:46.940> ton<00:04:47.120> of

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
super entertaining they have a ton of

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.980 
super entertaining they have a ton of
games<00:04:47.360> on<00:04:47.599> but<00:04:49.150> quite<00:04:50.150> you<00:04:50.389> know<00:04:50.510> say<00:04:50.720> they<00:04:50.870> use

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
games on but quite you know say they use

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.230 
games on but quite you know say they use
it<00:04:51.110> for<00:04:51.139> music<00:04:51.500> which<00:04:51.650> is<00:04:51.800> fine<00:04:51.979> I<00:04:52.849> think

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
it for music which is fine I think

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.460 
it for music which is fine I think
that's<00:04:53.479> pretty<00:04:53.630> much<00:04:53.750> it<00:04:53.900> so<00:04:54.050> that's<00:04:54.289> what<00:04:54.440> I

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
that's pretty much it so that's what I

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.550 
that's pretty much it so that's what I
do<00:04:54.590> to<00:04:54.800> keep<00:04:54.919> my<00:04:55.070> kids<00:04:55.340> entertained<00:04:55.789> and
