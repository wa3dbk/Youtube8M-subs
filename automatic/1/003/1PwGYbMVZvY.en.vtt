00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:23.580 

you<00:04:16.720> drag<00:04:17.079> the<00:04:17.440> music<00:04:17.620> in<00:04:18.449> to<00:04:19.449> the<00:04:19.570> file<00:04:19.840> and<00:04:22.590> if

you drag the music in to the file and if

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.779 
you drag the music in to the file and if
that<00:04:23.650> should<00:04:24.190> be<00:04:24.400> it<00:04:25.830> it'll<00:04:26.830> start<00:04:27.280> uploading

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789 
that should be it it'll start uploading

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:34.710 
that should be it it'll start uploading
it<00:04:28.090> and<00:04:28.530> then<00:04:29.530> you<00:04:30.509> disconnect<00:04:31.509> and<00:04:32.580> you<00:04:33.580> go<00:04:33.789> to

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
it and then you disconnect and you go to

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:44.219 
it and then you disconnect and you go to
music<00:04:36.060> memory<00:04:37.060> stick<00:04:38.370> right<00:04:39.370> there<00:04:41.550> um<00:04:43.229> open

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
music memory stick right there um open

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.420 
music memory stick right there um open
it<00:04:44.349> and<00:04:44.789> I<00:04:45.789> don't<00:04:45.849> only<00:04:46.060> have<00:04:46.150> one<00:04:46.570> song<00:04:46.840> stored

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
it and I don't only have one song stored

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.689 
it and I don't only have one song stored
so<00:04:48.570> this<00:04:49.570> is<00:04:49.810> what<00:04:50.050> this<00:04:50.620> should<00:04:50.919> be<00:04:51.460> what

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
so this is what this should be what

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:54.240 
so this is what this should be what
sounds<00:04:52.090> like
