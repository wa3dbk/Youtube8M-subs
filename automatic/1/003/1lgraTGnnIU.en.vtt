00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:09.870
 unlike whitewash stretch ceiling 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.300
 this time saving money as well 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:18.210
 minimum of construction waste and no 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:20.359
 paint preparatory stage includes 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.490
 markup level of the future ceiling 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.689
 he certainly congress a few centimeters 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.650
 living space 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.689
 but they are easy to fill at least visually 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.610
 let's pick up glossy material and the reflecting 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.960
 the surface will create the illusion of more 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.300
 high arches and so building 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.760
 markers mark the desired level throughout 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.890
 perimeter 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.730
 then draw diagonals and together 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.950
 intersection draw a circle 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.550
 so we get the fixing scheme of the future 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.629
 ceiling he will hold thanks 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.629
 wall profile 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.920
 armed with dowels and screws 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.420
 workers soar up their ladders and 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.420
 begin to drill the walls 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.900
 oil they will not find there but on the wires 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.050
 you can stumble so in this work 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.140
 the main attention and of course remarkable 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.140
 strength 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.880
 the workers will continue until the end of all 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.410
 operations soar to ceiling flying 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:33.880
 from stepladder to stepladder 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:36.310
 until they converge at one point recording them 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.700
 I wanted the ceiling was not just smooth 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.520
 rather beautiful with a twist as 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.520
 such will serve as a glossy circle in 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.570
 center do and the whole ceiling is glossy 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.270
 not a sensible idea 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.490
 night headlights passing cars below 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.060
 may be too bright on 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.660
 shiny surface and stop sleeping well 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.590
 circle in the center 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.990
 just do not catch the extra light but 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:11.150
 will reflect the lighting from the chandelier and make 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:13.970
 its brighter round frame in the center of the ceiling 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.650
 ready now you need to actually hand 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.650
 make fixtures for chandeliers 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:38.310
 Well, that's all the most dusty work is ready 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:42.150
 you can wind fishing rods more precisely drills and 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.850
 remove the hammers so that the work goes quickly and 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.950
 no garbage should be successful 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.700
 workers quickly put things in order 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.580
 premises and now begins the most 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:59.040
 impressive stage of work 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:01.590
 turns on the gas gun its meaning 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.450
 the application here is what is modern technology 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.790
 ceiling installation suggests that 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.220
 the source material is slightly shorter real 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.560
 and long whom and under the influence 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.690
 high temperature and worker strength 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.750
 fabric stretches to fit 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.750
 size 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.000
 carefully attaching the edge of the material 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.340
 bones new profile workers moves to 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.740
 center of the circle 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:45.420
 stretches the glossy material and 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:46.770
 I finish the main work now 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.760
 little things left 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:53.090
 namely close the seams and hang not 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.090
 rows
