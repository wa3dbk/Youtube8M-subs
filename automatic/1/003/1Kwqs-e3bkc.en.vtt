the recipe for it basically it's easy

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.429 
the recipe for it basically it's easy
and<00:00:17.029> basically<00:00:18.029> also<00:00:18.390> logical<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.020> finally

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
and basically also logical and finally

and basically also logical and finally
got<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.680> use<00:00:19.949> for<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.369> gold<00:00:20.640> we<00:00:20.820> find<00:00:20.970> so<00:00:21.900> it's

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
got a use for the gold we find so it's

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.380 
got a use for the gold we find so it's
really<00:00:22.350> precious<00:00:22.800> now<00:00:23.220> if<00:00:23.820> i<00:00:23.939> have<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.119> look

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
pick up your gold go like this this is

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.440 
pick up your gold go like this this is
the<00:00:28.859> power<00:00:29.099> trick<00:00:29.779> then<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.900> hook<00:00:31.080> up<00:00:31.349> stick

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
the power trick then you hook up stick

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.299 
the power trick then you hook up stick
with<00:00:33.450> some<00:00:33.630> redstone<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.350> then<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.800> get<00:00:34.950> six

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
with some redstone and then you get six

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.990 
with some redstone and then you get six
of<00:00:35.460> em<00:00:35.640> powered<00:00:36.090> rail<00:00:36.649> and<00:00:37.649> now<00:00:38.610> i'm<00:00:38.730> going<00:00:38.910> to

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
of em powered rail and now i'm going to

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
of em powered rail and now i'm going to
show<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.360> recipe<00:00:39.870> for<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.410> detector<00:00:40.920> track

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
show the recipe for the detector track

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.209 
show the recipe for the detector track
it's<00:00:43.020> also<00:00:43.290> pretty<00:00:43.710> easy<00:00:44.129> pressure<00:00:45.090> plate

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
it's also pretty easy pressure plate

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.990 
it's also pretty easy pressure plate
redstone<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.600> some<00:00:48.600> iron<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.850> there<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.969> go

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
redstone and some iron and there you go

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.619 
redstone and some iron and there you go
you<00:00:51.449> have<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.530> pressure<00:00:52.920> plate<00:00:59.090> so<00:01:00.090> let's

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
you have to pressure plate so let's

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.360 
you have to pressure plate so let's
quickly<00:01:00.750> head<00:01:01.170> down<00:01:01.440> i<00:01:01.469> have<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> quick<00:01:02.070> setup

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
quickly head down i have a quick setup

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.109 
quickly head down i have a quick setup
for<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.789> guys<00:01:03.030> here<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:05.119> boost

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
for you guys here so this is the boost

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.219 
for you guys here so this is the boost
up<00:01:06.330> track<00:01:07.610> now<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.760> doesn't<00:01:09.119> boost<00:01:09.330> when<00:01:10.110> you

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
up track now it doesn't boost when you

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.149 
up track now it doesn't boost when you
hook<00:01:10.350> up<00:01:10.530> our<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:11.010> boosts<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:12.710> let's<00:01:13.710> get<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
hook up our it boosts and let's get the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.929 
hook up our it boosts and let's get the
minecart<00:01:15.710> look<00:01:16.710> when<00:01:17.130> i<00:01:17.159> just<00:01:17.430> put<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.790> on

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
minecart look when i just put it on

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.660 
minecart look when i just put it on
there<00:01:18.180> nothing<00:01:18.720> will<00:01:18.869> happen<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:20.460> means

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
there nothing will happen so that means

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.700 
there nothing will happen so that means
the<00:01:20.880> car<00:01:21.119> needs<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.750> have<00:01:21.840> some<00:01:21.930> speed<00:01:22.380> when<00:01:22.560> it

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
the car needs to have some speed when it

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.710 
the car needs to have some speed when it
starts<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.490> means<00:01:23.700> we<00:01:23.820> need<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.000> slope<00:01:24.420> or

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
starts so that means we need a slope or

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.929 
starts so that means we need a slope or
not<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> means<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.650> boost<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.520> as<00:01:26.790> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
not a means to boost it so as the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.450 
not a means to boost it so as the
booster<00:01:27.330> still<00:01:27.570> work<00:01:27.810> maybe<00:01:28.799> dare<00:01:29.100> come<00:01:29.310> in

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
booster still work maybe dare come in

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.819 
booster still work maybe dare come in
handy<00:01:29.670> again<00:01:30.049> now<00:01:31.049> i'm<00:01:31.320> going<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.650> show<00:01:31.799> you

oh oh no yeah there you go let's boost
me<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.270> just<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.810> detector<00:01:40.290> up<00:01:40.409> lock<00:01:40.850> see<00:01:41.850> it

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
me and just the detector up lock see it

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.100 
me and just the detector up lock see it
goes<00:01:42.450> off

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
goes off

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.860 
goes off
we<00:01:45.110> prove<00:01:45.350> to<00:01:45.530> set<00:01:45.710> up<00:01:45.860> a<00:01:45.980> bit<00:01:46.450> so<00:01:47.450> let's<00:01:47.660> see

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
we prove to set up a bit so let's see

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.590 
we prove to set up a bit so let's see
again<00:01:48.310> now<00:01:49.310> we're<00:01:49.520> going<00:01:49.700> to<00:01:49.790> have<00:01:49.970> a<00:01:50.000> another

again now we're going to have a another
piece<00:01:50.960> of<00:01:51.140> track<00:01:51.170> here<00:01:52.750> and<00:01:55.300> put<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:56.450> mine<00:01:56.630> cut

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
piece of track here and put the mine cut

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.750 
piece of track here and put the mine cut
down<00:01:57.850> right<00:01:58.850> up<00:01:59.090> in<00:01:59.600> and<00:01:59.840> we<00:02:00.230> get<00:02:00.380> boost<00:02:00.650> it<00:02:00.860> and

gonna have a look at another

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.760 
gonna have a look at another
functionality<00:03:07.459> of<00:03:07.489> them<00:03:07.820> look<00:03:08.630> just<00:03:09.440> one<00:03:09.650> is

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
functionality of them look just one is

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:23.199 
functionality of them look just one is
unpowered<00:03:10.160> now<00:03:15.280> see<00:03:17.230> breaks<00:03:19.840> there<00:03:20.840> you<00:03:20.930> go<00:03:22.209> so

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
unpowered now see breaks there you go so

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.090 
unpowered now see breaks there you go so
it's<00:03:23.360> a<00:03:23.420> breaking<00:03:23.690> plate<00:03:24.080> but<00:03:24.500> if<00:03:24.620> I<00:03:24.739> here<00:03:24.950> we

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
it's a breaking plate but if I here we

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.699 
it's a breaking plate but if I here we
hook<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.670> power<00:03:25.880> hope<00:03:26.480> to<00:03:26.660> pop<00:03:26.840> up<00:03:26.870> again<00:03:27.230> it's

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
hook the power hope to pop up again it's

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.430 
hook the power hope to pop up again it's
not<00:03:27.950> gonna<00:03:28.130> boost<00:03:28.430> its<00:03:28.700> 02<00:03:28.940> my<00:03:29.930> cut<00:03:30.200> needs

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
not gonna boost its 02 my cut needs

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.670 
not gonna boost its 02 my cut needs
momentum<00:03:31.239> it's<00:03:32.239> not<00:03:32.360> gonna<00:03:32.600> go<00:03:32.870> need<00:03:33.320> to<00:03:33.350> push

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
momentum it's not gonna go need to push

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.120 
momentum it's not gonna go need to push
it<00:03:33.709> so<00:03:34.459> the<00:03:34.640> boosters<00:03:35.090> are<00:03:35.209> still<00:03:35.450> needed

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
it so the boosters are still needed

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.560 
it so the boosters are still needed
later<00:03:37.130> maybe<00:03:37.430> pistons<00:03:38.000> okay<00:03:39.190> later<00:03:40.190> I<00:03:40.640> think

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
later maybe pistons okay later I think

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.470 
later maybe pistons okay later I think
