and<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.520> most<00:01:56.730> interesting<00:01:57.300> piece<00:01:57.450> of

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
and the most interesting piece of

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.310 
and the most interesting piece of
information<00:01:58.340> basically<00:01:59.780> claimed<00:02:00.780> by<00:02:01.110> this

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
information basically claimed by this

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.840 
information basically claimed by this
Twitter<00:02:01.530> account<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:02.670> game's

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
Twitter account is that the game's

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.400 
Twitter account is that the game's
release<00:02:03.030> date<00:02:03.330> will<00:02:03.480> actually<00:02:03.690> depend<00:02:04.020> on<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
release date will actually depend on the

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.530 
release date will actually depend on the
sales<00:02:04.860> figures<00:02:05.220> of<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.340> ps4<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.940> Xbox<00:02:06.240> one

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
sales figures of the ps4 and Xbox one

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.640 
sales figures of the ps4 and Xbox one
but<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.840> be<00:02:06.960> honest<00:02:07.170> if<00:02:07.290> that's<00:02:07.440> what<00:02:07.560> their

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
but to be honest if that's what their

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.169 
but to be honest if that's what their
waste<00:02:07.800> and<00:02:08.009> fall<00:02:08.160> then<00:02:08.399> they<00:02:08.820> probably<00:02:09.000> got

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
waste and fall then they probably got

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.520 
waste and fall then they probably got
the<00:02:09.300> confirmation<00:02:09.630> that<00:02:10.050> they<00:02:10.170> needed<00:02:10.500> that

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
the confirmation that they needed that

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.050 
the confirmation that they needed that
there's<00:02:10.800> going<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.070> be<00:02:11.100> a<00:02:11.190> huge<00:02:11.490> player<00:02:11.850> base

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
there's going to be a huge player base

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.770 
there's going to be a huge player base
on<00:02:12.300> both<00:02:12.570> systems<00:02:13.280> still<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.760> claims<00:02:15.060> made<00:02:15.209> by

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
on both systems still the claims made by

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.390 
on both systems still the claims made by
this<00:02:15.959> twitter<00:02:16.350> account<00:02:16.680> don't<00:02:16.950> seem<00:02:17.190> so

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
this twitter account don't seem so

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.010 
this twitter account don't seem so
ridiculously<00:02:17.940> over<00:02:18.180> top<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.450> we<00:02:18.720> can<00:02:18.870> just

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
ridiculously over top that we can just

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.210 
ridiculously over top that we can just
immediately<00:02:19.170> go<00:02:19.530> are<00:02:19.709> this<00:02:20.010> is<00:02:20.100> obviously

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
immediately go are this is obviously

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.280 
immediately go are this is obviously
phakic<00:02:20.790> they<00:02:21.060> could<00:02:21.270> actually<00:02:21.480> easily<00:02:22.140> be

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
phakic they could actually easily be

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.170 
phakic they could actually easily be
true<00:02:22.620> we're<00:02:23.190> just<00:02:23.250> kind<00:02:23.490> of<00:02:23.520> making<00:02:23.700> me<00:02:23.910> think

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
true we're just kind of making me think

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.030 
true we're just kind of making me think
that<00:02:24.420> we<00:02:24.720> can<00:02:24.840> probably<00:02:25.140> say<00:02:25.440> yeah<00:02:25.740> these<00:02:25.980> are

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
that we can probably say yeah these are

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.010 
that we can probably say yeah these are
probably<00:02:26.370> true<00:02:26.730> but<00:02:26.970> just<00:02:27.420> keep<00:02:27.540> in<00:02:27.630> mind<00:02:27.690> that

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
probably true but just keep in mind that

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.570 
probably true but just keep in mind that
square<00:02:28.380> may<00:02:28.560> turn<00:02:28.739> around<00:02:28.950> go<00:02:29.100> know<00:02:29.340> this

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
square may turn around go know this

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.190 
square may turn around go know this
place<00:02:29.730> is<00:02:29.880> making<00:02:30.239> up<00:02:30.330> lies<00:02:30.570> but<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:30.900> think<00:02:31.140> the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
place is making up lies but I think the

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.290 
place is making up lies but I think the
chances<00:02:31.620> are<00:02:31.680> good<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.190> actually<00:02:32.880> we've<00:02:33.030> got

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
chances are good that actually we've got

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.210 
chances are good that actually we've got
some<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.840> little<00:02:34.140> bit<00:02:34.320> of<00:02:34.440> information<00:02:34.620> just<00:02:35.070> to

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
some a little bit of information just to

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.430 
some a little bit of information just to
tide<00:02:35.430> us<00:02:35.459> over<00:02:35.760> until<00:02:36.120> their<00:02:36.989> big<00:02:37.170> reveal

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
tide us over until their big reveal

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.990 
tide us over until their big reveal
which<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.680> course<00:02:37.739> isn't<00:02:38.130> going<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.520> be<00:02:38.610> III

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
which of course isn't going to be III

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.180 
which of course isn't going to be III
but<00:02:39.150> could<00:02:39.390> possibly<00:02:39.840> be<00:02:40.050> at<00:02:40.260> Gamescom<00:02:40.950> if<00:02:41.130> you
