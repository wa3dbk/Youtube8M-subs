00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:03.460
 hello how about youtube friends 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.629
 this time I want to share with you one of the 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.760
 of tea privileges with a graphics card as it is 

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:14.759
 the in viveiro foz 96 0 0 gp 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.539
 256-bit 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.310
 what in addition to being able to play games 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.539
 that are actually heavy as tirso muah 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.519
 but it cost me 4 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.789
 this is how it hides 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.160
 we can emulate almost any console on our computer 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.630
 one of the preferred emulators and I think that 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.770
 of those who want all of us to work well on a computer 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.560
 the latter 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.690
 this time I'm going to show you 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.690
 how it works well 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.380
 in this pc 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.290
 with this graphic card 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.290
 moyano is very low 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.330
 is version 49 15 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.840
 of the site where the base of 100 kerala 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.200
 city ​​logo I hope so 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.940
 if it is not, then it works anyway 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.520
 wonderfully then 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.520
 whether or not it is the latest version 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.200
 let's see some points is a privilege 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.610
 mario clear 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.610
 mario kart hidden super mario bros honey and 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.980
 ii of reynosa debt 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.370
 To his back 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.460
 higgins 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.460
 for nintendo wii I have the ribbon mario bros wii 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.390
 and I think it's one of the most famous Swedish console games 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.390
 they executed 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.270
 one in snatch immediately unencumbered than ever 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.880
 I do not have any time so 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.880
 use the keyboard 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.000
 Jack 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.979
 p 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.750
 p 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.310
 a man for being the first president the real time 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:12.119
 it's just a matter of 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:15.119
 actors some did not work very well the nba 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:17.949
 this game does not even with 

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:21.349
 with this graphic card but everything is a matter of going from picarle to 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.539
 configuration 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:25.539
 I love beagle to the options 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:28.079
 to reach it 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.149
 in the versions of that album 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:33.949
 n 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:38.409
 p no time the control said that so far I should add 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:42.189
 with not a single game 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.149
 as I say that that is a matter of him 

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:53.099
 we see several options until you have the current configuration that is 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.539
 because the fact 

00:02:54.539 --> 00:03:01.369
 if you ran an honest clean game with this configuration pl do not do it on 

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:04.859
 real time mela the boot 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.780
 mulet too fast too fast all moment in much the 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.950
 will be since then I have to move to the configuration I would have to return 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:15.189
 at 12 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:22.950
 hewitt brief very good configuration because if we are not imbeciles it seems 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:25.949
 and the least fearsome option of order 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:28.759
 d alleged 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:30.599
 wii control 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.599
 the command in the pulpit here have option 

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:39.309
 but the truth I've never tried is that I do not know if it's possible 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.639
 added a wii control 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.789
 because the sensory bar dries out they are actually a few that are 

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:50.049
 those who send the 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.649
 the infrared signal to the controls for signaling 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:57.499
 perimeter of the screen or holland 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:04:00.409
 the size of the led screen and followed its lyrics 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:03.779
 then it's not really a sensor, it's just 

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:06.779
 some lights that 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:08.599
 this 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:12.259
 yes they interpret the size of the screen to see paraguay moc 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:16.680
 toxo that's how the emulator works 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.259
 but what 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.699
 has clarified the doubt that some have 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.319
 that wii games do not work well on this graphics card 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:29.319
 if they work it's just a matter of fashion 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:36.259
 the configurations usually the main reason why they do not work 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:38.599
 well the josés for this one 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:40.249
 for this reason 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:42.539
 in natanz etc 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.650
 September 7 in this organ 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:46.680
 I'm fine 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.389
 your text 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.460
 for what 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.889
 so that wii games work very well 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.069
 only that in this way 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:56.879
 he 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.120
 the starting lights are very fast 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.789
 then it's just a matter of limiting them 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:03.339
 with the 

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:06.039
 in the configuration 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.779
 kristen the limit effén option 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:12.150
 nothing else is automatic 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.169
 the world as I told you 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.509
 limited country to 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:19.509
 for the start games so that they are no longer going to celebrate 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:23.259
 but they will be in real time 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:27.659
 Well, that's all this island 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:30.979
 the two pin emulator 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:33.949
 in its 32 bit version for pc 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:34.580
 regards
