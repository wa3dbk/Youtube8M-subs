know I just been injured for like a year
and<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.250> half<00:00:20.400> but<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.760> first<00:00:20.940> time<00:00:21.090> I'd<00:00:21.210> been

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:21.450 
and a half but the first time I'd been

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.740 
and a half but the first time I'd been
in<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.810> skate<00:00:22.410> scene<00:00:22.520> let<00:00:23.520> alone<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:24.630> know

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
in the skate scene let alone you know

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.480 
in the skate scene let alone you know
anybody<00:00:25.050> even<00:00:25.350> knew<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.770> was<00:00:25.950> skating<00:00:26.160> it

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
anybody even knew that I was skating it

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.580 
anybody even knew that I was skating it
so<00:00:26.790> I<00:00:27.060> think<00:00:27.720> for<00:00:28.020> the<00:00:28.080> most<00:00:28.200> part<00:00:28.439> people

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
so I think for the most part people

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.170 
so I think for the most part people
thought<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:28.919> was<00:00:29.009> pretty<00:00:29.490> kind<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.939> write-off

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
thought I was pretty kind of a write-off

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.120 
thought I was pretty kind of a write-off
at<00:00:30.509> that<00:00:30.660> moment<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.380> not<00:00:31.560> sure<00:00:31.829> what<00:00:31.980> was

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
at that moment and not sure what was

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.980 
at that moment and not sure what was
gonna<00:00:32.279> go<00:00:32.369> down<00:00:32.579> or<00:00:33.060> if<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.450> was<00:00:33.600> gonna<00:00:33.720> make<00:00:33.960> a

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:33.990 
gonna go down or if I was gonna make a

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:43.099 
gonna go down or if I was gonna make a
comeback<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:41.090> showed<00:00:42.090> up<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.390> Tampa<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.020> I

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:43.109 
comeback I showed up in Tampa and I

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:44.479 
comeback I showed up in Tampa and I
think<00:00:43.320> people<00:00:43.469> didn't<00:00:43.800> expect<00:00:43.949> to<00:00:44.219> see<00:00:44.370> me

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
think people didn't expect to see me

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.760 
think people didn't expect to see me
there<00:00:44.520> let<00:00:44.820> alone<00:00:44.850> skating<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.379> was<00:00:46.530> ready

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
there let alone skating and I was ready

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.240 
there let alone skating and I was ready
to<00:00:46.920> battle<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.000> out<00:00:51.530> so<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.590> won<00:00:52.769> the<00:00:52.890> contest

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
to battle it out so I won the contest

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.740 
to battle it out so I won the contest
which<00:00:53.489> was<00:00:53.670> very<00:00:53.850> surprising<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.570> me<00:00:54.690> because

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
which was very surprising to me because

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.319 
which was very surprising to me because
I<00:00:54.929> wasn't<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.760> didn't<00:00:56.760> go<00:00:56.879> there<00:00:57.090> with<00:00:57.210> the

I wasn't I didn't go there with the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.970 
I wasn't I didn't go there with the
anticipation<00:00:57.840> away<00:00:58.230> anything<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.649> went<00:00:58.829> there

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
anticipation away anything I went there

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.400 
anticipation away anything I went there
the<00:00:59.100> anticipation<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.820> get<00:01:00.410> reacquainted

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
the anticipation to get reacquainted

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.180 
the anticipation to get reacquainted
with<00:01:01.859> my<00:01:02.550> skateboarding<00:01:03.089> career<00:01:04.160> then<00:01:05.160> I
