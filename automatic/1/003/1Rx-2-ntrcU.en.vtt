00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
pressure issues from this patient

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.729 
pressure issues from this patient
because<00:02:39.239> they<00:02:39.660> have<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.140> much<00:02:40.319> of<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.530> flirt

because they have so much of a flirt
retention<00:02:41.480> you<00:02:42.480> may<00:02:42.750> see<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:43.170> spike<00:02:43.680> in<00:02:43.709> a<00:02:43.920> blood

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
retention you may see a spike in a blood

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.380 
retention you may see a spike in a blood
pressure<00:02:44.400> okay<00:02:45.299> um<00:02:45.739> so<00:02:46.739> you<00:02:47.280> want<00:02:47.519> to<00:02:47.760> monitor

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
pressure okay um so you want to monitor

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.380 
pressure okay um so you want to monitor
blood<00:02:48.780> pressure<00:02:49.019> closely<00:02:49.610> also<00:02:50.610> another

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
blood pressure closely also another

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.479 
blood pressure closely also another
really<00:02:51.840> important<00:02:52.350> thing<00:02:52.500> when<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.100> give<00:02:53.310> and

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
really important thing when you give and

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.800 
really important thing when you give and
lasix<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.120> patient<00:02:54.540> CHF<00:02:55.970> usually<00:02:56.970> you

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
lasix to the patient CHF usually you

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.720 
lasix to the patient CHF usually you
want<00:02:58.019> to<00:02:58.110> check<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.440> potassium<00:02:58.829> level<00:02:59.640> as

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
want to check the potassium level as

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.699 
want to check the potassium level as
well<00:02:59.760> because<00:03:00.480> lasix<00:03:00.930> is<00:03:01.019> a<00:03:01.049> drug<00:03:01.380> that

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
well because lasix is a drug that

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.370 
well because lasix is a drug that
depletes<00:03:02.370> your<00:03:02.519> potassium<00:03:02.970> level<00:03:03.600> okay<00:03:03.930> when

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
depletes your potassium level okay when

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.319 
depletes your potassium level okay when
you<00:03:04.560> urinate<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:05.250> your<00:03:05.370> internet<00:03:05.940> out<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.120> lot

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
you urinate it your internet out a lot

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.180 
you urinate it your internet out a lot
of<00:03:06.450> potassium<00:03:06.959> is<00:03:07.049> where<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.380> lose<00:03:07.620> potassium

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
of potassium is where you lose potassium

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.009 
of potassium is where you lose potassium
so<00:03:08.489> most<00:03:08.730> doctors<00:03:08.970> put<00:03:09.329> patients<00:03:09.840> on<00:03:09.959> a

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
so most doctors put patients on a

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.060 
so most doctors put patients on a
potassium<00:03:11.030> when<00:03:12.030> you're<00:03:12.560> doing<00:03:13.560> any<00:03:13.829> kind<00:03:13.890> of

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
potassium when you're doing any kind of

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.030 
potassium when you're doing any kind of
lasix<00:03:14.489> theory<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.840> when<00:03:16.350> your<00:03:16.500> own<00:03:16.620> lasix

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
lasix theory and when your own lasix

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.500 
lasix theory and when your own lasix
therapy<00:03:17.370> you<00:03:17.700> want<00:03:17.940> that's<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.180> ladder<00:03:18.420> that

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
therapy you want that's a ladder that

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.050 
therapy you want that's a ladder that
you<00:03:18.660> want<00:03:19.019> to<00:03:19.109> continue<00:03:19.739> to<00:03:19.829> shed<00:03:20.040> it<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.790> the

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
you want to continue to shed it is the

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.090 
you want to continue to shed it is the
potassium<00:03:21.780> level<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.530> make<00:03:22.650> sure<00:03:22.829> you're<00:03:22.980> not

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
potassium level to make sure you're not

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.050 
potassium level to make sure you're not
depleting<00:03:23.609> it<00:03:23.730> up<00:03:24.410> too<00:03:25.410> much<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.890> if<00:03:26.760> you're

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
depleting it up too much and if you're

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.509 
depleting it up too much and if you're
giving<00:03:27.750> potassium<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:28.739> this<00:03:29.100> is<00:03:29.280> not<00:03:29.459> just

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
giving potassium and this is not just

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.460 
giving potassium and this is not just
goes<00:03:29.910> with<00:03:30.120> congestive<00:03:30.450> heart<00:03:30.600> failure<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:31.170> lot

goes with congestive heart failure a lot

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.170 
goes with congestive heart failure a lot

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.400 
let me say something one lap you want to
look<00:03:46.500> at<00:03:46.680> before<00:03:47.250> year<00:03:47.819> this<00:03:48.510> medicine<00:03:48.870> is

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
look at before year this medicine is

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.670 
look at before year this medicine is
pasion<00:03:49.880> potassium<00:03:50.880> level<00:03:51.240> one<00:03:51.450> was<00:03:51.690> 3.5<00:03:52.290> 25

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
pasion potassium level one was 3.5 25

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.830 
pasion potassium level one was 3.5 25
before<00:03:53.460> you<00:03:53.550> give<00:03:53.730> potassium<00:03:54.330> make<00:03:54.540> sure<00:03:54.720> you

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
before you give potassium make sure you

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.710 
before you give potassium make sure you
know<00:03:54.990> what<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.230> potassium<00:03:55.740> level<00:03:56.160> is<00:03:56.280> because

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
know what the potassium level is because

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.590 
know what the potassium level is because
potassium<00:03:57.720> is<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:59.000> drug<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:00.270> will<00:04:00.390> cause

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
potassium is a drug that will cause

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.640 
potassium is a drug that will cause
lethal<00:04:01.200> arrhythmias<00:04:01.890> in<00:04:03.050> heart<00:04:04.050> patients<00:04:04.500> or

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
lethal arrhythmias in heart patients or

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.100 
lethal arrhythmias in heart patients or
non<00:04:05.010> heart<00:04:05.370> patients<00:04:05.880> it<00:04:06.060> will<00:04:06.450> make<00:04:06.630> your<00:04:06.780> art

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
non heart patients it will make your art

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.300 
non heart patients it will make your art
your<00:04:07.290> heart<00:04:07.680> at<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:07.980> food<00:04:08.780> so<00:04:09.780> you<00:04:10.220> want<00:04:11.220> to

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
your heart at the food so you want to

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.940 
your heart at the food so you want to
check<00:04:11.490> the<00:04:11.790> potassium<00:04:12.120> level<00:04:12.810> whenever<00:04:13.590> um

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
check the potassium level whenever um

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.600 
check the potassium level whenever um
you<00:04:14.400> given<00:04:14.670> potassium<00:04:15.240> okay<00:04:16.100> is<00:04:17.100> that<00:04:17.430> all<00:04:17.580> I

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:17.610 
you given potassium okay is that all I

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.130 
you given potassium okay is that all I
had<00:04:17.910> to<00:04:17.940> say<00:04:18.090> about<00:04:18.269> congestive<00:04:19.110> heart
