anything<00:04:01.549> about<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.629> way<00:04:03.079> this<00:04:03.409> album<00:04:03.829> was

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
anything about the way this album was

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.750 
anything about the way this album was
made<00:04:04.219> and<00:04:04.579> it<00:04:05.150> was<00:04:05.329> a<00:04:05.359> long<00:04:05.719> from<00:04:06.650> year<00:04:07.280> almost

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
made and it was a long from year almost

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.229 
made and it was a long from year almost
over<00:04:08.329> a<00:04:08.359> year<00:04:08.720> of<00:04:08.959> working<00:04:09.379> on<00:04:09.620> it<00:04:09.829> but<00:04:10.010> I<00:04:10.459> think

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
over a year of working on it but I think

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.160 
over a year of working on it but I think
that<00:04:11.780> it's<00:04:12.079> definitely<00:04:13.180> quality<00:04:14.180> over<00:04:14.209> trying

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
that it's definitely quality over trying

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.689 
that it's definitely quality over trying
to<00:04:15.319> cram<00:04:15.739> everything<00:04:15.920> in<00:04:16.310> and<00:04:16.459> finish

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699 
to cram everything in and finish

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:18.279
