00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
basically what God is to 600 watt HPS is

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.179 
basically what God is to 600 watt HPS is
with<00:00:25.480> all<00:00:25.720> the<00:00:25.750> air<00:00:25.990> cooling<00:00:26.289> got<00:00:26.680> the<00:00:26.770> ice<00:00:26.890> box

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
with all the air cooling got the ice box

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.389 
with all the air cooling got the ice box
is<00:00:27.400> cooling<00:00:27.700> the<00:00:27.880> lights<00:00:28.919> got<00:00:29.919> about<00:00:30.009> 1,200

is cooling the lights got about 1,200
watts<00:00:30.669> of<00:00:30.880> power<00:00:31.029> going<00:00:31.779> in<00:00:31.960> here<00:00:34.649> yeah<00:00:36.450> it

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
watts of power going in here yeah it

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:44.430 
watts of power going in here yeah it
really<00:00:37.719> is<00:00:38.079> awesome<00:00:38.770> yeah<00:00:41.579> cool<00:00:42.579> and<00:00:42.879> so<00:00:43.839> what

bases it's chilly water and then these

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:52.410 
bases it's chilly water and then these
big<00:00:50.079> boxes<00:00:50.260> right<00:00:50.679> here<00:00:50.969> they're<00:00:51.969> actually

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
big boxes right here they're actually

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.479 
big boxes right here they're actually
getting<00:00:52.989> cold<00:00:53.289> like<00:00:53.379> a<00:00:53.440> refrigerator<00:00:53.649> okay

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
getting cold like a refrigerator okay

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.759 
getting cold like a refrigerator okay
more<00:00:55.329> similar<00:00:55.629> to<00:00:55.839> like<00:00:56.019> a<00:00:56.050> radiator<00:00:56.469> in<00:00:56.649> your

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.710 
suck all the air through the legs oh
okay<00:01:08.710> so<00:01:08.770> pull<00:01:09.130> them<00:01:09.280> off<00:01:09.430> yeah<00:01:09.909> so<00:01:10.150> very<00:01:10.420> cold

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
okay so pull them off yeah so very cold

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.360 
okay so pull them off yeah so very cold
so<00:01:10.960> be<00:01:11.110> cool<00:01:11.260> in<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.409> bowl<00:01:11.560> right<00:01:12.010> here<00:01:12.040> we've

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.460 
so be cool in the bowl right here we've
got<00:01:12.400> it<00:01:12.580> blown<00:01:12.729> out<00:01:13.030> this<00:01:13.840> would<00:01:13.960> be<00:01:14.050> cold<00:01:14.320> air

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
got it blown out this would be cold air

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.600 
got it blown out this would be cold air
coming<00:01:14.680> out<00:01:14.800> so<00:01:14.950> it's<00:01:15.040> like<00:01:15.130> air<00:01:15.250> conditioned
