hard<00:01:32.100> work<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.549> now<00:01:32.729> ported<00:01:33.150> over<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.420> OpenGL

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
hard work is now ported over to OpenGL

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.420 
hard work is now ported over to OpenGL
and<00:01:34.290> what<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.740> going<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.920> allow<00:01:35.130> them<00:01:35.310> to

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
and what this is going to allow them to

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.190 
and what this is going to allow them to
do<00:01:35.549> as<00:01:35.670> far<00:01:35.820> as<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.030> understand<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.630> really<00:01:36.990> just

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
do as far as I understand is really just

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.440 
do as far as I understand is really just
have<00:01:37.710> animations<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.579> do<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.759> 3d<00:01:39.030> modeling<00:01:39.390> a

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
have animations and do the 3d modeling a

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.090 
have animations and do the 3d modeling a
lot<00:01:39.600> easier<00:01:39.840> it's<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.530> much<00:01:40.680> better

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
lot easier it's just a much better

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.920 
lot easier it's just a much better
system<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.939> guess<00:01:42.180> for<00:01:42.390> them<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.659> do<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.840> in

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
system I guess for them to do it in

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.990 
system I guess for them to do it in
OpenGL<00:01:43.470> there's<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.070> lot<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.189> technical<00:01:44.610> mumbo

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
OpenGL there's a lot of technical mumbo

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.460 
OpenGL there's a lot of technical mumbo
jumbo<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.509> he<00:01:45.630> kind<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.869> leaves<00:01:46.079> out<00:01:46.259> which

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
jumbo that he kind of leaves out which

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.719 
jumbo that he kind of leaves out which
is<00:01:46.500> good<00:01:46.770> because<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.040> personally<00:01:47.490> have<00:01:47.610> no

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
is good because I personally have no

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.969 
is good because I personally have no
 idea<00:01:48.180> what<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:49.229> difference<00:01:49.890> is

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
 idea what the difference is

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.100 
 idea what the difference is
between<00:01:50.040> each<00:01:50.850> one<00:01:51.119> outside<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.570> maybe<00:01:51.750> one

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
between each one outside of maybe one

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.560 
between each one outside of maybe one
being<00:01:52.290> easier<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.680> program<00:01:52.890> for<00:01:53.369> but<00:01:54.329> he<00:01:54.479> has

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
being easier to program for but he has

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.690 
being easier to program for but he has
finally<00:01:55.049> done<00:01:55.259> most<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.040> actually<00:01:56.399> has

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
finally done most of it and actually has

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.980 
finally done most of it and actually has
some<00:01:56.850> stuff<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.119> show<00:01:57.270> for<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.719> video

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
some stuff to show for it is a video

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.060 
some stuff to show for it is a video
here<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.439> think<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.710> guys<00:01:58.860> should<00:01:58.890> go

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
here that I think you guys should go

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.760 
here that I think you guys should go
check<00:01:59.219> out<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.610> watched<00:02:00.170> most<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.409> it

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
check out that I watched most of it

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.240 
check out that I watched most of it
shows<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.729> new<00:02:02.909> 3d<00:02:03.509> modeling<00:02:04.110> sprites<00:02:04.469> what

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
shows the new 3d modeling sprites what

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.830 
shows the new 3d modeling sprites what
this<00:02:05.430> new<00:02:05.610> 3d<00:02:05.969> modeling<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.479> going<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.689> be

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
this new 3d modeling is going to be

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.010 
this new 3d modeling is going to be
outside<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.619> less<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.849> burden<00:02:09.209> on<00:02:09.450> your<00:02:09.569> PC's

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
outside of less of a burden on your PC's

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.260 
outside of less of a burden on your PC's
is<00:02:10.259> going<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.950> allow<00:02:11.099> for<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.370> lot<00:02:11.459> smoother

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
is going to allow for a lot smoother

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.630 
is going to allow for a lot smoother
and<00:02:12.360> better<00:02:13.140> looking<00:02:13.350> animations<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.490> you

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
and better looking animations and you

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.800 
and better looking animations and you
actually<00:02:14.880> get<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.000> see<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.270> little<00:02:15.480> bit<00:02:15.600> of<00:02:15.660> that

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
actually get to see a little bit of that

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.870 
actually get to see a little bit of that
in<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.140> 3d<00:02:16.470> zombie<00:02:17.040> sprites<00:02:17.370> right<00:02:17.670> in<00:02:17.790> this

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
in the 3d zombie sprites right in this

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.280 
in the 3d zombie sprites right in this
video<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:18.420> go<00:02:18.450> check<00:02:18.720> out<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:18.990> thing<00:02:19.170> it

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
video so go check out this thing it

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.320 
video so go check out this thing it
looks<00:02:19.440> really<00:02:19.680> good<00:02:19.950> but<00:02:20.190> in<00:02:20.790> my<00:02:20.940> opinion<00:02:21.090> the

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
looks really good but in my opinion the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.640 
looks really good but in my opinion the
most<00:02:21.450> important<00:02:22.080> thing<00:02:22.260> that's<00:02:22.470> going<00:02:22.590> to

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
most important thing that's going to

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.950 
most important thing that's going to
allow<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:23.070> for<00:02:23.130> some<00:02:23.670> massive<00:02:24.150> optimizations

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
allow is for some massive optimizations

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.120 
allow is for some massive optimizations
it's<00:02:25.170> going<00:02:25.320> to<00:02:25.380> be<00:02:25.440> easier<00:02:25.620> for<00:02:25.860> your

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
it's going to be easier for your

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.430 
it's going to be easier for your
graphics<00:02:26.580> card<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:27.000> for<00:02:27.420> lower<00:02:27.570> NPCs<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.320> be

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
graphics card and for lower NPCs to be

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.190 
graphics card and for lower NPCs to be
able<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:29.070> render<00:02:29.820> these<00:02:30.090> 3d<00:02:30.480> sprites<00:02:30.930> are

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
able to render these 3d sprites are

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.350 
able to render these 3d sprites are
these<00:02:32.190> 3d<00:02:32.400> models<00:02:32.490> rather<00:02:32.940> they're<00:02:33.090> not<00:02:33.180> even

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
these 3d models rather they're not even

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.270 
these 3d models rather they're not even
sprites<00:02:33.570> anymore<00:02:33.870> this<00:02:34.020> 3d<00:02:34.260> models<00:02:34.650> on<00:02:34.800> your

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
sprites anymore this 3d models on your

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.010 
sprites anymore this 3d models on your
PC<00:02:35.610> because<00:02:35.760> as<00:02:36.120> they<00:02:36.270> brought<00:02:36.480> up<00:02:36.600> before<00:02:36.720> and

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
PC because as they brought up before and

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.980 
PC because as they brought up before and
as<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.230> talked<00:02:37.440> about<00:02:37.710> before<00:02:38.360> newer<00:02:39.360> pcs<00:02:39.810> and

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
as I talked about before newer pcs and

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.870 
as I talked about before newer pcs and
newer<00:02:40.110> graphics<00:02:40.560> cards<00:02:40.830> are<00:02:40.950> not<00:02:40.980> meant<00:02:41.640> or

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
newer graphics cards are not meant or

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.370 
newer graphics cards are not meant or
built<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.780> render<00:02:43.260> 2d<00:02:43.740> sprites<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.340> 2d

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.180 
built to render 2d sprites and 2d
environments<00:02:46.380> anymore<00:02:46.680> it's<00:02:46.770> actually<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.040> lot

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
environments anymore it's actually a lot

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.400 
environments anymore it's actually a lot
more<00:02:47.340> taxing<00:02:47.880> on<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.060> pc<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.690> then<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.260> would

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
more taxing on the pc and then it would

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.810 
more taxing on the pc and then it would
be<00:02:49.530> if<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.710> was<00:02:49.800> 3d<00:02:50.190> because<00:02:50.490> that's<00:02:50.670> what

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
be if it was 3d because that's what

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.430 
be if it was 3d because that's what
these<00:02:50.910> cards<00:02:51.210> have<00:02:51.330> built<00:02:51.540> around<00:02:51.780> it's<00:02:52.200> funny

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
these cards have built around it's funny

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.900 
these cards have built around it's funny
that<00:02:52.530> these<00:02:52.890> backwards<00:02:53.280> compatibility

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
that these backwards compatibility

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.820 
that these backwards compatibility
things<00:02:54.150> we're<00:02:54.360> even<00:02:54.570> seeing<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:55.320> know<00:02:55.470> that

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
things we're even seeing you know that

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.740 
things we're even seeing you know that
we've<00:02:56.370> been<00:02:56.490> seeing<00:02:56.670> on<00:02:56.790> PC<00:02:57.120> is<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.450> same<00:02:57.630> kind

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
we've been seeing on PC is the same kind

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.210 
we've been seeing on PC is the same kind
of<00:02:57.840> issues<00:02:57.960> we'd<00:02:58.230> see<00:02:58.410> on<00:02:58.560> consoles<00:02:59.100> the

to do backwards compatibility is because

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.470 
to do backwards compatibility is because
we<00:03:02.130> require<00:03:02.400> more<00:03:02.430> work<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:03.060> would<00:03:03.120> hold<00:03:03.330> back

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
we require more work and would hold back
