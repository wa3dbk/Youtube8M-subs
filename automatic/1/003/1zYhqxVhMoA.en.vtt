00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.029 
to the Premier League season too soon
okay<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:24.050> I<00:00:25.050> was<00:00:25.439> saying<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.830> at<00:00:25.980> the

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
okay and I was saying this at the

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.550 
okay and I was saying this at the
beginning<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.609> season<00:00:27.230> not<00:00:28.230> just<00:00:28.289> a

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
beginning of the season not just a

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.099 
beginning of the season not just a
reaction<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.130> our<00:00:29.429> last<00:00:29.670> few<00:00:29.880> matches<00:00:30.109> it's

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
reaction to our last few matches it's

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.569 
reaction to our last few matches it's
the<00:00:31.380> fact<00:00:31.590> that<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.800> think<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.160> we've<00:00:32.369> got<00:00:32.520> a

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
the fact that I think that we've got a

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.639 
the fact that I think that we've got a
team<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.329> particularly<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.840> coach<00:00:34.140> and

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
team and particularly a coach and

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.940 
team and particularly a coach and
manager<00:00:34.800> that's<00:00:35.329> probably<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.660> bit<00:00:37.530> too<00:00:37.559> high

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
manager that's probably a bit too high

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.650 
manager that's probably a bit too high
for<00:00:38.610> what<00:00:38.730> they're<00:00:38.879> capable<00:00:39.030> of

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
for what they're capable of

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.510 
for what they're capable of
now<00:00:40.170> we<00:00:40.230> can't<00:00:40.530> go<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.829> change<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.160> team<00:00:41.370> with

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
now we can't go and change the team with

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.100 
now we can't go and change the team with
this<00:00:41.610> stage<00:00:41.910> but<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.210> do<00:00:42.329> think<00:00:42.719> we've<00:00:42.899> got<00:00:43.020> to

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
this stage but I do think we've got to

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.860 
this stage but I do think we've got to
change<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.469> manager<00:00:43.920> please<00:00:45.320> guy<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.440> town<00:00:46.680> I

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
change the manager please guy in town I

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.810 
change the manager please guy in town I
know<00:00:48.870> you're<00:00:49.140> too<00:00:49.829> serious<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.399> assume<00:00:50.640> you've

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
know you're too serious to assume you've

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.000 
know you're too serious to assume you've
had<00:00:50.940> hard<00:00:51.210> games<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.719> all<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.989> but<00:00:52.199> some

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
had hard games and all that but some

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.490 
had hard games and all that but some
people<00:00:53.510> when<00:00:54.510> they're<00:00:54.629> playing<00:00:54.809> football<00:00:55.079> I'm

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
people when they're playing football I'm

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.950 
people when they're playing football I'm
sure<00:00:55.710> you'd<00:00:55.860> agree<00:00:55.949> can<00:00:56.460> go<00:00:56.610> into<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.960> situation

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
sure you'd agree can go into a situation

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.959 
sure you'd agree can go into a situation
where<00:00:58.440> they<00:00:58.559> can<00:00:58.739> be<00:00:58.859> paying<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.309> league<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.760> too

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
where they can be paying a league is too

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.729 
where they can be paying a league is too
high<00:01:00.180> for<00:01:00.449> them<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.170> think<00:01:01.199> we've<00:01:01.559> got<00:01:01.710> a

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
high for them and I think we've got a

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.100 
high for them and I think we've got a
coach<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.280> manager<00:01:02.670> who<00:01:03.270> hasn't<00:01:03.899> got<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
coach and a manager who hasn't got the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.770 
coach and a manager who hasn't got the
experience<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.680> never<00:01:04.769> will<00:01:05.010> have<00:01:05.250> really<00:01:05.780> to

your players for being a level too high

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.380 
your players for being a level too high
for<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.290> 12<00:01:22.619> months<00:01:23.100> anything<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.000> happens

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
for this 12 months anything that happens

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.999 
for this 12 months anything that happens
then<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.750> 12<00:01:25.049> months<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> bonus<00:01:25.920> surely

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
then this 12 months is a bonus surely

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.620 
then this 12 months is a bonus surely
that's<00:01:29.009> an<00:01:29.189> interesting<00:01:29.970> way<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.090> look<00:01:30.329> at<00:01:30.509> it

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
that's an interesting way to look at it

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.510 
that's an interesting way to look at it
because<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:31.170> haven't<00:01:31.590> got<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.070> Premier

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.890 
because I haven't got to the Premier
League

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
League

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.270 
League
shouldn't<00:01:33.900> we<00:01:34.020> grasp<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.590> with<00:01:34.770> both<00:01:34.979> hands

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
shouldn't we grasp it with both hands

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.980 
shouldn't we grasp it with both hands
and<00:01:35.460> make<00:01:35.549> sure<00:01:35.820> we<00:01:35.970> got<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.299> players<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.900> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
and make sure we got the players and the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.450
