tonight<00:02:03.289> absolutely<00:02:04.289> absolutely<00:02:06.860> none<00:02:07.860> do

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
tonight absolutely absolutely none do

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.979 
tonight absolutely absolutely none do
you<00:02:08.039> feel<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.399> ingesting<00:02:08.819> tons<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.360> milk

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
you feel that ingesting tons of milk

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.570 
you feel that ingesting tons of milk
before<00:02:10.200> hand<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.739> better<00:02:10.979> strategy<00:02:11.280> than

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
before hand is a better strategy than

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.059 
before hand is a better strategy than
other<00:02:11.880> previous<00:02:12.300> strategies<00:02:12.890> through<00:02:13.890> over

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
other previous strategies through over

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.430 
other previous strategies through over
the<00:02:14.100> years<00:02:14.660> well<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.690> feel<00:02:16.019> it's<00:02:16.170> one<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.349> the

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
the years well I feel it's one of the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.309 
the years well I feel it's one of the
best<00:02:16.650> strategies<00:02:17.370> because<00:02:18.050> then<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.170> can

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
best strategies because then you can

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.840 
best strategies because then you can
sink<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.769> the<00:02:19.860> bottom<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.370> lake<00:02:20.550> if<00:02:20.760> you

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
sink to the bottom of the lake if you

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.610 
sink to the bottom of the lake if you
get<00:02:20.970> enough<00:02:21.239> milk<00:02:21.510> in<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.470> can

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
get enough milk in you and you can

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.789 
get enough milk in you and you can
really<00:02:22.890> start<00:02:23.180> eating<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.959> mounds<00:02:25.410> of<00:02:25.500> duck

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
crap that are allegedly at the bottom of

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.720
