00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.630 
that's what this kind of does and you
can<00:02:43.870> even<00:02:44.019> take<00:02:44.290> some<00:02:44.500> put<00:02:44.769> it<00:02:44.860> just<00:02:45.010> above<00:02:45.400> the

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
can even take some put it just above the

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.850 
can even take some put it just above the
eyebrow<00:02:46.000> right<00:02:46.269> here<00:02:46.600> too<00:02:46.870> and<00:02:47.410> it<00:02:47.560> does<00:02:47.709> the

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
eyebrow right here too and it does the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.270 
eyebrow right here too and it does the
same<00:02:48.040> thing<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:49.510> gives<00:02:49.750> an<00:02:50.019> even<00:02:50.380> a<00:02:50.560> little<00:02:51.010> bit

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
same thing it gives an even a little bit

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.390 
same thing it gives an even a little bit
more<00:02:51.519> of<00:02:51.670> a<00:02:51.790> lift<00:02:52.000> it's<00:02:52.989> really<00:02:53.260> subtle<00:02:53.500> then

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
more of a lift it's really subtle then

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.690 
more of a lift it's really subtle then
I'm<00:02:54.519> going<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:54.820> take<00:02:55.060> this<00:02:55.330> little<00:02:56.140> pencil

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
I'm going to take this little pencil

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.509 
I'm going to take this little pencil
crease<00:02:57.700> brush<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:58.590> I'm<00:02:59.590> going<00:02:59.739> to<00:02:59.860> take<00:03:00.130> that

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
crease brush and I'm going to take that

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.199 
crease brush and I'm going to take that
kind<00:03:00.940> of<00:03:01.090> medium<00:03:01.739> light<00:03:02.739> brownish<00:03:03.250> color<00:03:03.940> it's

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
kind of medium light brownish color it's

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.960 
kind of medium light brownish color it's
perfect<00:03:04.570> for<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:04.810> crease<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:05.530> this<00:03:06.430> one<00:03:06.700> it

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
perfect for the crease and this one it

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.880 
perfect for the crease and this one it
technically<00:03:07.480> it<00:03:07.630> has<00:03:07.660> some<00:03:08.019> sparkle<00:03:08.620> in<00:03:08.769> it

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
technically it has some sparkle in it

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.290 
technically it has some sparkle in it
but<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.100> don't<00:03:09.220> really<00:03:09.340> see<00:03:09.850> it<00:03:10.000> that<00:03:10.150> much

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
but you don't really see it that much

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.750 
but you don't really see it that much
when<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:10.630> applies<00:03:11.310> we're<00:03:12.310> just<00:03:12.430> going<00:03:12.550> to<00:03:12.610> put

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
when it applies we're just going to put

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.080 
when it applies we're just going to put
this<00:03:12.910> all<00:03:13.120> right<00:03:13.450> into<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:14.320> crease<00:03:14.739> area<00:03:15.130> and

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
this all right into the crease area and

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.940 
this all right into the crease area and
just<00:03:16.140> kind<00:03:17.140> of<00:03:17.200> blend<00:03:17.470> it<00:03:17.620> up

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
just kind of blend it up

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.259 
just kind of blend it up
onto<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.370> brow<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:21.220> this<00:03:21.459> is<00:03:21.640> going<00:03:21.970> to

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
onto the brow and this is going to

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:42.970 
onto the brow and this is going to
create<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:22.900> shape<00:03:23.170> of<00:03:23.519> yeah

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.149 

so<00:03:43.980> now<00:03:44.129> that<00:03:44.280> we<00:03:44.430> have<00:03:44.640> kind<00:03:44.939> of<00:03:45.060> our<00:03:45.329> eye

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 
so now that we have kind of our eye

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.149 
so now that we have kind of our eye
shape<00:03:47.180> this<00:03:48.180> is<00:03:48.390> this<00:03:48.599> like<00:03:48.900> your<00:03:49.140> basic<00:03:49.379> look

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
shape this is this like your basic look

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.130 
shape this is this like your basic look
what<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:50.819> also<00:03:51.060> do<00:03:51.390> is<00:03:51.569> take<00:03:51.810> some<00:03:51.840> of<00:03:52.109> that

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
what I also do is take some of that

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.679 
what I also do is take some of that
medium<00:03:52.590> color<00:03:52.920> and<00:03:53.879> bring<00:03:54.540> it<00:03:54.659> down

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:54.689 
medium color and bring it down

00:03:54.689 --> 00:04:05.119 
medium color and bring it down
underneath<00:03:55.530> here<00:04:01.400> and<00:04:03.230> that<00:04:04.230> also<00:04:04.560> helps<00:04:04.980> to

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
underneath here and that also helps to

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.309 
underneath here and that also helps to
shape<00:04:05.280> your<00:04:05.519> eyes<00:04:05.670> then<00:04:06.540> you<00:04:06.720> just<00:04:06.900> want<00:04:07.109> to<00:04:07.170> do

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.170 
transition from my daytime look to my

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.690 
transition from my daytime look to my
nighttime<00:05:37.380> look<00:05:37.710> was<00:05:37.860> add<00:05:38.070> some<00:05:38.310> of<00:05:38.370> that<00:05:38.400> dark

one<00:05:43.560> of<00:05:43.800> many<00:05:44.220> demonstrations<00:05:45.090> I'm<00:05:45.270> gonna

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390 
one of many demonstrations I'm gonna

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
that you can do with just this quad

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.780
