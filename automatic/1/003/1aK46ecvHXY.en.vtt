00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.320 
capable because an apple is it can't
yeah<00:05:13.919> apple<00:05:14.370> doesn't<00:05:14.490> give<00:05:14.729> you<00:05:14.880> access<00:05:15.060> to

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
yeah apple doesn't give you access to

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.700 
yeah apple doesn't give you access to
all<00:05:15.449> this<00:05:15.599> stuff<00:05:15.780> means<00:05:15.870> certainly<00:05:16.259> the<00:05:16.349> apple

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
all this stuff means certainly the apple

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.830 
all this stuff means certainly the apple
watch<00:05:16.830> will<00:05:16.889> always<00:05:17.340> be<00:05:17.520> the<00:05:17.669> most<00:05:18.539> capable

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
watch will always be the most capable

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.659 
watch will always be the most capable
choice<00:05:19.380> for<00:05:19.650> somebody<00:05:19.949> wearing<00:05:20.130> using<00:05:20.580> an

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
choice for somebody wearing using an

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.409 
choice for somebody wearing using an
iphone<00:05:21.110> um<00:05:22.110> oh<00:05:22.680> yeah<00:05:23.490> I<00:05:23.970> think<00:05:24.060> they're<00:05:24.300> both

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
iphone um oh yeah I think they're both

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.210 
iphone um oh yeah I think they're both
good<00:05:24.630> I<00:05:24.659> think<00:05:24.810> smart<00:05:25.620> watches<00:05:25.830> are<00:05:26.130> of

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
good I think smart watches are of

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.820 
good I think smart watches are of
limited<00:05:26.400> utility<00:05:26.729> and<00:05:27.300> nobody<00:05:28.110> should<00:05:28.319> nobody

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
limited utility and nobody should nobody

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.170 
limited utility and nobody should nobody
should<00:05:29.009> think<00:05:29.460> of<00:05:29.580> a<00:05:29.669> smart<00:05:29.969> watches

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
should think of a smart watches

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.159 
should think of a smart watches
something<00:05:30.840> that<00:05:31.789> they<00:05:32.789> have<00:05:33.000> to<00:05:33.210> have<00:05:33.389> it

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
something that they have to have it

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.320 
something that they have to have it
doesn't<00:05:34.650> do<00:05:34.770> more<00:05:35.070> than<00:05:35.280> the<00:05:35.430> phone<00:05:35.639> does<00:05:35.940> well

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
doesn't do more than the phone does well

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.610 
doesn't do more than the phone does well
I<00:05:36.360> guess<00:05:36.599> it<00:05:36.750> does<00:05:36.930> if<00:05:36.960> you<00:05:37.229> talk<00:05:37.590> about

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
I guess it does if you talk about

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.200 
I guess it does if you talk about
setting<00:05:38.070> heartbeats<00:05:38.490> I<00:05:38.580> can't<00:05:38.820> do<00:05:38.940> that<00:05:39.060> with

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
setting heartbeats I can't do that with

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.450 
setting heartbeats I can't do that with
a<00:05:39.240> phone<00:05:39.479> but<00:05:40.289> and<00:05:40.500> you<00:05:40.680> know<00:05:40.800> having<00:05:41.099> sent
