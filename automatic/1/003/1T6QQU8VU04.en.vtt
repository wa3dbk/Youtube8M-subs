00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello everybody welcome 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.080
 hair and will have area and it is in this climate to have 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.730
 or be talking to you like this 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.340
 Thinking what I 'm talking about, then it's 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.070
 one more populi thing hit-ball game 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.500
 fast then berg fmi 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:32.759
 So we'll have a review of here. 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:35.489
 I'll go right after the line is here. 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.340
 would a 2011 book written by the author 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.460
 pekerman and was launched in Brazil in 2012 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.800
 Guttemberg the publisher and tell 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.750
 about a boy named wii u 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.550
 the book will not give you much context to 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.649
 uncertainty what world he is living 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.329
 so it's happening in a matter of 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.399
 where the human being advanced 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.770
 technologically any year that is 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.129
 if it happens then what gives the 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.190
 to understand that you are afraid of something is 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.780
 a weakness you feel afraid of something is 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.100
 seen with an illness mainly 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.369
 When you're afraid of something. 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.290
 deeply then he saw is a boy who 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.390
 in fear that you will only know 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.570
 much further ahead so it goes 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.130
 take up psychology with the doctor to 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.130
 try to solve this problem that he 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.439
 has his parents snow there he is there 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.180
 years of therapy and adopt speech 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.700
 Look, I'm trying to help but you. 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.159
 it's not very dear sergio to be helped 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.549
 And this is why there is a place that if you 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.530
 for you to be born healed and together with him and 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.780
 six other people, too. 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.369
 patients at that time who also have 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.240
 your specific fears 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.130
 This place is a strong human being. 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.159
 that's the place the book is called an attack 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.990
 He's because he's strong and he makes sense. 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.450
 he only when I was in this book 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.509
 was very lost because he changes a 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.189
 little of formatting in this some issues 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.100
 It starts as if it were an interview. 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.710
 him with the psychologist and then tied up 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.170
 direct by him and he tells how he has 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.930
 an obsession and listen to things so he 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.850
 even steals the audio files from the 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.920
 sessions this time 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:15.950
 it even from other patients 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.950
 practice coming to not the one who is uncle 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:23.070
 will you cut my eyes on the danilo is the 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.200
 that it is not that he wants to invade the 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.600
 privacy of others but so does the fact 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.430
 he could hear gives more security to 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.980
 it mainly because parents also 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.140
 agreed to evaluate this strong dem- 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.480
 everything else so he tactical afraid of 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.530
 go and he does not know he will see there but 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.180
 he knows he's going to be with those 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.910
 other six people then why not 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.040
 I know these six other people. 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.080
 listening to their actions and starting from the 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.090
 when they are already there 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.250
 know who's who there while the others 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.920
 have no idea who's hot 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.410
 with whom you will all know hi 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.140
 pleasure'm younger brother and know 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.420
 who are each of these people and more 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.490
 that he knows what the fear of each 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.920
 one of them and this is something that they just 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.450
 they will share with each other 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.550
 Basto did when you had confidence 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.470
 more leave 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.900
 he said hi, how are you my name is gabriel 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.000
 I'm afraid spiders do not give 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.550
 especially in the world where the fact 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.260
 you have a fear a phobia is seen with 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.420
 a great weakness as the disease then 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.170
 takes time to build this 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.090
 confidence 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.390
 but what happens then they do not seem 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.480
 strong nor law will have this whole session 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.950
 from therapies to this curious tell 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.980
 You, because I do not want history or 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.740
 nothing but the development of the book 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.660
 but I can tell you are 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.480
 everything was seen from the point of view of the 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.950
 and he has a certain way of knowing 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.160
 What is happening to others? 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.620
 understood the webb spanner flight because there 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.480
 I do not know what I can tell you 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.590
 he finds a room where he can 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.290
 watch what others are doing 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.510
 so he has that vision then ok 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.030
 this sight of it we are knowing 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:04.050
 what happened in the strong sabino type 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.330
 The curia works but it has one behind it. 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.520
 I can not tell you what the book was. 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.010
 well, you get curious about it 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.300
 of how people are being cured 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.120
 what's happening hit in 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.040
 Any one secret strong well and then you 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.080
 here it reads on the front cover 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.639
 we are seven strangers no one can 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.129
 we 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.080
 lie everybody knows where there are 6 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:26.300
 thinks it will work but will be 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.840
 only if it is true or this place and not 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.969
 destroy but so year in an adversary 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.219
 This is all wrong here. 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:36.409
 is getting dangerous and the book works 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:38.060
 I will not deny this is a man 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:40.159
 known to us is developing a lot 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.719
 cool the characters as long as they do not 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:44.330
 can establish an affinity with 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:46.400
 the characters you want to know that 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.620
 any fear of each other that was the 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.419
 space of that culture that the doctors are 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.189
 who work there and what is the big 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:55.009
 secret of the fort and if you reach the final 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:57.139
 and final does not she know that ending that 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.659
 spoils the book done happened because 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.699
 in people until it will seem like 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:03.889
 of people who do not but is something that 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:05.779
 I was so out of all that you are 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.610
 I am hoping that I wanted it to brown 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:09.560
 Do you know that something will come? 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.210
 to be something fantastic not here was something 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.169
 who showed he was waiting but was 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.479
 Far beyond 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:18.050
 then the book shows that 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:20.360
 Do you hit what came out or what? 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.039
 hence our line of explanation and not 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.740
 start so I was convinced that the 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:27.589
 I thought it was legal writing. 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.539
 develop well and leave at the end 

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:31.610
 and went with a guillotine had passed 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:34.189
 in my first version understood that 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.969
 The bet is worth it. 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:41.120
 and the book has been around other 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:42.649
 eight characters - and none of them are 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.589
 very well explored still has a 

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:48.289
 attempt a novel but this is not 

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:50.449
 nothing that will keep you focused during the 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.639
 book because it 's shallow 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:53.870
 the actor takes even more the part of trying 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.909
 become members 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.770
 the edition they did here in Brazil 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:06:00.740
 it was very cute this cover that 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.370
 It turns out it 's really cool and the 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:07.550
 book or the beginning of each chapter 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:11.300
 has iii brings us actions and colors 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:13.430
 different actions including illustrate that 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.419
 It's the fear of each one so I'm going to show 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.949
 for you 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:18.110
 and if you are in a story book 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:20.300
 cool your turn do not look forward 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:24.439
 because 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:28.399
 and that's what it 's like to be honest after 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:31.790
 the book ends you still do is 111 per 

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:34.250
 pronounced in the proceedings 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:37.040
 yes we explain a little more than 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.320
 It was that end then to know if you have 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.350
 one end and then you need to grow 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.630
 70 pages to try to justify why 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.490
 The end of that way you know of 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.740
 something wrong then author should 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.560
 have thought about it since Carlos and 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.180
 deserves a little research heard 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.370
 I confess, but the way you 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.800
 write recent so this 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.330
 dichotomy another victory of this book was 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.270
 that some situations that have here 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:04.280
 within were reference to 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.800
 you understand some things that he 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.240
 explains then he has some new ones as 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.130
 was that business of brochures of 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.190
 street delivery building 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.930
 like that, so you have a sense of 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.240
 to be able to speak he was in the room such 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.090
 health is exactly in the 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.920
 this aid to your imagination 

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:24.260
 including some some accoutrements that 

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.210
 he says are drawn again 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.760
 so it's cool for you to get 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:30.440
 into this universe in general of that 

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.880
 I even managed to have a lot of fun 

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.010
 more that this end has been 

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.050
 extremely disappointing and wanting 

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:38.530
 do the following route 3 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:41.780
 polymers as a recommendation says that the 

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:44.030
 read and prepare for the end hope 

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.700
 What do you like the most absurd thing? 

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:48.620
 so absolutely absurd for you 

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.030
 really like this book so 

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.260
 connected to the campaign so far has to 

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.940
 do one more more dynamic thing 

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.980
 decoration in tones and sounds in two pits 

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:57.380
 like I hope you enjoyed and 

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.090
 You liked it, if you explain it, I liked it.
