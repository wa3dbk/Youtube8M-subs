00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 good runners welcome to the new 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.790
 video of the barcelona program and today we are going 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.500
 to talk about an emblem model of asics 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.349
 good one of the two emblem models already 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.690
 six in this case it's not the nimbus and not the 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.389
 callan no anniversary number 20 in 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.880
 model number 20 you want to call 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.070
 difference from the 2002 people the shut up does not 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.109
 so it includes some remarkable changes 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.850
 that we can differentiate with your 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.470
 predecessor in this case the race 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.699
 number 19 we are going to talk about those 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.439
 changes and what effects it may have 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.240
 during our trainings we go 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.710
 there a change that the 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.540
 string 20 that can not be seen to simple 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.250
 view is that the introduction about 15 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.750
 grams of weight is a curious change since 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.239
 that anyone would say that the shoe has 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.030
 caught weight because it has increased the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.550
 amount and width of the wright flow 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.530
 what is this line Maria that goes all over 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.480
 the tapatÃ­a is one of the three 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.360
 amortizations together with polyurethane and 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.129
 gel that includes channel 20 the last 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.350
 remarkable change that we can get to the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.539
 hip a number 20 is concentrated the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.760
 skin plate that is in the metatarsals 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.590
 if we remember in the cane of the number 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.480
 19 which was divided into three 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.330
 plates and only one of it 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.770
 went through the metatarsals of the foot I think 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.600
 which is a good change since the great 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.909
 part of the weight that we apply once 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.190
 we drive is precisely the metatarsal 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.350
 to drive more comfortably in each 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.729
 tread to summarize the cane follows us 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.130
 being a shoe to hold 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.310
 great weights for girls over 60 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.229
 kilos for guys over 80 still has 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.240
 a good control of pronation follows 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.500
 being the most comfortable shoes that 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.729
 there is in the market because of the great 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.590
 amount of exercise of the 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.570
 damping and has achieved what 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.180
 You were once set foot inside 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.950
 the shoe but that's all for today 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.750
