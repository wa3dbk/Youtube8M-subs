00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:07.730
 calculate the domain of the function fx 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:11.340
 x 2 from x square plus x 2 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.920
 fx is its great real function of variable 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.820
 real that is given by the expression that 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.820
 we have here 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.279
 then the domain of f is the maximum 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.950
 subset of r where said expression 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.740
 it makes sense how this expression is a 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.840
 quotient of polynomials 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.989
 a fraction always makes sense 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.989
 except when the denominator is canceled 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.230
 therefore the domain of f 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:47.040
 will be r - the whole 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.500
 that makes the denominator of this 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.920
 function to replace these values ​​those of 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.710
 0 then we take the denominator x 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.200
 square so who else 2 and let's see 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.030
 how much this is worth 0 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.370
 this is a second degree equation what 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.870
 we solve 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:14.160
 by the formula of the equation 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:17.880
 of second grade that is less efficient 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:21.630
 of the x1 then it will be minus one plus minus 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.260
 the square root must square one at 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.570
 square minus 4 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.630
 what is the coefficient of the x to the 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.840
 square which is one per c which is the 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.490
 independent term that is two 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.930
 matches of 2 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:43.490
 this is what we have left 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:46.700
 minus one plus minus the square root of 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:50.510
 14 which is one minus four by one per 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.730
 two that is eight matches and this is less 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:59.510
 one 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:02:02.440
 plus minus 3 square of 187 match of 2 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.660
 as we know there is no number 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.050
 wait to square it up do not be 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.750
 a negative number then you have to 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.420
 this does not belong therefore not 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.010
 there are values ​​that annul to x squares 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.010
 more x + 2 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:25.830
 well the domain of fr - the set of 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:28.260
 values ​​that cancel x + x + 2 there is no 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:33.810
 no value that cancels ax squared more 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:37.260
 x + 2 or it would be r - the vacuum and r if it 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.720
 we remove nothing remains r therefore the 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.569
 domain of the function that they give us x 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.690
 minus two matches x square plus x + 2 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.650
 is the set of all the numbers 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.650
 real
