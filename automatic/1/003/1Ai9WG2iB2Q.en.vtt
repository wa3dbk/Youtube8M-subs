00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
first with a smaller brush because I

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.580 
first with a smaller brush because I
feel<00:03:20.670> like<00:03:20.820> it's<00:03:21.000> much<00:03:21.239> easier<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.170> it<00:03:22.290> helps

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
feel like it's much easier and it helps

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.949 
feel like it's much easier and it helps
me<00:03:22.800> keep<00:03:23.190> control<00:03:23.670> of<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:24.120> color<00:03:24.390> so<00:03:24.690> I<00:03:24.720> don't

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
me keep control of the color so I don't

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.900 
me keep control of the color so I don't
look<00:03:25.050> like<00:03:25.230> a<00:03:25.260> raccoon<00:03:25.500> up<00:03:25.890> in<00:03:26.010> here<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:26.610> then

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
look like a raccoon up in here and then

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.030 
look like a raccoon up in here and then

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.540 
blended out before I add any more just
to<00:03:42.750> make<00:03:42.810> sure<00:03:42.930> we<00:03:43.320> are<00:03:43.470> keeping<00:03:43.680> control<00:03:44.250> of

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
to make sure we are keeping control of

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.970 
to make sure we are keeping control of
these<00:03:44.670> darker<00:03:45.090> colors<00:03:45.510> it<00:03:45.810> is<00:03:45.989> way<00:03:46.440> too<00:03:46.500> easy<00:03:46.830> I

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.890 
back in and freshen up that Unicorn
color<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:02.610> get<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:02.910> stronger<00:04:03.269> pigment<00:04:03.690> again

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
color and get the stronger pigment again

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.750

because<00:04:04.230> sometimes<00:04:04.620> when<00:04:04.830> I<00:04:04.860> am<00:04:05.070> lending<00:04:05.340> it

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
because sometimes when I am lending it

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.559 
because sometimes when I am lending it
will<00:04:05.850> kind<00:04:06.060> of<00:04:06.120> take<00:04:06.299> away<00:04:06.329> from<00:04:06.989> that

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
will kind of take away from that

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.119 
will kind of take away from that
kourin<00:04:07.930> color<00:04:08.109> since<00:04:08.409> it<00:04:08.499> is<00:04:08.650> a<00:04:08.680> lighter<00:04:09.040> color

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:09.129
