00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
for the eyes later but the nostrils look

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.950 
for the eyes later but the nostrils look
better<00:02:02.040> before<00:02:02.940> it<00:02:03.240> just<00:02:03.450> kind<00:02:03.690> of<00:02:03.750> looked

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
better before it just kind of looked

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.460 
better before it just kind of looked
like<00:02:04.050> nose<00:02:05.040> like<00:02:05.520> moving<00:02:06.060> into<00:02:06.360> his<00:02:06.840> ears<00:02:07.170> but

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
like nose like moving into his ears but

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.040 
like nose like moving into his ears but
I<00:02:07.770> like<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.369> better

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
I like this better

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.540

okay<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.920> that's<00:02:11.100> his<00:02:11.430> arm<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:12.840> then<00:02:13.830> here<00:02:14.070> is

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
okay so that's his arm and then here is

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.160 
okay so that's his arm and then here is
his<00:02:14.790> other<00:02:14.970> arm<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.390> think<00:02:15.630> I'm<00:02:15.720> going<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.989> just

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
his other arm I think I'm going to just

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.350 
his other arm I think I'm going to just
make<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:16.530> like<00:02:16.739> he's<00:02:17.250> holding<00:02:17.700> he<00:02:17.940> is<00:02:18.090> holding

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
make it like he's holding he is holding

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.479 
make it like he's holding he is holding
up<00:02:18.570> his<00:02:18.690> arms<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.620> doesn't<00:02:19.950> not<00:02:20.190> look

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
up his arms so that it doesn't not look

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.449 
up his arms so that it doesn't not look
like<00:02:20.640> he<00:02:20.760> just<00:02:20.790> has<00:02:21.060> this<00:02:21.180> big<00:02:21.450> circle<00:02:21.660> body

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459
