00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
have to do physical damage so that's

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.640 
have to do physical damage so that's
where<00:02:31.950> classes<00:02:32.459> that<00:02:33.239> are<00:02:33.360> cast<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.900> casters

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
where classes that are cast the casters

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.150 
where classes that are cast the casters
have<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.760> disadvantage<00:02:36.510> because<00:02:36.780> they<00:02:37.160> really

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
have a disadvantage because they really

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.949 
have a disadvantage because they really
need<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.640> take<00:02:38.790> melee<00:02:40.130> and<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:41.580> you<00:02:42.480> really

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
need to take melee and so you really

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.990 
need to take melee and so you really
need<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.680> be<00:02:43.769> able<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:43.920> do<00:02:44.040> physical<00:02:44.430> damage<00:02:44.459> in

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
need to be able to do physical damage in

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.240 
need to be able to do physical damage in
the<00:02:45.090> zone<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:46.590> can<00:02:46.709> always<00:02:46.830> bring<00:02:47.130> in

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
the zone and you can always bring in

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.530 
the zone and you can always bring in
someone<00:02:47.519> else<00:02:47.730> so<00:02:47.940> that<00:02:47.970> can<00:02:48.269> do<00:02:48.390> that

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
someone else so that can do that

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.970 
someone else so that can do that
physical<00:02:48.870> damage<00:02:49.200> if<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:49.470> don't<00:02:49.650> want<00:02:49.769> if<00:02:49.860> you

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
physical damage if you don't want if you

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.830 
physical damage if you don't want if you
aren't<00:02:50.190> able<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.640> do<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:50.940> melee<00:02:51.269> damage<00:02:51.450> but

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
aren't able to do that melee damage but

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.710 
aren't able to do that melee damage but
we'll<00:02:52.739> see<00:02:52.980> how<00:02:53.010> easy<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:53.880> is<00:02:54.000> for<00:02:54.030> me<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.450> do<00:02:54.600> it

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
we'll see how easy it is for me to do it

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:04.360 
we'll see how easy it is for me to do it
as<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:55.110> death<00:02:55.319> knight

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.470 

as<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:05.459> can<00:03:05.550> see<00:03:05.700> he's<00:03:05.819> beginning<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.180> freeze

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
as you can see he's beginning to freeze

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.449 
as you can see he's beginning to freeze
up<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:06.870> now<00:03:07.020> he's<00:03:07.260> frozen<00:03:07.530> solid<00:03:07.740> and<00:03:08.190> now<00:03:08.400> is

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
up and now he's frozen solid and now is

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.370 
up and now he's frozen solid and now is
where<00:03:08.670> I<00:03:08.700> pretty<00:03:09.000> much<00:03:09.150> add<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.990> DPS<00:03:10.350> and

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
where I pretty much add the DPS and

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:25.910 
where I pretty much add the DPS and
hopefully<00:03:10.980> crack<00:03:11.340> them<00:03:11.459> soon<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.800> looks

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
hopefully crack them soon and it looks

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.080 
hopefully crack them soon and it looks
like<00:03:25.980> he's<00:03:26.130> ready<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.370> shatter<00:03:26.640> so<00:03:26.850> he<00:03:26.910> should

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
like he's ready to shatter so he should

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:34.460 
like he's ready to shatter so he should
be<00:03:27.120> breaking<00:03:27.330> soon

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.020 

and<00:03:34.980> this<00:03:35.130> is<00:03:35.220> what<00:03:35.310> happens<00:03:35.580> when<00:03:35.700> he<00:03:35.790> breaks

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
and this is what happens when he breaks

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.850 
and this is what happens when he breaks
he<00:03:36.420> will<00:03:36.570> go<00:03:36.720> flying<00:03:36.990> in<00:03:37.200> two<00:03:37.320> different<00:03:37.470> ads

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
he will go flying in two different ads

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:50.210 
he will go flying in two different ads
which<00:03:38.160> need<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:38.400> be<00:03:38.490> killed<00:03:48.500> as<00:03:49.500> you<00:03:49.920> can<00:03:50.010> see

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
which need to be killed as you can see

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.820 
which need to be killed as you can see

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
the more damn war get to him the more

00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:25.240 
the more damn war get to him the more
