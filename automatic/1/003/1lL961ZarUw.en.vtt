own and you'll get a very smooth surface

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.910 
own and you'll get a very smooth surface
when<00:01:48.520> it<00:01:48.640> dries<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:50.560> that's<00:01:50.740> it<00:01:50.979> and<00:01:52.830> for<00:01:53.830> the

leve<00:01:54.130> island<00:01:54.640> I<00:01:54.820> would<00:01:54.970> recommend<00:01:55.890> another

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
leve island I would recommend another

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.840 
leve island I would recommend another
four<00:01:57.520> coats<00:01:58.210> applied<00:01:58.810> just<00:01:59.110> like<00:01:59.259> this<00:01:59.649> to<00:02:00.640> get

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
four coats applied just like this to get

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.060 
four coats applied just like this to get
the<00:02:01.390> thickness<00:02:01.960> that<00:02:02.170> I<00:02:02.409> think<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:02.860> levee

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
the thickness that I think the levee

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.940 
the thickness that I think the levee
island<00:02:03.459> really<00:02:03.700> needs
