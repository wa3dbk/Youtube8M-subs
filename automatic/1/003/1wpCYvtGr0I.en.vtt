00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
chair I think that it does motivate some

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.410 
chair I think that it does motivate some
people<00:02:17.710> because<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.370> lot<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:18.820> people<00:02:18.910> no<00:02:19.300> matter

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
people because a lot of people no matter

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.150 
people because a lot of people no matter
how<00:02:19.630> professional<00:02:20.200> they<00:02:20.320> are<00:02:20.470> no<00:02:20.650> matter<00:02:20.830> how

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
how professional they are no matter how

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.430 
how professional they are no matter how
high<00:02:21.580> level<00:02:21.970> they<00:02:22.090> are<00:02:22.240> they<00:02:22.840> get<00:02:22.990> affected<00:02:23.350> by

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
high level they are they get affected by

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.280 
high level they are they get affected by
their<00:02:23.590> emotions<00:02:24.070> and<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:25.330> don't<00:02:25.870> get<00:02:26.020> me<00:02:26.140> wrong

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
their emotions and I don't get me wrong

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.400 
their emotions and I don't get me wrong
i<00:02:26.470> find<00:02:26.830> it<00:02:26.980> unacceptable<00:02:27.370> if<00:02:28.360> it<00:02:28.750> was<00:02:28.960> me<00:02:29.170> I

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
i find it unacceptable if it was me I

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.980 
i find it unacceptable if it was me I
wouldn't<00:02:30.100> affect<00:02:30.910> me<00:02:31.090> one<00:02:31.390> bit<00:02:31.690> because<00:02:31.720> I

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
wouldn't affect me one bit because I

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.730 
wouldn't affect me one bit because I
want<00:02:32.320> to<00:02:32.410> win<00:02:32.560> so<00:02:32.590> much<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:34.810> what<00:02:35.080> somebody

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
want to win so much that what somebody

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.820 
want to win so much that what somebody
else<00:02:35.800> says<00:02:36.130> is<00:02:36.580> entirely<00:02:37.330> irrelevant<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:38.650> my

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
else says is entirely irrelevant to my

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.520 
else says is entirely irrelevant to my
burning<00:02:39.430> passion<00:02:40.150> of<00:02:40.270> win<00:02:40.450> it<00:02:40.570> okay<00:02:41.260> i<00:02:41.410> know

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
burning passion of win it okay i know

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
burning passion of win it okay i know

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
because i play on the playground on the

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.660 
because i play on the playground on the
streets<00:02:46.420> of<00:02:47.460> west<00:02:48.460> los<00:02:48.700> angeles<00:02:50.430> but<00:02:51.430> Susan

streets of west los angeles but Susan

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.640 
streets of west los angeles but Susan
that's<00:02:52.090> how<00:02:52.240> I<00:02:52.270> compete<00:02:52.750> I<00:02:52.780> mean<00:02:53.110> it<00:02:53.290> might<00:02:53.500> be

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
that's how I compete I mean it might be

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.920 
that's how I compete I mean it might be
on<00:02:53.740> a<00:02:53.770> clown<00:02:54.070> level<00:02:54.460> right<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:55.270> I<00:02:55.360> think<00:02:55.390> at

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
on a clown level right and I think at

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.630 
on a clown level right and I think at
least<00:02:56.260> I<00:02:56.440> have<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.710> expectation<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:57.370> that's

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
least I have the expectation that that's

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.150 
least I have the expectation that that's
how<00:02:57.790> professional<00:02:58.570> athletes<00:02:58.930> should<00:02:58.990> be<00:02:59.920> but

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
how professional athletes should be but

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.920 
how professional athletes should be but
I<00:03:00.310> think<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.580> lot<00:03:00.730> of<00:03:00.760> times<00:03:01.030> they're<00:03:01.240> not<00:03:01.420> like

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
I think a lot of times they're not like

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.020 
I think a lot of times they're not like
they're<00:03:02.200> some<00:03:02.740> more<00:03:02.980> lackadaisical<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:03.880> then

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
they're some more lackadaisical and then

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.550 
they're some more lackadaisical and then
you<00:03:04.120> need<00:03:04.270> to<00:03:04.420> you<00:03:04.960> know<00:03:05.050> light<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.290> fire

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
you need to you know light a fire

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.750 
you need to you know light a fire
underneath<00:03:05.860> them<00:03:06.160> that's<00:03:06.400> why<00:03:06.550> those

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
underneath them that's why those

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.150 
underneath them that's why those
speeches<00:03:07.600> by<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:07.930> coaches<00:03:08.320> sometimes<00:03:08.680> work<00:03:08.920> I

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
speeches by the coaches sometimes work I

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.840 
speeches by the coaches sometimes work I
mean<00:03:09.640> where<00:03:09.940> in<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.180> world<00:03:10.570> is<00:03:10.930> Rashard<00:03:11.440> Lewis

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
mean where in the world is Rashard Lewis

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.820 
mean where in the world is Rashard Lewis
so<00:03:12.850> maybe<00:03:13.420> somebody<00:03:13.780> needs<00:03:14.140> to<00:03:14.230> motivate<00:03:14.680> his

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
so maybe somebody needs to motivate his

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.370 
so maybe somebody needs to motivate his
ass<00:03:15.010> right<00:03:15.580> so<00:03:16.390> let's<00:03:16.630> see<00:03:16.750> if<00:03:16.810> they<00:03:16.960> do<00:03:17.020> better

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
ass right so let's see if they do better

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.100 
ass right so let's see if they do better
but<00:03:17.790> my<00:03:18.790> guess<00:03:18.850> is<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.390> Celtics<00:03:19.750> will<00:03:19.900> roll

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
but my guess is the Celtics will roll

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.590 
but my guess is the Celtics will roll
over<00:03:20.140> them
