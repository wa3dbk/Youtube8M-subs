00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
plan for this program let's see if she

plan for this program let's see if she
could<00:00:17.670> write<00:00:17.910> more<00:00:18.150> skating<00:00:18.539> history<00:00:21.800> she's

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
could write more skating history she's

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:40.500 
could write more skating history she's
currently<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.430> fourth<00:00:23.760> flights

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.119 

why<00:00:41.510> couldn't<00:00:42.079> oh<00:00:42.260> my<00:00:42.469> goodness

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
why couldn't oh my goodness

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:44.619 
why couldn't oh my goodness
I'm<00:00:43.219> so<00:00:43.430> excited<00:00:43.820> that<00:00:43.969> she's<00:00:44.059> trip<00:00:44.420> I

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
I'm so excited that she's trip I

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.869 
I'm so excited that she's trip I
couldn't<00:00:45.289> tell<00:00:45.469> whether<00:00:45.739> she<00:00:46.039> hit<00:00:46.280> her<00:00:46.339> toe<00:00:46.640> on

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
couldn't tell whether she hit her toe on

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.220 
couldn't tell whether she hit her toe on
the<00:00:46.910> landing<00:00:47.449> of<00:00:47.570> that<00:00:47.719> or<00:00:47.809> no<00:00:47.870> we're<00:00:48.079> going<00:00:48.170> to

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
the landing of that or no we're going to

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.840 
the landing of that or no we're going to
have<00:00:48.409> to<00:00:48.559> wait<00:00:48.710> for<00:00:48.949> an<00:00:49.010> instant<00:00:49.370> replay<00:00:49.519> or

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
have to wait for an instant replay or

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.780 
have to wait for an instant replay or
verify<00:00:50.300> that

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.520 

and<00:00:57.790> she<00:00:58.000> pulled<00:00:58.300> off<00:00:58.510> that<00:00:58.540> triple<00:00:59.170> action

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
and she pulled off that triple action

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.840 
and she pulled off that triple action
but<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.710> position<00:01:00.130> on<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:00.400> ending<00:01:00.640> wasn't

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
but the position on the ending wasn't

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:40.679 
but the position on the ending wasn't
probably<00:01:01.330> what<00:01:01.480> she<00:01:01.600> hoped<00:01:01.810> for

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.000 

the<00:01:40.749> quality<00:01:41.320> in<00:01:41.499> ER<00:01:41.530> jump<00:01:41.920> that<00:01:42.399> eats

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
the quality in ER jump that eats

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.010 
the quality in ER jump that eats
and<00:01:44.130> Harding<00:01:44.610> app<00:01:44.820> but<00:01:45.420> she<00:01:45.570> certainly<00:01:45.750> has<00:01:45.990> a

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
and Harding app but she certainly has a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.930 
and Harding app but she certainly has a
very<00:01:46.110> tight<00:01:46.680> rotation<00:01:46.890> position<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.820> that's

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
very tight rotation position and that's

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.090 
very tight rotation position and that's
why<00:01:48.090> she's<00:01:48.330> able<00:01:48.660> to<00:01:48.750> pull<00:01:48.960> off<00:01:49.110> four

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
why she's able to pull off four

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:59.950 
why she's able to pull off four
rotations

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:34.180 

you

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.000 

like<00:02:35.060> some<00:02:35.420> of<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.660> men<00:02:35.930> who<00:02:36.170> attempted<00:02:36.470> quads

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
like some of the men who attempted quads

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.800 
like some of the men who attempted quads
here<00:02:37.400> it<00:02:37.550> almost<00:02:37.730> appears<00:02:38.330> as<00:02:38.510> though<00:02:38.660> they

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
here it almost appears as though they

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.290 
here it almost appears as though they
got<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:39.290> excited<00:02:39.500> so<00:02:40.190> hight<00:02:40.610> to<00:02:40.910> attempt<00:02:41.240> that

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
got so excited so hight to attempt that

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.030 
got so excited so hight to attempt that
one<00:02:41.720> jump<00:02:42.050> that<00:02:42.410> they've<00:02:42.530> lost<00:02:42.740> their

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
one jump that they've lost their

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.160 
one jump that they've lost their
concentration<00:02:43.820> to<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.000> balance<00:02:44.420> of

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
concentration to the balance of

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.440 
concentration to the balance of
actually<00:02:46.860> said<00:02:47.070> this<00:02:47.250> morning<00:02:47.550> that<00:02:48.000> she

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
actually said this morning that she

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.510 
actually said this morning that she
wasn't<00:02:48.780> even<00:02:48.870> going<00:02:49.110> for<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.530> tops<00:02:49.770> race<00:02:50.100> she

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
wasn't even going for the tops race she

00:02:50.520 --> 00:03:05.040 
wasn't even going for the tops race she
was<00:02:50.640> going<00:02:50.880> for<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.150> quad

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.890 

in<00:03:05.920> some<00:03:06.220> ways<00:03:06.430> is<00:03:06.700> surprising<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.570> that<00:03:07.690> she

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
in some ways is surprising and that she

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.260 
in some ways is surprising and that she
came<00:03:08.110> in<00:03:08.350> fourth<00:03:08.710> and<00:03:08.950> she<00:03:09.160> did<00:03:09.430> legitimately

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
came in fourth and she did legitimately

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.850 
came in fourth and she did legitimately
have<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.540> chance<00:03:10.870> at<00:03:11.080> have<00:03:11.170> been<00:03:11.350> open

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
have a chance at have been open

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.890 
have a chance at have been open
obviously<00:03:12.820> the<00:03:12.940> quad<00:03:13.210> to<00:03:13.390> her<00:03:13.540> is<00:03:13.690> more

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
obviously the quad to her is more

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.960 
obviously the quad to her is more
important

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.910 

the<00:03:17.330> first<00:03:17.600> woman<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:18.140> complete

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
the first woman to complete

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:34.160 
the first woman to complete
she's<00:03:20.310> lying

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.520 

like<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.830> try<00:03:35.010> those<00:03:35.220> too

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.790 

I've<00:03:39.400> noticed<00:03:39.820> about<00:03:39.970> her<00:03:40.590> operation<00:03:41.590> for

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
I've noticed about her operation for

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.920 
I've noticed about her operation for
these<00:03:41.920> difficult<00:03:42.640> judges<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.300> Menace

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
these difficult judges the Menace

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.340 
these difficult judges the Menace
like<00:03:45.469> she's<00:03:45.650> selling<00:03:45.980> a<00:03:46.069> telly

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
like she's selling a telly

00:03:47.350 --> 00:04:28.340

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.810 

mixed<00:04:29.350> emotions<00:04:29.440> about<00:04:29.830> this<00:04:30.160> program<00:04:30.670> but

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
mixed emotions about this program but

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.350 
mixed emotions about this program but
fire<00:04:31.060> look

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.300
