video<00:00:03.990> for<00:00:04.380> you<00:00:04.589> showing<00:00:05.310> you<00:00:05.460> how<00:00:05.609> to<00:00:05.640> get

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
video for you showing you how to get

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.870 
video for you showing you how to get
into<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.120> secret<00:00:06.480> area<00:00:06.720> in<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.140> black<00:00:07.319> garden

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:07.880 
into a secret area in the black garden

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.060 
into a secret area in the black garden
so<00:00:08.880> if<00:00:09.240> you<00:00:09.389> explore<00:00:10.019> that<00:00:10.349> mission<00:00:10.740> you<00:00:10.920> might

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
so if you explore that mission you might

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.240 
so if you explore that mission you might
have<00:00:11.160> seen<00:00:11.340> this<00:00:11.460> gate<00:00:11.730> that<00:00:13.099> pushes<00:00:14.099> you

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
have seen this gate that pushes you

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.599 
have seen this gate that pushes you
backwards<00:00:14.759> so<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:14.940> can't<00:00:15.150> pass<00:00:15.360> through<00:00:15.599> it

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
backwards so you can't pass through it

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.740 
backwards so you can't pass through it
but<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.640> will<00:00:17.820> show<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.029> how<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.390> get<00:00:18.539> through

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
but I will show you how to get through

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.019 
but I will show you how to get through
it<00:00:19.010> first<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.250> just<00:00:20.340> try<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.640> do<00:00:20.789> this<00:00:21.109> and<00:00:23.029> that

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
it first I just try to do this and that

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:31.040 
it first I just try to do this and that
did<00:00:24.240> not<00:00:24.359> work<00:00:26.029> clearly<00:00:27.230> but<00:00:29.179> you<00:00:30.179> can<00:00:30.570> climb

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
did not work clearly but you can climb

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.470 
did not work clearly but you can climb
up<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.470> wall<00:00:31.969> if<00:00:32.969> you're<00:00:33.090> looking<00:00:33.329> at<00:00:33.420> you

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
up the wall if you're looking at you

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.729 
up the wall if you're looking at you
climb<00:00:33.660> up<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.870> right<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.290> then<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.530> jump

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
climb up to the right and then you jump

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.740 
climb up to the right and then you jump
over<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.130> left<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:36.149> there's<00:00:36.480> this<00:00:36.570> little

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
over to the left and there's this little

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.970 
over to the left and there's this little
area<00:00:37.050> over<00:00:37.290> here<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:39.200> then<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.290> figured<00:00:40.559> what

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
area over here and then I figured what

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.100 
area over here and then I figured what
if<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.190> go<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.370> at<00:00:41.640> an<00:00:41.760> angle<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.570> when<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.840> pushes

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
if I go in at an angle so when it pushes

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.720 
if I go in at an angle so when it pushes
me<00:00:43.230> backwards<00:00:43.680> it'll<00:00:43.920> push<00:00:44.070> me<00:00:44.250> into<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.489> wall

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
me backwards it'll push me into the wall

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.729 
me backwards it'll push me into the wall
instead<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.300> back<00:00:45.600> out<00:00:46.700> so<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.730> tried<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:50.600> and

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
instead of back out so I tried that and

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.920 
instead of back out so I tried that and
to<00:00:52.739> my<00:00:52.890> surprise<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.579> actually<00:00:54.180> worked<00:00:54.420> like

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
to my surprise it actually worked like

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.150 
to my surprise it actually worked like
after<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.440> get<00:00:55.530> through<00:00:55.739> there<00:00:55.890> just<00:00:56.100> doesn't

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
after you get through there just doesn't

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.099 
after you get through there just doesn't
push<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.610> out<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.969> doesn't<00:00:57.780> push<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.989> out

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
push you out it doesn't push you out

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.069 
push you out it doesn't push you out
anymore<00:00:58.320> doesn't<00:00:58.859> try<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.520> can<00:01:00.079> wander

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
anymore doesn't try so you can wander

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.009 
anymore doesn't try so you can wander
back<00:01:01.320> behind<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.609> an<00:01:02.730> area<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.090> clearly

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
back behind it to an area that clearly

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.580 
back behind it to an area that clearly
is<00:01:04.260> meant<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.949> mission<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.610> future

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
is meant for a mission in the future

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.200 
is meant for a mission in the future
because<00:01:07.590> there's<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:08.130> know<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.460> very<00:01:09.030> detailed

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
because there's you know a very detailed

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.230 
because there's you know a very detailed
area<00:01:09.689> back<00:01:09.869> here<00:01:09.900> with<00:01:10.700> you<00:01:11.700> know<00:01:11.820> doorways

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
area back here with you know doorways

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.450 
area back here with you know doorways
that<00:01:12.270> have<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.750> spawning<00:01:13.080> areas<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:14.130> enemies

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
that have the spawning areas for enemies

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.590 
that have the spawning areas for enemies
that<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.659> know<00:01:15.750> they're<00:01:15.900> not<00:01:15.930> activated<00:01:16.890> but

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
that you know they're not activated but

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.340 
that you know they're not activated but
I'm<00:01:18.600> sure<00:01:18.810> they<00:01:19.020> will<00:01:19.200> be<00:01:19.380> at<00:01:19.680> some<00:01:19.920> point

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.190 

and<00:01:24.350> if<00:01:24.890> you<00:01:24.980> go<00:01:25.100> farther<00:01:25.400> in<00:01:25.900> then<00:01:26.900> you<00:01:27.020> come

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
and if you go farther in then you come

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.280 
and if you go farther in then you come
to<00:01:27.380> a<00:01:27.410> really<00:01:27.650> big<00:01:28.040> wide-open<00:01:28.520> room<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:29.420> I've

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
to a really big wide-open room and I've

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.870 
to a really big wide-open room and I've
explored<00:01:30.650> every<00:01:31.010> inch<00:01:31.160> of<00:01:31.220> this<00:01:31.310> room<00:01:31.460> I<00:01:31.640> feel

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
explored every inch of this room I feel

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.370 
explored every inch of this room I feel
and<00:01:33.070> you<00:01:34.070> can<00:01:34.190> get<00:01:34.340> up<00:01:34.430> just<00:01:35.150> some<00:01:35.360> neat<00:01:35.750> areas

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
and you can get up just some neat areas

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.320 
and you can get up just some neat areas
I<00:01:36.560> guess<00:01:36.770> but<00:01:37.190> there's<00:01:37.400> really<00:01:37.940> nothing<00:01:38.300> to

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
I guess but there's really nothing to

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.160 
I guess but there's really nothing to
see<00:01:40.090> there's<00:01:41.090> a<00:01:41.120> lot<00:01:41.240> of<00:01:41.330> invisible<00:01:41.750> walls<00:01:41.960> an

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
see there's a lot of invisible walls an

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.630 
see there's a lot of invisible walls an
invisible<00:01:42.620> ceiling<00:01:42.830> so<00:01:43.190> you<00:01:43.280> can't<00:01:43.460> get

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
invisible ceiling so you can't get

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.550 
invisible ceiling so you can't get
everywhere<00:01:44.120> that<00:01:44.870> you<00:01:44.960> see<00:01:45.170> and<00:01:47.500> there's<00:01:48.500> a

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
everywhere that you see and there's a

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.470 
everywhere that you see and there's a
big<00:01:48.770> portal<00:01:49.160> thing<00:01:49.370> I've<00:01:49.700> tried<00:01:49.970> interacting

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
big portal thing I've tried interacting

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.060 
big portal thing I've tried interacting
with<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:50.720> it's<00:01:50.840> not<00:01:50.990> activated<00:01:51.440> you<00:01:51.710> can't<00:01:51.950> do

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
with it it's not activated you can't do

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.260 
with it it's not activated you can't do
anything<00:01:52.400> with<00:01:52.550> it

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.860 

the<00:01:56.510> only<00:01:56.630> neat<00:01:56.900> little<00:01:57.020> thing<00:01:57.350> I<00:01:57.650> found<00:01:58.100> is

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
the only neat little thing I found is

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.490 
the only neat little thing I found is
that<00:02:00.520> there's<00:02:01.520> this<00:02:01.610> pit<00:02:01.910> on<00:02:02.660> the<00:02:02.990> left<00:02:03.260> of<00:02:03.410> me

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
that there's this pit on the left of me

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.760 
that there's this pit on the left of me
right<00:02:03.650> now<00:02:04.090> right<00:02:05.090> like<00:02:05.510> over<00:02:05.810> there<00:02:06.020> if<00:02:06.620> you

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770

right now right like over there if you
fall<00:02:06.980> down<00:02:07.130> there<00:02:07.370> there's<00:02:07.580> a<00:02:07.640> part<00:02:07.910> you<00:02:07.970> can

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
fall down there there's a part you can

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.120 
fall down there there's a part you can
land<00:02:08.300> on<00:02:08.420> that<00:02:08.480> doesn't<00:02:08.869> kill<00:02:09.050> you<00:02:09.170> but<00:02:09.770> you

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
land on that doesn't kill you but you

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.290
