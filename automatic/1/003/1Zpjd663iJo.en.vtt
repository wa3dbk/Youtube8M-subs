00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.240
 wehr people thank you for turning on 

00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:08.379
 welcome to my hard core gaming 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.780
 video on the samsung galaxy note 8.0 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:12.999
 why is it called hardcore gamer for one 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.660
 I have a few very 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:16.340
 graphics intensive but also a few 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.230
 simple and very easy at the moment 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.269
 popular games picked out and the 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.080
 the main reason you will end this 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.060
 experienced videos 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.050
 I wish you lots of fun now 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.779
 it's 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.320
 we are laying directly with a very very 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.790
 graphics-heavy and also very much 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.760
 interesting and probably one of the best 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.379
 car rating play it's real 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.300
 racing 3 and most of you 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.940
 finished already know as I said the 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.559
 Graphics are very good here we can 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.360
 switch back and forth that's all 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.460
 Of course no problem runs smoothly 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.260
 from as well as the race wonderful 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.579
 looks 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.440
 I do not have to say that much 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.790
 I do think that runs smoothly 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.670
 do not ask me not quite so good 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.550
 was clearly better on the outside 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.850
 streets of Munich and at least as well 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.000
 fast and unrestrained real racing 3 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.160
 runs in any case wonderful and also 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.229
 the trigger belongs to the graphics very much 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.179
 very elaborate play and also 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.039
 to the very popular currently and 

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:16.140
 Of course, that's why I have to do it for you 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:17.700
 show and what should I say it 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.320
 Of course, it works even if I do 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.850
 a bit out of here you know 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.520
 I do that more often in the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.750
 videos so you can see her once 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.310
 you can start then too 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.220
 continue playing easily 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.950
 artwork well before you get it all well 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.020
 we make wonderful in the warrior 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.080
 continue with a game that latest 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.520
 in the second comment was called resp 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.369
 would be called if I did not 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.739
 would have played temple run in the second 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.440
 Of course everyone plays it many 

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:48.530
 stand on it some find meanwhile 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.580
 It is not that exciting anymore 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.160
 of course I can do that too 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.110
 jump and hop and a little bit there 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.970
 and everything is working 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.129
 of course without problems 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.179
 jerk as well as everyone else 

00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:01.440
 Play so far 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.720
 I think I do not have to 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.099
 great pretend I can now 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.750
 I kind of watch that monkey 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:09.149
 the studio would still be eaten 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.970
 my video still somehow elaborate 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.690
 but so will a gentleman fire it too 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.239
 not bad 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.849
 thomas blaha I like to branch these branches 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.400
 because it's just a cool game 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:24.090
 whole is so yes I'll say more or 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.560
 but less great in the 3d area is 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.180
 a cool game of course works 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.340
 also every gyro sensor again as 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.440
 Control looks pretty fancy 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.600
 also very very fluid and with 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.370
 this grenade and the pair of shoes 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.390
 I say goodbye to me 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.790
 Do not think you have to be great here 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.890
 that it runs absolutely smoothly 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.530
 there is no jerking and is here 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.870
 definitely fun to play 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.550
 love it is a funny one all the way 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.080
 sweet game we play this one here 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.330
 The small theaters and theaters would like to 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.790
 swing through the most different clock 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.290
 dedicates one young whatever the 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.910
 We want to call ourselves 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.209
 and act here and funny 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.459
 dangerous as a would-be cactus 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.410
 take care of plants in front of snakes 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.910
 before tigers and much more 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.280
 Of course we should also not the 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.680
 Doing and crashing here is fun 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.760
 is getting harder running of course 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.610
 also liquid in things graphic also one 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.209
 very nice demonstration and that is 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.459
 it's the official allmend game yes it is 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.430
 from the story aids really not like that 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.100
 exciting but I think it's good 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.330
 made from the graphic 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.890
 that's why it's all about hurting her 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.459
 do that is kinda temperance 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.440
 part 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.120
 I have to watch that I have any 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.630
 many fail 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.239
 and what should I say is running smoothly 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.610
 despite this beautiful really very good 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.010
 3d graphics we have everything we have here 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.420
 we may even need a few more 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.519
 Ugly monsters are destroying us 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.670
 So you will see something of everything right away 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.470
 while running smoothly looks good who 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.150
 who is good here 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.549
 I do not think so now 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.670
 exciting but there are still many many 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:07.840
 many many people on these little ones 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:11.620
 he angry I take it now kag 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.690
 Birds are a very popular game 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.370
 angry birds inter star wars version i 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.290
 can neither with davos nor angry 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.329
 birds start but of course 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.430
 This game also works because it's easy 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.010
 not from the technical requirements 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.210
 so really the highest, yes, why 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.400
 actually hard for gaming 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.200
 I have all the games in the whole time 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.030
 background loaded and you have 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.650
 Nevertheless , they work 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.960
 Absolutely problem is the graphics looked 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.640
 Good everywhere it did not jerk anything 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.010
 could play properly and that though 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.020
 all these games were all the ones I ran 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.580
 just showed you and I think 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.830
 I was able to show you a little bit 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.270
 that we have the samsung galaxy note 8.0 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.810
 also as a small gaming machine 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.330
 used 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.880
 can graphically elaborate games there 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.990
 No problem performance everywhere 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.400
 that's it already was once a 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.620
 hardcore came in video 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.620
 I hope you enjoyed it a lot
