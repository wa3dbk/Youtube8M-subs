00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
an anomaly start just as a photography

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.420 
an anomaly start just as a photography
project<00:02:19.019> and<00:02:19.530> one<00:02:19.709> of<00:02:19.799> the<00:02:19.860> biggest<00:02:20.099> mistakes

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
project and one of the biggest mistakes

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.960 
project and one of the biggest mistakes
I<00:02:20.549> made

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
I made

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.059

before coming on my first trip was not
doing<00:02:23.370> enough<00:02:23.580> research<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:24.299> sort<00:02:24.989> of<00:02:25.049> hit<00:02:25.170> the

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
doing enough research I sort of hit the

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.259 
doing enough research I sort of hit the
ground<00:02:25.319> blind<00:02:25.890> not<00:02:26.459> really<00:02:26.730> knowing<00:02:26.910> what<00:02:27.030> was

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
of prypiat one of the reasons this

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.850 
of prypiat one of the reasons this
really<00:03:03.450> interesting<00:03:03.840> place<00:03:03.989> to<00:03:04.019> film<00:03:04.349> is<00:03:04.530> it's

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
really interesting place to film is it's

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.250 
really interesting place to film is it's
wide<00:03:05.340> open<00:03:05.760> I<00:03:05.849> mean<00:03:06.030> it's<00:03:06.209> 40-foot<00:03:07.019> ceilings

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
wide open I mean it's 40-foot ceilings

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.940 
wide open I mean it's 40-foot ceilings
slope<00:03:07.950> very<00:03:08.189> modern<00:03:08.670> concrete<00:03:09.269> tile<00:03:09.959> a<00:03:10.379> lot<00:03:10.829> of
