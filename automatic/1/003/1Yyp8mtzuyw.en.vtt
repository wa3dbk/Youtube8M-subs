00:00:18.845 --> 00:00:21.383
June 22, 2014

00:00:21.383 --> 00:00:25.863
I am in the small town of Lac Supérieur

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.639
We come to investigate a rather special case of triangular UFO sighting.

00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:41.031
In early May, a woman of the municipality of Lac Supérieur

00:00:41.046 --> 00:00:45.982
would have seen a triangular UFO about 300 feet long

00:00:45.982 --> 00:00:48.482
roughly the length of a football field.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.220
This is something quite unusual in the area.

00:00:54.625 --> 00:01:00.545
We're going to investigate to see in detail what the woman has to say

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.470
about this rather peculiar observation.

00:01:05.356 --> 00:01:07.216
MARC: What triggered the event?

00:01:07.424 --> 00:01:09.662
I was about to get out my cats.

00:01:09.662 --> 00:01:12.902
I have cats that require the door often

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.727
at the same time I was going to smoke a cigarette.

00:01:15.727 --> 00:01:16.846
When I opened the door

00:01:16.846 --> 00:01:19.944
I noticed at the top of the house of my neighbor across the street

00:01:19.944 --> 00:01:23.521
a big object that floated just above his house.

00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:25.951
It was not very far

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:28.299
it was still close enough.

00:01:28.307 --> 00:01:32.523
MARC: The size ... we had estimated

00:01:32.523 --> 00:01:36.323
MARC: it gave... something like 300 feet long?

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.300
Yes, it was really big.

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:43.764
It was about three of my neighbors in distance

00:01:43.764 --> 00:01:47.461
and it was up to the back ground of the neighbor.

00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:49.209
MARC: The shape is really ...

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:50.668
... a triangle

00:01:50.668 --> 00:01:52.028
MARC: As the picture ...

00:01:52.047 --> 00:01:53.496
you showed me

00:01:53.496 --> 00:01:56.036
MARC: That I showed you earlier ...

00:01:57.073 --> 00:01:59.781
There were red lights

00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:01.999
who made a red veil under the object ...

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:06.919
... a few feet under the object, it was a red reflection.

00:02:06.925 --> 00:02:10.071
MARC: What was your first reaction ...?

00:02:10.071 --> 00:02:12.480
First I remained frozen

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.317
then I started to panic ...

00:02:16.317 --> 00:02:18.275
MARC: It was at this time that you called your spouse?

00:02:18.275 --> 00:02:21.332
I cried to my spouse, I really cried to my spouse,

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.640
This is something I never do. I wanted him to come because I was really scared.

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:28.317
Yes my wife called me on the gallery, because she saw something.

00:02:28.317 --> 00:02:31.843
I went and saw a triangle thing.

00:02:31.843 --> 00:02:34.980
It was pretty big. This was about 300 feet long.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.420
It was flying ... as if it was floating in the air.

00:02:39.428 --> 00:02:42.145
There was no noise ... nothing.

00:02:42.145 --> 00:02:44.765
It floated in the air

00:02:44.942 --> 00:02:49.208
MARC: If I remember correctly, it was about 8:20 pm

00:02:49.208 --> 00:02:50.779
MARC or maybe 8:15 pm?

00:02:50.787 --> 00:02:52.587
Yes the sun began to set.

00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:54.611
MARC: Is this object had lights?

00:02:54.875 --> 00:03:00.115
Yes, it had red lights just below. It had 3 I think.

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:03.097
My husband arrived, he observed the same thing as me

00:03:03.097 --> 00:03:04.955
but in the meantime the children wanted to get out

00:03:04.955 --> 00:03:07.073
because they saw that I was panicked

00:03:07.073 --> 00:03:09.791
I have cried a second time to my children

00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:11.550
to stay in the house

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.128
and keep the door closed and then go to their room.

00:03:14.128 --> 00:03:16.259
I was afraid for them.

00:03:16.266 --> 00:03:17.904
Because I was afraid

00:03:17.904 --> 00:03:20.964
I told myself that it could scare them too ... I do not want them to see that.

00:03:21.013 --> 00:03:24.010
MARC: Then you cried your spouse ...

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.869
... I wanted him to take the camera

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:28.287
because I told myself:

00:03:28.287 --> 00:03:30.145
I had to photograph this object.

00:03:30.145 --> 00:03:32.325
I must say that I love taking pictures.

00:03:32.332 --> 00:03:34.471
So my husband went back inside

00:03:34.471 --> 00:03:35.849
and I was still holding the door

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.257
because I really did not want anyone out of my house.

00:03:38.257 --> 00:03:39.776
When he arrived with the camera,

00:03:39.776 --> 00:03:42.036
I fumbled to find the trigger

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.014
but, just time to raise my head,

00:03:44.014 --> 00:03:45.152
and the object was gone.

00:03:45.152 --> 00:03:48.790
My wife asked me the camera,

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.648
just the time to go looking for

00:03:50.648 --> 00:03:53.145
to bring her and the object was gone.

00:03:53.145 --> 00:03:54.864
MARC: But she had remained outside ...

00:03:54.864 --> 00:03:55.874
Yes, she remained on the gallery.

00:03:56.084 --> 00:03:57.742
MARC: What was you thought

00:03:57.742 --> 00:04:00.282
MARC: when you saw this object?

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.146
I was wondering what it was ... I was not sure.

00:04:04.146 --> 00:04:06.624
I was skeptical.

00:04:06.624 --> 00:04:07.864
MARC: And now?

00:04:07.903 --> 00:04:10.011
Well now I know there are.

00:04:10.011 --> 00:04:15.887
MARC: The sighting lasted approximately how long?

00:04:15.887 --> 00:04:18.667
I had to watch it about a minute.

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:20.034
maybe 1 minute and a half

00:04:20.034 --> 00:04:22.312
before realizing what I saw

00:04:22.312 --> 00:04:24.480
because it is not something that we usually see.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.498
I thought

00:04:26.498 --> 00:04:28.698
it was neither a plane nor a helicopter.

00:04:28.775 --> 00:04:34.572
MARC: According to you it's not a plane, it's not a terrestrial object?

00:04:34.572 --> 00:04:37.089
No, no, no. There is nothing that can fly that low

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:38.828
and at such a low speed.

00:04:38.828 --> 00:04:40.028
It hardly progressed.

00:04:40.126 --> 00:04:42.624
It was almost stationary.

00:04:42.624 --> 00:04:45.604
MARC: It was about 3 to 6 mph. Is that it?

00:04:45.762 --> 00:04:47.302
Yes approximately 3 to 6 mph.

00:04:47.601 --> 00:04:48.920
MARC: It made no sound?

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.438
No noise, there was no wind.

00:04:50.438 --> 00:04:52.297
There was no noise.

00:04:52.297 --> 00:04:55.393
I have a dog that barks all the time but he did not bark at all.

00:04:55.393 --> 00:04:57.751
I was really surprised because usually

00:04:57.751 --> 00:04:59.731
he sees a butterfly and then he starts barking.

00:04:59.731 --> 00:05:03.911
During the observation, I noticed a buzz in my ears.

00:05:03.916 --> 00:05:06.565
It felt like a drum sound.

00:05:06.565 --> 00:05:09.911
I was not deaf, but I heard nothing.

00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:12.039
We hear nothing out.

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.327
MARC: For example all the little critters ...

00:05:15.327 --> 00:05:17.805
Yes, usually we hear frogs and that sort of thing here

00:05:17.805 --> 00:05:19.154
but then we heard nothing.

00:05:19.154 --> 00:05:22.560
I could not even see if there were passing cars

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.480
because I looked up

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.231
and because I could not hear anything.

00:05:25.299 --> 00:05:29.386
MARC: Have you had problems with your appliances?

00:05:29.386 --> 00:05:31.893
Yes microwave sounded by itself.

00:05:31.893 --> 00:05:35.270
Internet did not work during the whole evening.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.948
What I found strange with Internet

00:05:37.948 --> 00:05:40.745
is that, when I entered inside

00:05:40.745 --> 00:05:43.353
I wanted to know what I had seen

00:05:43.353 --> 00:05:45.672
but every time I tried to login

00:05:45.672 --> 00:05:47.191
it did not work.

00:05:47.191 --> 00:05:51.476
It was only the next morning that I was able to connect around 8:00 in the morning.

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:52.875
I tried until midnight

00:05:52.875 --> 00:05:54.155
and it did not work.

00:05:54.185 --> 00:05:56.084
Then the microwave began to ring

00:05:56.084 --> 00:05:57.243
we were sitting in the living room

00:05:57.243 --> 00:05:58.681
then it made "beep ... beep ... beep ... beep."

00:05:58.681 --> 00:06:00.160
I seriously wondered what was going on.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.940
My husband tried to disconnected and reconnected

00:06:02.947 --> 00:06:04.346
and it made it yet.

00:06:04.346 --> 00:06:06.395
But since then, there is no more noise.

00:06:06.395 --> 00:06:07.643
It's been over a month.

00:06:07.643 --> 00:06:09.381
MARC: It had never done this before?

00:06:09.381 --> 00:06:10.341
No.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.028
I felt very scared.

00:06:13.028 --> 00:06:14.198
This is ...

00:06:14.198 --> 00:06:17.626
For me it's the worst thing I've seen in my life.

00:06:17.626 --> 00:06:19.264
Some people would be glad

00:06:19.264 --> 00:06:21.542
but me, I was really upset.

00:06:21.542 --> 00:06:24.562
I did not like that at all.

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:28.716
MARC: You mean that it changed your perception of reality?

00:06:28.716 --> 00:06:32.176
Yes because I did not think that these things exist.

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:36.143
I thought people tell anything today

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.530
but the fact of having seen this ...

00:06:38.537 --> 00:06:40.475
I was really skeptical about these things

00:06:40.475 --> 00:06:42.076
I never believed in that.

00:06:42.084 --> 00:06:44.803
I'm more a nature type: animals, flowers, things like that ...

00:06:44.803 --> 00:06:48.143
So when I saw this object, I was really scared

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:50.827
MARC: It changed your perception of the world?

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:52.037
Yes a bit much.

00:06:52.037 --> 00:06:54.035
MARC: You're less skeptical today?

00:06:54.035 --> 00:06:55.934
Yes I Am. And I do not go out after 8:00 pm.

00:06:55.934 --> 00:06:56.807
MARC: Oh no?

00:06:56.853 --> 00:06:59.591
When the sun sets

00:06:59.591 --> 00:07:01.771
I do not go out of the house.

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:04.417
MARC: Because the object was identified

00:07:04.417 --> 00:07:07.037
as unconventional

00:07:07.313 --> 00:07:11.020
and that it flew over the airspace of North America

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.299
I sent an email to NORAD

00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:15.619
with the observation report

00:07:15.626 --> 00:07:17.705
but I have no answer

00:07:17.705 --> 00:07:19.424
and this is almost a week.

00:07:19.424 --> 00:07:21.074
In fact, I do not expect to get an answer.

00:07:21.292 --> 00:07:24.909
To conclude, I think it is a very good case for further investigation.

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:28.327
We'll see if we could not find

00:07:28.327 --> 00:07:33.546
similar observations in the area.
