00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:10.539 

when<00:00:09.049> you're<00:00:09.200> satisfied<00:00:09.410> that<00:00:09.920> the<00:00:10.010> contours

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:10.549 
when you're satisfied that the contours

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.029 
when you're satisfied that the contours
are<00:00:10.670> right<00:00:11.180> checked<00:00:11.900> lens<00:00:12.320> fitting<00:00:12.650> again

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:13.039 
are right checked lens fitting again

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:25.250 
are right checked lens fitting again
just<00:00:13.520> to<00:00:13.730> be<00:00:13.850> sure

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.410 

the<00:00:26.260> panel<00:00:26.770> appears<00:00:27.279> to<00:00:27.490> have<00:00:27.640> the<00:00:27.820> slightest

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
the panel appears to have the slightest

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.320 
the panel appears to have the slightest
curve<00:00:28.689> in<00:00:29.020> this<00:00:29.230> direction<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:31.060> you<00:00:31.119> may<00:00:31.300> think

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
curve in this direction so you may think

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.630 
curve in this direction so you may think
that<00:00:31.810> a<00:00:31.840> flat<00:00:32.230> file<00:00:32.590> used<00:00:32.980> in<00:00:33.190> that<00:00:33.340> manner

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
that a flat file used in that manner

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.200 
that a flat file used in that manner
would<00:00:33.879> indicate<00:00:34.180> what<00:00:34.660> we<00:00:34.870> want<00:00:35.050> to<00:00:35.230> see<00:00:36.210> but

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
would indicate what we want to see but

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.020 
would indicate what we want to see but
some<00:00:37.570> of<00:00:37.660> it<00:00:37.809> is<00:00:37.960> so<00:00:38.350> close<00:00:38.710> to<00:00:38.950> flat<00:00:39.220> that<00:00:39.910> we

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
some of it is so close to flat that we

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.020 
some of it is so close to flat that we
could<00:00:40.270> cause<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:40.780> nose<00:00:41.019> to<00:00:41.290> dig<00:00:41.470> in

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.729 

so<00:00:46.030> we<00:00:46.150> adjusted<00:00:46.660> to<00:00:46.809> have<00:00:47.019> a<00:00:47.050> very<00:00:47.379> slight

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
so we adjusted to have a very slight

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:57.970 
so we adjusted to have a very slight
convex<00:00:48.580> curve<00:00:48.910> in<00:00:49.180> relation<00:00:49.690> to<00:00:49.720> the<00:00:49.930> panel

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.190 

it<00:00:58.579> is<00:00:58.760> very<00:00:59.000> important<00:00:59.600> to<00:00:59.720> remember<00:00:59.840> that

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
it is very important to remember that

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.370 
it is very important to remember that
you<00:01:00.470> are<00:01:00.500> not<00:01:00.620> trying<00:01:01.309> to<00:01:01.520> remove<00:01:01.850> metal<00:01:02.380> all

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
you are not trying to remove metal all

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:24.430 
you are not trying to remove metal all
we're<00:01:03.800> doing<00:01:04.100> is<00:01:04.190> indicating<00:01:04.850> highs<00:01:05.120> and<00:01:05.360> lows

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.590 

feeling<00:01:25.440> the<00:01:25.620> panel<00:01:26.010> at<00:01:26.190> this<00:01:26.520> point<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.540> to

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
feeling the panel at this point is to

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.520 
feeling the panel at this point is to
identify<00:01:27.960> if<00:01:28.740> we<00:01:28.890> have<00:01:29.130> highs<00:01:29.340> or<00:01:29.610> not<00:01:30.530> this

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
identify if we have highs or not this

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.010 
identify if we have highs or not this
time<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.070> removal<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.760> the<00:01:32.880> paint<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.510> telling

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
time the removal of the paint is telling

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.780 
time the removal of the paint is telling
us<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.320> these<00:01:34.560> part<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.190> the<00:01:35.280> panel<00:01:35.610> are

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
us that these part of the panel are

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.100 
us that these part of the panel are
correct<00:01:36.530> if<00:01:37.640> they've<00:01:38.640> been<00:01:38.790> true<00:01:39.119> highs<00:01:39.420> we'd

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
correct if they've been true highs we'd

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.990 
correct if they've been true highs we'd
know<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.560> panel<00:01:40.890> had<00:01:41.040> been<00:01:41.220> stretched<00:01:41.640> and

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
know the panel had been stretched and

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
know the panel had been stretched and
we'd<00:01:42.750> need<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.259> do<00:01:43.380> some<00:01:43.619> shrinking<00:01:45.020> these

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
we'd need to do some shrinking these

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.140 
we'd need to do some shrinking these
larger<00:01:46.500> lows<00:01:46.800> can<00:01:47.310> still<00:01:47.580> be<00:01:47.700> worked<00:01:47.909> with<00:01:48.119> a

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
larger lows can still be worked with a

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.510 
larger lows can still be worked with a
mallet<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.690> dolly<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.250> further<00:01:50.250> safeguard

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
mallet and dolly a further safeguard

00:01:50.520 --> 00:02:13.559 
mallet and dolly a further safeguard
against<00:01:51.150> stretching

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.300 

so<00:02:14.569> we<00:02:14.690> can<00:02:14.810> see<00:02:15.020> that<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.350> low<00:02:15.530> areas<00:02:16.010> are

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
so we can see that the low areas are

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.600 
so we can see that the low areas are
being<00:02:16.670> raised<00:02:17.319> it's<00:02:18.319> also<00:02:18.500> obvious<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.430> they

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
being raised it's also obvious that they

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.550 
being raised it's also obvious that they
are<00:02:19.640> now<00:02:20.000> too<00:02:20.060> small<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:21.050> handle<00:02:21.410> with<00:02:21.530> a

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
are now too small to handle with a

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.420 
are now too small to handle with a
rather<00:02:22.130> large<00:02:22.340> face<00:02:23.060> of<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.420> mallet<00:02:24.250> we<00:02:25.250> need

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
rather large face of the mallet we need

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.370 
rather large face of the mallet we need
a<00:02:25.459> smaller<00:02:25.880> contact<00:02:26.510> face<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:27.110> we<00:02:27.230> can

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
a smaller contact face and we can

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.140 
a smaller contact face and we can
achieve<00:02:27.500> that<00:02:27.739> with<00:02:28.160> either<00:02:28.459> a<00:02:28.700> planishing

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
achieve that with either a planishing

00:02:29.150 --> 00:03:14.270 
achieve that with either a planishing
hammer<00:02:29.180> or<00:02:30.020> a<00:02:30.080> flipper

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280
