00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.360

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:12.850
 crosses the Atlantic to celebrate the great 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.949
 Canada award this race comes 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.350
 marked by two important ephemeris 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.910
 30 years have passed since the death of 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.160
 gilles villeneuve in the circuit of 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.140
 zolder and 5 years of my best career in 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.929
 Formula 1 in the montreal circuit 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.220
 when I overtook braking alfonso like this 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.810

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.419
 now I will tell you what happened to me 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.640
 get to the circuit step past the 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.140
 garage of the Malaysian keys and I think 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.060
 now you fuck at the top of the 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.789
 shit for not having signed me in his day 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.520
 step ahead of the pink bulls and 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:45.100
 something similar comes to mind and a 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.050
 little later I find myself no more 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.820
 less than with good miss the now 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.559
 urine tester of chuck norris and the 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.960
 who stole my steering wheel in torito recorded 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.449
 for 2009 and a little more and it steals my 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.489
 watch and the wallet the thing is that by seeing 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.559
 to the loose man without a belt I gave myself 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.629
 account that the world organization of 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.859
 health had not yet taken letters in 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.900
 the case 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.790
 see this guy's face that looks like 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.860
 instead of giving birth they pulled it from a 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.350
 rock would have to be banned by the 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.770
 good of humanity and for the record to be 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.560
 a 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.869
 and constructively in order once made this 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.030

 free were led by luisito 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.310
 making it clear that this circuit is given 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.170
 very well 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.420
 Ferrari ross seemed to follow 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.819
 progressing and marking good times 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.829
 bruno dinner is listening rock against 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:44.229
 wall of the champions because I believed that 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.239
 so I will become champion something that I doubt 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.399
 a lot if you keep driving like 

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:50.140
 now in free third parties the 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.360
 temperature was somewhat higher and 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.610
 Frigodedo marked the best time for 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.750
 nobody will forget about him before he starts 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.750
 the fight for pole position 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.490

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.140

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.120
 his lotus and could not get past the tenth 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.070
 second position while pastor 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.080
 maldonado spun on his last 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.850
 attempt that condemns him to leave from the 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.350
 end of the grill after changing the 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.450
 gearbox 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.760
 huang virgin hedgehog in the nineteenth 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.470

 just behind him he will have a 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.620
 fantastic pedro of the thing that exceeded 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.620
 the two shits already 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.150
 Sunday morning is warm and 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.950
 sunny frigodedo hopes to convert the 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.049
 pollen victory something that could not 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.780
 get last year but pozzolanic 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.579
 wants his third victory in Canada in 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.099
 the exit remains in the first 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:11.439
 positions without any change felipe 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.599
 farce passes niko hs in the second 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:16.030
 back and shortly after paul arrested 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:18.790

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.680
 lap 6 felipe guasa wearing too 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.079
 time without messing up and makes a 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.829
 spin on curve 1 losing 7 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.379
 positions 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.659
 the paulista was completing a good 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:31.269
 great prize but it gives the feeling that 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:33.159
 is very pressured on round 13 the 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.510
 Brazilian is the first to change the 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:36.189
 tires 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.930
 toilets begins to suffer with the 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:39.159
 degradation and enters the pits in the 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.989
 round 17 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:43.299
 puzol to nito for a return later and 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.549
 he wins the position to the German fucking master 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.409
 makes a couple of quick laps before 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.450
 your first stop and get out in 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:51.519
 first position although hamilton gogh 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.879
 would recover the lead on the straight with 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:57.310
 drs help on round 23 here is 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.889
 marks a spin and leaves leaving to 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.370
 take curry in the pits shortly after you 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:02.709
 une 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.870
 but that still remained ahead 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.450
 of both shits already due to problems 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.670
 of brake hamilton pto was the fastest 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.220
 on the track while lining up for the 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.860
 fund managed to contain frigodedo in 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.109
 the turn 46 churro machete has to 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.510
 back home because I had the eyelet say 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.150
 the drs opened and it did not close nor to 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.419
 hosts this season do not get the 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.699
 things on lap 51 comes in quiet 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.770
 ton to make his second pit stop but a 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:32.320
 new delay with a rear wheel will 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.729
 does a man lose an extra extra 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.680
 no neck and finger man 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.780
 commanded the race and pretended to arrive 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.000
 at the end without making a second change of 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.039
 tires so that he with jito not 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.470
 had another option to approach them 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.449
 and overtake those if I wanted to win the 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.240
 button pushbutton overtakes frigodedo 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:51.220
 on lap 63 he was hunting for alonso 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.560
 while the current champion makes his 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.840
 second pit stop staying in the 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.000
 fifth place overtaking the 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.090
 Ferrari Ross is also a piece of cake for 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.889
 luisito that is launched for the triumph 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.240
 but there are still five laps left and Alonso 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.950
 he had to defend himself from his 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.790
 persecutors with tremendous wear 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.880
 of your tires 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.680
 and the greñas the mariachi until toilets 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.540
 overtake the Spanish driver without 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.450
 complications in the last measures 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.060
 It has been a brave effort but it has not 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.830
 had the expected reward today more 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.720
 that never has Luis been the son of 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.700
 wind at the wheel of a formula one 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.620
 completing an impeccable race and 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.110
 becoming the new leader of the 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.520
 contest and there are already seven winners 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.460
 different in the first seven 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.770
 races on the podium we have a Roman 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.630
 rude and sergio lazy that despite 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.730
 not having your best Saturday they made a 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.340
 good strategy and they came back in the race 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.500
 Frigodedo finished fourth and 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.380
 braking alfonso in the fifth followed 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.720
 very close by the felipe felipe braza 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.730
 managed to save a point from behind 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.800
 point out that the fucking or level 1 slows down 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.230
 they made a really loose career 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.810
 I left you three reflections before 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:01.090
 finish because I get from the medlar the 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.160
 first the pilot that they say is missing 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.110
 experience to pilot a ferrari 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.200
 get 26 points to the one that is already 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.240
 driving one of the red cars 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.550
 here is something that does not fit the 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.480
 second the so-called payment pilot is 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.970
 giving him a 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.830
 the sobrinísimo and the third if the 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:20.290
 butanero does not react soon can 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.180
 miss the world train up here the 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.190
 summary of a career not excessively 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.740
 exciting but that has had good 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.950
 we'll see each other in the next big 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.950
 prize
