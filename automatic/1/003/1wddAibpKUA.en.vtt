half inches at the bottom and then just

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.580 
half inches at the bottom and then just
put<00:05:40.909> a<00:05:40.939> quarter<00:05:41.389> circle<00:05:41.599> radius<00:05:42.020> outside

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
be finished at the bottom see I hope I

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.969 
be finished at the bottom see I hope I
didn't<00:05:50.360> miss<00:05:50.479> anything<00:05:50.779> be<00:05:51.110> accurate<00:05:51.830> with

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:53.889 
this angle because this angle represents

00:05:53.889 --> 00:06:00.749 
this angle because this angle represents
the<00:05:54.889> shear<00:05:56.469> the<00:05:57.469> angle<00:05:57.830> of<00:05:57.919> the<00:05:58.009> shear<00:05:58.310> okay<00:05:59.270> so

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 
the shear the angle of the shear okay so

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:04.659 
the shear the angle of the shear okay so
you<00:06:01.759> got<00:06:01.969> the<00:06:02.120> pattern<00:06:02.949> got<00:06:03.949> the<00:06:04.099> measurements

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:04.669 
you got the pattern got the measurements

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:06.249
