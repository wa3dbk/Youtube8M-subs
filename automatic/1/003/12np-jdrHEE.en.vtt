00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.850
 well you give in the extra key and you go 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.770
 where it says options after 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.469

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.020

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.660
 redefining controls and finally in 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.900
 Good vehicle controls on the part 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.570
 from up to down 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.400
 are your controls if you see the side 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.190
 left is your good function what 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.170
 we will configure it as or like it good 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.910
 select one and press the key that 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.700
 want but so how do I configure it and I 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:22.480
 because it accommodates me more than this one down 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.630
 is the j key up this cloud right 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.550
 is the key here and the left is the 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.040
 h key but if you want to do it 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.200
 different good we will have to stay 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.170
 in this good way you have already configured 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:39.220
 the controls in my way so we will have 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.410
