00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:11.820
 Hi, I'm America. I'm wine and this is 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:13.590
 market economy and america thing that 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.570
 I was before really the egg or the 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.970
 hen the big question the big dilemma 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.130
 that we all do because they say 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.760
 great thinkers that the egg so 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.820
 let's go the first thing you have to do with 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.500
 an egg is class a italy is not more 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.449
 big bigger but a very small 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.399
 and moderating that part you see that it's like 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.260
 dirty this is good one never has to 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.670
 be very washed because the own 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.409
 hen that was a protective film 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.629
 for groups with this game so 

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:41.639
 beautiful you have chosen I explain to you how 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.679
 economic cycles all 

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:46.109
 begins when the product is in the 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:48.120
 base has almost no value and is increasing 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:49.469
 the shareholders are increasingly going 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.600
 acquiring value until it reaches its 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.229
 maximum peak and from there it can not pass and 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.229
 go back down 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.840
 listen to me but you want to know if one 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.710
 it's cool not clear the 20 but I hope 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.710
 I 'm glad 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.600
 to 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.890
 america we are going to make the chick that is 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.720
 the typical dish of the gabinoteca 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.549
 which is in a glass jar we are going to 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.740
 make a dish as if we were going to make 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.960
 one preserves but not so much 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.789
 cooking as to preserve then in 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.409
 the fund the jar we are going to put a 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:26.630
 cream that we have made with potato and 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.689
 Leek and mash with a little water 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.189
 and a tad of cream boeing cream 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.369
 is what is going to give us a little bit 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.320
 rusty potato cut into pieces like 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.210
 you want candied so that it is made 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.460
 inside and then we go up the 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.259
 temperature and we fry it 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.619
 so that you are missing a little bit of 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.890
 salt and now it's time to crack 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.890
 something 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.350
 and we will make a little 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.480
 a picadillo that we have made of truffle is 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.310
 very expensive there in the supermarket is pasta 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.350
 tartuffe fairy who is also very rich 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.910
 and that is much cheaper or you can 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.770
 do with a little bit of fried bacon in 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.210
 sunflower oil and that also gives you a 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.820
 good touch and now let's go to the bathroom 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.979
 Mary that is nothing more than a casserole 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.270
 with hot water and without it reaching 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.060
 boil the water cover to where 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.960
 is the whole genre about 13 14 minutes and 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.960
 we have a rex egg 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.140
 our original code is a pass 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.180
 test on yes 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.569
 take to the bottom that is the leg of 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.569
 the cream 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.860
 you want the yolk is raw the clear 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.150
 is uncooked 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.150
 terrific 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.890
 avoid making the purchase hungry and not 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.890
 fall in two by one unnecessary
