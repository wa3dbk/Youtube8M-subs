you<00:03:02.299> that<00:03:02.540> transmission<00:03:03.200> was<00:03:03.970> horrible

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
you that transmission was horrible

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.440 
you that transmission was horrible
that<00:03:06.740> said<00:03:08.890> this<00:03:09.890> transmission<00:03:10.819> is<00:03:10.970> made<00:03:11.240> by

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
that said this transmission is made by

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.690 
that said this transmission is made by
one<00:03:11.720> of<00:03:11.750> three<00:03:11.930> companies<00:03:12.650> it<00:03:13.250> is<00:03:13.370> either<00:03:13.550> a

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
one of three companies it is either a

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.150 
one of three companies it is either a
Visteon<00:03:14.209> a<00:03:14.660> Hyundai<00:03:15.500> or<00:03:15.860> Mis<00:03:16.540> Mitsubishi<00:03:17.540> I

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
Visteon a Hyundai or Mis Mitsubishi I

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.000 
Visteon a Hyundai or Mis Mitsubishi I
believe<00:03:19.160> it's<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.459> Mitsubishi<00:03:19.970> in<00:03:20.209> this<00:03:20.390> one

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
believe it's a Mitsubishi in this one

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.560 
believe it's a Mitsubishi in this one
and<00:03:22.600> in<00:03:23.600> at<00:03:24.260> 14,000<00:03:25.190> miles<00:03:25.370> is<00:03:25.820> showing<00:03:26.330> some

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
and in at 14,000 miles is showing some

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.400 
and in at 14,000 miles is showing some
issues<00:03:28.180> previously<00:03:29.180> I<00:03:29.209> had<00:03:29.660> an<00:03:29.840> issue<00:03:30.020> this

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
issues previously I had an issue this

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.190 
issues previously I had an issue this
transmission<00:03:31.160> from<00:03:31.430> day<00:03:31.580> one<00:03:31.880> that<00:03:32.690> I<00:03:32.750> kind<00:03:33.080> of

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
transmission from day one that I kind of

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.680 
transmission from day one that I kind of
ignored<00:03:33.670> because<00:03:34.670> I<00:03:34.760> really<00:03:35.060> didn't<00:03:35.330> care<00:03:35.630> I

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
ignored because I really didn't care I

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.570 
ignored because I really didn't care I
mean<00:03:35.930> you<00:03:36.350> know<00:03:36.440> and<00:03:36.620> I<00:03:36.739> have<00:03:36.920> warranty

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
mean you know and I have warranty

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.810 
mean you know and I have warranty
coverage<00:03:38.000> of<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.630> ying-yang<00:03:39.050> so<00:03:39.459> if<00:03:40.459> it<00:03:40.610> blows

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
coverage of the ying-yang so if it blows

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.690 
coverage of the ying-yang so if it blows
up<00:03:41.150> what<00:03:41.510> does<00:03:41.570> it<00:03:41.720> matter<00:03:42.370> but<00:03:43.370> what<00:03:43.489> it<00:03:43.580> would

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
up what does it matter but what it would

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.090 
up what does it matter but what it would
do<00:03:43.880> is<00:03:44.060> it<00:03:44.090> would<00:03:44.239> have<00:03:44.330> a<00:03:44.480> very<00:03:45.260> slight<00:03:45.650> shift

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
do is it would have a very slight shift

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.840 
do is it would have a very slight shift
flare<00:03:46.519> from<00:03:46.700> second<00:03:47.209> to<00:03:47.239> third<00:03:48.430> so<00:03:49.430> here's<00:03:49.640> my

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
flare from second to third so here's my

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.300 
flare from second to third so here's my
hypothesis<00:03:50.690> now<00:03:50.870> that<00:03:51.140> issue<00:03:51.470> seems<00:03:51.950> to<00:03:52.160> have

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
hypothesis now that issue seems to have

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.479 
hypothesis now that issue seems to have
gone<00:03:52.519> away<00:03:52.910> and<00:03:53.620> was<00:03:54.620> replaced<00:03:55.040> with<00:03:55.220> this

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
gone away and was replaced with this

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.350 
gone away and was replaced with this
reversing<00:03:56.180> issue<00:03:56.390> so<00:03:57.310> here's<00:03:58.310> my<00:03:58.489> hypothesis

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
reversing issue so here's my hypothesis

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.000 
reversing issue so here's my hypothesis
there<00:03:59.660> was<00:03:59.810> something<00:04:00.170> stuck<00:04:00.500> in<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.800> valve

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
there was something stuck in the valve

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.170 
there was something stuck in the valve
body<00:04:01.810> and<00:04:02.810> that<00:04:03.160> finally<00:04:04.160> worked<00:04:04.459> its<00:04:04.670> way<00:04:04.880> out

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
body and that finally worked its way out

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.550 
body and that finally worked its way out
of<00:04:05.209> the<00:04:05.830> one<00:04:06.830> of<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.010> shift<00:04:07.310> solenoids<00:04:07.730> and

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
of the one of the shift solenoids and

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.410 
of the one of the shift solenoids and
was<00:04:09.560> forced<00:04:10.040> down<00:04:10.100> the<00:04:10.430> line<00:04:10.610> into<00:04:11.239> the

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
was forced down the line into the

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.380 
was forced down the line into the
reverse<00:04:11.840> solenoid<00:04:12.739> or<00:04:13.400> whichever<00:04:13.700> solenoid

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
reverse solenoid or whichever solenoid

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.219 
reverse solenoid or whichever solenoid
engages<00:04:14.930> reverse<00:04:15.260> and<00:04:15.560> it's<00:04:15.650> causing<00:04:16.130> it<00:04:16.280> to

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
engages reverse and it's causing it to

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.490 
engages reverse and it's causing it to
leak<00:04:18.229> or

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
leak or

work and I'm going to go ahead and put

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.830 
work and I'm going to go ahead and put
this<00:04:34.690> car<00:04:34.990> in<00:04:35.020> Reverse<00:04:36.090> car<00:04:37.090> they<00:04:37.240> lower<00:04:37.630> off

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
this car in Reverse car they lower off

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:44.030 
this car in Reverse car they lower off
AC<00:04:38.590> off<00:04:40.080> and<00:04:41.080> hear<00:04:41.290> the<00:04:41.410> engine<00:04:42.600> maybe<00:04:43.600> not

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
AC off and hear the engine maybe not

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:51.330 
AC off and hear the engine maybe not
okay<00:04:45.040> here<00:04:45.460> we<00:04:45.550> go<00:04:45.580> reverse<00:04:49.440> there<00:04:50.440> we<00:04:50.530> go<00:04:50.650> see

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
okay here we go reverse there we go see

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.960 
okay here we go reverse there we go see
that<00:04:51.600> yeah<00:04:52.600> well<00:04:52.840> on<00:04:52.930> that<00:04:53.080> took<00:04:53.260> to<00:04:53.440> engage

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
that yeah well on that took to engage

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.600 
that yeah well on that took to engage
that<00:04:54.970> is<00:04:55.180> not<00:04:55.360> normal

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
that is not normal

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.860 
that is not normal
let's<00:04:57.610> put<00:04:57.760> it<00:04:57.850> in<00:04:57.970> drive<00:04:59.550> instant<00:05:00.720> put<00:05:01.720> it<00:05:01.810> in

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
let's put it in drive instant put it in

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.380 
let's put it in drive instant put it in
reverse

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.310 

it's<00:05:07.390> like<00:05:07.510> a<00:05:07.540> solid<00:05:07.870> 2<00:05:08.410> to<00:05:08.560> 3<00:05:08.800> second<00:05:09.250> shift

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
it's like a solid 2 to 3 second shift

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.480 
it's like a solid 2 to 3 second shift
and<00:05:11.320> that's<00:05:11.500> what<00:05:11.650> I'm<00:05:11.740> talking<00:05:12.070> about<00:05:12.130> that

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
and that's what I'm talking about that

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.890 
and that's what I'm talking about that
my<00:05:13.450> friends<00:05:14.250> is<00:05:15.250> a<00:05:15.400> faulty<00:05:15.820> transmission<00:05:16.000> I

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
my friends is a faulty transmission I

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.960 
my friends is a faulty transmission I
will<00:05:17.350> say<00:05:17.530> this<00:05:18.150> the<00:05:19.150> dealer<00:05:19.720> tried<00:05:20.590> to

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
will say this the dealer tried to

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.490 
will say this the dealer tried to
reprogram<00:05:21.970> the<00:05:22.240> transmission<00:05:23.169> control

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
reprogram the transmission control

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.070 
reprogram the transmission control
module<00:05:23.650> and<00:05:24.270> actually<00:05:25.270> made<00:05:25.479> the<00:05:25.660> problem

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
module and actually made the problem

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.790 
module and actually made the problem
about<00:05:26.260> three<00:05:26.590> to<00:05:26.710> four<00:05:26.919> times<00:05:27.100> worse<00:05:28.680> but<00:05:29.680> they

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
about three to four times worse but they

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.440 
about three to four times worse but they
could<00:05:30.040> not<00:05:30.280> get<00:05:30.550> that<00:05:30.700> problem<00:05:31.090> to<00:05:31.150> go<00:05:31.270> away

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
could not get that problem to go away

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.480 
could not get that problem to go away
completely<00:05:31.600> maybe<00:05:32.410> they<00:05:32.800> could<00:05:32.950> only<00:05:33.160> make<00:05:33.460> it

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
completely maybe they could only make it

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.070 
completely maybe they could only make it
worse<00:05:33.700> what<00:05:33.970> they<00:05:34.060> did<00:05:34.240> is<00:05:34.360> they<00:05:34.450> reset<00:05:34.930> the

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
worse what they did is they reset the

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.000 
worse what they did is they reset the
ECM<00:05:35.830> to<00:05:36.070> default<00:05:36.430> values<00:05:36.520> and<00:05:37.740> it<00:05:38.740> not<00:05:38.979> only

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
ECM to default values and it not only

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.400 
ECM to default values and it not only
caused<00:05:39.520> some<00:05:40.000> erratic<00:05:40.360> shifting<00:05:40.990> in<00:05:41.080> forward

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
caused some erratic shifting in forward

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.800 
caused some erratic shifting in forward
gears<00:05:41.650> but<00:05:42.310> it<00:05:42.430> made<00:05:42.580> the<00:05:42.760> reverse<00:05:43.060> gear<00:05:43.479> even

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
gears but it made the reverse gear even

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.590 
gears but it made the reverse gear even
worse<00:05:44.400> and<00:05:45.400> the<00:05:45.550> reason<00:05:45.820> that<00:05:45.940> happens<00:05:46.360> is

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
worse and the reason that happens is

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.900 
worse and the reason that happens is
because<00:05:46.660> as<00:05:47.110> transmissions<00:05:47.830> wear<00:05:48.160> out<00:05:48.370> or<00:05:48.669> as

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
because as transmissions wear out or as

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.230 
because as transmissions wear out or as
they<00:05:49.060> break<00:05:49.330> in<00:05:49.600> the<00:05:50.560> TCM<00:05:51.280> compensates<00:05:52.090> for

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
they break in the TCM compensates for

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.010 
they break in the TCM compensates for
the<00:05:52.479> wear<00:05:52.800> now<00:05:53.800> if<00:05:54.040> you<00:05:54.220> set<00:05:54.610> it<00:05:54.700> to<00:05:55.020> default

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
the wear now if you set it to default

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.130 
the wear now if you set it to default
values<00:05:56.430> you've<00:05:57.430> essentially<00:05:58.290> taken<00:05:59.970> about

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140 
values you've essentially taken about

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.990 
values you've essentially taken about
15,000<00:06:02.140> miles<00:06:02.380> of<00:06:02.710> learning<00:06:03.250> away<00:06:03.669> from<00:06:03.910> the

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
15,000 miles of learning away from the

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.719 
15,000 miles of learning away from the
TCM<00:06:04.540> and<00:06:04.780> now<00:06:05.500> it<00:06:05.650> has<00:06:05.800> to<00:06:05.830> relearn<00:06:06.340> the

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
TCM and now it has to relearn the

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:08.490 
TCM and now it has to relearn the
characteristics<00:06:07.479> of<00:06:07.570> the<00:06:07.720> transmission<00:06:08.320> all

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
characteristics of the transmission all

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.100 
characteristics of the transmission all
over<00:06:08.800> again<00:06:09.300> which<00:06:10.300> is<00:06:10.450> why<00:06:10.570> whenever<00:06:11.020> you

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
over again which is why whenever you

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.930 
over again which is why whenever you
replace<00:06:11.500> the<00:06:11.620> transmission<00:06:12.010> in<00:06:12.400> the<00:06:12.520> car<00:06:12.729> you

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
replace the transmission in the car you

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.350 
replace the transmission in the car you
have<00:06:13.150> to<00:06:13.330> reset<00:06:13.720> the<00:06:13.840> TCM<00:06:14.320> and<00:06:15.150> that's<00:06:16.150> uh

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
have to reset the TCM and that's uh

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.770 
have to reset the TCM and that's uh
that's<00:06:16.720> all<00:06:16.930> we<00:06:17.020> have<00:06:17.169> for<00:06:17.200> this<00:06:17.470> one<00:06:17.620> and

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
that's all we have for this one and

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.260 
that's all we have for this one and
until<00:06:19.780> then<00:06:20.080> I'll<00:06:20.740> do<00:06:21.460> an<00:06:21.580> update<00:06:21.910> when<00:06:22.030> I<00:06:22.060> get

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
until then I'll do an update when I get
