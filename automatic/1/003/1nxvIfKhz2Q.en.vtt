 after knowing the clinic matrix and 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.289
 to learn a little more about 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.840

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.750
 the perfection of smile because I 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.550
 I wanted and I decided to do it 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.800
 definitely wonderful is not 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.590
 possible that in a few hours you changed the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.780
 life a treatment or a procedure 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.700
 where zero tooth wear and where 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.950
 zero pain normally we meet 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.960
 with doctor gonzaga tabares from here 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.030

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.070
 well thank you very much happy that 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.210
 are around here again good that 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.370
 we had talked about the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.739
 procedure but there were certain 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.719
 I doubt if I would like us to talk about 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.980
 step by step in more detail more 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.460
 technically what is the 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.070
 perfecting smile good for 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.629
 let's say the whole audience the 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.670
 patients that at this moment we are 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.840
 seeing the idea of â€‹â€‹perfecting 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.390
 dental 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.210
 it's a cosmetic dental work 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.820
 where first of all there is nothing to do 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.770
 no wear on the teeth 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.890
 It is a technique that is managed 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.590
 adhesive ontology where we 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.750
 we put first one demineralized 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.880
 test then we put some stickers and 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.710
 we are molding tooth by tooth with 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.840
 material that is resin high 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.150
 aesthetics technically is the same as 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.680
 orthodontists have always done 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.930
 the patients who get their orthodontics 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.700
 when they are going to stick the bracket to the tooth 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.740
 they do it with resins with a single he 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.659
 goes when they finish their orthodontics on 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.250
 orthodontist removes the resin with some 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.740
 special stones and the enamels are left 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.720
 or the intact teeth is the same 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.619
 adhesion procedure that we do 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.509
 with the sheets for the 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.130
 improvement of smile that is 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.280
 that when the person wants to withdraw 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.850
 the resins the tooth remains as it was 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.440
 before technically if so far in the 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.580
 four years that we have been carrying out the 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.440
 technique here in matisse clinics 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.119
 dentistry because the first one did not arrive 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.830
 patient that withdraws it but technically 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.330
 is the same procedure of removing the 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.039
 resin like when the patient ends 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.110
 orthodontics with special stones 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.340
 is removed and the tooth remains intact is 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.239
 a procedure completely 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.040
 reversible fully reversible 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.050
 totally conservative dentistry 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.150
 adhesive aesthetic dentistry for 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.350
 patients from the age of 18 is without 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.280
 age limit 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.740
 people say I do this 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.510
 procedure I can not drink coffee not 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.980
 I can take coca cola 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.540
 basically what are the cares that 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.430
 must have the person always the 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.220
 recommendation is to consume this type 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.230
 of drinks or food in moderation 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.140
 to have greater stability of the 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.180
 color although the material as it comes with 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.070
 a high load in ceramic is 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.080
 offering a very good resistance to 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.120
 chewing forces and a very good 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.740
 color stability the use of silk 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.660
 It is also very important indispensable 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.390
 that the patient continues with his good 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.310
 hygiene habits brushing three 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.320
 times a day using a dental cea 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.180
 daily and the use of mouthwash is 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.340
 fundamental of maintenance at home and 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.250
