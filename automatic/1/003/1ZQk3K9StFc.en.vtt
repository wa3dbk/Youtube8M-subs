00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
adopting this technology so how is this

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.350 
adopting this technology so how is this
achieved<00:00:55.219> when<00:00:56.219> Pearson's<00:00:56.670> looks<00:00:56.940> at<00:00:57.090> water

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
achieved when Pearson's looks at water

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.040 
achieved when Pearson's looks at water
is<00:00:57.600> treating<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.199> as<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.379> logistical<00:00:59.340> process

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
is treating it as a logistical process

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.569 
is treating it as a logistical process
starting<00:01:01.050> at<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.320> pump<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.770> ending<00:01:02.430> at<00:01:02.520> the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.240 
starting at the pump and ending at the
root<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.449> it's<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.719> holistic<00:01:04.409> look<00:01:04.559> at<00:01:04.739> water<00:01:04.949> on
