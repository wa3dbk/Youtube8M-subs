00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.970
 As it is already missing some things 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.300
 A lot is missing but you can have 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.640

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.080

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.010
 I did not like it, I took my bed there. 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.609
 I did not want to buy the bed headboard 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.709

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:25.450
 I also did it I understood raw and I was me 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.670

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.209
 totally white is going to get a 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.459
 Wallpaper 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.739
 I just have not bought the ticket yet. 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.099
 This is the son you can not ask for. 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.379
 Did not he miss people with this? 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.739
 I just think it's not even 40 centimeters 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:49.540
 that there was a lack of wallpaper and there 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.180
 than buying a new piece of 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.370
 wall I did I gave my father my mother 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.079
 and I'm going to buy a new one I do not know when 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.209
 I'm going to buy some more but there was a lot missing. 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:01.989
 thing to buy carpets lack to buy 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.849

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.939
 do a lot of cooking buy one 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:10.090
 lots of things and then I enjoy 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:12.939
 I count more or less on the amount is everything 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.799
 How much did I like because it saves money 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:18.790
 Well, it's because my father told me the 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:20.650
 Diego did the installation is that mash and 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.299
 saves a lot on this part of the hand 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.449
 that what more people gas and 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:27.370
 save a lot in that sense I spent 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:29.650
 more decorating some things already 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.930
 had other things going to buy by 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.650
 example rug I only found 500 carpet 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.629
 600 reais and today the absurd of expensive né 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.519
 so he's going to wake up, I'm going to give 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.959
 one researched but because I'm always 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.979
 very heavy and ends up like things 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.949
 very expensive 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:46.989
 so I 'm going to give more weight but I'm going to give 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:49.180
 one expected and I will give one searched 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.620
 to be able to buy everything right and 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.540
 then I regret buying something 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.790
 dude and find something else quite cheap 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:59.439
