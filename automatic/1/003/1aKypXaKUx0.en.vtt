00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.779
 I bring today the demonstration of how 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.030
 the feature works and retro 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.759
 Compatibility of xbox the ample already 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.040
 360 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:16.139
 this feature it will be released by 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.830
 end of the year but for the members predicted 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.020
 you can already access here is the list 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.529
 which is still very small of games that already 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.529
 are compatible 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:42.680
 the feature that allows you to use both media 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.680
 physical and digital media 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:02.579
 it was very simple to use the media 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.579
 physics just put the disk in the brief 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.610
 He already asked to be there. 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:22.890
 download the game for free sent 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:24.869
 install and is already going to the queue to the media 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.689
 has become even simpler than 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:32.899
 just go there in the games goes to the 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.899
 Last 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:43.740
 they will appear here your content 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:55.759
 here is just push the button 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:55.759
 install menu is already going to queue 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:09.660
 I came here to the queue I'm already here to 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.510
 be able to download that you can 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:18.420
 equally ask for who wants to install 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:21.140
 first leave in order to put 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.140
 whatever 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:33.380
 now I'll get a game here show 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:33.380
 how is it running on xbox hua? 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.190
 apparently it's like having an xbox 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.350
 360 virtualized 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:12.260
 he even had it as long as you 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.260
 had in using xbox 360 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:56.240
 the rooster is getting a better picture 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:09.480
 detail is changing the game to match that 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:11.250
 is the law of physical media and without the disk 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.410
 inserted in the brief 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.320
 I do not know if it 's a mistake, you're still going 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.390
 fix it because if you do not just pick up 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.260
 a borrowed cd that you can have 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.260
 he in your library 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:39.590
 he also uses game salvina game 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:41.160
 saved in the cloud as I had only saved 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.870
 locally 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.860
 I could not redeem my service. 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.510
 I do not know if you have saved in the cloud if 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.930
 can rescue your being and continue 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.930
 where did you stop 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.220
 I played a little bit yesterday to test 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.390
 ah 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:32.260
 I see you working very well, do you? 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:35.080
 can use the features of xbox 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:44.639
 one normal as if it were an xbox game 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:44.639
 Even the year can fix 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:05.270
 can fix apps you can 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:08.600
 take screenshots 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:14.509
 everything works fine 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:52.850
 I discovered that I'm playing with a hand. 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.850
 only with the hand does not usually control 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.290
 ae 

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:12.970
 the wheel very well one thing I noticed 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:18.340
 is that you can not access the 

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:18.340
 market to be able to buy must cease 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:24.740
 I do not know if the game already comes with all 10 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:28.100
 included or if you simply do not have 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.360
 How to play them but the games I have 

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:33.470
 did not have any of them and will 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:35.620
 test then it is and I will not have this 

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.620
 information 

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:45.710
 is it work that way the resource 

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.990
 backward compatible xbox playground 

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:50.919
 Xbox 360 

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.919
