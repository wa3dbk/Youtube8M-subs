00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.870 
really careful whenever you fold them up
the<00:04:17.349> horses<00:04:17.590> probably<00:04:18.010> have<00:04:18.099> to<00:04:18.220> lay<00:04:18.340> down<00:04:18.370> but

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
the horses probably have to lay down but

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.879 
the horses probably have to lay down but
you<00:04:19.150> can<00:04:19.329> have<00:04:19.510> them<00:04:19.750> in<00:04:19.959> there<00:04:20.139> and<00:04:20.289> it<00:04:20.709> will

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
you can have them in there and it will

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:21.990 
you can have them in there and it will
close

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
close

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.900 
close
and<00:04:22.390> while<00:04:22.660> the<00:04:22.840> horses<00:04:23.050> are<00:04:23.290> in<00:04:23.320> there<00:04:23.560> so<00:04:24.310> I

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
and while the horses are in there so I

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.040 
and while the horses are in there so I
don't<00:04:25.330> think<00:04:25.420> you'll<00:04:25.570> fit<00:04:25.780> all<00:04:25.930> the

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
don't think you'll fit all the

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.230 
don't think you'll fit all the
accessories<00:04:26.530> though<00:04:26.890> but<00:04:27.490> you<00:04:27.730> can<00:04:27.880> try<00:04:28.030> but

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
accessories though but you can try but

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.750 
accessories though but you can try but
you<00:04:29.230> may<00:04:29.380> scrape<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:30.190> paint<00:04:30.400> or<00:04:30.580> something

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
you may scrape the paint or something

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.090 
you may scrape the paint or something
but<00:04:31.110> you<00:04:32.110> can<00:04:32.260> at<00:04:32.320> least<00:04:32.380> put<00:04:32.590> a<00:04:32.650> few<00:04:32.860> of<00:04:32.980> them

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
but you can at least put a few of them

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.170
