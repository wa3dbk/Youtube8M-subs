00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
in this episode we're going to look at

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.270 
in this episode we're going to look at
how<00:00:07.560> to<00:00:07.620> afk<00:00:08.460> from<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.300> wyvern<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.800> liven<00:00:11.160> is

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
how to afk from the wyvern the liven is

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.839 
how to afk from the wyvern the liven is
a<00:00:11.309> hard<00:00:11.610> mode<00:00:11.929> enemy<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.429> basically<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:14.670> need

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
a hard mode enemy and basically you need

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.480 
a hard mode enemy and basically you need
to<00:00:15.059> kill<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.750> get<00:00:15.929> souls<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.379> flight<00:00:16.680> which

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
to kill it to get souls of flight which

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.840 
to kill it to get souls of flight which
is<00:00:17.520> used<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.470> make<00:00:19.470> your<00:00:19.710> first<00:00:20.189> pair<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.580> wings

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
is used to make your first pair of wings

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.060 
is used to make your first pair of wings
so<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.720> can't<00:00:21.930> fly<00:00:22.199> until<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.650> kill<00:00:22.890> this

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
so you can't fly until you kill this

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.210 
so you can't fly until you kill this
beast<00:00:24.140> so<00:00:25.140> what<00:00:25.439> we're<00:00:25.560> gonna<00:00:25.650> look<00:00:25.830> at<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.189> a

that runs back and forward up and down
and<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:56.250> lot<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.430> flame<00:00:56.879> traps<00:00:57.329> rigged<00:00:57.750> up<00:00:57.930> to

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
and a lot of flame traps rigged up to

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.189 
and a lot of flame traps rigged up to
blue<00:00:58.649> pleasure<00:00:59.010> pleasure<00:00:59.840> pressure<00:01:00.840> plates

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
blue pleasure pleasure pressure plates

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.070 
blue pleasure pleasure pressure plates
are<00:01:01.920> blue<00:01:02.340> pressure<00:01:02.699> plates<00:01:03.030> are<00:01:03.510> ones<00:01:03.960> that

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
are blue pressure plates are ones that

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.640 
are blue pressure plates are ones that
can<00:01:04.199> only<00:01:04.530> be<00:01:04.680> triggered<00:01:05.189> by<00:01:06.320> well<00:01:07.320> there's<00:01:07.590> a

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
can only be triggered by well there's a

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.800 
can only be triggered by well there's a
live<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.950> now<00:01:08.070> they<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.210> only<00:01:09.330> be<00:01:09.450> triggered

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
live and now they can only be triggered

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.320 
live and now they can only be triggered
by<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.020> player<00:01:10.430> so<00:01:11.430> what<00:01:11.610> happens<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.150> when

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
by the player so what happens is when

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.890 
by the player so what happens is when
you<00:01:12.600> zoom<00:01:12.990> past<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.590> your<00:01:13.950> roller<00:01:14.369> coaster

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
you zoom past on your roller coaster

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.630 
you zoom past on your roller coaster
you're<00:01:15.900> activating<00:01:16.500> all<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.070> flame<00:01:17.280> traps

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
you're activating all the flame traps

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.760 
you're activating all the flame traps
behind<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:19.020> I'm<00:01:19.110> calling<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.530> one<00:01:19.590> the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
behind you so I'm calling this one the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.920 
behind you so I'm calling this one the
flame<00:01:20.130> coaster<00:01:20.610> because<00:01:20.820> that's<00:01:21.659> kind<00:01:21.869> of

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
flame coaster because that's kind of

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.030 
flame coaster because that's kind of
what<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.170> looks<00:01:22.350> like

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
what it looks like

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.730 
what it looks like
I'm<00:01:23.820> also<00:01:24.030> demonstrating<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.049> trap<00:01:25.350> during

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
I'm also demonstrating this trap during

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.740 
I'm also demonstrating this trap during
a<00:01:25.950> Blood<00:01:26.189> Moon<00:01:26.430> because<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.240> spawn<00:01:27.509> rates

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
a Blood Moon because the spawn rates

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.740 
a Blood Moon because the spawn rates
just<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.470> much<00:01:28.710> higher<00:01:29.180> obviously<00:01:30.180> I've<00:01:30.570> got

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
just so much higher obviously I've got

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.130 
just so much higher obviously I've got
water<00:01:30.930> candles<00:01:31.470> placed<00:01:32.070> around<00:01:32.390> but<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.869> works

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
water candles placed around but it works

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.710 
water candles placed around but it works
a<00:01:34.290> lot<00:01:34.409> better<00:01:34.470> during<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.460> Blood<00:01:35.670> Moon<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.689> I

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
a lot better during a Blood Moon so I

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.630 
a lot better during a Blood Moon so I
waited<00:01:37.020> for<00:01:37.290> one<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.650> start<00:01:38.310> before<00:01:38.490> I

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
waited for one to start before I

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.050 
waited for one to start before I
recorded<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.710> so<00:01:41.210> I'll<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:42.540> jump<00:01:42.630> off<00:01:42.990> it

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
recorded this so I'll just jump off it

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.480 
recorded this so I'll just jump off it
alright<00:01:45.079> so<00:01:46.079> I'll<00:01:46.409> just<00:01:46.560> put<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.860> wiring<00:01:47.340> up

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
alright so I'll just put the wiring up

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
flame traps actuated and they're linked

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.810 
flame traps actuated and they're linked
up<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.799> blue<00:01:55.979> pressure<00:01:56.280> plate<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:56.700> when

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
up to the blue pressure plate so when

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.600 
up to the blue pressure plate so when
you<00:01:56.909> stand<00:01:57.329> on<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.649> or<00:01:58.649> zoom<00:01:58.950> past<00:01:59.250> on<00:01:59.490> your

wyman let's get back on it
so<00:02:06.119> yeah<00:02:06.390> now<00:02:06.869> I'm<00:02:07.140> not<00:02:07.350> using<00:02:07.380> booster<00:02:08.220> tracks

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
so yeah now I'm not using booster tracks

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.510 
so yeah now I'm not using booster tracks
because<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.149> problem<00:02:09.509> is

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
because the problem is

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.620 
because the problem is
that<00:02:11.230> boosters<00:02:12.230> will<00:02:13.030> keep<00:02:14.030> making<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:14.510> go

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
that boosters will keep making you go

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.710 
that boosters will keep making you go
faster<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:15.290> faster<00:02:15.530> until<00:02:16.540> you're<00:02:17.540> just

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
faster and faster until you're just

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.920 
faster and faster until you're just
going<00:02:17.990> too<00:02:18.110> fast<00:02:18.380> to<00:02:18.680> collect<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.430> lose<00:02:19.930> all

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
going too fast to collect the lose all

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.420 
going too fast to collect the lose all
right<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.230> next<00:02:21.380> thing<00:02:21.530> is<00:02:21.860> I've<00:02:22.040> got<00:02:22.070> some

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
right the next thing is I've got some

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.700 
right the next thing is I've got some
heart<00:02:22.730> statues<00:02:23.300> hooked<00:02:23.570> up<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:23.990> these<00:02:24.560> are

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
heart statues hooked up and these are

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.710 
heart statues hooked up and these are
probably<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.010> most<00:02:25.100> important<00:02:25.940> part<00:02:26.180> of<00:02:26.420> the

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
probably the most important part of the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.410 
probably the most important part of the
trap<00:02:27.020> so<00:02:28.010> basically<00:02:28.550> while<00:02:28.850> you're<00:02:29.060> zooming

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
trap so basically while you're zooming

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.350 
trap so basically while you're zooming
around<00:02:29.540> on<00:02:29.870> your<00:02:29.990> mind<00:02:30.260> card<00:02:30.820> it's<00:02:31.820> gradually

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
around on your mind card it's gradually

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.680 
around on your mind card it's gradually
dropping<00:02:32.630> hearts<00:02:33.350> and<00:02:33.560> they're<00:02:34.250> fairly<00:02:34.690> far

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
dropping hearts and they're fairly far

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.530 
dropping hearts and they're fairly far
apart<00:02:35.990> so<00:02:36.620> they're<00:02:37.130> not<00:02:37.340> limited<00:02:37.580> by<00:02:37.910> spawn

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
apart so they're not limited by spawn

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.220 
apart so they're not limited by spawn
rates<00:02:38.810> for<00:02:39.170> hearts<00:02:39.580> so<00:02:40.580> you're<00:02:40.760> zooming<00:02:41.030> along

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
rates for hearts so you're zooming along

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.140 
rates for hearts so you're zooming along
the<00:02:42.230> flames<00:02:42.530> are<00:02:42.740> going<00:02:42.950> out<00:02:43.100> behind<00:02:43.520> you<00:02:43.820> and

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
the flames are going out behind you and

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.150 
the flames are going out behind you and
the<00:02:44.510> wyvern<00:02:44.930> will<00:02:45.080> just<00:02:45.290> keep<00:02:45.440> taking<00:02:45.740> damage

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
the wyvern will just keep taking damage

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.100 
the wyvern will just keep taking damage
as<00:02:46.610> it<00:02:46.910> zooms<00:02:46.940> about<00:02:48.460> so<00:02:49.460> zooming<00:02:49.880> along

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
as it zooms about so zooming along

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.750 
as it zooms about so zooming along
flames<00:02:51.110> are<00:02:51.290> killing<00:02:51.560> live-ins<00:02:52.040> they<00:02:52.550> also

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
flames are killing live-ins they also

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.700 
flames are killing live-ins they also
kill<00:02:53.120> any<00:02:53.270> harpies<00:02:53.810> so<00:02:54.140> you<00:02:54.230> can<00:02:54.380> see<00:02:54.560> we're

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
kill any harpies so you can see we're

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.010 
kill any harpies so you can see we're
picking<00:02:55.010> up<00:02:55.070> coins<00:02:55.580> hearts<00:02:56.300> feathers<00:02:56.720> as<00:02:56.900> we

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
picking up coins hearts feathers as we

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.300 
picking up coins hearts feathers as we
go<00:02:58.420> I've<00:02:59.420> tried<00:02:59.810> using<00:03:00.050> summons<00:03:00.770> with<00:03:01.010> this

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
go I've tried using summons with this

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.940 
go I've tried using summons with this
but<00:03:02.210> I<00:03:02.240> found<00:03:02.540> summons<00:03:03.170> we're<00:03:03.410> getting<00:03:03.680> in<00:03:03.860> the

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
but I found summons we're getting in the

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.430 
but I found summons we're getting in the
way<00:03:04.130> and<00:03:04.460> making<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.970> wyvern<00:03:05.390> die<00:03:05.720> sort<00:03:06.350> of

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
way and making the wyvern die sort of

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.810 
way and making the wyvern die sort of
away<00:03:06.830> from<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.220> trap<00:03:07.870> um<00:03:08.920> I<00:03:09.920> put<00:03:10.160> fireworks<00:03:10.640> on

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
away from the trap um I put fireworks on

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:11.950 
away from the trap um I put fireworks on
because<00:03:11.090> it<00:03:11.180> just<00:03:11.270> reminds<00:03:11.660> me<00:03:11.780> of<00:03:11.900> a

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
because it just reminds me of a

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.050 
because it just reminds me of a
rollercoaster<00:03:12.260> and<00:03:12.950> carnivals<00:03:13.550> and<00:03:13.820> all<00:03:13.910> that

cells of wool and there's another woven

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.750 
cells of wool and there's another woven
ah<00:03:41.500> I'm<00:03:42.500> gonna<00:03:42.680> wait<00:03:42.950> and<00:03:43.190> see<00:03:43.340> if<00:03:43.370> we<00:03:43.580> can<00:03:43.670> get

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
ah I'm gonna wait and see if we can get

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.660 
ah I'm gonna wait and see if we can get
it<00:03:43.880> to<00:03:44.060> follow<00:03:44.390> us<00:03:44.600> here<00:03:44.840> we<00:03:44.930> go<00:03:45.220> here<00:03:46.220> it<00:03:46.280> comes

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
it to follow us here we go here it comes

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.199 
it to follow us here we go here it comes
so<00:03:47.600> you<00:03:47.660> can<00:03:47.810> see<00:03:48.080> in<00:03:48.920> a<00:03:49.100> perfect<00:03:49.550> world<00:03:49.790> it

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
so you can see in a perfect world it

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.800 
so you can see in a perfect world it
will<00:03:50.360> just<00:03:50.600> follow<00:03:51.050> your<00:03:51.530> flame<00:03:51.950> trail<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:52.810> it

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
will just follow your flame trail and it

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.240 
will just follow your flame trail and it
takes<00:03:54.050> a<00:03:54.200> little<00:03:54.290> bit<00:03:54.560> to<00:03:54.709> get<00:03:54.830> the<00:03:54.890> timing

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
takes a little bit to get the timing

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.250 
takes a little bit to get the timing
right<00:03:55.580> but<00:03:56.030> I<00:03:56.060> haven't<00:03:56.300> used<00:03:56.540> boosters<00:03:57.050> and

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260 
right but I haven't used boosters and
this<00:03:57.410> is<00:03:57.590> for<00:03:57.770> the<00:03:57.830> reason<00:03:58.130> so<00:03:58.370> come<00:03:59.000> to<00:03:59.150> this

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
this is for the reason so come to this

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.750 
this is for the reason so come to this
platform<00:03:59.540> over<00:04:00.020> here<00:04:00.350> right<00:04:01.070> click<00:04:01.370> to<00:04:01.550> get<00:04:01.640> on

platform over here right click to get on

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.449 
platform over here right click to get on
the<00:04:01.880> minecart<00:04:02.450> you<00:04:03.230> hold<00:04:03.500> right<00:04:03.800> down<00:04:04.160> and<00:04:04.400> I

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
the minecart you hold right down and I

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.199 
the minecart you hold right down and I
count<00:04:04.700> one<00:04:04.850> two<00:04:05.360> three<00:04:06.260> four<00:04:06.709> and<00:04:07.070> then<00:04:08.060> you're

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.030 
count one two three four and then you're
pretty<00:04:08.420> much<00:04:08.630> going<00:04:08.989> as<00:04:09.260> fast<00:04:09.440> as<00:04:09.770> you<00:04:09.860> need<00:04:09.890> to

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
pretty much going as fast as you need to

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.580 
pretty much going as fast as you need to
go<00:04:10.400> and<00:04:10.730> then<00:04:11.600> your<00:04:11.750> character<00:04:12.140> will<00:04:12.290> just<00:04:12.500> go

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
go and then your character will just go

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.400 
go and then your character will just go
back<00:04:12.830> and<00:04:12.980> forward<00:04:13.280> it<00:04:14.270> avoids<00:04:14.600> most<00:04:14.870> harpy

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
back and forward it avoids most harpy

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.159 
back and forward it avoids most harpy
projectiles<00:04:16.010> and<00:04:16.489> if<00:04:17.299> you<00:04:17.450> can<00:04:17.600> get<00:04:17.810> it

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
projectiles and if you can get it

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.380 
projectiles and if you can get it
the<00:04:18.410> wiving<00:04:18.799> in<00:04:18.919> that<00:04:19.040> sweet<00:04:19.400> spot<00:04:19.430> you<00:04:20.000> saw

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
the wiving in that sweet spot you saw

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.300 
the wiving in that sweet spot you saw
before<00:04:20.600> it<00:04:20.960> was<00:04:21.140> just<00:04:21.169> following<00:04:21.919> in<00:04:22.190> the

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
before it was just following in the

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.730 
before it was just following in the
flame

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
flame

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.450 
flame
and<00:04:23.039> dying<00:04:23.430> slowly<00:04:24.270> I<00:04:24.800> tried<00:04:25.800> spheres<00:04:26.250> for

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
and dying slowly I tried spheres for

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.969 
and dying slowly I tried spheres for
this<00:04:26.610> trap<00:04:26.940> but<00:04:27.270> spheres<00:04:27.960> are<00:04:28.319> a<00:04:28.350> little<00:04:28.560> bit

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
this trap but spheres are a little bit

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.400 
this trap but spheres are a little bit
too<00:04:29.190> slow<00:04:29.460> for<00:04:29.610> this<00:04:30.000> and<00:04:30.300> because<00:04:31.139> they<00:04:31.229> only

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
too slow for this and because they only

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.339 
too slow for this and because they only
fire<00:04:31.740> downwards<00:04:32.370> they<00:04:32.550> were<00:04:32.639> no<00:04:32.789> good<00:04:33.289> so<00:04:34.289> you

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 
fire downwards they were no good so you

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:36.439 
fire downwards they were no good so you
get<00:04:34.770> giant<00:04:35.160> harpy<00:04:35.550> feathers<00:04:35.910> which<00:04:36.180> you<00:04:36.300> used

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
get giant harpy feathers which you used

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.809 
get giant harpy feathers which you used
to<00:04:36.569> make<00:04:36.720> harpy<00:04:37.169> wings<00:04:37.410> plenty<00:04:38.340> of<00:04:38.430> normal

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:38.819 
to make harpy wings plenty of normal

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:41.059 
to make harpy wings plenty of normal
feathers<00:04:39.210> which<00:04:39.599> are<00:04:39.750> used<00:04:39.960> in<00:04:40.259> gravitation

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:41.069

you<00:04:52.080> don't<00:04:52.289> need<00:04:52.440> all<00:04:52.560> the<00:04:52.650> fireworks<00:04:53.190> in<00:04:53.430> this

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
you don't need all the fireworks in this

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.260 
you don't need all the fireworks in this
and<00:04:53.970> the<00:04:54.470> fireworks<00:04:55.550> streamer<00:04:56.550> things<00:04:56.880> and

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
and the fireworks streamer things and

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.719 
and the fireworks streamer things and
you<00:04:58.229> could<00:04:58.380> probably<00:04:58.530> do<00:04:58.740> this<00:04:58.860> with<00:04:59.070> less<00:04:59.340> oh

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
you could probably do this with less oh

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.070 
you could probably do this with less oh
look<00:05:00.419> at<00:05:00.509> that<00:05:00.539> that's<00:05:00.780> beautiful<00:05:01.610> nice<00:05:03.080> you

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
look at that that's beautiful nice you

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.510 
look at that that's beautiful nice you
could<00:05:04.229> probably<00:05:04.410> make<00:05:04.560> it<00:05:04.830> work<00:05:05.070> with<00:05:05.340> just

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
could probably make it work with just

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.650 
could probably make it work with just
one<00:05:05.550> flame<00:05:06.180> trap<00:05:06.599> on<00:05:06.810> each<00:05:07.080> level<00:05:07.759> so<00:05:08.759> it<00:05:09.449> works

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
one flame trap on each level so it works

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.810 
one flame trap on each level so it works
really<00:05:09.900> well<00:05:10.050> you<00:05:10.889> could<00:05:11.039> set<00:05:11.280> it<00:05:11.310> up<00:05:11.490> and<00:05:11.669> wait

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
really well you could set it up and wait

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.589 
really well you could set it up and wait
for<00:05:12.060> a<00:05:12.090> Blood<00:05:12.330> Moon<00:05:12.509> and<00:05:12.780> then<00:05:12.870> just<00:05:13.110> farm<00:05:13.410> away
