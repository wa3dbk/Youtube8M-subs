00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:12.420
 for my pompom now for me 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.780
 It's totally hey people in a few days 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.990
 so far 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.730
 and then it's christmas and because 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.529
 Christmas is already in a few days 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.840
 There are some things like that today 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.490
 happy fest can screw up pretty much 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.340
 and where the mood then in the cellar 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.160
 therefore falls as is now happening with the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:35.280
 can mess up what to christmas 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:37.050
 christmas sucks really ill 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.969
 in the typical season 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.260
 Of course not uncommon to get sick 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.570
 there it is but then only if you 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.160
 exactly on 24 december will be sick so 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.469
 then you all celebrate and given 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.239
 get and we went no gifts 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:54.629
 because we are lying in bed strange rain 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.340
 plusgrade winter hello 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.980
 typical of the season what babbles 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.410
 the boy yes it is different 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.210
 Let's see outside then see 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.250
 Unfortunately this year we will not participate 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.570
 the snow is absolute no go if it is 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.670
 no longer wants to cut out there 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.260
 but is that plusgrade instead 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.490
 It is not like this 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.350
 season winter call 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.930
 Instead, there is a before and would 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.640
 a late summer I have 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.060
 not sunday said city too 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.180
 do 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:27.840
 yes hello hello grandma grandpa aunt uncle too 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.340
 a lot of family overflow so much you his 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.600
 loved ones have christmas 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.130
 I would rather with my then 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.840
 spend a family and not at 50 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.790
 other people because I'm honest 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.600
 then I preferred to draw Christmas Eve instead 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.189
 me with it any 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.920
 to leave family members and me 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.659
 then bored to death 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.770
 many have wanted it so there is 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.770
 now christmas tour in 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.150
 kloten completely 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.840
 so excited in the next video I have 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.610
 I already mentioned that this year 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.930
 no Christmas feeling you 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.460
 which is the reason I think that lies 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.619
 once in the fact that in the tv just 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.300
 shit runs and on the other hand that that 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.100
 weather outside somewhere in the summer 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.959
 the whole looks like this time from among you 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.550
 do you have Christmas feelings or are you? 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.380
 you also in my opinion and have 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.880
 no feelings at all for this year 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:27.290
 writes it down there the comments one 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.290
 new present a toilet brush seriously 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.630
 what should i do with a sock 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.500
 that happens to most of you 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.480
 because the dear parents of course 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.130
 something good but do not know what 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.239
 you wish they give you 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.650
 any gram 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.690
 little tip write you a list 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.000
 on clara winter is the feast of love 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.799
 blabla bluewin that's it already 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.570
 Gives gifts and then one 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.040
 gift does not get something like that 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.810
 this can already be expected 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.670
 really the solid verliegen you just got it 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.130
 which is great presented and gets it 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.970
 an attack 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.070
 Of course , Christmas still has many 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.510
 positive sides but this video pulls 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.160
 now just about the negative 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.959
 because it has to be christmas again 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.459
 so give negative by the now 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.170
 like to write in the comments 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.880
 what your favorites from the whole 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.190
 these are the topics you have 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.269
 Christmas too afraid of a shit 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.450
 to get a gift 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.400
 then it gets into the comments i have to 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.260
 Say yes my favorite is the bad one 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.239
 weather because that's just real 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.130
 public out there and indeed want 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.030
 just do not deliver winter so what 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.019
 is happening again over the video 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.090
