00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
little bit more transparent but it'll

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.359 
little bit more transparent but it'll
also<00:01:31.140> make<00:01:31.499> the<00:01:31.649> vein<00:01:31.829> look<00:01:32.070> like<00:01:32.219> it's

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
also make the vein look like it's

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.069 
also make the vein look like it's
actually<00:01:32.700> underneath<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.210> skin<00:01:33.479> after<00:01:33.899> i<00:01:33.960> go

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
actually underneath the skin after i go

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.090 
actually underneath the skin after i go
ahead<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.259> do<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.409> with<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.710> vein<00:01:34.829> i<00:01:34.859> could

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
ahead and do that with the vein i could

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.830 
ahead and do that with the vein i could
begin<00:01:35.369> finishing<00:01:35.939> my<00:01:36.060> highlights<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.749> i

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
begin finishing my highlights and i

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.270 
begin finishing my highlights and i
gotta<00:01:37.079> say<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.499> hairs<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.859> highlights<00:01:38.189> have

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
gotta say the hairs and highlights have

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.559 
gotta say the hairs and highlights have
been<00:01:38.460> very<00:01:38.759> difficult<00:01:39.030> for<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.359> to<00:01:39.390> do

00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:39.569 
been very difficult for you to do

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:41.389 
been very difficult for you to do
because<00:01:39.719> i<00:01:39.869> don't<00:01:40.109> have<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.380> thin<00:01:40.679> brush<00:01:40.859> john

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
because i don't have a thin brush john

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.399 
because i don't have a thin brush john
needs<00:01:41.609> to<00:01:41.789> go<00:01:41.880> by<00:01:42.090> thin<00:01:42.450> brush<00:01:42.810> because<00:01:43.109> i

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
needs to go by thin brush because i

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.559 
needs to go by thin brush because i
don't<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:43.920> worn<00:01:44.429> it<00:01:44.609> and<00:01:44.789> it's<00:01:44.909> making<00:01:45.359> my

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:45.569 
don't have worn it and it's making my

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:49.370 
don't have worn it and it's making my
life<00:01:46.280> unnecessarily<00:01:47.569> hard<00:01:48.569> so<00:01:48.990> probably

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
life unnecessarily hard so probably

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.080 
life unnecessarily hard so probably
tomorrow<00:01:49.560> or<00:01:49.829> thursday<00:01:50.429> i'll<00:01:50.579> go<00:01:50.729> ahead<00:01:50.909> not

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
tomorrow or thursday i'll go ahead not

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.569 
tomorrow or thursday i'll go ahead not
pick<00:01:51.270> up<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.630> very<00:01:52.049> very<00:01:52.409> very<00:01:52.560> thin<00:01:53.249> brush

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
pick up a very very very thin brush

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.609 
pick up a very very very thin brush
because<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.479> brush<00:01:54.659> i<00:01:54.780> have<00:01:54.960> isn't<00:01:55.439> cutting

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
because the brush i have isn't cutting

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.349 
because the brush i have isn't cutting
it<00:01:55.740> now<00:01:55.950> not<00:01:56.189> saying<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.850> can't<00:01:57.090> do

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:57.359 
it now not saying that you can't do

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:59.179 
it now not saying that you can't do
either<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.990> two<00:01:58.229> with<00:01:58.499> a<00:01:58.530> thicker<00:01:58.829> brush

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
either of the two with a thicker brush

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.819 
either of the two with a thicker brush
but<00:01:59.819> i<00:01:59.850> think<00:02:00.240> it'd<00:02:00.359> just<00:02:00.600> be<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> lot<00:02:01.079> easier<00:02:01.380> if

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
but i think it'd just be a lot easier if

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.410 
but i think it'd just be a lot easier if
I<00:02:01.950> used<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.280> brush<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.639> was<00:02:02.759> appropriate<00:02:03.270> for

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
I used a brush that was appropriate for

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.510 
I used a brush that was appropriate for
the<00:02:03.539> job<00:02:03.810> it's<00:02:04.109> like<00:02:04.319> yes<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.799> can<00:02:04.920> use<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.130> rock

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
the job it's like yes you can use a rock

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.609 
the job it's like yes you can use a rock
in<00:02:05.700> order<00:02:05.819> to<00:02:05.939> hammer<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.600> nail<00:02:06.630> but<00:02:07.200> you

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
in order to hammer in a nail but you

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.410 
in order to hammer in a nail but you
know<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.799> hammer<00:02:08.280> would<00:02:08.520> probably<00:02:09.030> be<00:02:09.149> better

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
know a hammer would probably be better

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.449 
know a hammer would probably be better
to<00:02:09.660> do<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.020> job<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:10.679> after<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:10.979> go<00:02:11.130> ahead<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.340> i

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
to do that job so after I go ahead and i

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.980 
to do that job so after I go ahead and i
buy<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.910> thinner<00:02:12.150> brush<00:02:12.330> I'm<00:02:12.540> gonna<00:02:12.690> go<00:02:12.810> back

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
buy that thinner brush I'm gonna go back

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.930 
buy that thinner brush I'm gonna go back
in<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.440> do<00:02:13.650> some<00:02:13.860> more<00:02:13.890> hairs<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.640> ear<00:02:14.790> and

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
in and do some more hairs in the ear and

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.910 
in and do some more hairs in the ear and
then<00:02:15.180> I'm<00:02:15.360> gonna<00:02:15.540> study<00:02:15.900> highlights<00:02:16.500> because

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
then I'm gonna study highlights because

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.590 
then I'm gonna study highlights because
my<00:02:17.070> highlights<00:02:17.460> don't<00:02:17.700> look<00:02:17.880> too<00:02:18.060> convincing

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
my highlights don't look too convincing

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.060 
my highlights don't look too convincing
and<00:02:18.720> that's<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.960> result<00:02:19.080> of<00:02:19.380> me<00:02:19.530> using<00:02:19.710> way<00:02:20.010> to

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
and that's a result of me using way to

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.610 
and that's a result of me using way to
think<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.490> a<00:02:20.580> brush<00:02:20.820> in<00:02:20.850> order<00:02:21.210> to<00:02:21.300> do

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
think of a brush in order to do

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.410 
think of a brush in order to do
you<00:02:21.799> see<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.099> inside<00:02:22.489> of<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:22.670> ear<00:02:22.700> is<00:02:23.000> kind<00:02:23.269> of

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
you see the inside of the ear is kind of

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.149 
you see the inside of the ear is kind of
smooth<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:23.989> smooth<00:02:24.319> surfaces<00:02:24.920> have<00:02:25.129> a

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
smooth and smooth surfaces have a

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.039 
smooth and smooth surfaces have a
tendency<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.730> be<00:02:25.970> sort<00:02:26.269> of<00:02:26.330> reflective<00:02:26.900> and

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
tendency to be sort of reflective and

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:28.869 
tendency to be sort of reflective and
reflective<00:02:27.739> lights<00:02:28.010> tend<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:28.519> be<00:02:28.640> pretty

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
reflective lights tend to be pretty

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.449 
reflective lights tend to be pretty
sharp<00:02:29.299> and<00:02:29.540> sharp<00:02:29.989> lights<00:02:30.349> tend<00:02:30.920> to<00:02:31.099> look<00:02:31.250> like

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
sharp and sharp lights tend to look like

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.240 
sharp and sharp lights tend to look like
they<00:02:31.580> exist<00:02:32.060> on<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.450> surface<00:02:32.480> of<00:02:33.379> whatever<00:02:34.069> it

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
they exist on the surface of whatever it

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.100 
they exist on the surface of whatever it
is<00:02:34.280> they're<00:02:34.549> highlighting<00:02:35.090> unlike<00:02:35.450> softer

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
is they're highlighting unlike softer

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.660 
is they're highlighting unlike softer
highlights<00:02:36.470> which<00:02:36.890> look<00:02:37.280> like<00:02:37.310> they're

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
highlights which look like they're

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.970 
highlights which look like they're
absorbed<00:02:38.299> into<00:02:38.569> whatever<00:02:39.349> it<00:02:39.680> is<00:02:39.799> they're

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
absorbed into whatever it is they're

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.589 
absorbed into whatever it is they're
highlighting<00:02:40.459> now<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.700> ear<00:02:40.970> has<00:02:41.209> a<00:02:41.239> mixture

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
highlighting now the ear has a mixture

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.899 
highlighting now the ear has a mixture
of<00:02:41.690> both<00:02:41.930> soft<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:42.560> sharp<00:02:43.099> highlights<00:02:43.610> and

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
of both soft and sharp highlights and

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.520 
of both soft and sharp highlights and
that's<00:02:44.060> not<00:02:44.150> how<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.510> inside<00:02:44.900> of<00:02:44.930> my<00:02:45.110> ear<00:02:45.140> look

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
that's not how the inside of my ear look

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.589 
that's not how the inside of my ear look
so<00:02:45.739> I<00:02:45.769> definitely<00:02:46.069> want<00:02:46.579> to<00:02:46.640> study<00:02:46.879> up<00:02:47.120> on<00:02:47.269> oil

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
so I definitely want to study up on oil

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.479 
so I definitely want to study up on oil
painting<00:02:48.140> highlights<00:02:48.560> cuz<00:02:48.980> as<00:02:49.129> of<00:02:49.310> right<00:02:49.459> now

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
painting highlights cuz as of right now

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.009 
painting highlights cuz as of right now
it's<00:02:50.060> giving<00:02:50.390> me<00:02:50.420> a<00:02:50.480> little<00:02:50.599> bit<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:50.840> problem

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
it's giving me a little bit of problem

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.110 
it's giving me a little bit of problem
and<00:02:51.260> that<00:02:51.379> might<00:02:51.650> be<00:02:51.920> just<00:02:51.950> because<00:02:52.670> I<00:02:52.700> don't

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
and that might be just because I don't
