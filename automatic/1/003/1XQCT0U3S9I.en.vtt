00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
before and we actually started design

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.630 
before and we actually started design
and<00:02:10.500> development<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.890> these<00:02:11.009> headsets<00:02:11.400> from

you can plug it in your computer use

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.430 
you can plug it in your computer use
real<00:03:21.359> time<00:03:21.600> you<00:03:21.780> can<00:03:21.900> adjust<00:03:22.170> all<00:03:22.290> the

all the other sounds and focus solely on
footsteps<00:03:27.989> so<00:03:28.350> that's<00:03:28.500> one<00:03:28.709> of<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:28.829> presets

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
footsteps so that's one of the presets

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.610 
footsteps so that's one of the presets
we<00:03:29.220> have<00:03:29.340> is<00:03:29.430> footsteps<00:03:29.850> focus<00:03:30.239> so<00:03:30.780> you<00:03:31.140> can

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
we have is footsteps focus so you can

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.960 
we have is footsteps focus so you can
you<00:03:31.680> know<00:03:31.769> block<00:03:31.950> out<00:03:32.100> all<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.310> explosions<00:03:32.640> so

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
you know block out all the explosions so

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.670 
you know block out all the explosions so
all<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.209> hear<00:03:33.359> footsteps<00:03:33.660> so<00:03:34.260> when<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:34.470> use

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
all you hear footsteps so when you use

surround out of a PC is that right

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.270 
surround out of a PC is that right
that's<00:04:03.239> correct<00:04:03.389> yeah<00:04:03.750> most<00:04:03.989> pcs<00:04:04.440> you're<00:04:05.100> only

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
that's correct yeah most pcs you're only

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.729 
that's correct yeah most pcs you're only
going<00:04:05.489> to<00:04:05.549> get<00:04:05.639> surround<00:04:06.090> sound<00:04:06.500> out<00:04:07.500> of<00:04:07.560> the
