00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:28.290
 it's about time they know that I 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.290
 thrill the jokes 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.679
 and what better than with a caldito they say 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.309

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:44.309

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:51.480

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:53.760

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.010
 a tablespoon of oil if you so 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.860
 they need clear these two areas that 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.160
 are cell pellets and I started with 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.290
 peeled and chopped into cubes a pumpkin 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.180

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.789
 avocado this cascarita that is eaten 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.789
 the wonderful shell 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.720
 it's an avocado that is a little bit more 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.720
 small complaints and face 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.009
 more bitter 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:52.180
 there we leave it there we are going to put to brown 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.090
 onions and 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.670
 is finally up rang vicent started 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.189
 to sound rich along with the carrot and 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.500
 you know that many people then ask me 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:08.020

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.489
 because it's okay to ask they do not serve 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.410
 super good I in my house have the 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.470
 golden because I followers 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.880

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.349
 the food and me what I love is 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.099
 that gives you the opportunity to take a 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:30.170
 very good habit and help another drop 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.540

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.870
 habit what is another father second 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.030
 you really do not have to make an effort 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.099
 so the only thing you have to do is 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.049
 good to buy the pans start 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.030

 he has to take the oil out of the pantry 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.280
 it is no longer enough to add oil to the pan and 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.680
