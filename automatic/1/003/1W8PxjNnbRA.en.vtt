00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
machine that usually would tell us that

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.300 
machine that usually would tell us that
we<00:01:51.360> cannot<00:01:51.720> do<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.680> now<00:01:52.829> all<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.070> need<00:01:53.220> to

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
we cannot do that so now all you need to

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.280 
we cannot do that so now all you need to
do<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.579> take<00:01:53.820> out<00:01:53.970> your<00:01:54.000> echo<00:01:54.360> fill<00:01:54.630> open<00:01:55.170> up

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
do is take out your echo fill open up

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.830 
do is take out your echo fill open up
the<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.860> lid<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.369> empty<00:01:57.000> out<00:01:57.030> those<00:01:57.390> grounds

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
the the lid and empty out those grounds

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.810 
the the lid and empty out those grounds
and<00:01:57.930> then<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.110> can<00:01:58.259> brew<00:01:58.439> another<00:01:58.820> little

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
and then you can brew another little

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.819 
and then you can brew another little
trick<00:02:00.060> would<00:02:00.270> be<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.479> get<00:02:00.600> two<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.170> these<00:02:01.350> so

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
trick would be to get two of these so

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.770 
trick would be to get two of these so
that<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.009> can<00:02:02.310> quickly<00:02:02.549> make<00:02:02.939> multiple<00:02:03.509> cups

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
that you can quickly make multiple cups

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.240 
that you can quickly make multiple cups
that's<00:02:04.020> really<00:02:04.350> useful<00:02:04.469> if<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.829> have<00:02:04.950> friends

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
that's really useful if you have friends

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.310 
that's really useful if you have friends
over<00:02:05.729> or<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.540> really<00:02:06.810> need<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.049> get<00:02:07.170> your

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
over or you really need to get your

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.169 
over or you really need to get your
coffee<00:02:07.469> in<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.710> morning<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.250> get<00:02:08.459> going<00:02:08.849> keep

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
and another reason I say that is the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.500 
and another reason I say that is the
price<00:02:12.790> which<00:02:13.060> is<00:02:13.180> only<00:02:13.680> 1995<00:02:14.680> not<00:02:15.549> a<00:02:15.579> bad<00:02:16.060> price

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510
