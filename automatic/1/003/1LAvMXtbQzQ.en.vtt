00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.729 
91 over here we have 27 and 42 well now
we're<00:02:40.100> getting<00:02:40.280> close<00:02:40.550> to<00:02:40.700> 40<00:02:41.060> so<00:02:41.330> it<00:02:42.320> seems

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
we're getting close to 40 so it seems

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.850 
we're getting close to 40 so it seems
like<00:02:43.010> these<00:02:43.640> guys<00:02:43.700> started<00:02:44.510> firing<00:02:44.930> first<00:02:45.410> so

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
like these guys started firing first so

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.210 
like these guys started firing first so
it<00:02:46.610> seems<00:02:46.910> like<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.270> protection<00:02:47.600> in<00:02:48.110> the

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
it seems like the protection in the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.620 
it seems like the protection in the
forest<00:02:49.220> is<00:02:50.140> significant<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:51.890> also<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:53.390> front

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
forest is significant and also the front

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.130 
forest is significant and also the front
of<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.989> the<00:02:55.360> friendly<00:02:56.360> fire<00:02:56.540> dome<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:57.020> this

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
of the the friendly fire dome to this

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.770 
of the the friendly fire dome to this
unit<00:02:57.500> behind<00:02:57.620> here<00:02:57.980> is<00:02:58.190> also<00:02:58.850> significant<00:02:59.600> and

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
unit behind here is also significant and

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.590 
unit behind here is also significant and
you<00:02:59.840> can<00:02:59.959> see<00:03:00.110> that<00:03:00.320> crossbows<00:03:00.770> cause<00:03:01.610> damage

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
you can see that crossbows cause damage

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.340 
you can see that crossbows cause damage
to<00:03:02.630> units<00:03:03.200> that<00:03:03.410> stand<00:03:04.209> far<00:03:05.209> outside<00:03:05.720> of<00:03:05.780> their

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
to units that stand far outside of their

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.130 
to units that stand far outside of their
range<00:03:06.739> this<00:03:07.160> is<00:03:07.220> their<00:03:07.610> maximum<00:03:08.180> range<00:03:08.420> but

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
range this is their maximum range but

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.229 
range this is their maximum range but
they're<00:03:09.290> actually<00:03:09.650> able<00:03:09.769> to<00:03:09.950> damage<00:03:10.280> troops

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
they're actually able to damage troops

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.770 
they're actually able to damage troops
that<00:03:11.510> are<00:03:11.750> standing<00:03:12.320> this<00:03:13.250> for<00:03:13.550> behind<00:03:13.910> my

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
that are standing this for behind my

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.990 
that are standing this for behind my
general<00:03:15.200> even<00:03:15.440> though<00:03:15.590> he<00:03:16.100> is<00:03:16.190> just<00:03:16.670> at<00:03:16.880> the

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
general even though he is just at the

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.580 
general even though he is just at the
edge<00:03:17.120> of<00:03:17.300> the<00:03:17.450> range<00:03:17.660> it's<00:03:17.840> actually<00:03:18.140> taking<00:03:18.500> a

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
edge of the range it's actually taking a

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.009 
edge of the range it's actually taking a
significant<00:03:19.160> amount<00:03:19.340> of<00:03:19.400> casualties<00:03:19.820> but<00:03:20.630> the

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
significant amount of casualties but the

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.060 
significant amount of casualties but the
test<00:03:21.200> result<00:03:21.560> is<00:03:21.739> fairly<00:03:22.250> conclusive<00:03:22.820> I'd<00:03:22.940> say

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
test result is fairly conclusive I'd say

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.000 
test result is fairly conclusive I'd say
putting<00:03:25.070> your<00:03:25.190> troops<00:03:25.430> in<00:03:25.580> a<00:03:25.700> forest<00:03:26.030> is

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
putting your troops in a forest is

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.400 
putting your troops in a forest is
definitely<00:03:28.010> going<00:03:28.489> to<00:03:28.580> help<00:03:29.150> you<00:03:29.420> to<00:03:30.019> protect

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
definitely going to help you to protect

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.089 
definitely going to help you to protect
them<00:03:30.739> better<00:03:30.950> than<00:03:31.340> having<00:03:31.580> them<00:03:31.850> in<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.239> open

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
them better than having them in the open

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.060 
them better than having them in the open
strength<00:03:33.819> the<00:03:33.909> motor
