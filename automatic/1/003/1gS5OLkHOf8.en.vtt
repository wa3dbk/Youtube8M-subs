what's the role of a story within a
video<00:02:59.220> game<00:02:59.459> I<00:02:59.750> think<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.799> story<00:03:02.099> is

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
video game I think the the story is

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.160 
video game I think the the story is
there<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:03.120> help<00:03:03.659> enhance<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.409> gameplay<00:03:06.170> yeah

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940

I think I still think the gameplay is
king<00:03:09.299> but<00:03:09.599> i<00:03:09.629> think<00:03:10.019> what<00:03:10.379> story<00:03:10.860> can<00:03:11.159> add<00:03:11.430> 2<00:03:12.090> 2

see<00:03:56.489> the<00:03:56.639> story<00:03:56.970> everywhere<00:03:57.620> and<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:58.680> just

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
see the story everywhere and you just

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.890 
see the story everywhere and you just
mentioned<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.280> differences<00:03:59.760> between<00:03:59.900> books

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
mentioned the differences between books

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.569 
mentioned the differences between books
and<00:04:01.169> movies<00:04:01.290> on<00:04:01.560> one<00:04:01.709> side<00:04:01.980> and<00:04:02.010> then<00:04:02.280> video

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
and movies on one side and then video

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.699 
and movies on one side and then video
games<00:04:02.790> in<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.000> other<00:04:03.260> does<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:04.380> make<00:04:04.560> it

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
games in the other does it make it

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.559 
games in the other does it make it
harder<00:04:05.129> to<00:04:05.160> write<00:04:05.459> for<00:04:05.700> video<00:04:05.970> games<00:04:06.030> than

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
harder to write for video games than

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.150 
harder to write for video games than
four<00:04:07.079> books<00:04:07.319> or<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.560> movie<00:04:07.709> because<00:04:08.069> the

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
four books or a movie because the

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.430 
four books or a movie because the
players<00:04:08.370> always<00:04:08.609> involved<00:04:09.090> I<00:04:09.319> mean<00:04:10.319> I<00:04:10.410> think

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
players always involved I mean I think

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.770 
players always involved I mean I think
that<00:04:10.859> that<00:04:10.889> games<00:04:11.430> games<00:04:12.209> writing<00:04:12.510> can<00:04:12.750> be

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
that that games games writing can be

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.690 
that that games games writing can be
incredibly<00:04:13.169> hard<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:13.709> go<00:04:13.859> storytelling<00:04:14.489> can

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
incredibly hard and go storytelling can

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.670 
incredibly hard and go storytelling can
be<00:04:14.819> incredibly<00:04:15.060> hard<00:04:15.540> because<00:04:15.840> you're

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
be incredibly hard because you're

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.860 
be incredibly hard because you're
constantly<00:04:16.950> at<00:04:17.609> odds<00:04:17.820> with<00:04:18.060> with<00:04:18.570> all<00:04:18.720> the

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
constantly at odds with with all the

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.589 
constantly at odds with with all the
other<00:04:19.489> production<00:04:20.489> elements<00:04:20.639> of<00:04:20.970> games<00:04:21.180> so

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
other production elements of games so

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.800 
other production elements of games so
level<00:04:22.019> this<00:04:22.139> iron<00:04:22.380> in<00:04:22.620> gameplay<00:04:22.860> and<00:04:23.610> story<00:04:23.810> I

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
level this iron in gameplay and story I

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.400 
level this iron in gameplay and story I
mean<00:04:25.020> story<00:04:25.320> is<00:04:25.440> still<00:04:25.560> I<00:04:26.930> mean<00:04:27.930> I<00:04:27.990> said<00:04:28.199> that

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
mean story is still I mean I said that

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.110 
mean story is still I mean I said that
there's<00:04:28.620> always<00:04:28.919> been<00:04:29.039> the<00:04:29.160> story<00:04:29.430> of<00:04:29.490> a<00:04:29.729> sort

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
there's always been the story of a sort

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.710 
there's always been the story of a sort
but<00:04:31.490> kind<00:04:32.490> of<00:04:32.520> really<00:04:32.880> folding<00:04:33.360> in<00:04:33.449> story

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
but kind of really folding in story

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.330 
but kind of really folding in story
properly<00:04:33.900> with<00:04:34.229> gameplay<00:04:34.620> I<00:04:34.710> think<00:04:35.010> it's

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
properly with gameplay I think it's

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.010 
properly with gameplay I think it's
still<00:04:35.520> sort<00:04:35.789> of<00:04:35.820> fairly<00:04:36.030> new<00:04:36.300> and<00:04:36.419> we're<00:04:36.780> still

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
still sort of fairly new and we're still

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.420 
still sort of fairly new and we're still
looking<00:04:37.320> at<00:04:37.410> the<00:04:37.560> best<00:04:37.710> way<00:04:37.919> to<00:04:37.979> do<00:04:38.190> that<00:04:38.220> I

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
looking at the best way to do that I

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.750 
looking at the best way to do that I
think<00:04:38.780> we've<00:04:39.780> moved<00:04:40.110> on<00:04:40.530> from<00:04:40.979> from<00:04:41.370> saying<00:04:41.580> do

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
think we've moved on from from saying do

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.820 
think we've moved on from from saying do
games<00:04:42.000> need<00:04:42.300> writers<00:04:42.539> and<00:04:43.080> do<00:04:43.440> games<00:04:43.560> need

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
games need writers and do games need

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:44.990 
games need writers and do games need
professional<00:04:44.250> storytellers<00:04:44.729> I<00:04:44.849> think

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
professional storytellers I think

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.500 
professional storytellers I think
everyone<00:04:45.389> agrees<00:04:45.539> that<00:04:45.750> yes<00:04:46.139> that<00:04:46.380> they<00:04:47.310> do<00:04:47.510> if

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
everyone agrees that yes that they do if

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.629 
everyone agrees that yes that they do if
you<00:04:48.690> if<00:04:48.840> you<00:04:48.960> have<00:04:49.110> a<00:04:49.139> story<00:04:49.410> with<00:04:49.650> a<00:04:50.070> strong

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
you if you have a story with a strong

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:51.860 
you if you have a story with a strong
narrative<00:04:50.849> then<00:04:51.210> yes<00:04:51.389> you<00:04:51.419> should<00:04:51.720> get<00:04:51.810> a

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
narrative then yes you should get a

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.990 
narrative then yes you should get a
narrative<00:04:52.260> professional<00:04:52.830> to<00:04:52.919> do<00:04:53.099> it<00:04:53.130> the

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
narrative professional to do it the

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.180 
narrative professional to do it the
question<00:04:54.419> is<00:04:54.539> now<00:04:54.810> how<00:04:55.199> do<00:04:55.470> you<00:04:55.620> use<00:04:55.949> them

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
question is now how do you use them

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.409 
question is now how do you use them
properly<00:04:56.310> how<00:04:56.669> do<00:04:56.729> you<00:04:56.820> integrate<00:04:57.030> them<00:04:57.330> in

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
properly how do you integrate them in

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:00.080 
properly how do you integrate them in
the<00:04:57.510> team<00:04:57.780> at<00:04:58.590> one<00:04:58.740> point<00:04:58.919> do<00:04:59.099> you<00:04:59.130> get<00:04:59.340> them<00:04:59.460> in

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
the team at one point do you get them in

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.990 
the team at one point do you get them in
you<00:05:00.419> know<00:05:00.540> what<00:05:00.750> information<00:05:01.290> do<00:05:01.410> they<00:05:01.440> need

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
you know what information do they need

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.790 
you know what information do they need
you<00:05:03.000> know<00:05:03.090> how<00:05:03.270> can<00:05:03.840> you<00:05:04.260> know<00:05:04.350> developers

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
you know how can you know developers

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.050 
you know how can you know developers
hell<00:05:04.949> the<00:05:05.040> writer<00:05:05.220> happen<00:05:05.639> right<00:05:05.790> to<00:05:05.910> help

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
hell the writer happen right to help

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.550 
hell the writer happen right to help
developers<00:05:06.510> so<00:05:06.660> I<00:05:06.720> think<00:05:06.780> that's<00:05:07.020> the<00:05:07.169> problem

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
developers so I think that's the problem

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.620 
developers so I think that's the problem
we're<00:05:07.800> dealing<00:05:07.830> at<00:05:08.220> the<00:05:08.310> moment<00:05:08.639> how<00:05:09.449> do<00:05:09.510> you

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
we're dealing at the moment how do you

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.300 
we're dealing at the moment how do you
feel<00:05:09.900> that<00:05:10.139> Deb<00:05:10.410> games<00:05:10.680> writing<00:05:11.040> should

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
feel that Deb games writing should

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.159 
feel that Deb games writing should
develop<00:05:11.639> over<00:05:12.090> over<00:05:12.330> the<00:05:12.419> coming<00:05:12.660> few<00:05:12.960> years

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
develop over over the coming few years

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.500 
develop over over the coming few years
what's<00:05:13.680> the<00:05:13.860> ideal<00:05:14.190> place<00:05:14.550> to<00:05:14.580> be<00:05:14.970> in<00:05:15.120> in<00:05:15.270> a<00:05:15.360> few

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
what's the ideal place to be in in a few

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.230 
what's the ideal place to be in in a few
years<00:05:16.070> well<00:05:17.070> I<00:05:17.100> think<00:05:17.190> the<00:05:17.340> ideal<00:05:17.610> place<00:05:17.820> is

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
years well I think the ideal place is

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.240 
years well I think the ideal place is
for<00:05:18.780> developers<00:05:19.320> to<00:05:19.350> start<00:05:19.770> thinking<00:05:20.160> about

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
for developers to start thinking about

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.730 
for developers to start thinking about
writers<00:05:20.760> much<00:05:20.970> early<00:05:21.419> on<00:05:21.449> it<00:05:21.630> in<00:05:22.020> in<00:05:22.470> the

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
writers much early on it in in the

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.270 
writers much early on it in in the
production<00:05:23.190> process<00:05:23.460> and<00:05:24.229> talk<00:05:25.229> to<00:05:25.440> any<00:05:25.889> games

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
production process and talk to any games

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.950 
production process and talk to any games
writer<00:05:26.669> and<00:05:27.030> they'll<00:05:27.419> tell<00:05:27.630> you<00:05:27.690> that<00:05:27.870> the

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
writer and they'll tell you that the

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.260 
writer and they'll tell you that the
sooner<00:05:28.199> they<00:05:28.410> get<00:05:28.530> involved<00:05:28.830> better<00:05:29.310> and<00:05:29.729> that

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
sooner they get involved better and that

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
sooner they get involved better and that
isn't<00:05:30.660> really<00:05:30.840> some<00:05:31.199> kind<00:05:31.229> of<00:05:32.990> plea<00:05:33.990> that<00:05:34.020> we

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
isn't really some kind of plea that we

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.680 
isn't really some kind of plea that we
just<00:05:34.770> want<00:05:34.889> to<00:05:34.950> be<00:05:35.040> a<00:05:35.070> no<00:05:35.790> studying<00:05:36.389> paid

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
just want to be a no studying paid

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.290 
just want to be a no studying paid
earlier<00:05:37.290> we<00:05:37.770> or<00:05:38.190> anything<00:05:38.610> like<00:05:38.639> that<00:05:38.760> it's

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
earlier we or anything like that it's
