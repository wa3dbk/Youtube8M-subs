00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.210 
siglo that you lose traction from
I<00:02:14.150> mean<00:02:15.050> it<00:02:15.140> probably<00:02:15.200> has<00:02:15.740> a<00:02:15.770> little<00:02:16.130> effect

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
I mean it probably has a little effect

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.210 
I mean it probably has a little effect
to<00:02:16.580> it<00:02:16.700> but<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.660> main<00:02:17.840> thing<00:02:18.080> is<00:02:18.260> these<00:02:18.740> two

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
to it but the main thing is these two

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.940 
to it but the main thing is these two
pots<00:02:19.550> were<00:02:19.820> exposed<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.570> UV<00:02:20.750> rays<00:02:21.230> for<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.590> good

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
pots were exposed to UV rays for a good

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.460 
pots were exposed to UV rays for a good
probably<00:02:22.340> 3040<00:02:23.180> hours<00:02:23.510> like<00:02:23.660> I<00:02:23.780> mentioned<00:02:24.290> and

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
probably 3040 hours like I mentioned and

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.710 
probably 3040 hours like I mentioned and
as<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.520> can<00:02:25.640> see<00:02:25.820> a<00:02:25.850> little<00:02:26.090> bit<00:02:26.210> of<00:02:26.300> whitening

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
as you can see a little bit of whitening

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.240 
as you can see a little bit of whitening
but<00:02:27.380> it's<00:02:28.220> lost<00:02:29.440> some<00:02:30.440> of<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.650> traction<00:02:30.920> on

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
but it's lost some of the traction on

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.250 
but it's lost some of the traction on
here<00:02:31.520> so<00:02:34.600> you<00:02:35.600> can<00:02:35.690> see<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:35.870> little<00:02:36.020> bit<00:02:36.200> of

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
here so you can see a little bit of

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.740 
here so you can see a little bit of
fading<00:02:36.710> it's<00:02:36.860> it's<00:02:37.040> part<00:02:37.340> of<00:02:37.430> some<00:02:37.610> of<00:02:37.700> the

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.940 

ruts<00:02:41.750> are<00:02:41.900> bright<00:02:42.170> but<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:42.620> got<00:02:42.740> to<00:02:42.830> really

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
ruts are bright but you got to really

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.250 
ruts are bright but you got to really
watch<00:02:43.220> out<00:02:43.430> for<00:02:43.700> it<00:02:43.880> but<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.750> other<00:02:44.900> one<00:02:45.080> looks

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
watch out for it but the other one looks

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.600 
watch out for it but the other one looks
perfectly<00:02:45.680> fine<00:02:45.880> did<00:02:46.880> some<00:02:47.060> cutouts<00:02:48.430> day<00:02:49.430> and

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
perfectly fine did some cutouts day and

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.220 
perfectly fine did some cutouts day and
day<00:02:49.730> they<00:02:49.910> got<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.180> same<00:02:50.330> traction<00:02:50.840> it<00:02:50.990> looks

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
day they got the same traction it looks

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.110 
day they got the same traction it looks
like<00:02:51.410> these<00:02:51.590> just<00:02:51.770> came<00:02:52.010> right<00:02:52.489> off<00:02:52.520> the<00:02:52.910> bat

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
like these just came right off the bat

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.870 
like these just came right off the bat
from<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:54.590> know<00:02:54.680> right<00:02:55.040> off<00:02:55.190> right<00:02:55.520> off<00:02:55.580> the

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
from you know right off right off the

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.540 
from you know right off right off the
box<00:02:56.090> so<00:02:56.420> but<00:02:57.350> just<00:02:57.650> that's<00:02:57.770> the<00:02:58.010> main<00:02:58.190> thing<00:02:58.459> I

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
box so but just that's the main thing I

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.240 
box so but just that's the main thing I
will<00:02:58.820> point<00:02:58.850> out<00:02:59.209> as<00:02:59.450> a<00:02:59.510> concern<00:02:59.959> my<00:03:00.709> setup<00:03:01.010> is

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
will point out as a concern my setup is

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.660 
will point out as a concern my setup is
pretty<00:03:01.520> well<00:03:01.760> know<00:03:02.480> so<00:03:02.750> separation<00:03:03.580> you<00:03:04.580> know

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
pretty well know so separation you know

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.580 
pretty well know so separation you know
depending<00:03:05.120> on<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:08.600> life<00:03:08.900> of<00:03:09.140> your<00:03:09.260> kicks

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
depending on the the life of your kicks

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.280 
depending on the the life of your kicks
and<00:03:09.830> then<00:03:09.950> how<00:03:10.300> you've<00:03:11.300> used<00:03:11.570> it<00:03:11.720> and<00:03:11.780> so<00:03:11.959> forth

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
and then how you've used it and so forth

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.810 
and then how you've used it and so forth
