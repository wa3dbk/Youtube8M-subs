that have come out in the last three
years<00:00:36.710> and<00:00:37.010> looking<00:00:37.610> forward<00:00:38.149> there's<00:00:38.629> I

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
years and looking forward there's I

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.660 
years and looking forward there's I
think<00:00:38.930> the<00:00:39.320> statistic<00:00:39.500> i<00:00:39.920> recently<00:00:40.250> read<00:00:40.489> that

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
think the statistic i recently read that

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.920 
think the statistic i recently read that
in<00:00:40.820> North<00:00:41.120> America<00:00:41.539> alone<00:00:41.690> there'll<00:00:41.899> be

automotive industry with the OEMs and

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.169 
automotive industry with the OEMs and

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:56.179 
suppliers in that relationship has been

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:58.389 
suppliers in that relationship has been
a<00:00:56.239> turbulent<00:00:56.570> one<00:00:57.170> what's<00:00:57.559> happening<00:00:57.949> now<00:00:58.129> is

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
a turbulent one what's happening now is

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.520 
a turbulent one what's happening now is
a<00:00:58.429> lot<00:00:58.670> more<00:00:58.820> collaboration<00:00:59.629> between<00:01:00.019> the<00:01:00.260> two

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
a lot more collaboration between the two

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.829 
a lot more collaboration between the two
because<00:01:01.039> the<00:01:01.219> OEMs<00:01:01.730> understand<00:01:02.300> that<00:01:02.660> they

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
because the OEMs understand that they

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.530 
because the OEMs understand that they
have<00:01:02.870> to<00:01:03.109> have<00:01:03.280> profitable<00:01:04.330> suppliers<00:01:05.330> to
