 foto maren your partner for foto and 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:21.150
 studio accessories on www.hotel.de in 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.949
 In this chapter I want the little one 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.439
 make a trip and explain yourself 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.939
 why an exposure meter works 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.099
 you should definitely have part already 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.960
 every photographer is important 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.279
 and what holds up has one 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.200
 one with one 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.480
 Exposure meter runs around and then 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.510
 always to the models in the race and then 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.739
 stops here holds such a movement 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.809
 I'm sure you've got that somewhere 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.350
 seen that went is not there to 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.120
 measure up 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.890
 I already had in the last chapter 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.690
 said that I have an exposure meter 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.850
 relatively seldom used today 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.800
 You can also be quite good of mine 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.800
 opinion left on the display 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.090
 It was not that way before 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.250
 just photographed on film 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.250
 and yes you could not just three 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.470
 take test photos and then watch fits 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.650
 or do not pass how does that work 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.930
 whole on the light meter I have 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.850
 the same attitudes as on the 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.200
 Camera that means I'm the first 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.450
 my iso value with me 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.250
 wants to take photos in this case 100 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.729
 then I set my exposure time 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.030
 on 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:28.740
 that's I think we had 125 like that and 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.630
 Now I hold the light meter 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.909
 I do not adjust the aperture 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.040
 Now I hold the light meter 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.840
 where I want to measure the light 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.240
 and that's just where my model 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.030
 I will stand with the direction 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.070
 where the light should fit 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.659
 this is of course as close as possible to the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.250
 so you fumble with the face 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.479
 So always stay here right on the 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.340
 Face of the models rum 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.960
 Now I have to trigger once 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.079
 I hope the camera sees that 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.420
 here is a small button the press 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.369
 me and now he is waiting now 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.810
 light meter almost in a flash 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:06.960
 I now solvent from the trigger 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:10.550
 and now he has measured how much light 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.170
 there is such and you see 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:18.320
 the light meter now showed 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:21.230
 at 56 that is that lightning that celebrates 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:25.400
 now light up for the crowd 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.320
 56 Now I can either use my camera 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.380
 adjust to this aperture and say 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.330
 hey that fits and then everything will be fine 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.920
 or I have one before me 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.110
 dazzling and that's it 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.450
 so-called working aperture normally 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.070
 you do not adjust your iris in a flash 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.960
 but gives a dazzling front 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.510
 For example, but I want to say 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.010
 take pictures with four or 28 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.990
 or dazzle 8 or whatever 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.300
 and then I have the lightning long 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.640
 adjust until the power suits 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.980
 Let's assume we want to dazzle 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.700
 take four pictures 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.900
 then the lightning has too much power 56 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.720
 to blind 4 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.140
 that would be a dazzling stage that is 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.480
 I have to be in a flash now 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.240
 reduce so that it light for iris 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:15.200
 four releases so now I'll go back 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:18.290
 press once on minus reduce it 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:24.640
 the light output around a blind meter 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:28.880
 fire now and fire again 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.090
 presentation succeeded you seht aperture 40 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:36.800
 that is now the flash output 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:41.180
 for 4 0 from there is still a second number 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:44.180
 and right here on the top you can see that 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.370
 there under iso so iso 100 a 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.190
 percentages are in this case 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.750
 there 90 percent 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.020
 that indicates with this light meter 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.390
 how much ambient or daylight with 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.790
 the exposure is involved in this 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.570
 case is then 90 percent that is 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:06.830
 so this light is the flash light that 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:09.230
 reported the picture to 90 percent and 10 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.600
 percent daylight with the game though 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.340
 me, for example, my look though 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.790
 high three 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:20.350
 I'll say one more blind 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.350
 I have to be back at 5.6 

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:25.639
 I'm probably 50 now because I am 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.340
 something closer was 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:32.639
 but now 100 is up there that is 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:37.110
 now the lightning has so much power 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:39.060
 at blinding 56 or 50 the lightning lot 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.750
 much brighter than the day is not only 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.879
 the lightning the picture illuminates son 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.150
 I can stop this ad 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:50.180
 weighting between lightning and daylight 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.650
 if you are outside, for example 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.000
 photographed and one on one 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.889
 that means you want to have a relationship 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.280
 We want the lightning as bright as we have 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:02.069
 the ambient light then you have here 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.650
 50 50 reach 50 percent 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:06.569
 daylight 50% flashing light and then it is 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.819
 that quite balanced and then the 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:10.289
 dramaturgy in the picture to regulate something 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:12.690
 can you just say yes he goes 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:15.659
 perhaps 70 percent 80 percent 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.940
 and the more lightning in the game is all the more 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:19.500
 but your background becomes darker 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.990
 Let's come back to an extra chapter 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.360
 that's basically the way it works 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.879
 from an exposure meter that has one here 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.940
 above another so -called mesz 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:34.349
 calotte this is this this one 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.849
 white if she drives out of it and yes that 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:38.190
 is just the thing where the light is measured 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:39.270
 if that is sunk so 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.889
 retracted 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.699
 then yes, then I measure rather narrow 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.469
 lichtkegel 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:48.589
 that is, this carl otte is from 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:51.029
 shielded from the side I drive out the 

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:52.740
 then you have to stop the light thing 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:54.210
 more comes from the side and I was 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.400
 actually quite good with that 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.740
 this carrot i drive you content 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.960
 then the light of all will be 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.960
 measured and not only very narrow 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.190
 what's right with his 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.719
 Of course you can report even better 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.699
 Do a lot more 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:13.919
 you can thus for example also 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:15.449
 measure daylight or ambient light 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:19.409
 then I have to go to another one here 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:21.270
 mode then go make this one then 

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:22.500
 I'm here on his solar mode with it 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.560
 I can now, for example, our livestock 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.630
 not measure the eu and what to do here 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.150
 example, the big advantage over the 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:32.850
 Light meter in the camera is that 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.500
 i will measure the incoming light if you 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.360
 a little bit with camera technology and 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.600
 Metering was busy then 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.770
 Do you know that the camera is misting? 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.710
 what is reflected 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.090
 so much light is reflected as to 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.390
 Example of a white wall 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:50.700
 then the camera thinks that is very bright 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.620
 I have to make darker is less light 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:56.220
 reflects eg from a black wall 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:58.710
 thinks the camera us but dark here and 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.140
 trying to make the whole picture brighter 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.150
 as a problem to the story is if 

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.910
 I now eric the eric in front of a white wall 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:07.919
 then I take another picture 

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.650
 exposure in the camera as to 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:11.730
 Example in front of a black wall 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.070
 but I always want the erika the same 

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:15.840
 bright pictures and here comes then so 

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.640
 light meter into the game of 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.830
 light meter is just not that 

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:23.730
 light what is reflected but me 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:26.790
 hold him where the music plays and 

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:28.530
 Here I measure the light which arrives and 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:31.200
 The light meter does not care 

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:33.960
 whether behind a white wall and a 

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:36.330
 black wall or a green or eric 

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.669
 or whatever is moderate with it 

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.650
 incoming light and so seen around 

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:45.630
 light meter, of course, much more accurate 

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:47.430
 but as I said yes that I no 

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:49.919
 friend of this would be exaggerated though 

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:52.320
 I'm more of a guy who tries 

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:54.930
 as little equipment to region 

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:57.120
 races and today's displays are on 

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:59.460
 actually quite good to look and 

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.620
 then about the exposure based 

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:04.620
 one purely of a purely visual one 

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:06.090
 therefore, to determine impressively 

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.100
 you have to decide for yourself if you want to be 

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:10.820
 I would like to find something to use 

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.820
 Don `t need it
