00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.800
 family tradition and sharing are 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:22.960
 three perfect words to represent the 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.310
 cook my kitchen but I also think the 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:30.640
 yours and what better than a cake 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.309
 homemade can represent all and 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.300
 three words tradition because in short 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.950
 each of us has a family cake 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.750
 sharing because the cake does not 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.550
 only for us I do it for me too 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.910
 you know I can eat it too 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.520
 all but usually for others 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.650
 and in short family because in any case the 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.870
 cake always reminds us of someone there 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.970
 it always brings back some affections 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.250
 in my case those of my mom that 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.820
 My grandmother's making a cake is a lot 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.910
 simple 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.269
 this time it is putting a little imagination 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.119
 also with the basic ingredients of the 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.350
 in fact, very simple ingredients today 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.350
 prepare a cake 

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:13.230
 I combined eggs and sugar very simply 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.500
 inside the robot to create a 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.269
 cream and then oil the water is now 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.940
 I go with the lemon rind 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:24.110
 the robot in this recipe is mine 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.110
 perfect ally 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.760
 I used two different flour the 00 flour 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.550
 and spelled flour to give a tone 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.900
 different is my cake a little bit special 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.670
 and now one thing is still missing 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.280
 we are never jam or jam 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.069
 ask yourself what it means if there is a 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.799
 sure difference that there is jam and 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.810
 the citrus one with the rest of the 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.180
 fruit is then made jam 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.569
 as I use for williams use the 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.569
 jam 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.320
 here is the dough for my cake 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.760
 water is ready in the oven at 180 degrees 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.760
 for about 40 minutes 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.220
 to make it even easier but 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:15.460
 tasty my cake let's call it this way 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.370
 other times because made with water use 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.530
 the jam directly cold as well 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.390
 spending it well and finally the 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.120
 garnish with grain of 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.510
 hazelnuts because the pears and hazelnuts of the 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.510
