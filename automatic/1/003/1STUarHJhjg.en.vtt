00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.960 
theology modem let's have a look here
the<00:03:21.750> internals<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:22.470> there<00:03:23.130> it<00:03:23.250> is<00:03:23.280> verizon

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
the internals and there it is verizon

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.580 
the internals and there it is verizon
sim<00:03:24.510> card<00:03:24.780> bet<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.080> never<00:03:25.170> thought<00:03:25.290> you'd<00:03:25.440> see

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
the day verizon sim card so those are

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.340 
the day verizon sim card so those are
those<00:03:30.330> are<00:03:30.390> finally<00:03:30.870> there<00:03:31.050> let's<00:03:31.709> see<00:03:31.950> here<00:03:32.190> a

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
those are finally there let's see here a

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.699 
those are finally there let's see here a
little<00:03:34.350> thing<00:03:35.870> to<00:03:36.870> oh<00:03:36.900> I'm<00:03:37.230> sorry<00:03:37.380> a<00:03:37.500> little

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.830 
little thing to oh I'm sorry a little
thing<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:38.010> guess<00:03:38.130> you<00:03:38.220> do<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.370> like<00:03:38.430> that<00:03:38.660> to<00:03:39.660> add

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
thing I guess you do it like that to add

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.250 
thing I guess you do it like that to add
to<00:03:39.870> stick<00:03:40.200> it<00:03:40.320> in<00:03:40.410> little<00:03:41.250> doohickey<00:03:42.030> and<00:03:42.360> then

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
to stick it in little doohickey and then

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.330 
to stick it in little doohickey and then
a<00:03:43.290> i<00:03:43.440> did<00:03:43.769> a<00:03:43.800> USB<00:03:44.450> extender<00:03:45.450> so<00:03:45.890> you<00:03:46.890> cannot<00:03:47.190> you

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
a i did a USB extender so you cannot you

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.430 
a i did a USB extender so you cannot you
can<00:03:47.459> plug<00:03:47.640> it<00:03:47.760> in<00:03:47.820> this<00:03:47.940> way<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.989> your<00:03:49.080> computer

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
can plug it in this way to your computer

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.840 
can plug it in this way to your computer
versus<00:03:49.739> plugging<00:03:50.100> it<00:03:50.190> directly<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.700> if<00:03:50.790> you

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
versus plugging it directly and if you

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.729 
versus plugging it directly and if you
have<00:03:50.940> a<00:03:51.000> tight<00:03:51.209> USB<00:03:51.600> port<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:52.380> know<00:03:52.470> you<00:03:52.530> have

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
have a tight USB port you know you have

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:53.780 
have a tight USB port you know you have
a<00:03:52.769> bunch<00:03:52.920> of<00:03:53.040> things<00:03:53.160> plugged<00:03:53.370> into<00:03:53.550> the<00:03:53.640> other

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
a bunch of things plugged into the other

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.550 
a bunch of things plugged into the other
ones<00:03:53.970> you<00:03:54.030> can<00:03:54.180> do<00:03:54.269> this<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:54.690> then<00:03:55.140> plug<00:03:55.350> it<00:03:55.470> in

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
ones you can do this and then plug it in

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.290 
ones you can do this and then plug it in
so<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:55.739> makes<00:03:55.830> a<00:03:55.920> little<00:03:55.980> bit<00:03:56.190> easier<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:57.209> a

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
so it makes a little bit easier and a

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.080 
so it makes a little bit easier and a
little<00:03:57.420> bit<00:03:57.630> smaller<00:03:57.840> so<00:03:58.019> in<00:03:58.580> the<00:03:59.580> box<00:03:59.790> you

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
little bit smaller so in the box you

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.840 
little bit smaller so in the box you
know<00:04:00.180> not<00:04:00.300> too<00:04:00.570> much<00:04:00.830> but<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:02.070> above<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.489> USB

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
know not too much but the above the USB

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.090 
know not too much but the above the USB
stick<00:04:03.090> is<00:04:03.300> definitely<00:04:03.780> definitely<00:04:04.560> large

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
stick is definitely definitely large

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.240 
stick is definitely definitely large
let's<00:04:05.370> take<00:04:05.519> a<00:04:05.550> look<00:04:05.790> here<00:04:06.030> at<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:07.440> SIM<00:04:07.950> card

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
let's take a look here at the SIM card

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.090 
let's take a look here at the SIM card
yeah<00:04:09.000> i'm<00:04:09.870> part<00:04:10.230> of<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.350> typical<00:04:10.620> sim<00:04:10.860> card

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
yeah i'm part of the typical sim card

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.780 
yeah i'm part of the typical sim card
