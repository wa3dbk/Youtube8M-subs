great way to stir-fry without using
extra<00:02:28.160> oil<00:02:30.640> keeping<00:02:31.640> it<00:02:31.760> nice<00:02:31.970> and

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
extra oil keeping it nice and

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:39.009 
extra oil keeping it nice and
heart-healthy<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:37.060> tiny<00:02:38.060> bit<00:02:38.360> of<00:02:38.450> moisture<00:02:38.959> in

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
heart-healthy a tiny bit of moisture in

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.050 
heart-healthy a tiny bit of moisture in
there<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.290> is<00:02:39.410> sticking<00:02:39.769> slightly<00:02:40.430> but<00:02:40.730> I'm

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
there it is sticking slightly but I'm

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.420 
there it is sticking slightly but I'm
going<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.510> add<00:02:41.690> half<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:42.230> cup<00:02:42.440> of<00:02:42.470> frozen<00:02:43.010> peas

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
going to add half a cup of frozen peas

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.280 
going to add half a cup of frozen peas
so<00:02:44.239> they<00:02:44.420> will<00:02:44.660> add<00:02:44.810> a<00:02:44.840> little<00:02:45.080> bit<00:02:45.260> of

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
so they will add a little bit of

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.590 
so they will add a little bit of
moisture<00:02:45.500> as<00:02:45.950> well<00:02:46.239> because<00:02:47.239> they<00:02:47.360> have<00:02:47.390> just

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
moisture as well because they have just

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:57.490 
moisture as well because they have just
come<00:02:47.870> out<00:02:48.050> of<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.230> freezer<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:57.019> same<00:02:57.319> thing

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
come out of the freezer the same thing

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.710 
come out of the freezer the same thing
again<00:02:57.739> this<00:02:57.860> is<00:02:58.069> half<00:02:58.310> a<00:02:58.459> cup<00:02:58.489> of<00:02:58.910> frozen<00:02:59.209> corn

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
again this is half a cup of frozen corn

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.440 
again this is half a cup of frozen corn
kernels<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:01.010> again<00:03:01.550> they<00:03:01.760> go<00:03:01.880> add<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.150> bit<00:03:02.360> of

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
kernels and again they go add a bit of

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.680 
kernels and again they go add a bit of
moisture<00:03:02.870> because<00:03:03.170> they<00:03:03.290> have<00:03:03.470> been<00:03:03.650> frozen

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
moisture because they have been frozen

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.530 
moisture because they have been frozen

leads<00:03:37.820> from<00:03:38.299> just<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.290> ends<00:03:39.709> that<00:03:39.859> I<00:03:39.920> had<00:03:40.250> not

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
leads from just the ends that I had not

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.530 
leads from just the ends that I had not
just<00:03:41.390> set<00:03:41.630> them<00:03:41.810> in<00:03:41.930> a<00:03:42.019> little<00:03:42.140> bit

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
water for a few days and they like to

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.399 
water for a few days and they like to
regrow<00:03:46.859> so<00:03:47.400> I<00:03:47.819> usually<00:03:48.719> only<00:03:48.840> do<00:03:49.049> it<00:03:49.140> a<00:03:49.200> few

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:49.409 
regrow so I usually only do it a few

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:51.830 
regrow so I usually only do it a few
times<00:03:49.469> because<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.340> bottoms<00:03:50.700> do<00:03:51.329> tend<00:03:51.629> to<00:03:51.659> get

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
times because the bottoms do tend to get

slimy<00:03:52.439> after<00:03:52.769> a<00:03:52.799> while<00:03:53.599> but<00:03:54.599> it's<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:54.840> great<00:03:55.079> way

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
slimy after a while but it's a great way

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:03.099
