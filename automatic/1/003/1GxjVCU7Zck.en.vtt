my cringe they must have been probably
you<00:00:33.030> know<00:00:33.120> some<00:00:33.840> water<00:00:34.050> than<00:00:34.290> 700<00:00:34.829> mil<00:00:35.010> but

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
you know some water than 700 mil but

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.850 
you know some water than 700 mil but
it's<00:00:36.059> right<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.300> BMX<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.960> lot<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.410> sort<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.680> use

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
it's right a BMX a lot and I sort of use

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.410 
it's right a BMX a lot and I sort of use
really<00:00:38.129> narrow<00:00:38.399> bars<00:00:38.700> for<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.270> thought

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
really narrow bars for that so I thought

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.729 
really narrow bars for that so I thought
was<00:00:39.540> cool<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.870> use<00:00:39.989> them<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> dining<00:00:40.530> hall<00:00:40.559> by

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
was cool to use them on a dining hall by

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.410 
was cool to use them on a dining hall by
okay<00:00:43.739> wide<00:00:44.010> bars<00:00:44.340> what<00:00:44.879> are<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.090> pros<00:00:45.390> of

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
okay wide bars what are the pros of

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.930 
okay wide bars what are the pros of
using<00:00:45.660> wide<00:00:46.260> bars<00:00:46.559> but<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.309> think<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.700> biggest

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
using wide bars but I think the biggest

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.360 
using wide bars but I think the biggest
thing<00:00:48.239> for<00:00:48.270> me<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:49.050> have<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> nice<00:00:49.559> big<00:00:49.829> big

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
thing for me is you have a nice big big

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.760 
thing for me is you have a nice big big
wide<00:00:50.610> bar<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.840> makes<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.289> bike<00:00:52.469> feel

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
wide bar and it makes the bike feel

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.490 
wide bar and it makes the bike feel
really<00:00:53.129> planted<00:00:53.610> really<00:00:53.940> stable<00:00:54.629> you've<00:00:55.379> got

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
really planted really stable you've got

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.470 
really planted really stable you've got
a<00:00:55.530> lot<00:00:55.739> more<00:00:55.890> leverage<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> corners<00:00:57.239> and

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
a lot more leverage in the corners and

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.750 
a lot more leverage in the corners and
you<00:00:58.109> really<00:00:58.440> feel<00:00:58.649> like<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:59.039> are<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.250> control

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
you really feel like you are in control

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.200 
you really feel like you are in control
of<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.210> it's<00:01:00.420> confidence-inspiring

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
of that and it's confidence-inspiring

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.000 
of that and it's confidence-inspiring
yeah<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.390> big<00:01:03.539> thing<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.840> notice<00:01:04.229> if<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.619> go<00:01:04.650> too

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
yeah the big thing I notice if I go too

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.770 
yeah the big thing I notice if I go too
wide<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.790> my<00:01:05.880> bars<00:01:06.119> which<00:01:06.420> actually<00:01:06.689> I've<00:01:06.750> got

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
wide in my bars which actually I've got

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.090 
wide in my bars which actually I've got
a<00:01:06.900> new<00:01:07.110> bike<00:01:07.490> it's<00:01:08.490> come<00:01:08.670> with<00:01:08.790> 780

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
a new bike it's come with 780

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.500 
a new bike it's come with 780
millionnaire<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.640> that's<00:01:11.820> much<00:01:12.119> wider<00:01:12.420> than

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
millionnaire and that's much wider than

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.450 
millionnaire and that's much wider than
normally<00:01:12.930> use<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.320> feel<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.799> riding<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
normally use I feel that riding in the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.800 
normally use I feel that riding in the
woods<00:01:14.670> were<00:01:14.850> normally<00:01:15.150> right<00:01:15.330> I'm<00:01:15.509> getting

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
woods were normally right I'm getting

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.200 
woods were normally right I'm getting
really<00:01:16.049> close<00:01:16.290> those<00:01:16.619> trees<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.340> I'm<00:01:17.850> slowed

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
really close those trees and I'm slowed

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.359 
really close those trees and I'm slowed
down<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.600> get<00:01:18.750> through<00:01:18.960> them<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.350> yeah<00:01:20.220> it's

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
down to get through them so yeah it's

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.340 
down to get through them so yeah it's
definitely<00:01:20.659> smacking<00:01:21.659> your<00:01:21.750> hands<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.110> trees

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
definitely smacking your hands on trees

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.469 
definitely smacking your hands on trees
is<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> big<00:01:22.950> disadvantage<00:01:23.250> rahl<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.150> feels<00:01:24.330> a

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
is a big disadvantage rahl so it feels a

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.390 
is a big disadvantage rahl so it feels a
bit<00:01:24.509> sluggish<00:01:24.930> not<00:01:25.500> quite<00:01:25.740> as<00:01:25.860> nimble<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.280> the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
bit sluggish not quite as nimble in the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.390 
bit sluggish not quite as nimble in the
woods<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:26.990> personally<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.049> run<00:01:28.290> 740s<00:01:29.159> and

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
woods so personally I run 740s and

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.130 
woods so personally I run 740s and
they're<00:01:29.490> still<00:01:29.790> relatively<00:01:30.240> wide<00:01:30.570> but<00:01:30.990> I'm

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
they're still relatively wide but I'm

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.560 
they're still relatively wide but I'm
not<00:01:31.590> up<00:01:31.740> there<00:01:32.009> with<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.189> big<00:01:32.340> Daniel<00:01:32.850> 800<00:01:33.390> mil

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
not up there with the big Daniel 800 mil

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.800 
not up there with the big Daniel 800 mil
wide<00:01:33.780> bars<00:01:36.500> so<00:01:37.500> why<00:01:37.799> use<00:01:38.159> narrow<00:01:38.490> bars<00:01:38.850> it's

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
wide bars so why use narrow bars it's

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.440 
wide bars so why use narrow bars it's
fair<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.229> say<00:01:40.259> maro<00:01:40.829> bar<00:01:41.189> suit<00:01:41.610> along<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.180> stem

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
fair to say maro bar suit along the stem

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.389 
fair to say maro bar suit along the stem
because<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.470> bringing<00:01:43.740> your<00:01:44.040> weight

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
because it's bringing your weight

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.010 
because it's bringing your weight
further<00:01:44.820> forward<00:01:45.329> with<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> longer<00:01:45.810> stem

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
further forward with a longer stem

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.719 
further forward with a longer stem
you're<00:01:46.350> then<00:01:46.500> running<00:01:46.860> wide<00:01:47.070> bars<00:01:47.369> it's

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
you're then running wide bars it's

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:48.950 
you're then running wide bars it's
really<00:01:48.060> bringing<00:01:48.270> your<00:01:48.450> chest<00:01:48.659> down<00:01:48.899> and

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
really bringing your chest down and

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.889 
really bringing your chest down and
forward<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.770> long<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.850> stem<00:01:51.090> narrow<00:01:51.479> bars

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
forward so long the stem narrow bars

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.060 
forward so long the stem narrow bars
definitely<00:01:52.560> better<00:01:53.369> cross-country<00:01:55.070> also

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
definitely better cross-country also

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.219 
definitely better cross-country also
going<00:01:56.610> back<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:57.030> something<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.780> see<00:01:57.930> we<00:01:58.049> rode

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
going back to something you see we rode

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.840 
going back to something you see we rode
guys<00:01:58.530> when<00:01:58.829> they're<00:01:58.950> climbing<00:01:59.189> they<00:01:59.610> bring

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
guys when they're climbing they bring

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.789 
guys when they're climbing they bring
their<00:02:00.000> hands<00:02:00.180> right<00:02:00.600> on<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.049> tops<00:02:01.290> really

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
their hands right on the tops really

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.249 
their hands right on the tops really
close<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.189> stem<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:03.450> can<00:02:03.630> open<00:02:03.719> your<00:02:03.960> chest

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
close to stem and it can open your chest

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.690 
close to stem and it can open your chest
up<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.590> little<00:02:04.740> bit<00:02:04.860> better<00:02:04.979> for<00:02:05.219> breeding<00:02:05.430> on

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
up a little bit better for breeding on

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.320 
up a little bit better for breeding on
climbing<00:02:07.310> they're<00:02:08.310> all<00:02:08.459> valid<00:02:08.759> points<00:02:08.879> Neil

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
climbing they're all valid points Neil

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.940 
climbing they're all valid points Neil
but<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.509> just<00:02:09.660> want<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.899> talk<00:02:10.349> about<00:02:10.530> some<00:02:10.860> of

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
but I just want to talk about some of

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.210 
but I just want to talk about some of
the<00:02:11.009> cons<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.520> running<00:02:11.819> narrow<00:02:12.030> bars<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.989> know

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
the cons of running narrow bars you know

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.430 
the cons of running narrow bars you know
especially<00:02:14.060> at<00:02:14.150> higher<00:02:14.420> speeds<00:02:14.900> you<00:02:15.320> know

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
especially at higher speeds you know

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.270 
especially at higher speeds you know
like<00:02:15.590> I<00:02:15.680> get<00:02:15.920> up<00:02:16.070> to<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:17.620> bike<00:02:18.620> might<00:02:18.980> feel<00:02:19.250> a

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
like I get up to the bike might feel a

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.830 
like I get up to the bike might feel a
little<00:02:19.550> bit<00:02:19.730> twitchy<00:02:20.030> underneath<00:02:20.630> you

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
little bit twitchy underneath you

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.570 
little bit twitchy underneath you
perhaps<00:02:21.230> haven't<00:02:21.650> got<00:02:21.770> quite<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.040> control

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
perhaps haven't got quite the control

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.030 
perhaps haven't got quite the control
that<00:02:22.790> you<00:02:22.850> would<00:02:23.000> have<00:02:23.150> with<00:02:23.300> a<00:02:23.360> wider<00:02:23.630> set<00:02:24.040> in

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
that you would have with a wider set in

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.560 
that you would have with a wider set in
the<00:02:25.550> turns<00:02:25.880> you<00:02:26.090> haven't<00:02:26.330> got<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:26.450> same

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
the turns you haven't got that same

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.300 
the turns you haven't got that same
leverage<00:02:27.380> and<00:02:27.590> that<00:02:27.680> same<00:02:27.950> sort<00:02:28.220> of

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
leverage and that same sort of

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.760 
leverage and that same sort of
confidence-inspiring<00:02:29.300> sort<00:02:30.110> of<00:02:30.200> getting<00:02:30.680> the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
confidence-inspiring sort of getting the

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.410 
confidence-inspiring sort of getting the
weight<00:02:30.950> through<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.250> bike<00:02:31.490> to<00:02:31.760> get<00:02:31.910> that<00:02:32.090> grip

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
weight through the bike to get that grip

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.000 
weight through the bike to get that grip
and<00:02:32.930> I<00:02:34.330> just<00:02:35.330> doesn't<00:02:35.600> do<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.810> for<00:02:35.840> me<00:02:35.990> no<00:02:36.590> and

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
and I just doesn't do it for me no and

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.650 
and I just doesn't do it for me no and
it<00:02:37.100> is<00:02:37.340> definitely<00:02:37.790> something<00:02:37.970> we<00:02:38.120> even<00:02:38.390> seen

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
it is definitely something we even seen

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.240 
it is definitely something we even seen
with<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.930> cross<00:02:39.110> country<00:02:39.320> guys<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.100> girls

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
with the cross country guys and girls

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.680 
with the cross country guys and girls
they<00:02:40.520> are<00:02:40.550> starting<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.180> go<00:02:41.270> a<00:02:41.300> bit<00:02:41.360> wider

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
they are starting to go a bit wider

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.900 
they are starting to go a bit wider
their<00:02:42.020> bars<00:02:42.260> so<00:02:42.560> how<00:02:43.310> do<00:02:43.370> you<00:02:43.610> choose<00:02:43.850> the

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
their bars so how do you choose the

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.030 
their bars so how do you choose the
right<00:02:44.120> bars<00:02:44.480> for<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:46.990> so<00:02:47.990> doing<00:02:48.440> a<00:02:48.530> press<00:02:48.770> up

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
right bars for you so doing a press up

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.760 
right bars for you so doing a press up
this<00:02:49.610> is<00:02:49.790> my<00:02:49.910> natural<00:02:49.970> position<00:02:50.840> hands

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
this is my natural position hands

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.590 
this is my natural position hands
slightly<00:02:52.340> wider<00:02:52.490> than<00:02:52.820> my<00:02:52.910> shoulders<00:02:52.940> feels

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
slightly wider than my shoulders feels

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.440 
slightly wider than my shoulders feels
really<00:02:54.020> nice<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.200> strong<00:02:54.850> nice<00:02:55.850> and<00:02:56.090> stable

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
really nice and strong nice and stable

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.780 
really nice and strong nice and stable
as<00:02:56.540> well<00:02:56.660> for<00:02:57.260> try<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.590> get<00:02:57.709> too<00:02:58.130> wide<00:02:58.400> the

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
as well for try and get too wide the

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.980 
as well for try and get too wide the
case<00:02:59.420> can<00:02:59.600> be<00:02:59.660> much<00:02:59.870> harder<00:03:00.290> work<00:03:01.990> definitely

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
case can be much harder work definitely

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.620 
case can be much harder work definitely
pretty<00:03:03.350> tiring<00:03:03.650> but<00:03:04.400> also<00:03:04.730> going<00:03:04.970> back<00:03:05.300> to<00:03:05.540> the

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
pretty tiring but also going back to the

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.040 
pretty tiring but also going back to the
middle

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
middle

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.800 
middle
feels<00:03:06.380> pretty<00:03:06.530> strong<00:03:07.070> now<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:07.670> can<00:03:08.390> do<00:03:08.480> a<00:03:08.510> press

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
feels pretty strong now I can do a press

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.560 
feels pretty strong now I can do a press
up<00:03:09.130> again<00:03:10.130> that's<00:03:10.400> quite<00:03:10.640> hard<00:03:10.820> work<00:03:11.120> compared

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
up again that's quite hard work compared

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.720 
up again that's quite hard work compared
to<00:03:11.630> my<00:03:11.810> comfortable<00:03:12.709> position<00:03:13.100> but<00:03:13.580> also

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
to my comfortable position but also

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.150 
to my comfortable position but also
obviously<00:03:14.390> on<00:03:14.510> less<00:03:14.780> stable<00:03:15.140> so<00:03:15.890> trying<00:03:16.130> to

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
obviously on less stable so trying to

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.300 
obviously on less stable so trying to
find<00:03:16.370> that<00:03:17.019> comforting<00:03:18.019> hands<00:03:18.950> slightly

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
find that comforting hands slightly

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.509 
find that comforting hands slightly
wider<00:03:19.489> than<00:03:19.730> shoulders<00:03:21.100> nice<00:03:22.100> and<00:03:22.340> strong

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
wider than shoulders nice and strong

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.190 
wider than shoulders nice and strong
shoosh<00:03:23.530> so<00:03:24.530> it's<00:03:24.980> fair<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.370> say<00:03:25.430> that<00:03:25.850> a

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
shoosh so it's fair to say that a

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.530 
shoosh so it's fair to say that a
narrower<00:03:27.200> bar<00:03:27.530> suits<00:03:28.190> a<00:03:28.400> longer<00:03:28.880> stem<00:03:29.180> for

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
narrower bar suits a longer stem for

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.540 
narrower bar suits a longer stem for
cross<00:03:29.720> country<00:03:29.930> where<00:03:30.380> you're<00:03:31.100> going<00:03:31.280> to<00:03:31.370> need

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
cross country where you're going to need

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.040 
cross country where you're going to need
to<00:03:31.670> keep<00:03:31.820> some<00:03:32.120> weight<00:03:32.269> on<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.510> front<00:03:32.630> tire<00:03:33.019> to

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
to keep some weight on the front tire to

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.660 
to keep some weight on the front tire to
stop<00:03:33.560> that<00:03:33.769> front<00:03:34.040> wheel<00:03:34.160> from<00:03:34.310> wheelie<00:03:34.519> and

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
stop that front wheel from wheelie and

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.330 
stop that front wheel from wheelie and

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
similar issues with the wider bar if you

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.009 
similar issues with the wider bar if you
have<00:03:40.310> say<00:03:40.790> a<00:03:40.820> longer<00:03:41.239> stem<00:03:41.480> like<00:03:41.690> something

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
have say a longer stem like something

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.470 
have say a longer stem like something
like<00:03:42.140> 70<00:03:42.590> mils<00:03:42.830> and<00:03:43.040> you<00:03:43.400> put<00:03:43.610> a<00:03:43.640> wider<00:03:43.970> bar<00:03:44.299> on

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
like 70 mils and you put a wider bar on

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.880 
like 70 mils and you put a wider bar on
you're<00:03:44.600> going<00:03:44.720> to<00:03:44.780> have<00:03:44.840> like<00:03:45.200> this<00:03:45.320> effect<00:03:45.739> of

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
you're going to have like this effect of

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.160 
you're going to have like this effect of
like<00:03:46.100> like<00:03:46.489> you're<00:03:46.640> driving<00:03:46.850> a<00:03:47.150> big<00:03:47.330> big

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
like like you're driving a big big

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.350 
like like you're driving a big big
London<00:03:48.560> bus<00:03:48.769> or<00:03:48.980> something<00:03:49.190> so<00:03:49.640> the<00:03:50.000> steering

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
London bus or something so the steering

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.680 
London bus or something so the steering
would<00:03:50.450> be<00:03:50.630> even<00:03:51.200> even<00:03:52.070> slower<00:03:52.459> with<00:03:52.970> that<00:03:53.239> long

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
would be even even slower with that long

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.080 
would be even even slower with that long
stem<00:03:54.019> so<00:03:54.260> if<00:03:54.860> you<00:03:55.040> are<00:03:55.220> looking<00:03:55.640> to<00:03:55.790> run<00:03:56.030> a

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
stem so if you are looking to run a

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.150 
stem so if you are looking to run a
wider<00:03:56.420> bar<00:03:56.750> tend<00:03:57.410> to<00:03:57.530> mate<00:03:57.769> it<00:03:57.950> with<00:03:58.070> the

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
wider bar tend to mate it with the

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.620 
wider bar tend to mate it with the
shorter<00:03:58.640> stem<00:03:58.850> therefore<00:03:59.299> you<00:03:59.390> have<00:03:59.480> that

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
shorter stem therefore you have that

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.780 
shorter stem therefore you have that
nimble<00:04:00.019> nimble<00:04:00.860> steering<00:04:01.250> but<00:04:01.549> then<00:04:01.700> the

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
nimble nimble steering but then the

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.190 
nimble nimble steering but then the
stability<00:04:02.030> when<00:04:02.510> you're<00:04:02.630> up<00:04:02.750> to<00:04:02.930> speed

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
stability when you're up to speed

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.949 
stability when you're up to speed
yes<00:04:03.980> it's<00:04:04.280> fair<00:04:04.489> to<00:04:04.640> say<00:04:04.700> that<00:04:05.060> you<00:04:05.269> know<00:04:05.420> the

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
yes it's fair to say that you know the

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.140 
yes it's fair to say that you know the
bar<00:04:06.230> setup<00:04:06.620> really<00:04:07.010> comes<00:04:07.549> down<00:04:07.670> to<00:04:07.850> the

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
bar setup really comes down to the

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.990 
bar setup really comes down to the
trails<00:04:08.420> II<00:04:08.630> ride<00:04:08.840> and<00:04:09.049> what<00:04:09.170> you<00:04:09.290> like<00:04:09.410> to<00:04:09.470> ride

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.010 

so<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.300> other<00:04:13.420> things<00:04:13.720> talk<00:04:13.960> about

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
so the other things talk about

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.400 
so the other things talk about
handlebars<00:04:14.770> is<00:04:15.100> rise<00:04:15.640> and<00:04:16.120> sweep<00:04:16.480> we've<00:04:17.170> got

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
handlebars is rise and sweep we've got

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.090 
handlebars is rise and sweep we've got
two<00:04:17.980> sets<00:04:18.220> of<00:04:18.340> downhill<00:04:18.760> bars<00:04:19.120> here<00:04:19.859> sweep<00:04:20.859> is

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
two sets of downhill bars here sweep is

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.430 
two sets of downhill bars here sweep is
that<00:04:21.250> measurement<00:04:21.670> of<00:04:22.000> how<00:04:22.240> far<00:04:22.630> the<00:04:23.230> way<00:04:23.380> you

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
that measurement of how far the way you

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.430 
that measurement of how far the way you
grip<00:04:23.860> on<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.160> bar<00:04:24.310> actually<00:04:24.640> comes<00:04:24.880> back<00:04:25.440> and

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
grip on the bar actually comes back and

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.050 
grip on the bar actually comes back and
also<00:04:26.800> up<00:04:27.070> there's<00:04:27.370> two<00:04:27.490> measurements<00:04:27.970> of

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
also up there's two measurements of

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.360 
also up there's two measurements of
sweets<00:04:28.270> back<00:04:28.540> and<00:04:28.810> up<00:04:28.930> you<00:04:29.440> see<00:04:29.620> on<00:04:29.710> these<00:04:29.980> bars

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
sweets back and up you see on these bars

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.760 
sweets back and up you see on these bars
this<00:04:31.240> part<00:04:31.600> of<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:31.750> bar<00:04:31.900> is<00:04:31.990> much<00:04:32.140> higher<00:04:32.410> off

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
this part of the bar is much higher off

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.680 
this part of the bar is much higher off
the<00:04:32.830> table<00:04:33.460> than<00:04:33.790> these<00:04:33.970> so<00:04:34.240> there's<00:04:34.450> more

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
the table than these so there's more

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.170 
the table than these so there's more
sweet<00:04:35.050> back<00:04:35.350> on<00:04:35.710> these<00:04:35.830> bars<00:04:36.100> tends<00:04:36.940> to<00:04:37.090> be

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
sweet back on these bars tends to be

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.970 
sweet back on these bars tends to be
more<00:04:37.390> of<00:04:37.480> a<00:04:37.600> personal<00:04:38.320> preference<00:04:38.530> thing<00:04:38.830> I

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
more of a personal preference thing I

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.830 
more of a personal preference thing I
think<00:04:39.250> although<00:04:39.430> you<00:04:39.670> tend<00:04:40.000> to<00:04:40.060> find<00:04:40.180> anal

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
think although you tend to find anal

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.540 
think although you tend to find anal
bars<00:04:41.080> have<00:04:41.320> more<00:04:41.560> sweet<00:04:41.860> than<00:04:41.890> cross-country

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
bars have more sweet than cross-country

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.120 
bars have more sweet than cross-country
bars<00:04:42.990> yeah<00:04:43.990> I<00:04:44.140> think<00:04:44.320> that's<00:04:44.470> a<00:04:44.620> fair<00:04:44.830> point

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
bars yeah I think that's a fair point

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.850 
bars yeah I think that's a fair point
and<00:04:45.760> and<00:04:46.150> as<00:04:46.360> you<00:04:46.540> say<00:04:46.720> I<00:04:46.750> think<00:04:46.900> there<00:04:47.770> be

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
and and as you say I think there be

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.770 
and and as you say I think there be
certain<00:04:48.280> you<00:04:48.820> could<00:04:48.970> give<00:04:49.120> me<00:04:49.240> a<00:04:49.270> set<00:04:49.510> of<00:04:49.600> bars

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
certain you could give me a set of bars

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.420 
certain you could give me a set of bars
and<00:04:49.900> I<00:04:50.020> will<00:04:50.140> at<00:04:50.230> all<00:04:50.380> that's<00:04:50.740> horrible<00:04:51.280> and

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
and I will at all that's horrible and

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.190 
and I will at all that's horrible and
you<00:04:51.970> would<00:04:52.090> be<00:04:52.180> oh<00:04:52.210> no<00:04:52.510> I<00:04:52.540> really<00:04:52.750> like<00:04:52.870> that<00:04:53.169> I

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
you would be oh no I really like that I

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.900 
you would be oh no I really like that I
think<00:04:53.380> it's<00:04:53.620> just<00:04:53.680> the<00:04:53.890> way<00:04:54.040> your<00:04:54.520> shoulders

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
think it's just the way your shoulders

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.480 
think it's just the way your shoulders
are<00:04:55.030> set<00:04:55.240> and<00:04:55.419> how<00:04:55.570> it<00:04:55.720> kind<00:04:55.900> of<00:04:55.960> fits<00:04:56.200> to<00:04:56.410> your

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
are set and how it kind of fits to your

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.260 
are set and how it kind of fits to your
body<00:04:57.780> rise<00:04:58.780> on<00:04:59.110> the<00:04:59.140> other<00:04:59.350> hand<00:04:59.640> yeah<00:05:00.640> so<00:05:01.000> rise

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
body rise on the other hand yeah so rise

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.710 
body rise on the other hand yeah so rise
is<00:05:01.750> what<00:05:02.440> we're<00:05:02.590> looking<00:05:02.860> at<00:05:02.919> here<00:05:02.980> is<00:05:03.490> if<00:05:04.480> this

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
is what we're looking at here is if this

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.500 
is what we're looking at here is if this
was<00:05:04.930> zero<00:05:05.320> and<00:05:05.710> then<00:05:06.340> it's<00:05:06.490> how<00:05:06.700> much<00:05:06.880> rise<00:05:07.150> up

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
was zero and then it's how much rise up

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.810 
was zero and then it's how much rise up
to<00:05:07.780> here<00:05:07.990> so<00:05:08.260> in<00:05:08.380> this<00:05:08.560> case<00:05:08.860> it's<00:05:09.100> 20<00:05:09.610> mils

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
to here so in this case it's 20 mils

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.080 
to here so in this case it's 20 mils
from<00:05:10.540> here<00:05:11.050> to<00:05:11.530> the<00:05:11.650> top<00:05:11.830> of<00:05:11.980> there<00:05:12.160> so<00:05:12.880> there's

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
from here to the top of there so there's

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.670 
from here to the top of there so there's
all<00:05:13.270> different<00:05:13.300> rises<00:05:14.230> that<00:05:14.740> you<00:05:14.890> can<00:05:15.070> get

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
all different rises that you can get

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.170 
all different rises that you can get
Daniel<00:05:17.680> bikes<00:05:17.919> as<00:05:18.160> a<00:05:18.220> rule<00:05:18.550> tend<00:05:18.880> to<00:05:18.970> have<00:05:19.150> a

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
Daniel bikes as a rule tend to have a

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.540 
Daniel bikes as a rule tend to have a
bigger<00:05:19.810> rise<00:05:20.140> and<00:05:20.530> then<00:05:21.040> a<00:05:21.070> cross<00:05:21.340> country

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
bigger rise and then a cross country

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.510 
bigger rise and then a cross country
would<00:05:21.880> have<00:05:22.030> zero<00:05:22.690> rise<00:05:22.990> handlebars<00:05:23.830> all

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
would have zero rise handlebars all

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.640 
would have zero rise handlebars all
right<00:05:24.729> so<00:05:24.940> there's<00:05:25.120> handlebars<00:05:25.750> explained<00:05:26.290> I

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
right so there's handlebars explained I
