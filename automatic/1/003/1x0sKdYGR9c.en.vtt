00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
we call sharps and this is what we'll

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.310 
we call sharps and this is what we'll
mix<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.820> cement<00:00:21.000> with<00:00:21.330> we've<00:00:21.869> got<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.050> bag<00:00:22.289> of

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
mix the cement with we've got a bag of

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.009 
mix the cement with we've got a bag of
cement<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:23.670> we've<00:00:23.789> got<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.090> fantastic<00:00:24.330> hard

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
cement and we've got this fantastic hard

cement and we've got this fantastic hard
core<00:00:25.380> this<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.160> what<00:00:26.430> we<00:00:26.519> call<00:00:26.699> ten<00:00:27.029> mil<00:00:27.240> to

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
core this is what we call ten mil to

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.990 
core this is what we call ten mil to
dust<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.470> really<00:00:28.769> good<00:00:29.010> especially<00:00:29.609> for

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
dust this is really good especially for

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.269 
dust this is really good especially for
DIY<00:00:30.390> purposes<00:00:31.230> because<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.619> can<00:00:31.800> packs<00:00:32.040> really

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
DIY purposes because it can packs really

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.459 
DIY purposes because it can packs really
easily<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.329> knits<00:00:33.540> together<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.290> gives

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
easily and it knits together and gives

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.680 
easily and it knits together and gives
you<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.590> real<00:00:34.770> solid<00:00:35.040> base<00:00:35.370> then<00:00:36.329> we've<00:00:36.510> got

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
you a real solid base then we've got

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.229 
you a real solid base then we've got
other<00:00:36.809> stuff<00:00:37.140> like<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.680> lump<00:00:37.950> hammer<00:00:38.210> essential

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
other stuff like a lump hammer essential

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.869 
other stuff like a lump hammer essential
we've<00:00:39.809> got<00:00:40.110> trowels<00:00:40.860> we've<00:00:41.129> got<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> bolster

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
we've got trowels we've got a bolster

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.910 
we've got trowels we've got a bolster
chisel<00:00:42.300> we've<00:00:42.750> got<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:42.989> stiff<00:00:43.320> brush<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.860> a

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
chisel we've got a stiff brush and a

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.650 
chisel we've got a stiff brush and a
softer<00:00:44.579> brush<00:00:44.730> we've<00:00:45.030> got<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.210> Stanley<00:00:45.600> knife

softer brush we've got a Stanley knife
and<00:00:46.079> we've<00:00:46.200> got<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.410> crowbar<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.850> let's<00:00:48.090> go<00:00:48.210> have

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
and we've got a crowbar so let's go have

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.600 
and we've got a crowbar so let's go have
a<00:00:48.390> look<00:00:48.570> now<00:00:48.780> how<00:00:49.680> David<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.160> getting<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.430> path

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
a look now how David is getting a path

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:58.250 
a look now how David is getting a path
up

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.779 

so<00:00:59.260> what's<00:00:59.500> good<00:00:59.710> about<00:00:59.800> this<00:01:00.129> is<00:01:00.190> we've<00:01:00.609> all

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
so what's good about this is we've all

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:02.670 
so what's good about this is we've all
we've<00:01:01.059> taken<00:01:01.329> existing<00:01:01.839> paths<00:01:02.079> up<00:01:02.260> we've<00:01:02.530> got

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
we've taken existing paths up we've got

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.490 
we've taken existing paths up we've got
already<00:01:02.829> got<00:01:03.219> a<00:01:03.250> solid<00:01:03.699> base<00:01:03.909> to<00:01:03.940> work<00:01:04.360> from

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
already got a solid base to work from

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.200 
already got a solid base to work from
now<00:01:05.500> if<00:01:05.619> you<00:01:05.740> were<00:01:05.860> doing<00:01:06.130> this<00:01:06.310> from<00:01:06.939> scratch

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
now if you were doing this from scratch

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.480 
now if you were doing this from scratch
you'd<00:01:08.140> have<00:01:08.290> to<00:01:08.439> dig<00:01:08.619> down<00:01:08.860> you'd<00:01:09.100> have<00:01:09.220> to<00:01:09.310> put

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
you'd have to dig down you'd have to put

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.730 
you'd have to dig down you'd have to put
a<00:01:09.520> solid<00:01:09.790> foundation<00:01:10.540> in<00:01:10.659> which<00:01:11.409> would<00:01:11.590> be

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
a solid foundation in which would be

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.430 
a solid foundation in which would be
approximately<00:01:12.220> 50<00:01:12.880> mil<00:01:13.090> deep<00:01:13.390> then<00:01:14.289> you'd

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
approximately 50 mil deep then you'd

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.899 
approximately 50 mil deep then you'd
have<00:01:14.560> to<00:01:14.649> take<00:01:14.770> into<00:01:15.130> allowance<00:01:15.549> the

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
have to take into allowance the

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.139 
have to take into allowance the
thickness<00:01:16.360> of<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:17.530> new<00:01:17.649> paving<00:01:17.950> and<00:01:18.340> then<00:01:18.970> the

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
thickness of the new paving and then the

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.389 
thickness of the new paving and then the
thickness<00:01:20.080> of<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.320> water<00:01:20.530> bed<00:01:20.890> which<00:01:21.190> could

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
thickness of the water bed which could

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.760 
thickness of the water bed which could
be<00:01:21.520> up<00:01:21.970> to<00:01:22.030> two<00:01:22.390> inches<00:01:22.810> so<00:01:23.440> straight<00:01:23.740> away

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
be up to two inches so straight away

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.910 
be up to two inches so straight away
you've<00:01:24.009> got<00:01:24.130> 125<00:01:24.970> mil<00:01:25.409> depth<00:01:26.409> you've<00:01:26.649> got<00:01:26.799> to

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
you've got 125 mil depth you've got to

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.040 
you've got 125 mil depth you've got to
dig<00:01:27.039> down<00:01:27.280> so<00:01:28.090> it's<00:01:28.270> a<00:01:28.330> little<00:01:28.479> bit<00:01:28.659> more<00:01:28.780> work

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
dig down so it's a little bit more work

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.710 
dig down so it's a little bit more work
that<00:01:29.289> way<00:01:29.530> but<00:01:30.130> let's<00:01:30.340> look<00:01:30.550> at<00:01:30.700> how<00:01:30.970> David's

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
that way but let's look at how David's

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.149 
that way but let's look at how David's
dealing<00:01:31.960> with<00:01:32.050> this<00:01:32.200> what<00:01:32.530> he's<00:01:32.649> done<00:01:32.890> he's

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
dealing with this what he's done he's

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.070 
dealing with this what he's done he's
put<00:01:33.399> on<00:01:33.520> some<00:01:33.789> of<00:01:33.909> the<00:01:34.000> 10<00:01:34.240> mil<00:01:34.420> to<00:01:34.600> dust<00:01:34.810> odd

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
put on some of the 10 mil to dust odd

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.609 
put on some of the 10 mil to dust odd
core<00:01:35.530> and<00:01:35.800> he's<00:01:36.399> just<00:01:36.580> giving<00:01:36.880> us<00:01:37.000> a<00:01:37.270> nice<00:01:37.619> thin

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
core and he's just giving us a nice thin

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.529 
core and he's just giving us a nice thin
blinding<00:01:39.159> of<00:01:39.310> that<00:01:39.490> so<00:01:40.000> we've<00:01:40.149> got<00:01:40.300> something

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
blinding of that so we've got something

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.590 
blinding of that so we've got something
solid<00:01:40.899> to<00:01:41.590> lay<00:01:41.740> that<00:01:41.920> lay<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.490> paving<00:01:42.700> on<00:01:42.970> but

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
solid to lay that lay the paving on but

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.690 
solid to lay that lay the paving on but
before<00:01:43.960> we<00:01:44.200> do<00:01:44.380> that<00:01:44.409> he<00:01:44.860> is<00:01:45.009> going<00:01:45.220> to<00:01:45.280> compact

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
before we do that he is going to compact

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.820 
before we do that he is going to compact
this<00:01:45.819> down<00:01:46.119> and<00:01:46.420> give<00:01:46.720> it<00:01:46.810> a<00:01:46.869> real<00:01:47.110> solid<00:01:47.440> base

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.020 

so<00:01:50.830> now<00:01:51.009> let's<00:01:51.250> have<00:01:51.369> a<00:01:51.459> look<00:01:51.580> at<00:01:51.729> this<00:01:51.850> easy

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
so now let's have a look at this easy

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.570 
so now let's have a look at this easy
pave<00:01:52.390> cobble<00:01:52.840> tiles<00:01:53.140> I<00:01:53.440> really<00:01:54.220> love<00:01:54.399> this

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
pave cobble tiles I really love this

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.539 
pave cobble tiles I really love this
because<00:01:55.000> it's<00:01:55.149> on<00:01:55.299> it<00:01:55.450> on<00:01:55.539> a<00:01:55.600> mesh<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:57.340> it's<00:01:57.459> a

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
because it's on it on a mesh and it's a

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.190 
because it's on it on a mesh and it's a
bit<00:01:57.729> like<00:01:57.759> you<00:01:58.270> know<00:01:58.390> when<00:01:58.569> you<00:01:58.659> do<00:01:58.810> mosaic

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
bit like you know when you do mosaic

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.139 
bit like you know when you do mosaic
tile<00:01:59.440> in<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.709> bathroom<00:02:00.130> it's<00:02:00.640> that<00:02:00.849> sort<00:02:01.090> of

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
tile in the bathroom it's that sort of

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.809 
tile in the bathroom it's that sort of
fact<00:02:01.509> so<00:02:02.080> rather<00:02:02.349> than<00:02:02.649> laying<00:02:02.830> them<00:02:03.039> one<00:02:03.580> by

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
fact so rather than laying them one by

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:06.229 
fact so rather than laying them one by
one<00:02:03.849> you<00:02:04.629> can<00:02:04.810> lay<00:02:04.959> a<00:02:04.989> whole<00:02:05.170> load<00:02:05.410> at<00:02:05.560> a<00:02:05.619> time

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:06.239 
one you can lay a whole load at a time

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:09.240 
one you can lay a whole load at a time
what's<00:02:07.239> also<00:02:07.450> great<00:02:07.780> is<00:02:07.979> we're<00:02:08.979> going<00:02:09.099> to<00:02:09.160> be

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
what's also great is we're going to be

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.100 
what's also great is we're going to be
laying<00:02:09.429> on<00:02:09.520> this<00:02:09.670> path<00:02:09.940> here<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.720> width<00:02:10.959> of

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
laying on this path here the width of

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.869 
laying on this path here the width of
that<00:02:11.200> isn't<00:02:11.590> quite<00:02:11.800> enough<00:02:11.950> we<00:02:12.550> can<00:02:12.730> actually

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
that isn't quite enough we can actually

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.140 
that isn't quite enough we can actually
cut<00:02:13.390> down<00:02:13.920> here<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.430> make<00:02:15.610> up<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:15.970> difference

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
cut down here to make up the difference

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.860 
cut down here to make up the difference
which<00:02:17.080> is<00:02:17.260> brilliant

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
which is brilliant

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.050 
which is brilliant
you

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.360 

you

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.970 

so<00:02:28.000> what's<00:02:28.269> also<00:02:28.510> nice<00:02:28.840> about<00:02:28.900> these<00:02:29.349> is<00:02:29.620> they

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
so what's also nice about these is they

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.520 
so what's also nice about these is they
come<00:02:30.280> steps<00:02:31.150> like<00:02:31.420> this<00:02:31.629> so<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.019> next<00:02:32.230> bit

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
come steps like this so the next bit

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.130 
come steps like this so the next bit
like<00:02:32.830> a<00:02:32.860> bit<00:02:33.069> like<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.250> jigsaw<00:02:33.670> puzzle<00:02:33.900> locks<00:02:34.900> in

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
like a bit like a jigsaw puzzle locks in

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.130 
like a bit like a jigsaw puzzle locks in
and<00:02:35.349> it<00:02:35.410> makes<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:35.739> nice<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.250> seamless

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
and it makes it nice and seamless

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.750 
and it makes it nice and seamless
fantastic<00:02:38.140> finish<00:02:38.470> so<00:02:39.099> we're<00:02:39.370> nearly<00:02:39.550> ready

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
fantastic finish so we're nearly ready

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.400 
fantastic finish so we're nearly ready
to<00:02:39.879> start<00:02:40.180> laying<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.569> paving<00:02:40.810> but<00:02:41.110> first

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
to start laying the paving but first

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.410 
to start laying the paving but first
we've<00:02:41.620> got<00:02:41.800> to<00:02:41.830> look<00:02:42.040> at<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.819> mortar<00:02:43.180> mix

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
we've got to look at the mortar mix

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.570 
we've got to look at the mortar mix
we're<00:02:43.599> going<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:43.780> be<00:02:43.870> laying<00:02:44.170> it<00:02:44.290> on<00:02:44.410> -<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:45.400> what

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
we're going to be laying it on - so what

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.500 
we're going to be laying it on - so what
we're<00:02:45.730> going<00:02:45.849> to<00:02:45.910> do<00:02:46.060> we're<00:02:46.239> going<00:02:46.269> to<00:02:46.420> be

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
we're going to do we're going to be

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.530 
we're going to do we're going to be
doing<00:02:46.599> a<00:02:46.780> 5<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.319> 1<00:02:47.530> mix<00:02:47.830> 5<00:02:48.519> parts<00:02:48.970> sharps<00:02:49.330> and

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
doing a 5 and 1 mix 5 parts sharps and

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.380 
doing a 5 and 1 mix 5 parts sharps and
to<00:02:50.170> one<00:02:50.349> part<00:02:50.650> cement<00:02:50.890> so<00:02:51.700> that's<00:02:51.910> 5<00:02:52.180> shovel

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
to one part cement so that's 5 shovel

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.630 
to one part cement so that's 5 shovel
Falls<00:02:52.780> one<00:02:53.170> shovel<00:02:53.530> fall<00:02:53.709> really<00:02:54.190> easy<00:02:54.340> but<00:02:54.549> if

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
Falls one shovel fall really easy but if

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.550 
Falls one shovel fall really easy but if
you're<00:02:54.760> going<00:02:54.879> to<00:02:54.970> be<00:02:55.060> doing<00:02:55.180> loads<00:02:55.540> you<00:02:56.530> know

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
you're going to be doing loads you know

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.229 
you're going to be doing loads you know
it<00:02:56.890> might<00:02:57.099> be<00:02:57.129> worth<00:02:57.250> hiring<00:02:57.610> a<00:02:57.819> cement<00:02:58.090> mixer

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
it might be worth hiring a cement mixer

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.479 
it might be worth hiring a cement mixer
for<00:02:58.629> the<00:02:58.720> day<00:02:58.959> now<00:02:59.260> another<00:02:59.500> top<00:02:59.799> tip<00:03:00.040> from<00:03:00.250> me

for the day now another top tip from me
is<00:03:01.019> with<00:03:02.019> your<00:03:02.200> mix<00:03:02.410> is<00:03:03.310> this<00:03:03.579> mortar

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
is with your mix is this mortar

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.690 
is with your mix is this mortar
plasticizer<00:03:04.690> what<00:03:05.530> this<00:03:05.769> does<00:03:06.069> it<00:03:06.220> makes<00:03:06.459> the

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
plasticizer what this does it makes the

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.550 
plasticizer what this does it makes the
mix<00:03:06.910> so<00:03:07.180> much<00:03:07.360> easier<00:03:07.720> to<00:03:07.870> work<00:03:08.019> with

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
mix so much easier to work with

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.680 
mix so much easier to work with
makes<00:03:08.799> it<00:03:08.950> more<00:03:09.069> pliable<00:03:09.370> and<00:03:10.120> all<00:03:10.329> it<00:03:10.450> needs

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
makes it more pliable and all it needs

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.410 
makes it more pliable and all it needs
is<00:03:11.069> approximately<00:03:12.069> a<00:03:12.099> cup<00:03:12.310> full<00:03:12.549> in<00:03:12.760> your

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
is approximately a cup full in your

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:30.720 
is approximately a cup full in your
bucket<00:03:13.599> of<00:03:13.840> water

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.000 

but<00:03:31.730> let's<00:03:31.910> just<00:03:32.000> have<00:03:32.240> a<00:03:32.270> bit<00:03:32.480> of<00:03:32.510> a<00:03:32.660> recap

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
but let's just have a bit of a recap

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.040 
but let's just have a bit of a recap
we've<00:03:34.010> taken<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.400> old<00:03:34.490> paving<00:03:34.910> up<00:03:35.060> we've<00:03:35.810> put

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
we've taken the old paving up we've put

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.990 
we've taken the old paving up we've put
the<00:03:36.140> hard<00:03:36.320> core<00:03:36.620> in<00:03:36.650> we've<00:03:37.070> compacted<00:03:37.640> it<00:03:37.760> down

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
the hard core in we've compacted it down

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.880 
the hard core in we've compacted it down
we've<00:03:38.630> done<00:03:38.840> the<00:03:38.930> mix<00:03:39.170> of<00:03:39.350> cement<00:03:39.710> at

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
we've done the mix of cement at

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:40.660 
we've done the mix of cement at
five-to-one

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
five-to-one

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.300 
five-to-one
david<00:03:41.660> is<00:03:41.780> actually<00:03:42.140> now<00:03:42.350> putting<00:03:42.890> the<00:03:42.980> cement

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
david is actually now putting the cement

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.670 
david is actually now putting the cement
here<00:03:43.610> and<00:03:44.000> we're<00:03:44.210> going<00:03:44.330> to<00:03:44.360> do<00:03:44.570> section<00:03:45.380> by

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
here and we're going to do section by

here and we're going to do section by
section<00:03:45.790> we're<00:03:46.790> going<00:03:46.970> to<00:03:47.030> lay<00:03:47.320> approximately

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
section we're going to lay approximately

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:56.890 
section we're going to lay approximately
25<00:03:49.610> ml<00:03:49.970> bed<00:03:50.300> of<00:03:50.600> cement<00:03:51.320> here

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.960 

so<00:03:57.900> that's<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.290> mortar<00:03:58.680> down<00:03:58.890> it's<00:03:59.580> time<00:03:59.820> to

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
so that's the mortar down it's time to

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.450 
so that's the mortar down it's time to
start<00:04:00.180> putting<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.540> paving<00:04:00.780> down<00:04:01.430> we've<00:04:02.430> got

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
start putting the paving down we've got

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.910 
start putting the paving down we've got
a<00:04:02.610> couple<00:04:02.880> two<00:04:03.240> others<00:04:03.510> here<00:04:03.660> make<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:04.500> quite<00:04:04.890> a

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
a couple two others here make it quite a

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.720 
a couple two others here make it quite a
bit<00:04:04.980> easier<00:04:06.680> what<00:04:07.680> a<00:04:07.710> good<00:04:07.920> tip<00:04:08.130> with<00:04:08.310> this<00:04:08.460> is

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
bit easier what a good tip with this is

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.790 
bit easier what a good tip with this is
we've<00:04:09.090> made<00:04:09.300> the<00:04:09.480> mortar<00:04:10.020> bed<00:04:10.230> quite<00:04:10.530> high

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
we've made the mortar bed quite high

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.900 
we've made the mortar bed quite high
we're<00:04:11.160> going<00:04:11.340> to<00:04:11.430> put<00:04:11.610> both<00:04:12.180> pieces<00:04:12.510> in<00:04:12.720> like

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
we're going to put both pieces in like

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.670 
we're going to put both pieces in like
so

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
so

Sun and cement easy to do we just put on

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:19.219 
Sun and cement easy to do we just put on
the<00:05:10.199> mix<00:05:13.159> and<00:05:14.159> we<00:05:14.310> brush<00:05:14.550> it<00:05:14.729> in<00:05:14.879> like<00:05:15.870> so<00:05:18.229> we

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
the mix and we brush it in like so we

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.369 
the mix and we brush it in like so we
push<00:05:19.560> this<00:05:19.830> into<00:05:20.610> all<00:05:20.729> the<00:05:20.849> joints<00:05:21.270> so<00:05:21.509> it's

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:22.379 
push this into all the joints so it's

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:25.429 
push this into all the joints so it's
really<00:05:22.620> nice<00:05:23.039> and<00:05:23.310> compact<00:05:24.110> and<00:05:25.110> all<00:05:25.259> I<00:05:25.289> do

00:05:25.429 --> 00:05:25.439 
really nice and compact and all I do

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:29.360 
really nice and compact and all I do
then<00:05:25.830> is<00:05:26.189> put<00:05:26.490> a<00:05:26.550> bit<00:05:26.699> more<00:05:26.879> on<00:05:27.680> and<00:05:28.680> keep<00:05:29.159> doing

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
then is put a bit more on and keep doing

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.369 
then is put a bit more on and keep doing
it<00:05:29.610> until<00:05:29.789> literally<00:05:30.539> you<00:05:30.750> can't<00:05:30.990> press<00:05:31.229> it

00:05:31.369 --> 00:05:31.379 
it until literally you can't press it

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:34.700 
it until literally you can't press it
down<00:05:31.529> anymore<00:05:31.979> a<00:05:33.020> good<00:05:34.020> idea<00:05:34.050> is<00:05:34.349> to<00:05:34.469> get<00:05:34.650> a

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
down anymore a good idea is to get a

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.290 
down anymore a good idea is to get a
watering<00:05:35.069> can<00:05:35.249> with<00:05:35.279> a<00:05:35.430> sprinkler<00:05:35.939> thing<00:05:36.150> on

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
watering can with a sprinkler thing on

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.659 
watering can with a sprinkler thing on
the<00:05:36.419> end<00:05:36.539> and<00:05:37.199> go<00:05:37.379> over<00:05:37.529> the<00:05:37.620> path<00:05:37.889> that<00:05:38.520> will

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
the end and go over the path that will

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.730 
the end and go over the path that will
really<00:05:38.849> set<00:05:39.150> it<00:05:39.330> off<00:05:39.449> and<00:05:39.750> you<00:05:40.349> know<00:05:40.409> what

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
really set it off and you know what

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.470 
really set it off and you know what
that's<00:05:41.250> going<00:05:41.520> to<00:05:41.610> look<00:05:41.759> really<00:05:41.789> really<00:05:42.180> good

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.540
