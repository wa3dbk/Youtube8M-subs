RTV now high temp silicone that we're

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.060 
RTV now high temp silicone that we're
gonna<00:02:31.620> use<00:02:33.110> Ecuador<00:02:34.110> is<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:34.530> gonna<00:02:34.650> work<00:02:34.740> as<00:02:34.980> a

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
gonna use Ecuador is it gonna work as a

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:51.410 
gonna use Ecuador is it gonna work as a
copy<00:02:35.250> on<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.490> side

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.880 

so<00:02:52.420> we<00:02:52.540> tried<00:02:52.750> this<00:02:52.900> first<00:02:53.080> of<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.319> tank<00:02:53.530> on<00:02:53.650> to

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
so we tried this first of the tank on to

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.949 
so we tried this first of the tank on to
make<00:02:54.040> sure<00:02:54.220> so<00:02:54.730> see<00:02:54.880> how<00:02:55.000> it<00:02:55.120> would<00:02:55.239> fit<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.840> we

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
make sure so see how it would fit and we

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.130 
make sure so see how it would fit and we
think<00:02:56.200> it<00:02:56.530> is<00:02:56.590> like<00:02:56.920> this<00:02:57.959> then<00:02:58.959> we're<00:02:59.050> gonna

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
think it is like this then we're gonna

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.690 
think it is like this then we're gonna
