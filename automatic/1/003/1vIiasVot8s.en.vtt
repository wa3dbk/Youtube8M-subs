the epidural itself as i mentioned

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.010 
the epidural itself as i mentioned
earlier<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.480> safe<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:21.930> effective

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020

technique for labor analgesia takes away

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.560 
technique for labor analgesia takes away
most<00:00:25.080> pretty<00:00:25.769> much<00:00:25.890> quite<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> bit<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.910> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
most pretty much quite a bit of the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.400 
most pretty much quite a bit of the
discomfort<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.560> labor<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.960> it<00:00:30.960> tends<00:00:31.320> to

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
discomfort of labor and it tends to

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.330 
discomfort of labor and it tends to
decrease<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.390> trauma<00:00:33.890> of<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.950> first

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
decrease the trauma of the first

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.400 
decrease the trauma of the first
especially<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.059> first<00:00:36.329> child<00:00:36.809> by<00:00:37.200> allowing

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
especially the first child by allowing

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.619 
especially the first child by allowing
you<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.649> more<00:00:37.920> slow<00:00:38.250> at<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.550> dose<00:00:38.760> slow<00:00:39.270> labor

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
you a more slow at the dose slow labor

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.380 
you a more slow at the dose slow labor
progression<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.610> we<00:00:41.610> have<00:00:41.850> found<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.270> it

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
progression and we have found that it

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.360 
progression and we have found that it
decreases<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.960> chance<00:00:43.260> decreases<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.010> chances

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
decreases a chance decreases the chances

decreases a chance decreases the chances
of<00:00:44.460> c-section<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.840> first<00:00:46.079> pregnancy<00:00:46.789> so

not a painful technique it hurts less
than<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.000> IV<00:01:51.299> because<00:01:51.659> we<00:01:51.840> actually<00:01:52.170> numb<00:01:52.380> the

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
epidural is needle is placed and then we

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.719 
epidural is needle is placed and then we
give<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.479> test<00:02:00.780> dose<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.140> medication<00:02:01.610> to<00:02:02.610> make

give a test dose of medication to make

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.399 
give a test dose of medication to make
sure<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.030> we're<00:02:03.299> not<00:02:03.329> in<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.659> vein<00:02:03.869> or<00:02:04.140> not

sure that we're not in a vein or not

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.560 
sure that we're not in a vein or not
doing<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.770> spinal<00:02:05.040> which<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.790> very<00:02:06.000> very<00:02:06.299> rare

doing a spinal which is very very rare

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.869 
doing a spinal which is very very rare
then<00:02:07.530> we<00:02:07.619> put<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.829> catheter<00:02:08.099> in<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.459> epidural

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
then we put a catheter in the epidural

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.880 
then we put a catheter in the epidural
space<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.420> needle<00:02:09.660> comes<00:02:09.899> out<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.379> catheter

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
space the needle comes out the catheter

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.010 
space the needle comes out the catheter
remains<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:12.000> then<00:02:12.090> we<00:02:12.180> tape<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.510> catheter<00:02:12.989> to

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
remains and then we tape the catheter to

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.590 
remains and then we tape the catheter to
your<00:02:13.260> back

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
your back

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.910
