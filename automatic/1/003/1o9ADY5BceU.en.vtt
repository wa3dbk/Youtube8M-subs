00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.280 
for 43 years
and<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.610> designed<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> flavor<00:01:12.360> package<00:01:12.840> you

flavor<00:01:20.159> package<00:01:20.640> because<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.970> think<00:01:21.090> people

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
flavor package because I think people

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.440 
flavor package because I think people
want<00:01:21.810> something<00:01:22.259> different<00:01:22.909> and<00:01:23.909> that's<00:01:24.210> what

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
want something different and that's what

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.080 
want something different and that's what
