 devices on the mega operating system 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.129

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.850
 is inside the box 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:58.640
 The phone came to us from China 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:01:06.820
 we take out the box a little torn that 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:13.040
 we have a smart phone book itself and 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:14.930
 nothing else okay if we talk about 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.580
 nokia n9 from a technical point of view it 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.680
 nothing revolutionary at the time in it 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.320
 there was no single core giger hertz 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.250
 39 inch processor screen made by 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.180

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.090
 operating system blinked which 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.820
 nobody needs 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.369
 at the time of release this unit 124 thousand 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.539
 rubles for a version with 16 gigabytes per 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.340
 board and 26 thousand for 64 gigabytes externally 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.350
 looks just like a piece of uncouth 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.329
 plastic in which there is a sensor 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.100

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:59.799
 sim card 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.799
 it is done like this 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.650
 Here is such a construction climbs up 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.450
 nokia became the first company after sex 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.260
 applied this format if 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.020
 look at the port you can see that 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.490
 he looks good on the right 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.400
 the end of the apparatus is a button 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.990
 on and volume rocker on the back 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.150

 720p resolution with 30 frames per second 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.160
 let's turn it on and see it elk 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.720
 called instantly by the way this 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.700
 the only smartphone she uses 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.490
 used now it is not officially 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.710
 supported which is very interesting on 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.230
 smartphone generally do not come no buttons 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:50.440
 touch unusual no buttons 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.510
 that is, all control occurs through 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.010
 screen by the way screen 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:59.110
 bulging and not very good move it weighs 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.970
 scratches quickly in general this 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.220
 recovered phone looks good 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.490
 so here is this operating room 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.490
 system 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:20.480
 to go further into the menu or from this 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.600
 menu you need to do here so let's go in 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.600
 options 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.010
 it's based on linux open code so 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.010
 looks like settings 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.270
 let's look at the product 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.180
 the menu is in principle clear and 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.580
 let's see the camera 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.640
 such a camera 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.780
 camera settings 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.319
 opera 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.750
 opera standard connect to wi-fi 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.750
 i won't 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.560
 let's see the gallery 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.370
 no pictures 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.760
 let's see what a tick looks like 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:07.469
 go out of us since you are the ones go out you 

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:07.469
 this and that and get out the same problem 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:24.099
 then put on the block from the block she 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:28.949
 again, but there is, and tell me to come out as 

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:28.949
 eerie here home through me to 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.179
 back back 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:47.290
 back back see the calculator as 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.740
 looks like a calculator looks like 

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.740
 chocolate bar 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:58.150
 again we go out like this 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:07:02.770
 there are still other cranes here they are 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:04.089
 running processes browser menu this 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.699
 operating wall now is not 

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:08.740
 supported by 

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:11.439
 I don't even know where that is for her 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:14.169
 swing but here it is he says mushroom rts 

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:18.309
 games some office applications 

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:20.289
 There is of course our youtube skype 

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:24.069
 some simple office notes 

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:24.879
 There are no applications in general 

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:27.580
 excesses 

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:30.039
 This phone does not work enough 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:35.770
 Stable to disassemble it I just don't want 

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:37.870
 I'm afraid I'll show it and I will not collect it 

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:40.569
 we looked at this chocolate 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.580
 the phone looks rather unusual 

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:44.289
 very similar to android board 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.969
 very comfortable bad that there are no buttons 

00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:46.749
 which could be clicked for example 

00:07:45.969 --> 00:07:48.520
 in the middle on 

00:07:46.749 --> 00:07:50.949
 or buttons for example that turned off 

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:53.050
 would the phone application be for nokia 

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:56.620
 very unpopular here and legs and on 

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:58.449
 the threshold has already begun to give ends in general 

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.099
 that's all I wanted to tell you friends 

00:07:58.449 --> 00:08:02.499
