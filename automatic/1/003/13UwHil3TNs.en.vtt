00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:08.940
 navigation in the bible in Hebrew 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:13.650
 It is basically very simple, right? 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:16.260
 You have here Hebrew and others, right? 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.930
 the Hebrew for you to navigate in the bible 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.369
 in Hebrew and others to navigate in 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.859
 other languages 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.550
 For now, the Bible only has braga. 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:30.390
 Portuguese but will have other 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:35.960
 languages prince is already like others né 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:40.250
 I want to put more languages like here 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:45.149
 Do you have a timer dialed? 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:47.190
 so every time you move and 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.930
 modify the Hebrew will modify the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.890
 another if you will stay the other is 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.910
 to unify Hebrew 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.180
 so the two good versions always be 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:02.149
 synchronized we'll click on verses 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:07.860
 for us we can see an example of this is 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:10.830
 good you have a genius summary of the bible 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.330
 Hebrew this belongs to and just below 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.200
 you have one of them a gift Almeida 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:26.150
 always one below the other always 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:28.950
 can sync 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.200
 a person will want to take the 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.670
 synchronize because by logic it goes 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.670
 must always see Genesis as a Hebrew and 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:42.210
 zoom Portuguese another language but she goes 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.700
 want always well synchronized exists 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.869
 this button here or sync to you 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.649
 synchronize with the following 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:55.649
 there are some verses and in the bible 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.930
 Hebrew is different from other languages 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.890
 for example malachites 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.890
 let's go to nuno marques 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.780
 when you can see here in Hebrew 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.580
 malachite 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:17.130
 he has three chapters 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.330
 but other languages in four chapters 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.420
 huh 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.820
 not that the text is bigger 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:28.230
 the text of a different font is white 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:32.790
 There 's a piece - bray, chapter by chapter. 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:37.080
 - is the same chapter in the same chapter 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:41.250
 it 's not the same amount of text 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.560
 however the division of chapters and 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.709
 verses is different 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:52.170
 So if I come here in Malawi 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:57.090
 chapter 3 verse 24 is the last 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:59.850
 chapter of non-Hebrew 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.670
 going to open could not open nor 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:06.380
 gotta put the 24th verse here 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.360
 because in Portuguese in other languages 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:13.680
 go only until verse 18 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.880
 verse 19 is chapter 4 verse 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.860
 1 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.640
 so if you want to compare the two 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:29.760
 versions of santa that came here jirau 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:35.040
 synchronize enter chapter 4 and 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:42.720
 come in is the last one in portuguese now 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:47.390
 yes, then there is the malachi 3 24 in 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:50.250
 Hebrew is the same as the Malachi 46 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.670
 Portuguese and other languages ​​as well 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.640
 then this is the reason that exists or 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:01.440
 synchronize then this is the 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.680
 basic site navigation to the next 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.680
 video
