seen it too many times when I mentioned
fog<00:00:27.930> coat<00:00:28.289> that's<00:00:29.220> why<00:00:29.490> I'm<00:00:29.730> making<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.210> video

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539

I<00:00:30.810> think<00:00:30.840> I've<00:00:31.170> even<00:00:31.289> made<00:00:31.590> one<00:00:31.859> more<00:00:32.130> before

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
to need a few tools you're gonna need a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.270 
to need a few tools you're gonna need a

up but there is one more thing you
should<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.990> before<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:15.200> put<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.290> stuff<00:01:16.530> in

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
should have before you put the stuff in

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.370 
should have before you put the stuff in
a<00:01:16.740> container<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:18.060> paint<00:01:18.689> strainer

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
a container and that is a paint strainer

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.160 
a container and that is a paint strainer
these<00:01:20.130> things<00:01:20.430> work<00:01:20.700> great<00:01:20.729> just<00:01:21.570> simply<00:01:21.930> put

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
these things work great just simply put

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.260 
these things work great just simply put
the<00:01:22.380> strainer<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.430> bucket<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
the strainer in the bucket this is the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.179 
the strainer in the bucket this is the
same<00:01:24.450> thing<00:01:24.689> they<00:01:24.840> use<00:01:25.020> for<00:01:25.380> straining<00:01:25.830> paint

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
same thing they use for straining paint

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.830 
same thing they use for straining paint
and<00:01:26.549> can<00:01:26.790> be<00:01:26.939> purchased<00:01:27.180> at<00:01:27.979> almost<00:01:28.979> anywhere

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
and can be purchased at almost anywhere

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.090 
and can be purchased at almost anywhere
and<00:01:30.840> if<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.049> don't<00:01:31.259> have<00:01:31.500> something<00:01:31.920> like

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
and if you don't have something like

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.210 
and if you don't have something like
that<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.310> can<00:01:32.579> always<00:01:32.729> use<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> nylon<00:01:33.979> but<00:01:34.979> I

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
that you can always use a nylon but I

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.649 
that you can always use a nylon but I
think<00:01:35.520> these<00:01:35.640> paints<00:01:36.000> strength<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.390> paint

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
think these paints strength the paint

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.230 
think these paints strength the paint
strainers<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.500> get<00:01:38.030> they<00:01:39.030> work

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
strainers that you get they work

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.060 
strainers that you get they work
fantastic<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:40.200> they<00:01:40.259> hold<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.530> little<00:01:40.710> more

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
fantastic and they hold a little more

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.660 
fantastic and they hold a little more
materials<00:01:41.850> than<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:43.159> nylon<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.399> I'd<00:01:44.490> recommend

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
materials than a nylon so I'd recommend

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.300 
materials than a nylon so I'd recommend
getting<00:01:45.329> one<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.899> getting<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.560> strainer

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
getting one of the getting a strainer

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.190 
getting one of the getting a strainer
like<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.880> just<00:01:48.090> simply<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> cloth<00:01:49.460> with

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
like that just simply a cloth with

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.429 
like that just simply a cloth with
extremely<00:01:52.200> small<00:01:53.420> I<00:01:54.420> don't<00:01:55.110> even<00:01:55.170> know<00:01:55.350> what

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
extremely small I don't even know what

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.410 
extremely small I don't even know what
they'd<00:01:55.590> be<00:01:55.740> little<00:01:56.009> small<00:01:56.250> squares<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:57.240> let

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
they'd be little small squares to let

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.039 
they'd be little small squares to let
the<00:01:58.219> water<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.000> cement<00:02:00.420> mixture<00:02:00.750> through

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
the water and the cement mixture through

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.350

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
but to keep the clumps that are going to

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.410 
but to keep the clumps that are going to
be<00:02:03.540> blocking<00:02:03.960> your<00:02:04.740> Hudson<00:02:05.040> sprayer<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:06.240> of

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
be blocking your Hudson sprayer and of

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.440 
be blocking your Hudson sprayer and of
course<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:06.990> reason<00:02:07.409> why<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.649> strain

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
course that is the reason why you strain

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.690 
course that is the reason why you strain
these<00:02:09.450> materials<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.340> can<00:02:11.520> just

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
these materials so that you can just

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.270 
these materials so that you can just
spray<00:02:11.970> effortlessly

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
spray effortlessly

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.910 
spray effortlessly
with<00:02:13.700> your<00:02:14.060> sprayer<00:02:14.390> when<00:02:14.750> after<00:02:15.530> it's<00:02:15.740> all

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
with your sprayer when after it's all

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.120 
with your sprayer when after it's all
mixed<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:16.460> loaded<00:02:17.060> into<00:02:17.240> the<00:02:17.360> sprayer<00:02:17.780> I

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
mixed and loaded into the sprayer I

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.330 
mixed and loaded into the sprayer I
actually<00:02:19.130> like<00:02:19.520> to<00:02:19.550> double<00:02:20.060> strain<00:02:20.450> the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
actually like to double strain the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.100 
actually like to double strain the
materials<00:02:22.340> so<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:22.820> put<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:23.270> into<00:02:23.390> one<00:02:23.630> container

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
materials so I put it into one container

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.170 
materials so I put it into one container
but<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:24.620> then<00:02:24.710> I<00:02:24.830> strain<00:02:25.430> it<00:02:25.580> again<00:02:25.910> when<00:02:26.090> it

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
but and then I strain it again when it

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.570 
but and then I strain it again when it
goes<00:02:26.330> into<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.750> Hudson<00:02:27.140> sprayer<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:28.010> you

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
goes into the Hudson sprayer so you

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.760 
goes into the Hudson sprayer so you
could<00:02:28.700> always<00:02:28.850> try<00:02:29.120> that<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:30.560> these

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
could always try that and these

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.190 
could always try that and these
materials<00:02:31.370> will<00:02:31.970> need<00:02:32.209> to<00:02:32.390> be<00:02:32.540> sprayed<00:02:32.810> on<00:02:32.870> if

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
materials will need to be sprayed on if

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.260 
materials will need to be sprayed on if
you'd<00:02:33.320> let<00:02:33.560> it<00:02:33.680> sit<00:02:33.950> overnight<00:02:34.120> you're<00:02:35.120> gonna

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
you'd let it sit overnight you're gonna

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.900 
you'd let it sit overnight you're gonna
get<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.780> cement<00:02:36.230> mixture<00:02:36.709> on<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.040> bottom<00:02:37.580> and

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
get the cement mixture on the bottom and

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.390 
get the cement mixture on the bottom and
shaking<00:02:38.690> it<00:02:38.840> up<00:02:39.020> all<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.500> time<00:02:39.709> isn't<00:02:39.980> going

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
shaking it up all the time isn't going

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.770 
shaking it up all the time isn't going
to<00:02:40.520> work<00:02:40.760> you<00:02:41.060> might<00:02:41.209> need<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.980> mix<00:02:42.980> it<00:02:43.190> again

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
to work you might need to mix it again

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.500 
to work you might need to mix it again
before<00:02:44.830> spraying<00:02:45.830> but<00:02:46.310> that<00:02:47.209> could<00:02:47.360> all<00:02:47.480> be

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
before spraying but that could all be

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.330 
before spraying but that could all be
trial<00:02:47.959> and<00:02:48.170> error<00:02:48.410> for<00:02:48.800> you<00:02:49.010> give<00:02:49.310> you

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
trial and error for you give you

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.990 
trial and error for you give you
something<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:50.020> process<00:02:51.020> there<00:02:51.489> last<00:02:52.489> but<00:02:52.820> not

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
something to process there last but not

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.750 
something to process there last but not
least<00:02:53.480> simply<00:02:54.260> grab<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.709> Hudson<00:02:55.100> sprayer<00:02:55.400> and

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
least simply grab the Hudson sprayer and

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.750 
least simply grab the Hudson sprayer and
start<00:02:56.120> spraying<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.780> stucco<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:57.760> it

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
start spraying the stucco and it

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.449 
start spraying the stucco and it
realistically<00:02:59.540> is<00:02:59.720> as<00:02:59.930> easy<00:03:00.170> as<00:03:00.440> that<00:03:00.470> even<00:03:01.280> if

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
realistically is as easy as that even if

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.000 
realistically is as easy as that even if
you<00:03:01.670> spray<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.450> stucco<00:03:02.870> onto<00:03:03.320> certain<00:03:03.530> things

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
you spray the stucco onto certain things

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.790 
you spray the stucco onto certain things
like<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.840> gutter<00:03:05.840> downspout<00:03:06.080> there<00:03:06.620> you<00:03:06.709> can

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
like the gutter downspout there you can

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.220 
like the gutter downspout there you can
simply<00:03:07.100> wipe<00:03:07.250> it<00:03:07.430> off<00:03:07.580> if<00:03:07.820> it's<00:03:07.970> metal<00:03:08.230> however

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
simply wipe it off if it's metal however

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.590 
simply wipe it off if it's metal however
you<00:03:09.980> might<00:03:10.130> not<00:03:10.340> have<00:03:10.520> the<00:03:10.640> same<00:03:10.850> opportunity

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
you might not have the same opportunity

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.479 
you might not have the same opportunity
if<00:03:11.840> you're<00:03:12.110> going<00:03:12.410> to<00:03:12.590> spray<00:03:12.860> it<00:03:13.010> on<00:03:13.160> to<00:03:13.459> a

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
if you're going to spray it on to a

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.940 
if you're going to spray it on to a
sidewalk<00:03:14.360> remember<00:03:14.870> this<00:03:15.020> stuff<00:03:15.260> absorbs

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
sidewalk remember this stuff absorbs

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.090 
sidewalk remember this stuff absorbs
into<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.730> stucco<00:03:17.239> it's<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.380> cement<00:03:18.769> based

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
into the stucco it's a cement based

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.539 
into the stucco it's a cement based
product<00:03:19.730> it<00:03:20.630> will<00:03:20.840> also<00:03:21.380> absorb<00:03:21.769> into<00:03:22.160> other

product it will also absorb into other
cement<00:03:23.090> based<00:03:23.420> products<00:03:24.350> so<00:03:24.500> make<00:03:24.680> sure<00:03:24.709> that

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
cement based products so make sure that

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.310 
cement based products so make sure that
you<00:03:25.190> cover<00:03:25.489> these<00:03:25.700> areas<00:03:25.760> with<00:03:26.570> plastic<00:03:27.140> or

killed it and go from there I wasn't

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.890 
killed it and go from there I wasn't
really<00:03:41.989> worried<00:03:42.290> about<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:42.650> plants<00:03:43.220> but

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
really worried about the plants but

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.130 
really worried about the plants but
definitely<00:03:44.900> cover<00:03:45.320> up<00:03:45.650> any<00:03:46.430> concrete<00:03:47.239> or<00:03:47.930> even

definitely cover up any concrete or even

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.199 
definitely cover up any concrete or even
