produce two flower spikes but they just

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.889 
produce two flower spikes but they just
dried<00:00:40.350> up<00:00:40.379> for<00:00:41.010> no<00:00:41.129> reason<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.790> actually<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.510> am

behaves<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> sense<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.530> when<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.190> new

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
behaves in the sense that when the new

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.150 
behaves in the sense that when the new
growth<00:00:48.050> matured<00:00:49.050> these<00:00:49.410> are<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.739> new<00:00:49.860> growth

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
growth matured these are the new growth

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.450 
growth matured these are the new growth
they<00:00:50.489> started<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.030> get<00:00:51.210> all<00:00:51.690> sort<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.460> spots

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460

and<00:00:53.820> weird<00:00:54.660> rusty<00:00:55.199> colors<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.190> underside

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
and weird rusty colors on the underside

and weird rusty colors on the underside
of<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.940> leaf<00:00:57.210> as<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.750> can<00:00:57.930> see<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
of the leaf as you can see this is the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.670 
of the leaf as you can see this is the
leaf<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.070> cut<00:00:59.430> for<00:00:59.789> testing<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.620> all<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
leaf that I cut for testing and all the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.109 
leaf that I cut for testing and all the
the<00:01:02.309> leaves<00:01:02.730> are<00:01:03.149> looking<00:01:03.719> like<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
the leaves are looking like this and

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.630 
the leaves are looking like this and
yeah<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.360> don't<00:01:06.479> seem<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.020> fight<00:01:07.200> any<00:01:07.470> leaf<00:01:08.340> that

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
yeah I don't seem to fight any leaf that

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.410 
yeah I don't seem to fight any leaf that
is<00:01:08.790> completely<00:01:09.360> perfect<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.260> green<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.070> nice

except for this new growth but I'm sure
it<00:01:14.250> will<00:01:14.490> start<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.210> develop<00:01:15.360> those<00:01:15.780> ugly

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.969 
have a better look but yeah I tested
this<00:01:33.689> orchid<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:36.900> result<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.500> positive

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
this orchid and the result is positive

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.130 
this orchid and the result is positive
for<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.579> virus<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.420> time<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
for a virus but this time is the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.800 
for a virus but this time is the
cymbidium<00:01:40.500> mosaic<00:01:41.100> virus<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.909> hopefully<00:01:42.720> you

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
cymbidium mosaic virus and hopefully you

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.149 
cymbidium mosaic virus and hopefully you
can<00:01:42.930> see<00:01:43.079> on<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.290> test<00:01:43.470> here<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.770> have<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
can see on the test here I have the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.830 
can see on the test here I have the
control<00:01:44.520> line<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.000> just<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.450> middle<00:01:45.689> just

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
control line and just in the middle just

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.069 
control line and just in the middle just
very<00:01:46.320> faint<00:01:46.710> line<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.570> oncidium<00:01:48.570> ringspot

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
very faint line of oncidium ringspot

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.370 
very faint line of oncidium ringspot
virus<00:01:49.170> as<00:01:49.890> well<00:01:50.100> I'm<00:01:50.670> not<00:01:50.939> sure<00:01:51.240> if<00:01:52.049> this

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
virus as well I'm not sure if this

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.800 
virus as well I'm not sure if this
orchid<00:01:52.740> has<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.399> small<00:01:53.880> infection<00:01:54.299> with<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
orchid has a small infection with the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.899 
orchid has a small infection with the
oncidium<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.530> ringspot<00:01:55.920> virus<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.700> it's

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909

mosaic<00:01:59.670> virus<00:01:59.700> as<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.420> can<00:02:00.570> see<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.710> just

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
mosaic virus as you can see and I just

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.039 
mosaic virus as you can see and I just
wanted<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.399> record<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.329> show<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.719> guys

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
wanted to record this and show you guys

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.740 
wanted to record this and show you guys
how<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.829> streaking<00:02:05.369> mosaic<00:02:06.180> pattern

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
how the streaking mosaic pattern

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.619 
how the streaking mosaic pattern
whatever<00:02:07.170> looks<00:02:07.530> like<00:02:08.030> you<00:02:09.030> wouldn't<00:02:09.450> really

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
whatever looks like you wouldn't really

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.510 
whatever looks like you wouldn't really
say<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.200> would<00:02:10.319> say<00:02:10.500> it's<00:02:10.649> just<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:11.039> spotted

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
say it you would say it's just a spotted

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.400 
say it you would say it's just a spotted
oncidium<00:02:12.000> right

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
oncidium right

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.309 
oncidium right
well<00:02:13.710> no<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.460> appears<00:02:14.910> that<00:02:15.360> these<00:02:15.569> pots<00:02:16.020> and

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
well no it appears that these pots and

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.940 
well no it appears that these pots and
the<00:02:16.980> rusty<00:02:17.490> color<00:02:17.850> actually<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:19.319> starts<00:02:19.770> to

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
the rusty color actually that starts to

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.480 
the rusty color actually that starts to
develop<00:02:20.000> whenever<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.900> new<00:02:22.110> leaf<00:02:22.650> reaches

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
develop whenever a new leaf reaches

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.340 
develop whenever a new leaf reaches
maturity<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:24.209> new<00:02:24.540> growth<00:02:24.810> reaches<00:02:25.230> maturity

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
maturity a new growth reaches maturity

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.640 
maturity a new growth reaches maturity
is<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.950> sign<00:02:26.340> of<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.730> cymbidium<00:02:27.030> mosaic<00:02:27.540> virus

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
is a sign of the cymbidium mosaic virus

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.680 
is a sign of the cymbidium mosaic virus
here<00:02:28.650> you<00:02:28.800> can<00:02:29.010> see<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.310> sort<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.910> ring<00:02:30.270> shape

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
here you can see a sort of a ring shape

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.210 
here you can see a sort of a ring shape
spots<00:02:31.230> this<00:02:32.040> really<00:02:32.520> looks<00:02:32.730> like<00:02:32.820> a<00:02:34.220> oncidium

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
spots this really looks like a oncidium

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.660 
spots this really looks like a oncidium
ring<00:02:35.490> spot<00:02:35.730> virus<00:02:35.790> maybe<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:37.110> has<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.670> small

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
ring spot virus maybe it has a small

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.210 
ring spot virus maybe it has a small
development<00:02:39.420> on<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:39.720> as<00:02:40.290> well<00:02:40.560> that<00:02:40.890> showed

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
development on that as well that showed

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.300 
development on that as well that showed
on<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.580> test<00:02:42.180> strip<00:02:42.480> but<00:02:43.110> in<00:02:43.260> any<00:02:43.410> case<00:02:43.709> this

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
on the test strip but in any case this

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.360 
on the test strip but in any case this
is<00:02:44.610> how<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.300> looks<00:02:45.690> like<00:02:45.989> it<00:02:46.800> doesn't<00:02:47.250> look

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
is how it looks like it doesn't look

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.840 
is how it looks like it doesn't look
pretty

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
pretty

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.620 
pretty
it<00:02:48.450> does<00:02:48.690> look<00:02:48.930> sort<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.350> mosaic<00:02:49.770> but<00:02:50.130> again

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
it does look sort of mosaic but again

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.780 
it does look sort of mosaic but again
viruses<00:02:51.630> can<00:02:51.870> look<00:02:52.019> different<00:02:52.260> in<00:02:52.830> orchids

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
viruses can look different in orchids

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.300 
viruses can look different in orchids
this<00:02:54.510> is<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.690> cymbidium<00:02:55.050> Australian<00:02:55.890> oncidium

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
this is a cymbidium Australian oncidium

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.220 
this is a cymbidium Australian oncidium
but<00:02:56.580> this<00:02:57.180> virus<00:02:57.570> can<00:02:57.810> look<00:02:57.989> totally

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
but this virus can look totally

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.740 
but this virus can look totally
different<00:02:58.410> on<00:02:59.250> a<00:02:59.310> cymbidium<00:02:59.790> or<00:03:00.269> as<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.690> go

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
different on a cymbidium or as I go

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.170 
different on a cymbidium or as I go
petal<00:03:01.170> um<00:03:01.290> or<00:03:01.470> any<00:03:01.500> other<00:03:01.890> orchid<00:03:02.459> this<00:03:03.000> is

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
petal um or any other orchid this is

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.840 
petal um or any other orchid this is
just<00:03:03.540> how<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.840> looks<00:03:04.050> like<00:03:04.230> on<00:03:04.590> my<00:03:05.220> orchid<00:03:05.670> here

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
just how it looks like on my orchid here

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.400 
just how it looks like on my orchid here
and<00:03:06.000> this<00:03:06.120> is<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.360> reason<00:03:06.690> why<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:06.840> wanted<00:03:07.230> to

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
and this is the reason why I wanted to

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.710 
and this is the reason why I wanted to
test<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.800> all<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.250> leaves<00:03:08.459> look<00:03:09.090> like<00:03:09.300> this<00:03:09.540> on

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
test it all the leaves look like this on

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.420 
test it all the leaves look like this on
the<00:03:09.840> underside<00:03:10.350> maybe<00:03:10.680> if<00:03:10.860> you<00:03:10.950> look<00:03:11.100> it<00:03:11.220> from

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
the underside maybe if you look it from

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.090 
the underside maybe if you look it from
above<00:03:11.700> doesn't<00:03:12.269> look<00:03:12.390> so<00:03:12.570> ill<00:03:13.080> but<00:03:13.500> it<00:03:13.650> is<00:03:13.800> and

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
above doesn't look so ill but it is and

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.180 
above doesn't look so ill but it is and
it's<00:03:14.220> really<00:03:14.700> not<00:03:15.080> performing<00:03:16.080> great<00:03:16.380> that's

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
it's really not performing great that's

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.860 
it's really not performing great that's
the<00:03:17.459> main<00:03:17.700> issue<00:03:18.000> I'm<00:03:18.450> not<00:03:18.480> sure<00:03:18.780> if

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
the main issue I'm not sure if

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.509 
the main issue I'm not sure if
eventually<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:19.470> will<00:03:19.620> die<00:03:19.769> but<00:03:19.920> it's<00:03:20.100> really

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
eventually you will die but it's really

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.250 
eventually you will die but it's really
not<00:03:20.730> performing<00:03:21.239> great<00:03:21.420> it's<00:03:21.690> not<00:03:21.900> blooming

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
not performing great it's not blooming

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.590 
not performing great it's not blooming
it's<00:03:23.100> not<00:03:23.280> producing<00:03:23.579> as<00:03:23.880> many<00:03:24.000> words<00:03:24.299> as<00:03:24.450> I

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
it's not producing as many words as I

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.390 
it's not producing as many words as I
would<00:03:24.780> like<00:03:24.959> okay<00:03:25.680> let's<00:03:25.980> look<00:03:26.190> at<00:03:26.340> another

really<00:03:55.170> more<00:03:55.970> obvious<00:03:56.970> than<00:03:57.180> this<00:03:57.360> it<00:03:57.870> has

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
really more obvious than this it has

really more obvious than this it has
this<00:03:58.440> pink<00:03:59.070> line<00:03:59.780> not<00:04:00.780> sure<00:04:01.079> why<00:04:01.260> my<00:04:01.470> camera<00:04:01.890> is

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
this pink line not sure why my camera is

it does have a pink line in the middle

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.860 
it does have a pink line in the middle
this<00:04:07.829> is<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.130> oncidium<00:04:08.549> ringspot<00:04:08.970> virus<00:04:09.060> sign

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
this is the oncidium ringspot virus sign

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.390 
this is the oncidium ringspot virus sign
and<00:04:10.170> I<00:04:10.290> just<00:04:10.500> want<00:04:10.680> to<00:04:10.769> show<00:04:10.920> you<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.220> leaf

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
see something like this on your orchid

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.000 
see something like this on your orchid
test<00:04:33.720> it<00:04:33.900> right<00:04:34.320> away

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
test it right away

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.330 
test it right away
other<00:04:35.430> than<00:04:35.700> that<00:04:35.760> this<00:04:36.600> work<00:04:36.810> kid

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
other than that this work kid

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.120 
other than that this work kid
it<00:04:38.790> won't<00:04:39.150> but<00:04:39.780> it's<00:04:39.900> really<00:04:40.410> not<00:04:40.650> performing

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
it won't but it's really not performing

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.130 
it won't but it's really not performing
great<00:04:41.310> I<00:04:41.580> try<00:04:41.940> to<00:04:42.000> keep<00:04:42.180> it<00:04:42.330> super<00:04:42.450> hydrated

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
great I try to keep it super hydrated

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.920 
great I try to keep it super hydrated
but<00:04:43.290> still<00:04:43.680> I<00:04:43.710> have<00:04:44.010> really<00:04:44.450> added<00:04:45.450> looking

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
but still I have really added looking

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.370 
but still I have really added looking
new<00:04:46.320> growths<00:04:46.880> also<00:04:47.880> the<00:04:48.150> Leafs<00:04:48.390> have<00:04:48.750> a<00:04:49.050> lot<00:04:49.350> of

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
new growths also the Leafs have a lot of

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.120 
new growths also the Leafs have a lot of
spotting<00:04:49.950> on<00:04:50.310> them<00:04:50.520> and<00:04:50.880> they<00:04:51.570> go<00:04:51.750> yellow<00:04:52.200> very

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
spotting on them and they go yellow very

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.840 
spotting on them and they go yellow very
quickly<00:04:53.670> and<00:04:54.200> yeah<00:04:55.200> overall<00:04:55.800> I<00:04:56.130> really<00:04:56.490> don't

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
quickly and yeah overall I really don't

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.090 
quickly and yeah overall I really don't
like<00:04:57.000> the<00:04:57.210> way<00:04:57.330> it's<00:04:57.510> growing<00:04:58.110> even<00:04:58.860> though<00:04:59.070> I

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
like the way it's growing even though I

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.030 
like the way it's growing even though I
keep<00:04:59.370> it<00:04:59.520> hydrated<00:04:59.700> and<00:05:00.240> so<00:05:00.480> on<00:05:00.690> it's<00:05:01.530> just<00:05:01.680> not

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
keep it hydrated and so on it's just not

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.590 
keep it hydrated and so on it's just not
performing<00:05:02.580> well<00:05:02.610> again<00:05:03.090> it's<00:05:03.270> a<00:05:03.360> sign<00:05:03.570> of

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
performing well again it's a sign of

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.530 
performing well again it's a sign of
virus<00:05:04.050> infection<00:05:04.620> and<00:05:04.860> all<00:05:05.730> the<00:05:05.940> spotting<00:05:06.390> on

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
virus infection and all the spotting on

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.530 
virus infection and all the spotting on
the<00:05:06.660> leaves<00:05:06.900> look<00:05:07.830> at<00:05:07.950> this<00:05:08.180> look<00:05:09.180> at<00:05:09.330> this

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
the leaves look at this look at this

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.880 
the leaves look at this look at this
leaf<00:05:09.900> now<00:05:10.800> all<00:05:11.040> the<00:05:11.310> spotting<00:05:11.820> up<00:05:11.970> on<00:05:12.210> the<00:05:12.450> leaf

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
leaf now all the spotting up on the leaf

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.070 
leaf now all the spotting up on the leaf
it's<00:05:13.890> really<00:05:14.190> ugly<00:05:14.310> it's<00:05:14.640> a<00:05:14.730> sign<00:05:14.970> that<00:05:15.210> your

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
it's really ugly it's a sign that your

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.200 
it's really ugly it's a sign that your
orchid<00:05:16.410> might<00:05:16.740> have<00:05:17.130> a<00:05:17.160> virus<00:05:17.670> the<00:05:17.910> only<00:05:18.120> way

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
orchid might have a virus the only way

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.330 
orchid might have a virus the only way
to<00:05:18.270> know<00:05:18.600> actually<00:05:19.170> is<00:05:19.380> by<00:05:19.710> testing<00:05:20.010> your

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
to know actually is by testing your

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.520 
to know actually is by testing your
orchids<00:05:20.790> because<00:05:21.300> I<00:05:21.390> do<00:05:21.450> have<00:05:21.720> another<00:05:22.230> orchid

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
orchids because I do have another orchid

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.710 
orchids because I do have another orchid
I'll<00:05:23.010> try<00:05:23.490> to<00:05:23.550> show<00:05:23.850> a<00:05:23.880> picture<00:05:24.270> on<00:05:24.360> the<00:05:24.480> screen

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
I'll try to show a picture on the screen

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.530 
I'll try to show a picture on the screen
right<00:05:24.870> now<00:05:24.930> it<00:05:25.590> looks<00:05:25.800> so<00:05:26.220> weird<00:05:26.460> it<00:05:27.210> looks

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
right now it looks so weird it looks

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.350 
right now it looks so weird it looks
like<00:05:27.750> a<00:05:27.780> virus<00:05:28.350> really<00:05:28.800> it<00:05:28.860> has<00:05:29.130> the<00:05:29.430> rounded

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
like a virus really it has the rounded

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.820 
like a virus really it has the rounded
shape<00:05:30.420> with<00:05:30.900> the<00:05:30.990> dot<00:05:31.170> in<00:05:31.380> the<00:05:31.470> middle<00:05:31.710> but

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
shape with the dot in the middle but

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.970 
shape with the dot in the middle but
it's<00:05:31.980> not<00:05:32.280> a<00:05:32.310> virus<00:05:33.110> it's<00:05:34.110> just<00:05:34.410> a<00:05:34.500> bacterial

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
it's not a virus it's just a bacterial

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.340 
it's not a virus it's just a bacterial
infection<00:05:35.070> but<00:05:36.060> it<00:05:36.210> definitely<00:05:36.780> looks<00:05:37.110> like<00:05:37.200> a

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
infection but it definitely looks like a

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.500 
infection but it definitely looks like a
virus<00:05:37.860> or<00:05:38.040> it<00:05:38.190> just<00:05:38.220> looks<00:05:38.580> like<00:05:38.640> to<00:05:39.300> me<00:05:39.450> it

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
virus or it just looks like to me it

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:40.820 
virus or it just looks like to me it
looks<00:05:39.690> like<00:05:39.750> a<00:05:39.870> virus<00:05:40.230> because<00:05:40.470> I<00:05:40.530> don't<00:05:40.740> have

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
looks like a virus because I don't have

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.160 
looks like a virus because I don't have
too<00:05:41.100> much<00:05:41.220> experiences<00:05:41.880> with<00:05:42.030> viruses<00:05:42.540> but<00:05:43.110> I

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
too much experiences with viruses but I

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.290 
too much experiences with viruses but I
tested<00:05:43.590> it<00:05:43.650> it's<00:05:43.950> negative<00:05:44.400> yay

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
tested it it's negative yay

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.170 
tested it it's negative yay
it's<00:05:45.720> the<00:05:45.960> NC<00:05:46.380> Korea<00:05:46.680> from<00:05:47.010> shredders<00:05:47.580> so<00:05:47.910> I

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
it's the NC Korea from shredders so I

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.300 
it's the NC Korea from shredders so I
was<00:05:48.630> a<00:05:48.660> bit<00:05:48.870> nervous<00:05:49.200> about<00:05:49.350> it<00:05:49.650> but<00:05:49.770> it's<00:05:50.070> um

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
was a bit nervous about it but it's um

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.600 
was a bit nervous about it but it's um
it's<00:05:51.060> negative<00:05:51.630> that's<00:05:51.990> a<00:05:52.170> good<00:05:52.320> sign

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
it's negative that's a good sign

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.740 
it's negative that's a good sign
unfortunately<00:05:53.610> these<00:05:53.850> two<00:05:53.910> orchids<00:05:54.480> are

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
unfortunately these two orchids are

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.220 
unfortunately these two orchids are
positive<00:05:55.680> for<00:05:55.830> viruses<00:05:56.250> and<00:05:56.790> I<00:05:57.510> think<00:05:58.020> I<00:05:58.110> will

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.230 
positive for viruses and I think I will

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.470 
positive for viruses and I think I will
throw<00:05:58.920> them<00:05:59.130> away<00:05:59.280> don't<00:05:59.670> want<00:05:59.820> to<00:05:59.910> expose<00:06:00.180> all

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.670 
this on the test trip I showed you how
the<00:06:25.260> Leafs<00:06:25.650> look<00:06:26.040> like<00:06:26.340> so<00:06:27.330> pretty<00:06:28.200> confusing

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
to me at this point but hopefully I can

to me at this point but hopefully I can
make<00:06:31.020> a<00:06:31.050> trained<00:06:31.650> eye<00:06:31.860> for<00:06:32.640> leaves

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580

they are now performing grades and I
look<00:06:37.030> at<00:06:37.180> believes<00:06:37.479> hopefully<00:06:37.870> I'll<00:06:38.050> be<00:06:38.080> able

00:06:38.369 --> 00:06:38.379
