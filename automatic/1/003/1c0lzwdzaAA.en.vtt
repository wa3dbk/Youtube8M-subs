00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.299 
for for you is the made Hornets park
amplifier<00:00:06.529> what<00:00:07.529> you<00:00:07.649> see<00:00:07.830> in<00:00:07.950> front<00:00:08.130> of<00:00:08.250> you

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
amplifier what you see in front of you

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.040 
amplifier what you see in front of you
is<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.580> simulator<00:00:09.269> and<00:00:09.570> it's<00:00:09.809> going<00:00:09.990> to

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
is a simulator and it's going to

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.360 
is a simulator and it's going to
simulate<00:00:10.730> the<00:00:11.730> standard<00:00:12.389> spark<00:00:12.870> out<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:14.160> your

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
simulate the standard spark out of your

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.300 
simulate the standard spark out of your
car<00:00:14.759> what<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.150> looks<00:00:15.420> like<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.020> then<00:00:16.830> after<00:00:17.190> we

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
car what it looks like and then after we

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.730 
car what it looks like and then after we
show<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.789> standard<00:00:18.330> spark<00:00:18.779> we're<00:00:19.590> going

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
show you the standard spark we're going

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.220 
show you the standard spark we're going
to<00:00:19.800> turn<00:00:20.039> on<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.430> amplifier<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.570> show<00:00:22.170> you

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
to turn on the amplifier and show you

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.620 
to turn on the amplifier and show you
what<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.650> spark<00:00:22.980> looks<00:00:23.310> like<00:00:23.550> after<00:00:24.240> the

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
what the spark looks like after the

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.410 
what the spark looks like after the
spark<00:00:25.050> simulators<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:26.039> hooked<00:00:26.849> up<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.240> turned

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
spark simulators is hooked up and turned

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:50.770 
spark simulators is hooked up and turned
on<00:00:28.730> turn<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.760> up<00:00:29.910> turn<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.240> simulator<00:00:30.750> on

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.889 

okay<00:00:51.780> what<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.050> just<00:00:52.230> saw<00:00:52.469> was<00:00:52.730> these

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
okay what you just saw was these

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.369 
okay what you just saw was these
standard<00:00:54.899> ignition<00:00:56.059> running<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.180> 3000<00:00:57.989> rpm

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
standard ignition running a 3000 rpm

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.160 
standard ignition running a 3000 rpm
that's<00:00:58.649> what<00:00:58.890> your<00:00:59.070> spark<00:00:59.399> would<00:00:59.610> look<00:00:59.789> like

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
that's what your spark would look like

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.779 
that's what your spark would look like
now<00:01:01.170> what<00:01:01.440> you're<00:01:01.589> going<00:01:01.769> to<00:01:01.890> see<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.309> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
now what you're going to see is the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.660 
now what you're going to see is the
spark<00:01:03.210> with<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.409> man<00:01:04.830> Hornets<00:01:05.339> park

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
spark with the man Hornets park

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:29.690 
spark with the man Hornets park
amplifier<00:01:06.360> engaged

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.969 

okay<00:01:30.700> what<00:01:31.180> you<00:01:31.329> just<00:01:31.479> saw<00:01:31.720> was<00:01:31.960> the<00:01:32.140> increase

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
okay what you just saw was the increase

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.569 
okay what you just saw was the increase
in<00:01:33.159> amplitude<00:01:33.840> from<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:34.990> standard<00:01:35.470> spark<00:01:35.920> to

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
in amplitude from the standard spark to

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:39.870 
in amplitude from the standard spark to
the<00:01:37.110> amplified<00:01:38.110> spark<00:01:38.619> thus<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.490> spark

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
the amplified spark thus the spark

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.850 
the amplified spark thus the spark
amplifier<00:01:40.600> that's<00:01:40.869> why<00:01:41.020> it's<00:01:41.170> called<00:01:41.229> a<00:01:41.500> spark

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
amplifier that's why it's called a spark

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.090 
amplifier that's why it's called a spark
amplifier<00:01:42.689> now<00:01:43.689> what<00:01:43.899> this<00:01:44.079> does<00:01:44.140> is<00:01:44.649> it<00:01:44.680> burns

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
amplifier now what this does is it burns

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.690 
amplifier now what this does is it burns
up<00:01:45.460> all<00:01:45.970> of<00:01:46.509> the<00:01:46.810> gas<00:01:47.649> and<00:01:47.979> your<00:01:48.159> cylinder

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
up all of the gas and your cylinder

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.969 
up all of the gas and your cylinder
instead<00:01:49.000> of<00:01:49.270> just<00:01:49.420> partially<00:01:50.140> with<00:01:50.799> the

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
instead of just partially with the

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.550 
instead of just partially with the
smaller<00:01:51.280> spark<00:01:51.789> so<00:01:52.600> you<00:01:52.689> get<00:01:52.990> it<00:01:53.079> you<00:01:53.350> get

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
smaller spark so you get it you get

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.149 
smaller spark so you get it you get
better<00:01:54.429> fuel<00:01:54.759> mileage<00:01:54.850> and<00:01:55.509> more<00:01:55.689> power

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
better fuel mileage and more power

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.919 
better fuel mileage and more power
simply<00:01:57.159> by<00:01:57.340> adding<00:01:57.579> this<00:01:57.909> electronic<00:01:58.630> device

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
simply by adding this electronic device

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.130 
simply by adding this electronic device
to<00:01:59.439> your<00:01:59.679> car<00:02:00.179> let<00:02:01.179> me<00:02:01.270> demonstrate<00:02:01.450> it<00:02:02.020> with

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
to your car let me demonstrate it with

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:26.820 
to your car let me demonstrate it with
power<00:02:02.409> once<00:02:02.799> again

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.440 

okay<00:02:27.830> let<00:02:28.040> me<00:02:28.130> slow<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:28.459> up<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.849> little<00:02:29.000> bit<00:02:29.120> for

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
okay let me slow it up a little bit for

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:55.119 
okay let me slow it up a little bit for
you<00:02:29.569> I'm<00:02:30.050> gonna<00:02:30.230> slow<00:02:31.130> it<00:02:31.160> up<00:02:31.400> as<00:02:31.610> it's<00:02:31.849> running

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.470 

now<00:02:56.129> I'm<00:02:56.220> going<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.489> speed<00:02:56.790> it<00:02:56.819> up<00:02:57.030> for<00:02:57.269> you<00:02:57.420> a

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
now I'm going to speed it up for you a

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:30.450 
now I'm going to speed it up for you a
little<00:02:57.510> bit

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:43.400 

you

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:59.670 

you

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.070 

well<00:04:00.680> just<00:04:01.489> as<00:04:01.640> long<00:04:01.670> as<00:04:02.000> you<00:04:02.120> don't<00:04:02.330> go<00:04:02.510> faster

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
well just as long as you don't go faster

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.850 
well just as long as you don't go faster
than<00:04:03.260> 8,000<00:04:03.980> rpm<00:04:04.900> you'll<00:04:05.900> be<00:04:06.110> good<00:04:06.319> although

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
than 8,000 rpm you'll be good although

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.160 
than 8,000 rpm you'll be good although
the<00:04:07.010> spark<00:04:07.310> amplifier<00:04:07.910> is<00:04:08.030> good<00:04:08.270> up<00:04:08.390> to<00:04:08.569> 28

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
the spark amplifier is good up to 28

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.900 
the spark amplifier is good up to 28
thousand<00:04:09.890> rpm<00:04:11.470> let<00:04:12.470> me<00:04:12.620> uh<00:04:12.650> I<00:04:13.040> could<00:04:13.670> show<00:04:13.880> you

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
thousand rpm let me uh I could show you

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.770 
thousand rpm let me uh I could show you
that<00:04:14.209> but<00:04:14.480> oh<00:04:15.400> well<00:04:16.400> I<00:04:16.700> don't<00:04:17.180> think<00:04:17.389> any<00:04:17.510> car

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
that but oh well I don't think any car

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.900 
that but oh well I don't think any car
goes<00:04:17.959> that<00:04:18.169> fast<00:04:18.410> but<00:04:19.160> as<00:04:19.310> you<00:04:19.459> can<00:04:19.579> see<00:04:19.760> the

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
goes that fast but as you can see the

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.060 
goes that fast but as you can see the
device<00:04:20.239> works<00:04:20.510> and<00:04:20.989> we<00:04:21.139> can<00:04:21.350> change<00:04:21.560> the<00:04:21.829> power

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
device works and we can change the power

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.940 
device works and we can change the power
level<00:04:22.340> to<00:04:23.300> whatever<00:04:23.570> we'd<00:04:23.780> like<00:04:24.020> or<00:04:24.350> the<00:04:24.560> speed

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
level to whatever we'd like or the speed

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.970 
level to whatever we'd like or the speed
and<00:04:25.810> that's<00:04:26.810> our<00:04:26.960> demonstration<00:04:27.790> thank<00:04:28.790> you
