00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
I think yeast going to dissolve the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:07.359 
I think yeast going to dissolve the
yeast<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.609> you<00:01:02.210> just<00:01:03.210> takes<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.660> few<00:01:03.690> seconds

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.690 

this<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.869> normally<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:09.900> would<00:01:10.140> use<00:01:10.700> lukewarm

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
this is normally you would use lukewarm

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.460 
this is normally you would use lukewarm
water<00:01:11.880> but<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.689> just<00:01:12.900> cold<00:01:13.110> water<00:01:13.350> it

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
water but this is just cold water it

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.750 
water but this is just cold water it
doesn't<00:01:13.650> really<00:01:13.890> matter<00:01:14.100> because<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:14.549> going

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
doesn't really matter because it's going

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.429 
doesn't really matter because it's going
to<00:01:14.820> sit<00:01:15.000> on<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.210> counter<00:01:15.450> for<00:01:15.659> eight<00:01:16.380> to

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
you actually get a very decent result

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.110 
you actually get a very decent result
just<00:02:53.989> using<00:02:54.379> ordinary<00:02:55.000> all-purpose<00:02:56.000> flour

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
but it gets a little bit better if you

the dryer kayak social integration is

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.170 
the dryer kayak social integration is
important<00:03:26.239> so<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.420> trip<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:28.110> make<00:03:28.290> sure<00:03:28.439> this

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
important so the trip to make sure this

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.910 
important so the trip to make sure this
recipe<00:03:30.180> succeeds<00:03:30.689> that<00:03:30.870> you<00:03:31.379> have<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.769> make

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
recipe succeeds that you have to make

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.920 
recipe succeeds that you have to make
sure<00:03:32.129> that<00:03:32.370> it's<00:03:32.579> been<00:03:32.790> weeded<00:03:33.269> enough<00:03:33.629> and

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
sure that it's been weeded enough and

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.949 
sure that it's been weeded enough and
you<00:03:34.500> know<00:03:34.709> that<00:03:34.920> it's<00:03:35.069> enough<00:03:35.370> when<00:03:35.609> the<00:03:36.390> dough

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
you know that it's enough when the dough

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.699 
you know that it's enough when the dough
sort<00:03:37.349> of<00:03:37.409> fur<00:03:37.650> clinging<00:03:38.430> salute<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.450> hook

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
sort of fur clinging salute to the hook

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.490 
sort of fur clinging salute to the hook
and<00:03:40.709> you<00:03:41.099> sort<00:03:41.549> of<00:03:41.609> leave<00:03:41.879> the<00:03:42.359> sides<00:03:43.170> of<00:03:43.409> the

and you sort of leave the sides of the
bottle<00:03:44.810> it<00:03:45.810> can<00:03:46.019> be<00:03:46.109> very<00:03:46.260> tempting<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.829> put<00:03:47.040> in

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
bottle it can be very tempting to put in

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.009 
bottle it can be very tempting to put in
extra<00:03:47.340> flour<00:03:47.879> because<00:03:48.359> it<00:03:48.510> seems<00:03:48.810> very<00:03:49.430> moist

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
extra flour because it seems very moist

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.440 
extra flour because it seems very moist
avoid<00:03:52.019> the<00:03:52.170> temptation<00:03:52.379> because<00:03:53.239> once<00:03:54.239> the

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
will come together quite nicely okay

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.729 
will come together quite nicely okay
sometimes<00:04:08.579> this<00:04:08.819> takes<00:04:09.090> really<00:04:10.079> long<00:04:10.260> time

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
sometimes this takes really long time

sometimes this takes really long time
apparently<00:04:11.340> today<00:04:11.670> this<00:04:11.879> was<00:04:12.090> 20<00:04:12.599> minutes

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
apparently today this was 20 minutes

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.140 
apparently today this was 20 minutes
before<00:04:13.139> it<00:04:13.650> came<00:04:14.220> together<00:04:14.400> but<00:04:14.700> it<00:04:14.819> did<00:04:14.970> come

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
before it came together but it did come

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.170 
before it came together but it did come
together<00:04:15.329> and<00:04:15.689> as<00:04:16.380> you<00:04:16.530> can<00:04:16.709> see<00:04:16.859> it<00:04:17.009> just

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
together and as you can see it just

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.589 
together and as you can see it just
slapped<00:04:18.180> on<00:04:18.389> the<00:04:18.570> edges<00:04:19.229> of<00:04:19.259> the<00:04:19.530> bowl<00:04:20.599> now

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
slapped on the edges of the bowl now

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:22.779 
slapped on the edges of the bowl now
it's<00:04:21.810> over

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
it's over

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:27.920 
it's over
gooey<00:04:25.250> but<00:04:26.250> it<00:04:26.460> has<00:04:27.090> got<00:04:27.330> really<00:04:27.780> great

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
gooey but it has got really great

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.909 
gooey but it has got really great
elasticity<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:29.280> it<00:04:30.030> stretches<00:04:30.539> very<00:04:30.960> nice<00:04:31.710> so

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
elasticity and it stretches very nice so

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.820 
elasticity and it stretches very nice so
this<00:04:32.160> is<00:04:32.310> our<00:04:32.460> sheer<00:04:33.449> acid<00:04:33.720> or<00:04:33.870> off<00:04:34.080> to<00:04:34.470> ours

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
this is our sheer acid or off to ours

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.189 
this is our sheer acid or off to ours
and<00:04:35.010> as<00:04:35.940> you<00:04:36.060> can<00:04:36.180> see<00:04:36.330> it's<00:04:36.479> risen<00:04:36.750> quite<00:04:37.139> a

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
and as you can see it's risen quite a

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.180 
and as you can see it's risen quite a
bit<00:04:37.409> I'm<00:04:38.099> going<00:04:38.310> to<00:04:38.370> just<00:04:38.720> pull<00:04:39.720> this<00:04:39.900> out<00:04:40.190> pour

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
bit I'm going to just pull this out pour

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.640 
bit I'm going to just pull this out pour
it<00:04:41.400> out<00:04:41.580> onto<00:04:41.970> a<00:04:42.360> floured<00:04:42.979> table<00:04:45.530> careful<00:04:46.530> not

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
it out onto a floured table careful not

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.950 
it out onto a floured table careful not
to<00:04:46.919> to<00:04:48.530> squeeze<00:04:49.530> it<00:04:49.919> or<00:04:50.099> anything

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
to to squeeze it or anything

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.390 
to to squeeze it or anything
as<00:04:51.350> as<00:04:51.889> little<00:04:52.490> as<00:04:52.639> possible<00:04:53.919> in<00:04:54.919> order<00:04:55.070> to

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
as as little as possible in order to

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:09.219 
as as little as possible in order to
maintain<00:04:56.919> the<00:04:57.919> air<00:05:01.930> like<00:05:02.930> so<00:05:05.440> top<00:05:07.300> and<00:05:08.300> then

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
maintain the air like so top and then

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.279 
maintain the air like so top and then
you<00:05:09.380> just<00:05:09.710> use<00:05:10.520> a<00:05:10.550> metal<00:05:11.150> scraper<00:05:11.449> just<00:05:11.810> hack

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:12.289 
you just use a metal scraper just hack

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:14.740 
you just use a metal scraper just hack
it<00:05:12.440> into<00:05:12.770> whatever<00:05:13.370> size<00:05:13.610> you<00:05:14.000> want<00:05:14.030> today<00:05:14.509> we

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
it into whatever size you want today we

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:24.339 
it into whatever size you want today we
can<00:05:14.900> do<00:05:15.139> rolls<00:05:18.789> this<00:05:21.220> is<00:05:22.300> a<00:05:23.300> little<00:05:23.960> bit<00:05:24.050> tricky

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:24.349 
can do rolls this is a little bit tricky

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.610 
can do rolls this is a little bit tricky
very<00:05:25.090> doable<00:05:26.090> I'm<00:05:26.990> just<00:05:27.139> going<00:05:27.259> to<00:05:27.320> put<00:05:27.470> it<00:05:27.530> on

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
very doable I'm just going to put it on

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:41.360 
very doable I'm just going to put it on
a<00:05:27.680> breaking<00:05:28.070> plate<00:05:28.340> here<00:05:28.580> with<00:05:28.820> a<00:05:29.650> shaper<00:05:30.650> on

baking stone you can just put it in a
baking<00:05:52.710> plate<00:05:53.190> and<00:05:53.460> let<00:05:53.910> that<00:05:54.650> get<00:05:55.650> really

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
baking plate and let that get really

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:05.180 
baking plate and let that get really
really<00:05:56.760> warm<00:06:02.180> this

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
really warm this

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.040 

I'm<00:06:05.580> just<00:06:05.730> going<00:06:05.880> to<00:06:05.910> pull<00:06:06.180> the<00:06:06.390> baking<00:06:06.840> paper
