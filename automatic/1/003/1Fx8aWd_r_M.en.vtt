it already
I've<00:01:11.159> been<00:01:11.490> affected<00:01:11.939> from<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.479> my<00:01:12.659> family

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
I've been affected from it in my family

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.070 
I've been affected from it in my family
it<00:01:14.250> actually<00:01:14.460> runs<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:14.970> my<00:01:15.090> family<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.509> hope<00:01:15.900> I

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
it actually runs in my family I hope I

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.460 
it actually runs in my family I hope I
don't<00:01:16.140> get<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.920> hopefully<00:01:17.310> if<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.820> do<00:01:17.880> I

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
don't get it and hopefully if I do I

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.840 
don't get it and hopefully if I do I
find<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.560> early<00:01:19.890> due<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.369> screening

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
find it early due to the screening

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.730 
find it early due to the screening
because<00:01:21.299> if<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:21.600> caught<00:01:21.900> early<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.439> pretty

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
because if it's caught early it's pretty

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.679 
because if it's caught early it's pretty
treatable<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.909> make<00:01:24.119> sure<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.420> get<00:01:24.540> your
