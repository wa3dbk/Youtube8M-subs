00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.939
 publish in the system will you a 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.060
 update that comes with a single 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.310
 very assured mission is to improve the 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.099
 stability and overall speed of 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.080
 operating system wii console 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.460
 nintendo that yes you have to remember that 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.739
 after this update that 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.110
 we will see in April we will have another the 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.640
 next summer this same summer in the 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.460
 update this coming summer 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.040
 we will see new things new 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.230
 additional improvements to the wiiu but before 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.340
 everything we are going to focus on this video a 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.370
 recently released video 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.620
 recently a few hours own 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.239
 nintendo a video showing 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.129
 the difference that will be between the 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.829
 console with the update and the 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.379
 console with the current status voucher of the 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.020
 wii software let's say the system 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.420
 current operative we can compare that 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.270
 time it takes to leave a game 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.250
 the main menu WiiU eye because it is 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.140
 much less what we 're going to lose to 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.060
 from now on, a lot of attention to what 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.250
 we see in the video because it explains 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.590
 pretty good and is that if before this 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.380
 update the time it took was 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.600
 about 20 seconds to go out 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.580
 of a game and enter then with this new 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.430
 update the time is reduced 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.100
 remarkably the truth on this occasion 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.140
 we are before 8 seconds that will be the 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.810
 that we will have to wait at the time of 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.179
 leave a game and get back in 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.890
 the start menu of wiiu that the truth 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.860
 is that 20 seconds to me I was 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.690
 too eternal now with this 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.149
 video you have the proof that only 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.740
 we will have to wait 8 that yes before 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.460
 we will have to install that new 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.460
 upgrade
