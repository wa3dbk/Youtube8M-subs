00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.850
 last Sunday on France 5 I'm 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.610
 came across the shower gel shower skin 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.589
 sensitive abstain 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.780
 it was a report that showed that 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:18.080
 the cosmetics industry had 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.650
 replaced the parabens part of the methyl 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.170
 isautier audi nun or meti chloro 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.650
 Isautier pretty nuns conservatives 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.080
 before given twenty years ago because it 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.099
 was considered very allergic 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.099
 and irritating 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.460
 more scared by cynical unconsciousness 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.380
 cosmetic laboratories that 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.290
 design products without thinking about 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.640
 consequences on customers but what is 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:51.130
 what the methyl isautier pretty nun 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.040
 yet it is the dermatologists of the 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:57.160
 sfd the french dermatology society 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.480
 who launched the alert in December 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.030
 2013 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.020
 as they find is more and more 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.840
 of contact eczema generally due to 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:11.160
 the use of cosmetics 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.860
 causse holding this preservative the methyl 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.850
 isautier zhodino is a conservative 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.100
 who is licensed in cosmetics since 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.560
 1976 at very low rates and that is 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.490
 quoted in the afssaps reports in 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.640
 2010 as being one of the molecules the 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.740
 more allergenic afssaps 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.280
 so had recommended to avoid 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.810
 the use of this preservative and 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.660
 choose those who had the least 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.539
 side effects and everyone 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.539
 then rushed on the shares barely 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.729
 much less allergenic about 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.020
 three times a month but strongly 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.789
 suspected of being disruptive 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.340
 endocrine and yet why the 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.630
 cost products 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.829
 does he hold curators a 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.780
 conservative it's a biocidal molecule 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:09.330
 who kills bacteria from 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.430
 yeast mushrooms and others 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.590
 microorganisms that proliferate in 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.480
 cosmetics 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.819
 so cosmetics only who 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.500
 contain water because they find there 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:25.500
 an ideal environment to flourish 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.510
 this is obviously not ideal nor 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.030
 for the consumer or for the 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.970
 manufacturer as the conservatives are 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.870
 antibacterial killing molecules 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.579
 this generates side effects 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.799
 that is, side effects 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.500
 undesirable as for all 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.120
 pharmaceuticals 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.170
 but the conservatives are 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.079
 molecules essential to cosmetics 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.210
 that contain water is good 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.880
 obviously 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:00.330
 the consumer is in contact with 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.630
 allergenic molecules the more he feels 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.480
 little billy's and the more chances he has of 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.870
 develop an allergy that translates 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.300
 in this case by contact eczema 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.460
 it is therefore perfectly normal for 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.780
 contact eczemas be more and more 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:21.000
 many in the show of France 5 2 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.030
 last Sunday a beautician 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.120
 showed pictures of her eczema 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.060
 contact duo meti lizio holds in bed none 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.790
 of his face completely distorted by 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.160
 this pathology she explained her 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.520
 Calvary to find the products that 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.400
 did not contain any because all 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.700
 industrialists had gone to the 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.760
 paraben a dermatologist too was 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.450
 interviewed who was very virulent 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.710
 against the methyl isautier pretty nun 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.440
 until we show him a product 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.390
 two masterpieces that then count 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.340
 that she was working for them it was 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.850
 amazing 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:05.390
 but what does it put you 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.550
 your cosmetics it is clear that if you 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.680
 have allergic terrain you have to 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.200
 absolutely abandoned products that 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.510
 contain this molecule 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.690
 this concerns about 20% of you 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.989
 since the French population there is 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.610
 20% of people who is allergic 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.800
 but do you know that this conservative 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.480
 methyl isautier pretty nun is often 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.460
 associated with another methyl chloro 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:35.000
 isautier zullino and that this mixture is 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.950
 even more allergenic 20 years ago 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.990
 these products were rather used in 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.040
 products with reims and shampoos 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.270
 Shower gels 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:46.010
 so there was little time left on the skin 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.170
 then little by little they were 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:51.590
 incorporated into products without 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.590
 rinsing like creams or delays this 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.000
 which has increased their potential to 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.480
 awareness and what caused 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.740
 more and more eczema and yet I 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.510
 will surprise you 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.180
 parabens are the best 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.000
 conservative that combines efficiency and 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.670
 good tolerance 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.560
 Moreover, the European 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.880
 health at European level is working 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.790
 currently on their effects 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:21.860
 potential undesirables will we come back 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:23.840
 a paraben day may 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.060
 tic can not do without 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.039
 conservatives have you understood that 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.830
 formulas that contain water 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:33.289
 are nests with bacteria that the 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.740
 cosmetics manufacturers whose 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:39.860
 most products contain 70% 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.680
 of water what are doing that what makes that 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.439
 cosmetics are products to very 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.189
 strong profitability need these 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:50.389
 conservatives and those same industrialists 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:53.509
 whose products are almost 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:56.050
 ineffective make a living from 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:58.550
 huge advertising budgets of 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.469
 communication and so are going to be very 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.259
 sensitive to everything that will happen 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:06.650
 around the communication on one of 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:08.930
 their ingredients and so they go they 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:12.680
 have on reacted in a very deep way 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:17.289
 very important in communicating on the 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:20.779
 paraben free field without phenoxyethanol 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:24.919
 without triclosan and changing their 

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:28.219
 formulas to introduce molecules 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:30.949
 much worse and so the cosmetics are 

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:32.289
 become more and more harmful for 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:35.050
 the body 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:38.259
 Furthermore 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:41.020
 nothing apart from their harmful side for 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:43.840
 relation to their molecules imbalance 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.970
 the bacterial flora of your skin this 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.520
 who can also explain your 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:51.819
 many skin problems the more you 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.650
 live cream of serum background 

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:56.740
 more complexion you apply the product 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:07:01.500
 antibacterial and more skin flora 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.500
 your skin is unbalanced 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.020
 but the real questions do we have 

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:10.990
 really need all of his products 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:13.270
 sophisticated for cleaning the 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.250
 skin a good soap of Marseille or a 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.860
 soap his police cold or a 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:21.610
 Oleo limestone liniment or shower gel 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:24.069
 bio have an excellent cleaning power 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:27.009
 and do not contain preservatives 

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:31.659
 for the most part for the cleaning of 

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:34.750
 hair a good organic mild shampoo for 

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:36.870
 daily care of the face or 

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:40.719
 body of serums based on vegetable oil 

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:42.190
 therefore do not contain water 18 

00:07:40.719 --> 00:07:44.889
 the essential for those who have are 

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.719
 allergic can be a very good 

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:47.319
 alternative to all these products 

00:07:46.719 --> 00:07:51.099
 chemical 

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:53.580
 and if we made it simple 

00:07:51.099 --> 00:07:53.580
 what do you say
