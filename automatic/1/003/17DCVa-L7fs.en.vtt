00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
damaging power will start emitting from

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.200 
damaging power will start emitting from
it<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.350> doing<00:00:58.890> damage<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.309> nearby<00:00:59.550> enemies

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
the next one we have a slash grenade

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.759 
the next one we have a slash grenade
which<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.210> one<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.570> new<00:01:03.719> ones<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:04.650> a

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
which is one of the new ones it's a

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.270 
which is one of the new ones it's a
horizontal<00:01:05.460> wall<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.390> burning<00:01:06.960> void<00:01:07.560> light

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
horizontal wall of burning void light

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.130 
horizontal wall of burning void light
and<00:01:08.640> when<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:08.909> seen<00:01:09.210> this<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.479> action<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.960> just

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
and when I seen this in action it just

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.929 
and when I seen this in action it just
seems<00:01:10.320> like<00:01:10.439> he's<00:01:10.619> throwing<00:01:10.799> like<00:01:11.220> fire<00:01:11.580> and

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
seems like he's throwing like fire and

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.000 
seems like he's throwing like fire and
horizontal<00:01:12.600> line<00:01:12.810> maybe<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.439> can<00:01:13.590> use<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.799> to

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
horizontal line maybe you can use it to

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.800 
horizontal line maybe you can use it to
block<00:01:14.250> off<00:01:14.460> areas<00:01:14.970> or<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.390> throw<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.689> at

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
block off areas or just throw it at

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.469 
block off areas or just throw it at
enemies<00:01:16.049> feet<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.710> burn<00:01:17.130> them<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:18.180> next

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
enemies feet and burn them the next

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.480 
enemies feet and burn them the next
thing<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:18.780> have<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.110> line<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.860> jumps<00:01:20.280> and

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
thing we have in line is the jumps and

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.670 
thing we have in line is the jumps and
they<00:01:20.909> all<00:01:21.090> seem<00:01:21.390> very<00:01:21.689> similar<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.380> what<00:01:22.560> we

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
they all seem very similar to what we

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.890 
they all seem very similar to what we
already<00:01:22.710> have<00:01:23.040> except<00:01:23.909> for<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.240> third<00:01:24.540> perk

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
already have except for the third perk

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.170 
already have except for the third perk
which<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.799> not<00:01:26.040> there<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:26.970> bunch

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
which is not there and just have a bunch

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.490 
which is not there and just have a bunch
of<00:01:27.360> question<00:01:27.659> marks<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:28.110> don't<00:01:28.229> know<00:01:28.290> if<00:01:28.350> it's

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
of question marks I don't know if it's

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.230 
of question marks I don't know if it's
because<00:01:28.619> it's<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.009> newport<00:01:29.490> or<00:01:29.759> it's<00:01:29.939> just<00:01:30.030> the
