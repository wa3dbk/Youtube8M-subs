twitching is like a baby behavior but I
don't<00:01:16.200> know<00:01:16.290> maybe<00:01:16.619> your<00:01:16.860> bird<00:01:17.130> got<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.119> hit<00:01:18.270> in

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
don't know maybe your bird got to hit in

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.600 
don't know maybe your bird got to hit in
the<00:01:18.479> wing<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.840> like<00:01:18.990> moves<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.680> funny<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.009> that

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
the wing and like moves it funny so that

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.280 
the wing and like moves it funny so that
could<00:01:20.820> be<00:01:20.909> completely<00:01:21.240> different<00:01:21.570> according

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
could be completely different according

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.260 
could be completely different according
to<00:01:22.380> your<00:01:22.500> bird<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:22.979> that's<00:01:23.759> why<00:01:23.880> we<00:01:24.000> don't<00:01:24.090> have

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
to your bird so that's why we don't have

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.990 
to your bird so that's why we don't have
a<00:01:24.299> body<00:01:24.540> language<00:01:24.720> sheet<00:01:25.409> for<00:01:26.369> general<00:01:26.729> stuff

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
when the feathers streamline which

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.290 
when the feathers streamline which
you're<00:02:18.250> not<00:02:18.340> going<00:02:18.489> to<00:02:18.580> do<00:02:18.700> for<00:02:18.970> me

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
you're not going to do for me

when<00:02:19.690> they<00:02:19.780> all<00:02:19.900> go<00:02:20.080> flat<00:02:20.380> that<00:02:20.650> usually<00:02:20.980> means

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
when they all go flat that usually means

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.790 
when they all go flat that usually means
like<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.400> bird's<00:02:21.670> really<00:02:22.000> alert<00:02:22.650> can't<00:02:23.650> even

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
like a bird's really alert can't even

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.790 
like a bird's really alert can't even
keep<00:02:23.920> his<00:02:24.130> down<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:25.959> I<00:02:26.170> don't<00:02:26.230> know<00:02:26.500> how<00:02:26.650> it

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
keep his down and I don't know how it

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.020 
keep his down and I don't know how it
really<00:02:26.910> good<00:02:27.910> ah<00:02:28.349> oh<00:02:29.349> man<00:02:30.160> ok<00:02:30.580> well<00:02:30.790> they<00:02:30.910> were

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
really good ah oh man ok well they were

streamline<00:02:31.480> for<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:31.690> second<00:02:31.959> because<00:02:32.019> my<00:02:32.230> box

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
streamline for a second because my box

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.890 
streamline for a second because my box
holding<00:02:33.099> my<00:02:33.190> camera<00:02:33.250> fell<00:02:33.670> over<00:02:33.940> but<00:02:34.120> yeah

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
holding my camera fell over but yeah

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.300 
holding my camera fell over but yeah
it's<00:02:35.050> probably<00:02:35.140> almost<00:02:35.410> it<00:02:35.709> anyway<00:02:36.010> it<00:02:36.130> keeps

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
it's probably almost it anyway it keeps

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.930 
it's probably almost it anyway it keeps
dying<00:02:36.459> so<00:02:36.760> I<00:02:36.790> get<00:02:37.060> it<00:02:37.150> go<00:02:37.209> hope<00:02:37.450> this<00:02:37.660> helps
