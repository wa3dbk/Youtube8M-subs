00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 or the one that moves the most how to set 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.799
 Welcome back to our channel in 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 that fourth violence of how to make a 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.179
 hard reset or take our phone to 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.679
 factory point in the event that the 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.660
 phone is not learning and not 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.269
 have our full operation 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.190
 how is this or in the case of being 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.340
 forgot the password or the 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.779
 password lock pattern or the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.320
 phone I know that circling in the 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.820
 samsung symbol then in that case 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.769
 that phone is already turned off they should not 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.380
 turn it off or if you are not entering them 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.420
 they turn it off and we hope that the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.800
 phone is completely off and 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.190
 We will use the following 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.110
 key combinations remember that if 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.610
 they do not know how to do this correctly they can 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.219
 lock your phone and leave it 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.950
 unusable then what they do is 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.820
 use the three power keys or 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.430
 home and one volume up leave 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.590
 first of pressing the volume towards 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.960
 up the home and press the button 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:04.129
 turned on the phone immediately 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.129
 vibrate release the power key this 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.910
 and here is the doll that 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.390
 says that it allows us to enter the new 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.950
 configuration here there are several options 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.600
 there are two that are very important 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.180
 first that allows me to reset the 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.800
 phone and the one that interests us is this 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.740
 What are you saying here 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.210
 what is cool datafactory I know it's the 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.010
 state where we should enter if 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.620
 we want to get our phone to 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.050
 factory point to enter it 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.180
 we enter with the power button and 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.990
 to scroll through the menu like this 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.060
 do not 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.220
 we do it with the volume key towards 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.590
 up and volume down to go down 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.310
 we enter the one that interests us that dubai 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.130
 factory ruiz set we have turned it on 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.970
 and then we went down completely with the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.829
 volume to which it says yes remember that if 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.810
 they do this procedure they are going to lose 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.579
 all the information information 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.869
 that are on the phone and that your 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.179
 phone must be completely 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.280
 loaded or if the procedure is not 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.190
 can be halfway and lose 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.050
 your phone removed the information that the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.330
 then here being in 10 we have 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.430
 on again I will not do it since 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.130
 that phone is completely new and 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.870
 it's unnecessary you give it on and 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.489

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.830

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.470
 procedure that he is going to be after 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.320
 that will take us to the previous 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.330
 and we give it reboot system now after 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.030
