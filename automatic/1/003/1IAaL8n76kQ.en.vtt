00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459

actually<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:59.160> reason<00:02:59.370> is<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.030> dashboard<00:03:00.750> is

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
actually the reason is the dashboard is

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.690 
actually the reason is the dashboard is
because<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.680> airflow<00:03:02.130> is<00:03:02.310> over<00:03:02.579> your

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
because the airflow is over your

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.180 
because the airflow is over your
dashboard<00:03:03.329> and<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.349> bacteria<00:03:04.560> tend<00:03:05.040> to

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
dashboard and so the bacteria tend to

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.039 
dashboard and so the bacteria tend to
build<00:03:05.340> up<00:03:05.489> on<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:05.730> surface<00:03:06.150> we<00:03:06.690> headed<00:03:07.019> back

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
build up on that surface we headed back
