 lined up on my channel and can 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.300
 talking about this piece is simple 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.369
 for hours and I want to reread it again 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.949

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.740

 an epic story such a note about 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.650
 doctors like for example in a magazine around 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.380

 sad but quite life story

 someone will find here evil rock and someone 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.220
 pure coincidence far-fetched 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.769
 to each his own what is definitely not so 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.590
 it's fast you action and speed 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.930
 narrative and sharp turns and already 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.050
 surely there is no summer by the end of winter 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.459
 who have for example in 13 fairy tales this 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.640
 plant book 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.370
 its torrential rains gusting wind 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.380
 no all-embracing sadness yet here 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.560
 you can find life itself 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.140
 marvel at the defeat and success of the main 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.230
 hero envy him with happiness and 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.110
 empathize with the blackest moments of life 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.890
 hero and there is still a rainbow rainbow 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.019
 colors from the brightest to the darkest and 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.750
 this rainbow is unfortunately not limited to 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.660
 to dark purple rather she 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.170
 soaks up yes all the colors in order to 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.810
 become 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.299
 perfect black and it turns out 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.660
 story after someone after the black band 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:21.299
 whites goes someone confuses white color 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.450
 gray then everything but there is still ahead 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:27.160
 white and someone ends his life 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.720
 only black 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.330
 I was struck to the depths of the story 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.240
 the life of gulllemo bellman and it seems to me that 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.800
 in fact, the main idea of ​​the author 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.130
 was precisely to 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.980
 from beginning to end reveal whole life 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.020
 all color spectra show that she 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.670
 maybe bright fun interesting this 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.220
 counted can be grim and 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.640
 sad means it can be very 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.770
 fast and can flow terribly slowly but 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.910
 at some point I was struck by the choice 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.400
 we were gullemo 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.410
 what was this choice worth learning from 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.080
 books because billy sessions himself what 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.140
