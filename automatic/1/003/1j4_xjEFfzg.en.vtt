00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.860
 before entering school two lines 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.490
 are passed by a moment moment to the 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.500
 knowledge of reading and writing 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.850
 observing from social contexts through 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.740
 ads in the 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.740
 restaurants and shopping centers 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.890
 others and there is one without knowing how to read and write 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.199
 conventionally by anita inferences 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.769
 it what we can say is that a certain 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.769
 to provide 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.059
 ecosystems after the adoption of 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.160
 conventional writer system 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.379
 first step we are looking for 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.739
 criteria to differentiate from the world 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:55.159
 graphic between donkey and writing for 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.260
 with us in the first feature is 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.140
 that writing is done with forms 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.949
 arbitrary graphic that both new 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:07.520
 shape of the objects and round off the 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:10.420
 ordering line may show traces 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.830
 mias the philosophical aspect conference 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.830
 cosme in continuous traits 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:24.450
 The second step is to identify two 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.180
 basic inspectors 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.460
 the first is that knowing that it was the number 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.190
 minimum number of letters to write a 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.860
 word and the second goal that is 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.310
 an assessment of letters to 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.650
 to be able to write a word she advanced 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.440
 these elements mark transit in the 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.600
 second stage the honor should be mentioned that 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.330
 not necessarily yet on the agreement 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.760
 with the government the elements that those 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.760
 lines per action independently 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.979
 this step is to establish relations between 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.970
 sound aspects graphical aspects 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:10.140
 in business moving up for three 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:13.590
 enlightened moments and pop in the syllabic 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.890
 Alphabetic spelling and harvesting hypotheses 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.560
 is essentially a letter 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.410
 shows a washing of the word 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.019
 writing and lack of signal and caused 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.200
 benfica represented a moment of 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:31.319
 transition and floats between the 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.160
 a letter for each queue or for each 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.040
 disappeared 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.489
 is this type of writing in the queues and 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.700
 represent column or multiple letters 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:43.860
 indifferently hypothesis 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.799
 each letter represents a smile 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:51.769
 that the writing be realistic and 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.769
 so as not to be cane to conventional 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.799
 importance similar to those after 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.250
 described in China in a direct relationship 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:06.680
 with traffic since the traffic there 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.049
 themselves depend on contact that has 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.510
 context and following to learn the 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.420
 write is an individual process was 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.659
 does not resort to the appropriation of a 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:22.150
 new that all social construction in lorca 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:22.150
 your crisis before is the net insulate
