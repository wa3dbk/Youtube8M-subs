00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
them to goes a long way the reason we're

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.980 
them to goes a long way the reason we're
using<00:01:59.780> three<00:02:00.260> is<00:02:00.530> so<00:02:00.860> that<00:02:01.040> they<00:02:01.220> will<00:02:01.370> cover

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
using three is so that they will cover

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.800 
using three is so that they will cover
it<00:02:02.990> will<00:02:03.110> cover<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.530> whole<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:05.270> whole<00:02:05.300> front

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
big enough so we're gonna lay it let lay

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.460 
big enough so we're gonna lay it let lay
it<00:02:13.190> out<00:02:13.280> like<00:02:13.340> this<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:13.940> this<00:02:14.840> is<00:02:14.900> going<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.350> be

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.360 

and<00:02:35.250> just<00:02:35.459> lay<00:02:35.760> down<00:02:35.790> some<00:02:36.239> glue<00:02:36.569> again<00:02:37.370> you

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
and just lay down some glue again you

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.740 
and just lay down some glue again you
can<00:02:38.489> also<00:02:38.640> just<00:02:38.879> lay<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.209> right<00:02:39.239> down<00:02:39.390> on<00:02:39.599> the

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
can also just lay it right down on the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.860 
can also just lay it right down on the
paper<00:02:40.640> however<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:42.239> don't<00:02:42.390> want<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.659> burn

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
paper however you don't want to burn

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.470 
paper however you don't want to burn
yourself<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:45.620> this<00:02:46.620> one<00:02:46.890> we<00:02:47.069> want<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.430> go<00:02:47.609> all

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
yourself and this one we want to go all

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.339 
yourself and this one we want to go all
the<00:02:48.900> way<00:02:48.930> up<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.620> top<00:02:49.859> and<00:02:50.480> in<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:52.170> that

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
the way up to the top and in to that

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:59.850 
the way up to the top and in to that
edge

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.420 

okay<00:03:00.490> and<00:03:00.670> now<00:03:00.790> we<00:03:00.850> got<00:03:01.060> that<00:03:01.210> down<00:03:01.950> so<00:03:02.950> we're

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
okay and now we got that down so we're

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.310 
okay and now we got that down so we're
gonna<00:03:03.580> lay<00:03:03.760> down<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:04.030> next<00:03:04.270> layer<00:03:04.450> I<00:03:04.780> think

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
gonna lay down the next layer I think

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.350 
gonna lay down the next layer I think
I'm<00:03:05.410> gonna<00:03:05.530> go<00:03:06.250> write<00:03:06.490> on<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.760> paper<00:03:06.940> for<00:03:07.090> this

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
I'm gonna go write on the paper for this

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.720 
I'm gonna go write on the paper for this
glue<00:03:08.290> right<00:03:08.470> on<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.710> paper

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.060 

all<00:03:12.730> right<00:03:12.880> so<00:03:13.150> lay<00:03:13.390> all<00:03:13.840> around<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.890> outer

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
all right so lay all around the outer

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:21.590 
all right so lay all around the outer
edges<00:03:15.400> of<00:03:15.580> your<00:03:15.700> paper<00:03:16.030> you're<00:03:16.690> glue<00:03:16.870> down<00:03:17.020> ah

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.850 

but<00:03:22.600> not<00:03:22.720> all<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.080> way<00:03:23.170> out<00:03:23.290> to<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.590> side

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
but not all the way out to the side

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.290 
but not all the way out to the side
because<00:03:24.420> it's<00:03:25.420> gonna<00:03:25.540> fall<00:03:25.870> off<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.110> side

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
because it's gonna fall off the side

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.920 
because it's gonna fall off the side
that's<00:03:28.300> okay

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
that's okay

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:36.090 
that's okay
all<00:03:29.590> right<00:03:33.090> there's<00:03:34.090> that<00:03:34.300> and<00:03:35.170> now<00:03:35.500> our<00:03:35.860> last

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
all right there's that and now our last

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.880 
all right there's that and now our last
piece

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.940 

and<00:03:43.280> I'm<00:03:43.610> gonna<00:03:43.790> glue<00:03:44.630> around<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:45.080> edges<00:03:45.680> of

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
and I'm gonna glue around the edges of

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.670 
and I'm gonna glue around the edges of
the<00:03:46.190> binder<00:03:46.580> itself<00:03:46.970> for<00:03:47.420> this<00:03:47.540> so<00:03:48.170> this<00:03:48.500> one

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
the binder itself for this so this one

00:03:48.680 --> 00:04:04.000 
the binder itself for this so this one
stays<00:03:48.950> in<00:03:48.980> place

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.330 

and<00:04:04.160> you<00:04:04.940> get<00:04:05.090> a<00:04:05.120> little<00:04:05.330> bit<00:04:05.540> of<00:04:05.629> leeway<00:04:05.810> with

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
and you get a little bit of leeway with

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.550 
and you get a little bit of leeway with
moving<00:04:07.340> it<00:04:07.459> around<00:04:08.019> moving<00:04:09.019> the<00:04:09.110> paper<00:04:09.290> around

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
moving it around moving the paper around

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.470 
moving it around moving the paper around
after<00:04:10.010> you<00:04:10.069> put<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.310> glue<00:04:10.550> down<00:04:10.580> but<00:04:11.090> you<00:04:11.209> kind

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
after you put the glue down but you kind

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.160 
after you put the glue down but you kind
of<00:04:11.540> got<00:04:11.660> to<00:04:11.720> move<00:04:11.930> fast<00:04:13.420> okay<00:04:14.420> so<00:04:14.810> there's<00:04:14.989> the

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
of got to move fast okay so there's the

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.590 
of got to move fast okay so there's the
front<00:04:15.379> and<00:04:15.709> now<00:04:15.890> we're<00:04:16.040> gonna<00:04:16.160> do<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:16.489> back<00:04:16.669> so

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
front and now we're gonna do the back so

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.580 
front and now we're gonna do the back so
that<00:04:17.750> it<00:04:17.840> matches<00:04:18.310> with<00:04:19.310> our<00:04:19.549> other<00:04:19.760> paper<00:04:20.590> so

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
that it matches with our other paper so

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.240 
that it matches with our other paper so
you<00:04:21.950> just<00:04:22.190> lay<00:04:22.370> it<00:04:22.490> out<00:04:22.550> like<00:04:22.610> this<00:04:22.940> you<00:04:24.250> know

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
you just lay it out like this you know

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.370 
you just lay it out like this you know
the<00:04:25.460> same<00:04:25.669> sort<00:04:25.970> of<00:04:26.060> configuration<00:04:26.360> and<00:04:28.090> then

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
the same sort of configuration and then

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:36.340 
the same sort of configuration and then
glue<00:04:30.380> it<00:04:30.410> down<00:04:34.419> but<00:04:35.419> you<00:04:35.450> want<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:35.870> lines<00:04:36.139> to

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
glue it down but you want the lines to

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.530 
glue it down but you want the lines to
match<00:04:36.680> up<00:04:37.010> or<00:04:37.580> maybe<00:04:37.729> you<00:04:37.880> don't<00:04:38.030> maybe<00:04:38.389> you

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
match up or maybe you don't maybe you

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.290 
match up or maybe you don't maybe you
want<00:04:38.660> to<00:04:38.690> go<00:04:38.810> the<00:04:38.930> opposite<00:04:39.350> on<00:04:39.530> it<00:04:40.300> whatever

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
want to go the opposite on it whatever

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.340 
want to go the opposite on it whatever
you<00:04:41.540> want<00:04:41.660> to<00:04:41.810> do<00:04:41.930> is<00:04:42.320> fine<00:04:43.030> and<00:04:44.139> then<00:04:45.139> what

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
you want to do is fine and then what

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.010 
you want to do is fine and then what
we're<00:04:45.470> gonna<00:04:45.560> do<00:04:45.860> after<00:04:46.700> you've<00:04:47.600> done<00:04:47.840> that

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
we're gonna do after you've done that

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:55.469 
we're gonna do after you've done that
backside<00:04:48.530> is<00:04:49.570> take<00:04:50.830> your<00:04:51.830> scissors<00:04:52.310> and<00:04:54.220> trim

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
backside is take your scissors and trim

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:03.680 
backside is take your scissors and trim
off<00:04:56.889> the<00:04:57.889> edges

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.560 

might<00:05:04.230> be<00:05:04.350> easier<00:05:04.740> to<00:05:04.800> do<00:05:05.150> looking<00:05:06.150> at<00:05:06.300> it<00:05:06.420> like

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
might be easier to do looking at it like

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.900 
might be easier to do looking at it like
this<00:05:08.510> and<00:05:09.950> if<00:05:10.950> you<00:05:11.070> want<00:05:11.340> to<00:05:11.550> you<00:05:11.730> can<00:05:11.880> go

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
this and if you want to you can go

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.880 
this and if you want to you can go
further<00:05:13.850> with<00:05:14.850> designing<00:05:15.450> this<00:05:15.570> and<00:05:15.840> you<00:05:16.650> can

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
further with designing this and you can

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:22.760 
further with designing this and you can
do<00:05:17.100> things<00:05:17.340> like<00:05:20.840> use<00:05:21.840> ribbon<00:05:22.320> around<00:05:22.680> the

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
do things like use ribbon around the

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.480 
do things like use ribbon around the
outside<00:05:23.250> to<00:05:23.280> clean<00:05:23.970> up<00:05:24.120> your<00:05:24.300> edges<00:05:24.680> or<00:05:25.680> you

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
outside to clean up your edges or you

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.820 
outside to clean up your edges or you
can<00:05:26.760> you<00:05:27.180> know<00:05:27.210> attach<00:05:27.750> other<00:05:27.960> things<00:05:28.350> to<00:05:28.680> it

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
can you know attach other things to it

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.940 
can you know attach other things to it
you<00:05:29.640> can<00:05:29.910> write<00:05:30.840> on<00:05:31.020> here<00:05:31.380> that's<00:05:31.620> what<00:05:31.830> that

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
you can write on here that's what that

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.650 
you can write on here that's what that
was<00:05:32.040> for<00:05:32.220> you<00:05:32.400> can<00:05:32.550> like<00:05:32.820> ribbon<00:05:33.240> this<00:05:33.420> off

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
was for you can like ribbon this off

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.420 
was for you can like ribbon this off
ribbon<00:05:34.200> around<00:05:34.290> the<00:05:34.530> edges<00:05:34.860> or<00:05:34.980> you<00:05:35.160> can<00:05:35.310> just

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
ribbon around the edges or you can just

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.070 
ribbon around the edges or you can just
leave<00:05:35.580> it<00:05:35.610> as<00:05:35.820> is

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
leave it as is
