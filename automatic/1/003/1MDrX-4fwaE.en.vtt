that at the beginning once it's diverse
it<00:01:09.710> just<00:01:10.010> simplifies<00:01:10.250> out<00:01:10.670> so<00:01:10.940> it<00:01:11.420> goes

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.600 

so<00:01:22.100> here<00:01:22.310> it<00:01:22.369> goes<00:01:22.430> from<00:01:22.790> there

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:38.109 

what<00:01:26.210> to<00:01:26.330> this<00:01:26.479> once<00:01:26.720> keeps<00:01:27.020> that<00:01:37.119> it's

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
what to this once keeps that it's

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.330 
what to this once keeps that it's
another<00:01:38.360> thing<00:01:38.540> that<00:01:38.630> suits<00:01:38.810> them<00:01:39.050> so<00:01:39.680> it's

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
another thing that suits them so it's

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.130 
another thing that suits them so it's
just<00:01:40.369> like<00:01:40.580> a<00:01:40.640> simplified<00:01:41.119> out<00:01:41.270> version<00:01:41.720> so

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140
