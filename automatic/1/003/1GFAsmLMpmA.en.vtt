00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.359
 hey people welcome you on one 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.550
 channel goes to another video today 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.700
 It's about eight tips for your topic 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.950
 sony alpha 6000 the sony alpha 6000 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.139
 his system camera with an aps c 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.760
 Sensor also offers a good price 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.820
 Performance ratio with the kit 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.850
 objectively 16 to 50 millimeters is the 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.010
 camera already about 650 euros too 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.869
 have and of course it is an announcement 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.740
 for that really mirror reflex 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.710
 quality in jacket pockets format gets 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.989
 and eight tips like him even more 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.550
 to get out of this camera comes go 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.040
 we'll get you now and we'll start now 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.040
 Immediately with the first tip a lot of fun 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.200
 Tip 1 So the Sony Alpha 6000 has 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.320
 very many only strengthen very little 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.539
 weaknesses so far is the battery 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.399
 performance he is not quite as strong 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.350
 as always, the battery power but 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.329
 can improve and is with the flight 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.699
 Mode and although the camera has yes 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.890
 over wlan and nfc to the wireless 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.510
 data transmission or also 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.100
 for remote control of the camera 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.540
 Of course, that's one too 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.460
 amount of electricity when you're out and about 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.500
 that does not need one should the camera 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.210
 in the flight mode are so similar 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.240
 like the smartphone are all 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.590
 prevented data connections and thus 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.020
 of course you can spend a lot 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.340
 less power always in the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.380
 he will then come photos 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.650
 displayed similar to the smartphone 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.329
 just by this airplane here so 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.750
 really a great thing about power too 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.750
 save up 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.890
 the two optical image stabilizer so 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.450
 the lens kit 650 mm he has over 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.890
 an optical image stabilizer 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.570
 actually a good thing 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.090
 Here is described whether the clubs 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.100
 steadyshot so image stabilizer great 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.869
 the only problem is that you have this 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.140
 image stabilizer not directly on 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.299
 activate objectively or 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.619
 So you can disable it now 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.329
 here no button without image stabilizer 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.430
 off, there are also situations 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.329
 where to turn it off as to 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.750
 Example of long-term exposures 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.690
 night shots etc 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.270
 as soon as the camera is on a tripod 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.670
 should stand an image stabilizer 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.070
 off so that one optical 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.200
 image stabilizer but still very much 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.960
 can quickly activate and deactivate 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.850
 you should get this function on one 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.090
 the multifunction buttons set that 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.880
 works very fast on the menu 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.100
 Settings must look for yourself quickly 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.140
 believes that it is exactly on point 6 here 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.730
 the user settings and here 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.250
 can we really do that we have some 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.560
 freely configurable buttons and I have 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.330
 for example , the key al 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.130
 the schott as you can see here 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.730
 can because if you look now in 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.440
 photo mode I know the old button there 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.330
 I have here the selection of the optical 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.110
 Image Stabilizer to activate and to 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.820
 deactivate 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.290
 so I can do it very fast 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.360
 and if I do one 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.490
 long exposure then do it all 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.720
 quickly disable and then just 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.720
 activate again very quickly 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.250
 the three camera individualize that 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.050
 as it has now addressed 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.490
 The camera offers a lot 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.930
 multifunction ties which we freely 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.790
 configure or 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.380
 can individualize here for 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.600
 example here in front of the trigger 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.750
 the keys c1 and we have here back 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.520
 just the key al we too 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.709
 we can have a seat down here 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.410
 show key that we can occupy freely 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.390
 and we also have the functions here 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.370
 menu where we can adjust what 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.990
 he should be on everything and in this 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.850
 attitude where we were in the moment 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.800
 pea user setting like here 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.650
 we just have them right now 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.690
 buttons de l button 1 button 2 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.750
 and the function key and we can 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.720
 this individually with all 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.910
 possible functions prove that 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.290
 for example, the fair that needs to be 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.480
 can change quickly at the 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.270
 Exposure iso-value directional correction 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.370
 which focus field hdr mode creative 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.740
 image effects et cetera really one 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.320
 great thing so you can the camera 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:05.870
 to adjust to his ideas and 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.030
 for his sake next to align and 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:13.550
 the practical application is then 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:15.650
 really well prepared next day 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.299
 also a tip to save electricity 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.100
 and we have one too 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.940
 electronic viewfinder the very good 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.660
 services as an alternative 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.760
 to the 3 inch lcd monitor just as well 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.610
 foldable and swiveling is so 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.040
 or up and down 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.050
 From rattle, this monitor is really a 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.450
 great thing high resolution offer a 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.580
 good picture control but that pulls 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.560
 Of course, a lot of electricity and the 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.170
 search is really a full-fledged one 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.970
 Replacement for this monitor and if you can 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:48.000
 is on the way and you still want to 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.070
 more pictures but make the battery diako 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.380
 Charge indicator moves down 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.440
 then we can just about that 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.630
 menu winter monitor only the viewfinder 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.070
 choose so and now the black will 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:03.150
 and now only the search is active 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.860
 and with them we can exactly 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.270
 work so well on the viewfinder image 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.480
 this can be seen on the video now 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.740
 not so good we can also get the menu 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.170
 Show all important settings 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:16.410
 Selected aperture iso exposure time 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.700
 we are shown in the picture and 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.620
 thus the seeker is this 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.290
 electronic high-resolution super 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.250
 really a full replacement for the lcd 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.250
 monitor the camera 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.180
 okay people so that was the first
