00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.789 
changing it because they're saying it's
not<00:01:35.640> working<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.020> think<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.409> bigger<00:01:37.680> issue

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
not working and I think the bigger issue

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.980 
not working and I think the bigger issue
here<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.490> not<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:38.850> much<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.270> there's<00:01:39.479> there

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
here is not so much that there's there

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.929 
here is not so much that there's there
are<00:01:40.079> these<00:01:40.170> rules<00:01:40.439> for<00:01:40.680> equal<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.610> know<00:01:41.640> equal

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
are these rules for equal you know equal

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.490 
are these rules for equal you know equal
amount<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.509> weight<00:01:42.720> being<00:01:42.930> taken<00:01:43.200> up<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.439> you

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
amount of weight being taken up and you

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.690 
amount of weight being taken up and you
go<00:01:43.619> amount<00:01:43.829> being<00:01:44.130> down<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.520> now<00:01:44.579> they're

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
go amount being down and now they're

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.429 
go amount being down and now they're
changing<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.360> bring<00:01:45.899> down<00:01:46.049> some<00:01:46.259> more

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
changing it to bring down some more

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.749 
changing it to bring down some more
trash<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.770> think<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.040> bigger<00:01:47.220> issue<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
trash I think the bigger issue is the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.880 
trash I think the bigger issue is the
lack<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.149> enforcement<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.200> my<00:01:49.350> question<00:01:49.740> here

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
lack of enforcement so my question here

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.350 
lack of enforcement so my question here
is<00:01:50.009> okay<00:01:50.280> you're<00:01:50.610> saying<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:50.970> people<00:01:51.030> have

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
is okay you're saying that people have

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.210 
is okay you're saying that people have
to<00:01:51.479> bring<00:01:51.750> down<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:52.110> know<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.229> kilo<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.920> nearly

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
to bring down you know a kilo is nearly

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.310 
to bring down you know a kilo is nearly
18<00:01:53.579> pounds<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:53.970> they<00:01:54.090> come<00:01:54.270> on<00:01:54.390> down<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:55.200> is

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
18 pounds and they come on down but is

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.899 
18 pounds and they come on down but is
are<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.619> really<00:01:55.799> gonna<00:01:55.979> enforce<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.549> now<00:01:56.850> the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
are you really gonna enforce it now the

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.399 
are you really gonna enforce it now the
Ministry<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.600> saying<00:01:57.840> yes<00:01:58.049> we<00:01:58.290> absolutely

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
Ministry is saying yes we absolutely

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.789 
Ministry is saying yes we absolutely
will<00:01:59.040> unlike<00:01:59.880> unlike<00:02:00.750> with<00:02:01.229> our<00:02:01.350> previous

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
will unlike unlike with our previous

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.530 
will unlike unlike with our previous
rules<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.280> regulations<00:02:02.820> if<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.030> don't<00:02:03.299> bring

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
rules and regulations if you don't bring

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.690 
rules and regulations if you don't bring
down<00:02:03.719> these<00:02:04.380> additional<00:02:04.799> pounds<00:02:05.219> then<00:02:05.549> you

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
down these additional pounds then you

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.950 
down these additional pounds then you
will<00:02:05.850> be<00:02:05.969> fine<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.479> potentially

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
will be fine and potentially

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.080 
will be fine and potentially
criminalized<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:08.220> we'll<00:02:08.580> have<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.819> wait<00:02:08.970> and

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
criminalized so we'll have to wait and

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.790 
criminalized so we'll have to wait and
see<00:02:09.149> how<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.479> happens<00:02:09.780> but<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:09.959> think<00:02:10.200> I'm<00:02:10.379> on

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
see how that happens but I think I'm on

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.440 
see how that happens but I think I'm on
you<00:02:11.430> know<00:02:11.550> on<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.760> positive<00:02:12.120> side<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.300> this

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
you know on the positive side of this

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.830 
you know on the positive side of this
it's<00:02:12.660> a

it's a

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.729 
it's a
think<00:02:12.959> it's<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.140> great<00:02:13.319> thing<00:02:13.440> that<00:02:13.620> we're

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
think it's a great thing that we're

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.339 
think it's a great thing that we're
raising<00:02:14.129> awareness<00:02:14.430> about<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.840> environment

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
raising awareness about the environment

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.920 
raising awareness about the environment
and<00:02:16.470> how<00:02:16.620> poorly<00:02:17.190> our<00:02:17.700> natural<00:02:18.569> resources

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
and how poorly our natural resources

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.360 
and how poorly our natural resources
have<00:02:19.080> been<00:02:19.230> treated<00:02:19.590> in<00:02:19.680> this<00:02:19.800> case<00:02:20.069> Mount
