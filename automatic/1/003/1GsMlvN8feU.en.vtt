okay<00:00:30.679> so<00:00:31.130> phosphatases<00:00:31.880> come<00:00:32.390> effectively<00:00:32.930> in

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
okay so phosphatases come effectively in

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.560 
okay so phosphatases come effectively in
two<00:00:33.290> families<00:00:33.860> there<00:00:34.399> are<00:00:34.520> acid<00:00:34.910> phosphatases

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
two families there are acid phosphatases

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.410 
two families there are acid phosphatases
which<00:00:36.079> have<00:00:36.410> pH<00:00:36.800> Optima<00:00:37.370> somewhere<00:00:37.730> around<00:00:37.850> pH

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
which have pH Optima somewhere around pH

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.930 
which have pH Optima somewhere around pH
four<00:00:38.780> or<00:00:39.050> five<00:00:39.379> and<00:00:39.739> then<00:00:40.220> there<00:00:40.399> are<00:00:40.430> alkaline

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
four or five and then there are alkaline

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.720 
four or five and then there are alkaline
phosphatases<00:00:41.690> which<00:00:42.410> have<00:00:42.649> pee<00:00:42.920> which<00:00:43.550> have

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
phosphatases which have pee which have

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.990 
phosphatases which have pee which have
opt<00:00:43.910> pH<00:00:44.300> Optima<00:00:44.840> somewhere<00:00:45.680> around<00:00:45.800> pH<00:00:46.339> 10<00:00:46.760> or

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
opt pH Optima somewhere around pH 10 or

opt pH Optima somewhere around pH 10 or
11<00:00:47.449> now<00:00:48.350> I've<00:00:48.500> been<00:00:48.680> given<00:00:49.040> a<00:00:49.100> phosphatase

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
11 now I've been given a phosphatase

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:51.759 
11 now I've been given a phosphatase
enzyme<00:00:50.180> and<00:00:50.449> I'm<00:00:50.930> trying<00:00:51.230> to<00:00:51.320> do<00:00:51.470> two<00:00:51.739> things

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
enzyme and I'm trying to do two things

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:53.889 
enzyme and I'm trying to do two things
first<00:00:52.399> and<00:00:52.640> foremost<00:00:53.030> to<00:00:53.120> determine<00:00:53.720> whether

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
first and foremost to determine whether

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:55.960 
first and foremost to determine whether
it's<00:00:54.110> an<00:00:54.260> acid<00:00:54.620> or<00:00:54.710> an<00:00:54.829> alkaline<00:00:55.309> phosphatase

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
it's an acid or an alkaline phosphatase

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.840 
it's an acid or an alkaline phosphatase
and<00:00:56.269> secondly<00:00:57.050> to<00:00:57.290> determine<00:00:57.920> precisely<00:00:58.129> what

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
and secondly to determine precisely what

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:06.850 
and secondly to determine precisely what
its<00:00:59.059> pH<00:00:59.449> optimum<00:00:59.989> is<00:01:00.969> so<00:01:01.969> to<00:01:02.030> do<00:01:02.329> that<00:01:05.440> I've<00:01:06.440> got

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
its pH optimum is so to do that I've got

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.450 
its pH optimum is so to do that I've got
a<00:01:07.160> series<00:01:07.880> of<00:01:07.910> tubes<00:01:08.590> which<00:01:09.590> I'm<00:01:09.800> going<00:01:10.039> to<00:01:10.130> set

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
a series of tubes which I'm going to set

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.279 
a series of tubes which I'm going to set
up<00:01:10.670> at<00:01:11.509> a<00:01:11.990> variety<00:01:12.200> of<00:01:12.530> different<00:01:12.860> PHS<00:01:14.229> so<00:01:15.229> to

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
up at a variety of different PHS so to

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.590 
up at a variety of different PHS so to
start<00:01:15.740> with<00:01:15.979> here<00:01:16.280> I'm<00:01:16.460> just<00:01:16.880> putting<00:01:17.000> water

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
start with here I'm just putting water

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.359 
start with here I'm just putting water
into<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.229> tubes<00:01:20.500> and<00:01:21.610> now<00:01:22.610> I'm<00:01:22.970> going<00:01:23.270> to<00:01:23.420> add

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
into the tubes and now I'm going to add

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.850 
into the tubes and now I'm going to add
some<00:01:25.369> buffer<00:01:25.850> which<00:01:26.750> will<00:01:26.960> ensure<00:01:27.409> that<00:01:27.440> the

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
some buffer which will ensure that the

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.050 
some buffer which will ensure that the
pH<00:01:28.250> stays<00:01:28.819> at<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.890> intended<00:01:30.890> pH<00:01:31.550> throughout

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
pH stays at the intended pH throughout

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.570 
pH stays at the intended pH throughout
the<00:01:32.270> experiment

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.700 

you'll<00:01:39.580> see<00:01:39.940> that<00:01:40.150> I've<00:01:40.360> actually<00:01:40.570> got<00:01:41.170> three

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
you'll see that I've actually got three

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.490 
you'll see that I've actually got three
tubes<00:01:42.130> here<00:01:42.580> and<00:01:42.790> I'm<00:01:43.240> using<00:01:43.510> three<00:01:44.080> for<00:01:44.440> each

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
tubes here and I'm using three for each

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.240 
tubes here and I'm using three for each
pH<00:01:45.040> value<00:01:45.610> that<00:01:45.790> I'm<00:01:46.000> going<00:01:46.240> to<00:01:46.420> measure<00:01:47.250> one

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
pH value that I'm going to measure one

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.860 
pH value that I'm going to measure one
of<00:01:48.400> them<00:01:48.610> is<00:01:49.060> a<00:01:50.020> control<00:01:50.800> in<00:01:51.490> other<00:01:51.940> words<00:01:52.210> I'm

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
of them is a control in other words I'm

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.740 
of them is a control in other words I'm
not<00:01:53.200> going<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.740> add<00:01:53.920> any<00:01:54.310> enzyme<00:01:55.000> to<00:01:55.300> that<00:01:55.480> I

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
not going to add any enzyme to that I

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.140 
not going to add any enzyme to that I
will<00:01:56.230> simply<00:01:56.710> add<00:01:56.860> water<00:01:57.190> to<00:01:57.610> make<00:01:57.790> up<00:01:58.000> the

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
will simply add water to make up the

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.410 
will simply add water to make up the
same<00:01:58.390> volume<00:02:01.680> right<00:02:02.680> so<00:02:03.280> now<00:02:03.550> I'm<00:02:03.850> putting<00:02:04.120> in

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
same volume right so now I'm putting in

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.750 
same volume right so now I'm putting in
the<00:02:04.570> substrate<00:02:05.170> that<00:02:05.380> I<00:02:05.560> told<00:02:05.800> you<00:02:05.950> about<00:02:06.130> for

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
the substrate that I told you about for

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.320 
the substrate that I told you about for
nitrile<00:02:07.240> phenol<00:02:07.600> phosphate<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.970> I'm<00:02:10.119> putting

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
nitrile phenol phosphate and I'm putting

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.800 
nitrile phenol phosphate and I'm putting
half<00:02:10.720> a<00:02:10.929> mil<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:12.700> into<00:02:13.240> each<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.630> these

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
half a mil of that into each of these

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:27.839 
half a mil of that into each of these
tubes

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.640 

and<00:02:27.969> half<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.900> mil<00:02:29.110> of<00:02:29.230> water<00:02:30.780> into<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:32.019> control

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
and half a mil of water into the control

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.819 
and half a mil of water into the control
tube<00:02:33.010> at<00:02:33.189> the<00:02:33.219> front<00:02:33.719> to<00:02:34.719> replace<00:02:35.109> the<00:02:35.409> enzyme

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
tube at the front to replace the enzyme

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:37.679 
tube at the front to replace the enzyme
that<00:02:36.099> I<00:02:36.280> shall<00:02:36.519> then<00:02:36.700> put<00:02:37.000> into<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.569> other

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:37.689 
that I shall then put into the other

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:43.289 
that I shall then put into the other
tubes<00:02:40.739> so<00:02:41.739> I'm<00:02:41.829> going<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.159> mix<00:02:42.400> each<00:02:42.790> of<00:02:43.120> these

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
tubes so I'm going to mix each of these

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:55.120 
tubes so I'm going to mix each of these
tubes

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.190
