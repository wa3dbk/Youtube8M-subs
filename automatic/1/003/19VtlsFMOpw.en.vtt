00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
didn't happen at all that's because the

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.839 
didn't happen at all that's because the
animators<00:03:34.220> too<00:03:34.430> lazy<00:03:34.640> to<00:03:34.849> draw<00:03:34.970> a<00:03:35.060> skeleton

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849

great<00:03:38.719> just<00:03:39.709> great<00:03:40.700> so<00:03:41.209> I<00:03:41.239> suppose<00:03:41.659> we<00:03:41.959> are<00:03:41.989> in

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
great just great so I suppose we are in

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.809 
great just great so I suppose we are in
Sleepy<00:03:42.530> Hollow<00:03:42.560> then<00:03:42.980> I<00:03:43.250> guess<00:03:44.150> so<00:03:44.950> so<00:03:45.950> what<00:03:46.700> do

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
Sleepy Hollow then I guess so so what do

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.910 
Sleepy Hollow then I guess so so what do
you<00:03:46.879> think<00:03:47.060> we<00:03:47.150> should<00:03:47.180> do<00:03:47.450> now<00:03:47.659> I<00:03:47.989> guess<00:03:48.709> the

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
you think we should do now I guess the

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.649 
you think we should do now I guess the
story<00:03:49.189> of<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.459> Headless<00:03:49.819> Horseman<00:03:49.849> will<00:03:50.450> just

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:50.659 
story of the Headless Horseman will just

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:52.539 
story of the Headless Horseman will just
play<00:03:50.900> out<00:03:51.079> and<00:03:51.290> we<00:03:51.409> wait<00:03:51.590> for<00:03:51.769> it<00:03:51.859> to<00:03:51.950> end<00:03:52.010> I

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
play out and we wait for it to end I

00:03:52.549 --> 00:04:08.410 
play out and we wait for it to end I
guess<00:03:53.359> we<00:03:53.569> could<00:03:53.689> see<00:03:53.870> if<00:03:53.989> that<00:03:54.140> works

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.940 

I<00:04:10.510> guess<00:04:11.510> the<00:04:11.690> story<00:04:11.959> is<00:04:12.110> finally<00:04:12.500> reached<00:04:12.680> its

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
I guess the story is finally reached its

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.490 
I guess the story is finally reached its
climax<00:04:13.180> if<00:04:14.180> it<00:04:14.390> has<00:04:14.599> then<00:04:14.959> that<00:04:15.110> horsemen

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
climax if it has then that horsemen

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:45.350 
climax if it has then that horsemen
