a<00:01:40.680> bridge<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.580> they'll<00:01:41.850> actually<00:01:42.030> segregate

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
a bridge is they'll actually segregate

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.680 
a bridge is they'll actually segregate
the<00:01:43.110> bridge<00:01:43.350> into<00:01:43.860> two<00:01:44.040> separate<00:01:44.850> lanes<00:01:45.240> and

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
the bridge into two separate lanes and

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.200 
the bridge into two separate lanes and
they'll<00:01:46.320> tear<00:01:46.590> out<00:01:46.770> one<00:01:47.009> lane<00:01:47.280> while<00:01:48.060> they're

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
they'll tear out one lane while they're

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.700 
they'll tear out one lane while they're
working<00:01:48.360> on<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.900> other<00:01:49.080> they<00:01:49.320> leave<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
working on the other they leave the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.789 
working on the other they leave the
remaining<00:01:50.070> lane<00:01:50.430> open<00:01:51.229> and<00:01:52.229> slow<00:01:52.530> down<00:01:52.740> here

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
remaining lane open and slow down here

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.529 
remaining lane open and slow down here
and<00:01:54.979> then<00:01:55.399> they'll<00:01:55.520> put<00:01:55.670> a<00:01:55.700> traffic<00:01:56.180> light<00:01:56.390> at

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
and then they'll put a traffic light at

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.099 
and then they'll put a traffic light at
each<00:01:56.689> end<00:01:56.960> of<00:01:57.079> the<00:01:57.170> bridge<00:01:58.750> now<00:01:59.750> the<00:01:59.810> traffic

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:00.109 
each end of the bridge now the traffic

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:02.340 
each end of the bridge now the traffic
light<00:02:00.530> has<00:02:00.859> sensors<00:02:01.429> at<00:02:01.579> each<00:02:01.729> end<00:02:02.090> and

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
light has sensors at each end and

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.690 
light has sensors at each end and
basically<00:02:03.350> what<00:02:03.619> happens<00:02:04.070> this<00:02:04.219> this<00:02:04.490> is<00:02:04.670> a

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
basically what happens this this is a

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.179 
basically what happens this this is a
3-way<00:02:05.149> or<00:02:05.420> a<00:02:05.479> four-way<00:02:06.110> configuration<00:02:07.009> here

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
3-way or a four-way configuration here

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.800 
3-way or a four-way configuration here
maybe<00:02:09.429> but<00:02:10.429> there's<00:02:10.640> a<00:02:10.700> sensor<00:02:11.209> at<00:02:11.330> each<00:02:11.450> end

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
maybe but there's a sensor at each end

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.229 
maybe but there's a sensor at each end
and<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.650> traffic<00:02:13.069> in<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.220> opposing<00:02:13.819> lane<00:02:14.030> is

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
and the traffic in the opposing lane is

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.500 
and the traffic in the opposing lane is
stopped<00:02:14.599> while<00:02:15.379> traffic<00:02:15.860> from<00:02:16.129> the<00:02:17.120> oncoming

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
stopped while traffic from the oncoming

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.030 
stopped while traffic from the oncoming
lane<00:02:17.690> is<00:02:18.019> allowed<00:02:18.319> through<00:02:18.709> and<00:02:18.920> basically

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
lane is allowed through and basically

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.520 
lane is allowed through and basically
the<00:02:19.519> traffic<00:02:19.940> lights<00:02:20.120> arbitrate<00:02:20.780> it<00:02:20.930> such

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
the traffic lights arbitrate it such

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.619 
the traffic lights arbitrate it such
that<00:02:21.560> there's<00:02:22.010> only<00:02:22.280> cars<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:23.000> trucks<00:02:23.180> going

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
that there's only cars and trucks going

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.930 
that there's only cars and trucks going
in<00:02:23.750> one<00:02:23.959> direction<00:02:24.099> at<00:02:25.099> any<00:02:25.310> given<00:02:25.640> time

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
in one direction at any given time

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.390 
in one direction at any given time
through<00:02:26.330> here<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:27.349> this<00:02:27.530> van<00:02:27.799> that<00:02:28.069> you<00:02:28.130> see

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
through here so this van that you see

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.089 
through here so this van that you see
approaching<00:02:28.970> in<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.120> distance<00:02:29.709> has<00:02:30.709> got<00:02:30.920> to

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
approaching in the distance has got to

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.380 
approaching in the distance has got to
stop<00:02:31.370> while<00:02:32.209> I'm<00:02:32.360> going<00:02:32.599> through<00:02:33.280> the

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
stop while I'm going through the

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.000 
stop while I'm going through the
sectioned<00:02:35.390> off<00:02:35.510> lane<00:02:35.840> here<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.380> then

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
sectioned off lane here and then

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.430 
sectioned off lane here and then
eventually<00:02:37.310> once<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.239> logic<00:02:38.870> has<00:02:39.019> decided

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
eventually once the logic has decided

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.400 
eventually once the logic has decided
that<00:02:39.650> it<00:02:39.920> was<00:02:40.069> cleared<00:02:40.810> it'll<00:02:41.810> allow<00:02:42.049> the<00:02:42.110> van

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
that it was cleared it'll allow the van

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.800 
that it was cleared it'll allow the van
to<00:02:42.650> go<00:02:42.769> on<00:02:42.980> through<00:02:43.340> but<00:02:44.180> I<00:02:44.209> came<00:02:44.450> across<00:02:44.720> a

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
to go on through but I came across a

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.380 
to go on through but I came across a
bridge<00:02:45.170> recently<00:02:45.829> that's<00:02:46.579> done<00:02:46.910> a<00:02:46.940> little<00:02:47.180> bit

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
bridge recently that's done a little bit

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.870 
bridge recently that's done a little bit
differently<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.250> that's<00:02:49.250> what<00:02:49.430> I<00:02:49.459> want<00:02:49.730> to

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
differently and that's what I want to

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.540 
differently and that's what I want to
show<00:02:50.090> you

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.610 

go<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:53.210> throw<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.600> other<00:02:53.720> way<00:02:53.930> now<00:02:53.960> just

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
go and throw it the other way now just

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.320 
go and throw it the other way now just
so<00:02:54.740> you<00:02:54.770> can<00:02:55.040> see<00:02:55.280> what<00:02:55.460> happens<00:02:55.910> here

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
so you can see what happens here

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.660 
so you can see what happens here
I've<00:02:56.900> got<00:02:57.170> a<00:02:57.200> stoplight<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:59.090> that<00:02:59.750> SUV<00:03:00.670> is

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
I've got a stoplight and that SUV is

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:09.309 
I've got a stoplight and that SUV is
able<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.090> go<00:03:02.240> on<00:03:02.450> through

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.229 

and<00:03:09.560> then<00:03:09.920> after<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.370> logic<00:03:10.730> has<00:03:10.879> waited<00:03:11.209> for

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
and then after the logic has waited for

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.390 
and then after the logic has waited for
a<00:03:11.420> while<00:03:11.480> it<00:03:12.140> senses<00:03:12.650> that<00:03:12.799> my<00:03:12.950> truck<00:03:13.219> is

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
a while it senses that my truck is

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.309 
a while it senses that my truck is
sitting<00:03:13.549> here<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:14.180> it'll<00:03:14.840> turn<00:03:14.989> the<00:03:15.049> light

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
sitting here and it'll turn the light

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.080 
sitting here and it'll turn the light
green<00:03:15.590> so<00:03:15.890> I<00:03:15.950> can<00:03:16.129> go<00:03:16.280> on<00:03:16.459> through<00:03:16.670> so<00:03:16.939> this

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
green so I can go on through so this

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.929 
green so I can go on through so this
Lane<00:03:17.359> basically<00:03:18.049> changes<00:03:18.530> purpose<00:03:18.950> depending

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:19.939 
Lane basically changes purpose depending

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:22.720 
Lane basically changes purpose depending
on<00:03:20.060> what's<00:03:20.299> waiting<00:03:20.719> at<00:03:20.840> either<00:03:20.959> end<00:03:21.290> of<00:03:21.730> the

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
on what's waiting at either end of the

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.450 
on what's waiting at either end of the
bridge<00:03:23.469> now<00:03:24.469> I've<00:03:24.590> got<00:03:24.769> to<00:03:24.920> go<00:03:25.040> ahead

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.010 

you<00:03:28.700> can<00:03:28.880> see<00:03:29.090> how<00:03:29.270> the<00:03:29.330> other<00:03:29.540> side<00:03:29.630> of<00:03:29.960> the

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
you can see how the other side of the

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.670 
you can see how the other side of the
bridge<00:03:30.200> there<00:03:30.530> is<00:03:30.880> blocked<00:03:31.880> off<00:03:32.120> all<00:03:32.560> torn<00:03:33.560> up

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
bridge there is blocked off all torn up

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.720 
bridge there is blocked off all torn up
right<00:03:33.950> now

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.180 

now<00:03:37.270> coming<00:03:37.780> up<00:03:37.989> here<00:03:38.200> just<00:03:38.440> ahead<00:03:38.800> is<00:03:39.040> the

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
now coming up here just ahead is the

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.680 
now coming up here just ahead is the
bridge<00:03:39.370> that<00:03:39.640> I<00:03:39.700> actually<00:03:39.910> want<00:03:40.330> to<00:03:40.480> talk

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
bridge that I actually want to talk

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.900 
bridge that I actually want to talk
about<00:03:41.099> see<00:03:42.099> they've<00:03:42.250> done<00:03:42.310> something<00:03:42.879> very

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
about see they've done something very

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.670 
about see they've done something very
interesting<00:03:43.450> here<00:03:44.050> and<00:03:44.200> I'm<00:03:44.290> not<00:03:44.470> sure

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
interesting here and I'm not sure

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.589 
interesting here and I'm not sure
entirely<00:03:45.160> why<00:03:45.550> but<00:03:45.940> instead<00:03:46.239> of<00:03:46.300> just

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
entirely why but instead of just

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.330 
entirely why but instead of just
segregating<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.410> bridge<00:03:47.620> down<00:03:47.920> into<00:03:48.190> one

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
segregating the bridge down into one

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.089 
segregating the bridge down into one
lane<00:03:48.610> they<00:03:49.390> actually<00:03:49.989> tore<00:03:50.290> it<00:03:50.440> completely

here<00:04:00.250> in<00:04:00.280> Illinois<00:04:00.790> I<00:04:01.060> guess<00:04:01.599> they<00:04:01.810> decided

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
here in Illinois I guess they decided

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.620 
here in Illinois I guess they decided
they<00:04:02.440> couldn't<00:04:02.739> do<00:04:02.950> that<00:04:03.130> what<00:04:03.910> they<00:04:04.120> did<00:04:04.390> do

they couldn't do that what they did do

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.960 
they couldn't do that what they did do
is<00:04:05.170> very<00:04:05.530> very<00:04:05.830> interesting<00:04:06.519> because<00:04:06.700> the

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
is very very interesting because the

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.850 
is very very interesting because the

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
or whatever reason they tear bridge is

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.289 
or whatever reason they tear bridge is
completely<00:04:11.590> out<00:04:11.709> for<00:04:12.069> and<00:04:12.310> they've<00:04:13.090> done

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
completely out for and they've done

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.120
