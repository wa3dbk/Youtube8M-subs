we are adopting a paradigm in which we
bring<00:05:35.039> water<00:05:35.340> from<00:05:35.669> further<00:05:36.060> and<00:05:36.330> further

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 
bring water from further and further

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:38.960 
bring water from further and further
away<00:05:36.780> into<00:05:37.139> our<00:05:37.260> cities<00:05:37.620> and<00:05:37.830> we<00:05:38.340> collect<00:05:38.789> all

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
away into our cities and we collect all

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.339 
away into our cities and we collect all
the<00:05:39.120> sewage<00:05:39.419> and<00:05:39.570> we<00:05:39.659> want<00:05:39.900> to<00:05:40.020> take<00:05:40.199> it

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:40.349 
the sewage and we want to take it

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:42.689 
the sewage and we want to take it
further<00:05:40.620> and<00:05:40.919> further<00:05:41.130> out<00:05:41.400> of<00:05:41.520> the<00:05:41.969> cities

further and further out of the cities

further and further out of the cities
we<00:05:42.909> never<00:05:43.300> look<00:05:43.629> at<00:05:43.749> the<00:05:43.870> cost<00:05:44.169> of<00:05:44.530> this<00:05:44.949> and

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.099 
we never look at the cost of this and

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:48.570 
we never look at the cost of this and
whether<00:05:45.550> modern<00:05:46.330> urban<00:05:46.689> India<00:05:47.560> can<00:05:47.979> actually
