 paranormal events in a certain 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.280
 place 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.980
 whether real or not, the mystery entertains 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.650
 Many people can fascinate 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.000
 Afraid to motivate them to solve the 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.000
 mystery among others 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.730
 obviously to the people who had 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.430
 the joy of witnessing that 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.660
 event did not happen very well 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.329
 imagine that a phenomenon happens to you 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.690
 paranormal would scare you or you 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.699
 would you ask how that happened 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.519
 and now imagine that you are going to another 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.980
 place and again the same thing happens to you 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:48.629
 matter where you go or who you are with 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.510

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.060
 unexplained how would you react to 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.550
 that 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.040
 or worse still think about the others 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.020
 people realizing that this only 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.020
 It happens in the moments that you are 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.970
 Almost like it happened to Carol 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.040
 compton a young Scottish who worked 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.400
 as a nanny and that newspapers the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.070
 cataloged as a witch in the 20th century 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.140
 the case of carol compton is very strange 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.180
 and it gives a lot to talk about today is 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.700
 considered by many as the light of the 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.640
 poltergeist activity and as a person 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.260
 with a psychic ability or medium 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.250
 uncontrolled instead of having some 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.250
 relationship with witchcraft 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.420
 I will tell you from the beginning heat 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.030
 Compton went to work in Italy together 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.140
 with his boyfriend or boyfriend and I found a 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.270
 I work as a nanny 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.460
 she was going to be in the care of the children 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.710
 from the rich family and a rich family 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.869
 economically while working from 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.460
 nanny her boyfriend stopped in the service 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.440
 military 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.479
 during the first days everything 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.850
 It went smoothly until a 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.709
 day a little religious picture fell from 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.620
 the wall and crashed on the ground 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.459
 while carroll passed by there 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.959
 rose the maid of the house who was very 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.330
 superstitious realized that 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.349
 that made caron cross himself and pray 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.349
 a short prayer 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.460
 shortly after a family left 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.650
 vacation to the Italian Alps there 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.280
 they had a two-story house where they could 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.740
 stay and carol I accompany you after 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.720
 a couple of days there was a fire and 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.150
 the entire second floor of the 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.129
 house was in ruins 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.170
 a firefighter who helped turn the 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:48.349
 fire thought that the fire was caused 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.540
 for an electrical fault maybe some 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.930
 wires voted sparks under the boards 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.359
 ground 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.120
 in the next days there were two others 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:03:00.340
 fires one was a small fire in 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.109
 one garbage can and the other in the 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.170
 bedroom of his daughter two years of 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:06.630
 age and manuel 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.150
 these events caused the 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.069
 family would suspect karol and they told him 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.319
 that it was no longer necessary to take care of 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.010
 children so she was fired 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.010
 friendly 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.840
 at the end of July 1982 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:30.420
 carol got a new job as a nanny 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.700
 with the tonty family and went to live 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.659
 with them in the grandparents' house in 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.989
 the island of elba 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:39.109
 the grandmother was very superstitious and barely 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.519
 saw caron began to dislike him 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:43.739
 after a few days there was a 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.599
 fire of a mattress the points of 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.879
 electrical connections in the bedroom 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:51.299
 they were verified but the family did not 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:53.700
 found nothing bad later that day a 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.430
 little statue fell to the ground when not 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.500
 there was nobody near him shortly after 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.870
 small objects began to break 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.840
 or even to be thrown by the house 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.120
 this was followed minutes later by a 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.419
 blue glass vase that fell to the 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.489
 I'm breaking this vase in pieces 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:14.219
 had been on a small table at 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.829
 side of the TV out of reach of 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:18.799
 karol from then on the grandmother 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.220
 he took a violent attitude about her 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:24.840
 murmuring the word witch on his back 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.270
 unfortunately a fire occurred in the 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.960
 mattress of the crib where a baby slept 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.509
 three-year- old called anise 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.820
 dying calcinated this was enough 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:38.039
 so that the grandmother the accusation of initiating 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.680
 the fires and convinced the family 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:43.650
 to call the police the police 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.770
 He arrested Carol and sent her to a prison 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.380
 in livorno she was interrogated and taken to 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.960
 prison for attempted murder despite 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.699
 that she was not accused of witchcraft that 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.490
 was the basis of the accusations in his 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:58.259
 against the case it started to come out 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.110
 news and in several newspapers 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:03.180
 Italians however the coverage of 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.789
 the media provided some help 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.789
 Carol helped her raise money for 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:11.039
 your defense as well as attract the 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.530
 international attention against 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.390
 Italian justice system and the 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:19.200
 witch trial that was 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:21.210
 in the 20th century at that time the case of 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.550
 karol got the attention of for 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.740
 famous psychologists like guy layún 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.110
 playfair who offered to travel to 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.680
 roma and help carol in her fight against 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.169
 the charges against him 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.570
 however carol did not want the help of 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.970
 parapsychologists because of the fear that 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.880
 turn everything into rumors about his 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.340
 participation in the occult caron 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.400
 he believed that she did not possess any kind of 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.870
 psychic or supernatural ability and that 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.520
 there had to be some kind of 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.409
 rational explanation for the 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.959
 mysterious fires 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:56.819
 throughout the interrogations carol 

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:58.800
 insisted that he had nothing to do 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:00.599
 with the fires and the mysterious 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.569
 phenomena that seemed to follow 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:04.699
 wherever it was 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:06.710
 others of the mysteries concerning 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:09.740
 case is that nobody had seen carol 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.959
 break or throw an object besides 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.339
 create some of the fires in the 

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:15.339
 who had been accused 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.930
 there was a trial and in the end caron was 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.450
 declared not guilty of intent to 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:26.240
 murder but guilty of two counts of 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.850
 arson and one of attempted 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.580
 fire she received a sentence of 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.170
 two and a half years in prison but due 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.230
 at the time that I had already spent in prison 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:39.070
 the ancestry was suspended and she was 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:41.680
 free to leave 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:43.750
 shortly after his release carol 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.340
 compton left italy avoiding like this 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:49.330
 any kind of contact with the 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:52.060
 media until 1990 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.729
 in that year he published a book about his 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.259
 terrible experience titled 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:58.960
 superstition the true story of the 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:07:00.879
 nanny who called her a witch and who 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.560
 included evidence from the experts that 

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:05.560
 they suggested that she was the victim 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.840
 involuntary of a poltergeist today in 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.300
 day nothing is known about her but despite 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.250
 that Carol left this country in the 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.620
 2004 there were multiple fires 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.240
 spontaneous doing that in the mind of 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.310
 the inhabitants return the 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.689
 superstitions about strange powers 

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.689
 supernatural and witchcraft 

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:29.270
