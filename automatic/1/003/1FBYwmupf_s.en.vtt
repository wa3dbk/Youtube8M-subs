also have the extreme shock shield case
we've<00:00:37.140> seen<00:00:37.440> these<00:00:37.620> before<00:00:37.829> for<00:00:38.250> iphones

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
we've seen these before for iphones

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.790 
we've seen these before for iphones
things<00:00:39.059> like<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.450> it's<00:00:40.050> kind<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.469> like<00:00:40.620> an

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
things like that it's kind of like an

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
heavy-duty nice case as well they also

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.819 
heavy-duty nice case as well they also

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
support system we can take a quick look

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.650 
support system we can take a quick look
at<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.680> case<00:00:52.980> but<00:00:53.910> i<00:00:53.940> want<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.239> show<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.449> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
at this case but i want to show you the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.650 
at this case but i want to show you the
other<00:00:54.780> cases<00:00:55.140> if<00:00:56.010> i<00:00:56.219> can<00:00:56.489> here<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.300> can<00:00:57.449> see

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
other cases if i can here so you can see

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.500 
other cases if i can here so you can see
inside<00:00:58.250> its<00:00:59.250> nicely<00:01:00.680> nicely<00:01:01.680> decorated<00:01:02.510> most

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
inside its nicely nicely decorated most

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.450 
inside its nicely nicely decorated most
people<00:01:03.870> don't<00:01:04.049> take<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.409> time<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:05.100> make<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
people don't take the time to make the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.270 
people don't take the time to make the
inside<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.000> their<00:01:06.270> cases<00:01:06.720> nice<00:01:07.280> puregear

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
inside of their cases nice puregear

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.830 
inside of their cases nice puregear
seems<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.850> have<00:01:08.939> done<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.299> with<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.600> case

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
seems to have done that with this case

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.500 
seems to have done that with this case
it's<00:01:10.380> an<00:01:10.470> interesting<00:01:10.740> case<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.939> snaps<00:01:12.270> onto

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
it's an interesting case it snaps onto

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.649 
it's an interesting case it snaps onto
the<00:01:12.750> galaxy<00:01:13.200> s3<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:14.850> rubbery<00:01:15.240> you

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
the galaxy s3 like this it's rubbery you

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.109 
the galaxy s3 like this it's rubbery you
can<00:01:15.780> see<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.110> flexible<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.430> offers<00:01:17.670> some

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
can see it's flexible so it offers some

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.910 
can see it's flexible so it offers some
protection<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.840> then<00:01:19.049> if<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.439> want<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.740> clip

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
protection and then if you want to clip

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.520 
protection and then if you want to clip
it<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.490> use<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.689> also<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.049> stand

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
it on you can use this it's also a stand

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.130 
it on you can use this it's also a stand
and<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:23.490> has<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:23.880> interesting<00:01:24.420> stand

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
and it has this interesting stand

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.039 
and it has this interesting stand
mechanism<00:01:25.740> also<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.430> can<00:01:26.610> use<00:01:26.790> it

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
mechanism also so you can use it

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.480 
mechanism also so you can use it
multiple<00:01:28.049> different<00:01:28.439> ways<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:29.130> really

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
multiple different ways it's really

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.760 
multiple different ways it's really
pretty<00:01:29.670> nice<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.900> really<00:01:30.930> like<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.530> case

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
pretty nice and I really like that case

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.230 
pretty nice and I really like that case
so<00:01:31.950> i<00:01:32.009> thought<00:01:32.159> i'd<00:01:32.340> show<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.790> but<00:01:33.030> these

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
so i thought i'd show you that but these

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.660 
so i thought i'd show you that but these
cases<00:01:33.810> are<00:01:34.409> really<00:01:34.710> interesting<00:01:35.250> here's<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
cases are really interesting here's the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.219 
cases are really interesting here's the
s3<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.439> we<00:01:37.439> have<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.979> PX<00:01:38.400> 260<00:01:39.270> protection

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
s3 and we have the PX 260 protection

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.850 
s3 and we have the PX 260 protection
system<00:01:40.650> we<00:01:41.430> also<00:01:41.610> have<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.119> PX<00:01:42.450> 360<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.710> can

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
system we also have the PX 360 you can

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.050 
system we also have the PX 360 you can
see<00:01:44.040> they're<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.250> little<00:01:44.430> bit<00:01:44.640> different<00:01:45.000> we

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
see they're a little bit different we

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.300 
see they're a little bit different we
have<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.210> little<00:01:45.390> loop<00:01:45.869> here<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.860> carabiner

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
have a little loop here and a carabiner

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.210 
have a little loop here and a carabiner
for<00:01:48.079> clipping<00:01:49.079> on<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.500> whatever<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.890> need<00:01:50.100> it

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
for clipping on to whatever you need it

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.569 
for clipping on to whatever you need it

this<00:03:48.600> is<00:03:48.810> not<00:03:48.989> a<00:03:49.260> tiny<00:03:49.560> case<00:03:49.920> at<00:03:50.220> all<00:03:50.630> and<00:03:51.630> it

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
this is not a tiny case at all and it

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.910 
this is not a tiny case at all and it
goes<00:03:52.470> on<00:03:52.650> just<00:03:53.010> like<00:03:53.250> this<00:03:53.870> then<00:03:54.870> again<00:03:55.019> you're

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
goes on just like this then again you're

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.440 
goes on just like this then again you're
obviously<00:03:56.220> not<00:03:56.550> going<00:03:56.820> to<00:03:56.940> be<00:03:57.030> taking<00:03:57.360> your

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
obviously not going to be taking your

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.700 
obviously not going to be taking your
phone<00:03:57.720> out<00:03:57.989> of<00:03:58.050> this<00:03:58.320> case<00:03:58.620> very<00:03:58.950> often

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.070 

I've<00:04:03.370> got<00:04:03.640> all<00:04:03.760> six<00:04:04.060> screws<00:04:04.330> fastened<00:04:04.930> down

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
I've got all six screws fastened down

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.440 
I've got all six screws fastened down
and<00:04:05.380> you<00:04:05.800> can<00:04:05.950> see<00:04:06.190> it<00:04:06.310> adds<00:04:06.490> some<00:04:06.640> significant

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
and you can see it adds some significant

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.980 
and you can see it adds some significant
bulk<00:04:07.720> to<00:04:08.170> the<00:04:08.470> phone<00:04:09.130> itself<00:04:09.910> it's<00:04:10.510> pretty

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
bulk to the phone itself it's pretty

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.470 
bulk to the phone itself it's pretty
hefty<00:04:11.470> and<00:04:11.650> there's<00:04:12.430> a<00:04:12.490> separate<00:04:13.000> layer<00:04:13.180> it's

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
hefty and there's a separate layer it's

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.940 
hefty and there's a separate layer it's
almost<00:04:13.660> like<00:04:13.840> a<00:04:13.870> separate<00:04:14.290> shock<00:04:14.620> layer

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
almost like a separate shock layer

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.920 
almost like a separate shock layer
inside<00:04:15.520> so<00:04:15.880> if<00:04:16.000> this<00:04:16.150> were<00:04:16.330> to<00:04:16.360> impact

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
inside so if this were to impact

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.610 
inside so if this were to impact
something<00:04:17.410> it<00:04:17.590> has<00:04:18.130> a<00:04:18.430> good<00:04:19.020> maybe<00:04:20.020> two<00:04:20.380> eights

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
something it has a good maybe two eights

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.950 
something it has a good maybe two eights
worth<00:04:20.980> of<00:04:21.220> give<00:04:21.489> on<00:04:21.730> each<00:04:22.000> side<00:04:22.300> it's<00:04:22.600> it's

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
worth of give on each side it's it's

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.840 
worth of give on each side it's it's
pretty<00:04:23.380> impressive<00:04:23.680> but<00:04:24.130> also<00:04:24.250> pretty<00:04:24.610> bulky

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
pretty impressive but also pretty bulky

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.030 
pretty impressive but also pretty bulky
because<00:04:25.360> of<00:04:25.510> that<00:04:25.690> it's<00:04:26.260> not<00:04:26.470> going<00:04:26.740> to<00:04:26.920> ever

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
because of that it's not going to ever

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.770 
because of that it's not going to ever
fall<00:04:27.400> out<00:04:27.610> of<00:04:27.640> the<00:04:27.880> case<00:04:28.090> unless<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.600> case

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
fall out of the case unless the case

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.570 
fall out of the case unless the case
where<00:04:29.020> to<00:04:29.110> impact<00:04:29.590> something<00:04:30.010> so<00:04:30.220> hard<00:04:30.460> that

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
where to impact something so hard that

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.430 
where to impact something so hard that
it<00:04:30.700> would<00:04:30.820> break<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.540> you<00:04:32.020> can<00:04:32.170> see<00:04:32.410> the

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
it would break and you can see the

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.560 
it would break and you can see the
buttons<00:04:32.890> are<00:04:33.010> here<00:04:33.310> if<00:04:33.460> i<00:04:33.910> push<00:04:34.150> this<00:04:34.360> one

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
buttons are here if i push this one

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.590 
buttons are here if i push this one
we'll<00:04:34.780> see<00:04:35.020> it'll<00:04:35.170> turn<00:04:35.410> on<00:04:35.650> and<00:04:36.300> then<00:04:37.300> we<00:04:37.450> have

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
we'll see it'll turn on and then we have

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.900 
we'll see it'll turn on and then we have
our<00:04:37.720> volume<00:04:38.110> up/down<00:04:38.320> we<00:04:39.100> unlock<00:04:39.490> the<00:04:39.700> phone

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
our volume up/down we unlock the phone

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.690 
our volume up/down we unlock the phone
we<00:04:40.360> have<00:04:40.390> our<00:04:40.600> volume<00:04:40.990> up/down<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:42.340> buttons

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
we have our volume up/down the buttons

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.790 
we have our volume up/down the buttons
work<00:04:42.910> fine<00:04:43.240> no<00:04:43.690> problem<00:04:44.110> there<00:04:44.140> you<00:04:44.530> can<00:04:44.680> hit

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
work fine no problem there you can hit

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.700 
work fine no problem there you can hit
the<00:04:44.950> home<00:04:45.130> button<00:04:46.260> obviously<00:04:47.260> the<00:04:47.380> screens

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
the home button obviously the screens

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.130 
the home button obviously the screens
going<00:04:48.070> to<00:04:48.160> work<00:04:48.370> it<00:04:49.210> does<00:04:49.450> go<00:04:49.600> right<00:04:49.810> up<00:04:49.930> to<00:04:50.050> the

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
going to work it does go right up to the

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.470 
going to work it does go right up to the
edge<00:04:50.290> of<00:04:50.650> the<00:04:50.830> screen<00:04:51.040> so<00:04:51.460> that<00:04:51.490> might<00:04:51.820> be<00:04:52.090> a

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
edge of the screen so that might be a

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.060 
edge of the screen so that might be a
bit<00:04:52.870> of<00:04:52.900> a<00:04:53.050> difficult<00:04:53.500> thing<00:04:53.560> if<00:04:53.920> you're

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
bit of a difficult thing if you're

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.400 
bit of a difficult thing if you're
playing<00:04:54.340> a<00:04:54.460> game<00:04:54.670> but<00:04:54.970> for<00:04:55.900> the<00:04:55.990> most<00:04:56.110> part<00:04:56.260> I

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
playing a game but for the most part I

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.720 
playing a game but for the most part I
don't<00:04:56.590> think<00:04:56.770> that<00:04:56.950> should<00:04:57.100> be<00:04:57.160> too<00:04:57.430> big<00:04:57.550> of<00:04:57.640> a

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
don't think that should be too big of a

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.670 
don't think that should be too big of a
deal<00:04:57.910> on<00:04:58.090> the<00:04:58.660> bottom<00:04:59.020> you<00:04:59.200> can<00:04:59.230> see<00:04:59.380> they've

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
deal on the bottom you can see they've

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.370 
deal on the bottom you can see they've
left<00:05:00.190> an<00:05:00.370> opening<00:05:00.760> for<00:05:01.000> the<00:05:01.060> microphone<00:05:01.450> we

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
left an opening for the microphone we

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.860 
left an opening for the microphone we
have<00:05:02.620> the<00:05:02.860> USB<00:05:03.150> port<00:05:04.150> and<00:05:04.270> you<00:05:04.390> can<00:05:04.540> see<00:05:04.720> how

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
have the USB port and you can see how

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.530 
have the USB port and you can see how
thick<00:05:05.140> this<00:05:05.350> is<00:05:05.410> inside<00:05:05.950> here<00:05:06.340> it's<00:05:07.300> pretty

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
thick this is inside here it's pretty

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.600 
thick this is inside here it's pretty
significant<00:05:08.170> you've<00:05:08.680> got<00:05:08.920> a<00:05:08.950> good<00:05:09.190> maybe

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
significant you've got a good maybe

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.990 
significant you've got a good maybe
quarter<00:05:10.150> inch<00:05:10.360> inside<00:05:11.260> there<00:05:11.590> to<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:12.520> outside

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
quarter inch inside there to the outside

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.660 
quarter inch inside there to the outside
for<00:05:13.570> your<00:05:13.690> micro<00:05:14.020> USB<00:05:14.470> port<00:05:14.770> if<00:05:15.280> we<00:05:15.430> look<00:05:15.610> at

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
for your micro USB port if we look at

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.030 
for your micro USB port if we look at
the<00:05:15.850> top<00:05:16.150> of<00:05:16.180> the<00:05:16.510> case<00:05:16.720> we<00:05:17.290> have<00:05:17.380> a<00:05:17.440> huge<00:05:17.650> cut

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
the top of the case we have a huge cut

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.030 
the top of the case we have a huge cut
out<00:05:18.190> for<00:05:18.670> the<00:05:18.820> microphone<00:05:19.150> and<00:05:19.570> this<00:05:20.380> may<00:05:20.860> be<00:05:20.920> a

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
out for the microphone and this may be a

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.680 
out for the microphone and this may be a
problem<00:05:21.310> if<00:05:21.700> you<00:05:21.850> have<00:05:22.090> a<00:05:22.120> microphone<00:05:22.510> that

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
problem if you have a microphone that

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.020 
problem if you have a microphone that
has<00:05:23.500> a<00:05:23.560> right<00:05:23.890> angle<00:05:24.280> on<00:05:24.400> it<00:05:24.430> so<00:05:24.760> it<00:05:24.880> may<00:05:25.000> not

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
has a right angle on it so it may not

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.730 
has a right angle on it so it may not
fit<00:05:25.480> all<00:05:25.660> the<00:05:25.780> way<00:05:25.900> down<00:05:26.110> and<00:05:26.140> then<00:05:26.380> come<00:05:26.620> out

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
fit all the way down and then come out

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.160 
fit all the way down and then come out
but<00:05:27.040> it<00:05:27.460> is<00:05:27.880> pretty<00:05:28.210> far<00:05:28.510> down<00:05:28.660> in<00:05:28.870> there<00:05:29.020> but

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
but it is pretty far down in there but

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.000 
but it is pretty far down in there but
if<00:05:29.230> you<00:05:29.320> have<00:05:29.410> one<00:05:29.530> of<00:05:29.620> the<00:05:29.710> straight

if you have one of the straight

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.220 
if you have one of the straight
microphones<00:05:30.550> no<00:05:30.790> problem<00:05:31.240> there<00:05:31.450> again

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230

another cut out for a microphone on the

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.360 
another cut out for a microphone on the
back<00:05:34.840> the<00:05:35.110> cutouts<00:05:35.470> are<00:05:35.680> really<00:05:35.920> nice<00:05:36.070> I

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
back the cutouts are really nice I

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.040 
back the cutouts are really nice I
really<00:05:36.670> like<00:05:36.850> the<00:05:37.000> look<00:05:37.180> of<00:05:37.330> this<00:05:37.450> case<00:05:37.750> but

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
really like the look of this case but

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.480 
really like the look of this case but
again<00:05:38.320> it's<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:38.680> bulk<00:05:38.890> that's<00:05:39.190> a<00:05:39.280> little

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
again it's the bulk that's a little

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.660 
again it's the bulk that's a little
concerning<00:05:39.670> it's<00:05:40.660> it's<00:05:41.020> so<00:05:41.290> huge<00:05:41.650> but<00:05:41.890> you<00:05:42.460> can

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:42.670 
concerning it's it's so huge but you can

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.430 
concerning it's it's so huge but you can
pretty<00:05:43.180> much<00:05:43.270> rest<00:05:43.660> assured<00:05:44.020> that<00:05:44.230> if<00:05:44.350> you

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
pretty much rest assured that if you

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.380 
pretty much rest assured that if you
through<00:05:44.740> this<00:05:44.950> across<00:05:45.580> the<00:05:45.790> room<00:05:45.970> by<00:05:46.180> accident

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
through this across the room by accident

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.260 
through this across the room by accident
or<00:05:46.930> tripped<00:05:47.860> and<00:05:48.070> it<00:05:48.160> flew<00:05:48.550> out<00:05:48.730> of<00:05:48.760> your<00:05:49.000> hand

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
or tripped and it flew out of your hand

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.360 
or tripped and it flew out of your hand
it's<00:05:49.600> probably<00:05:50.140> going<00:05:50.350> to<00:05:50.470> be<00:05:50.590> fine<00:05:50.920> unless<00:05:51.130> it

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
it's probably going to be fine unless it

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.190 
it's probably going to be fine unless it
hits<00:05:51.550> something<00:05:51.700> directly<00:05:52.150> on<00:05:52.510> the<00:05:52.660> screen<00:05:52.870> so

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
hits something directly on the screen so

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.980 
hits something directly on the screen so
