00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.610
 we are also going to need cream cheese 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:42.580
 parmesan this is that that well plundered 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.379
 and we're going to need enough oil 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.480
 to make this recipe so we're going to 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.059
 start the first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.350
 cut them here on the banks and then 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.350
 let's open the banana 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.379
 and this we are going to open here for the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.379
 half 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.170
 but we're not going to open everything 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.420
 already with our fingers let's go 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.420
 opening a little 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:30.210
 in this way we are going to leave it and so 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.210
 we are going to cook them 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.610
 should not pass it up down there but 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.430
 that nothing more in half we need 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.340
 let him do a little bit of everything 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.550
 time so that we stay open there 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.670
 we have some of the bananas already 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.590
 cut and split in half and so what 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.130
 we open and open it a little bit so that 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.709

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.350
