like<00:01:43.250> you<00:01:43.340> normally<00:01:43.490> do<00:01:43.900> and<00:01:45.010> then<00:01:46.010> she<00:01:46.640> kind

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
like you normally do and then she kind

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.790 
like you normally do and then she kind
of<00:01:47.980> turned<00:01:48.980> like<00:01:49.610> twists<00:01:50.360> as<00:01:50.750> she<00:01:50.960> goes<00:01:51.080> up<00:01:51.440> I

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.770 
of turned like twists as she goes up I
want<00:01:52.580> to<00:01:52.640> try<00:01:52.820> that<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.180> see<00:01:53.330> it's<00:01:53.660> like<00:01:53.720> a

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
thing we're going to pin it up I think

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.540

I'm going to buy some bigger rollers

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.340 
I'm going to buy some bigger rollers
because<00:04:29.150> I<00:04:29.240> think<00:04:29.300> those<00:04:29.600> small<00:04:29.840> ones<00:04:29.870> are<00:04:30.110> too

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
because I think those small ones are too

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.370 
because I think those small ones are too
small<00:04:31.040> for<00:04:31.340> my<00:04:31.430> hair<00:04:31.670> like<00:04:31.820> now<00:04:32.120> when<00:04:33.110> my<00:04:33.200> hair

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
small for my hair like now when my hair

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.880 
small for my hair like now when my hair
was<00:04:33.410> shorter<00:04:33.980> they<00:04:34.580> worked<00:04:34.880> but<00:04:35.530> now<00:04:36.530> it's

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
was shorter they worked but now it's

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.180 
was shorter they worked but now it's
gotten<00:04:37.820> a<00:04:38.030> bit<00:04:38.090> longer<00:04:38.630> so<00:04:38.990> I<00:04:39.260> think<00:04:39.500> I<00:04:39.740> do<00:04:39.800> need

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
gotten a bit longer so I think I do need

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.520 
gotten a bit longer so I think I do need
to<00:04:40.520> get<00:04:40.820> some<00:04:41.000> of<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:41.120> ear<00:04:41.150> ones<00:04:41.480> but<00:04:42.200> you<00:04:42.260> know

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330
