00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.770
 dead we find ourselves today for 

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.200
 a new video this time a 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.240
 video tutorial for how to install 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.980
 strong minecraft on the 1.7 points version 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.270
 10 I explain all this to you in less 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.619
 of six minutes then nothing simpler 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.029
 just go to page 9 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.610
 despite a net I will put in the 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.610
 description you go down all the way down 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.960
 and you click on install jarre 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.380
 then it will give you a little 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.970
 file so like these next or 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.410
 select a mode you want 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.420
 so for my part I re in private bio 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.910
 kraft for this version campo 7.10 which 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.710
 is just huge I love this mode so 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.430
 you go down all the way down and you 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.040
 click here so you give the 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.000
 rom server 1 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.310
 then will send you to our page 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.200
 coup done online and it will give me so 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.760
 this little file there so nothing since that 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.299
 to install malgras forge enough to 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.790
 click on forge a 7.10 point that you 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.920
 so have to download you do a 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.500
 double click 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.090
 this is like this or excuse me no 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.130
 it's me who makes twice 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.499
 double click at I did twice 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.999
 in a row then here is enough 

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:21.659
 just find the path of 

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:24.549
 your minecraft point and you're doing ok 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.280
 so there is automatically installed the 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.569
 masne kraft forges 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.859
 after nothing simpler just 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:33.060
 click on your lunch hours of 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:36.390
 minecraft to throw it 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:41.649
 so that's going to search and so on 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:45.210
 so here's starting nature like this 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:49.810
 so there you just have to retype your 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.840
 email address and your password 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.030
 in addition to those I master it's a 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.990
 small 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.399
 stuff the story you see not selling 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.819
 e-mails I do not want to do myself 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:04.579
 so harass the norm in the profiler 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.659
 at forges and so my our stuff so there 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.609
 where you select the strong I you 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.739
 make play so it's a people and like 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:10.789
 the like the previous video that you 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.190
 explained about the tutorials 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.450
 on the tax version 7.2 a trick of the 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.049
 kind it was this version that you 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.060
 presented 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.549
 so it's exactly the same 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.810
 same club operation so you 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.700
 start your lunch hours that's what 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.580
 so I made it forged you 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.769
 launches you eye in class who 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.360
 will happen is that he will install 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.920
 automatically so it's for those 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.640
 that it is essential to launch a 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.670
 first time 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.950
 forget so that it creates the fashion folder 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.079
 and then when the mode folder will be 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.579
 created and so those who are in the process of 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.470
 happen there my written fashion record 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.819
 so here they say walk the smell 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.879
 three active modes so that is to say that 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.319
 the forget file has been installed 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.260
 correctly in that you close your 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.670
 minecraft you go in point 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.590
 minecraft so I recreated a 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.239
 shortcut and as you can see 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.819
 signed a fashion folder that was created 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:02.120
 so here nothing more simple it is enough 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.650
 drag your bibliography 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.130
 in the mode folder 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.829
 then you close and you start a 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.410
 again your minecraft launcher 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.630
 so why because I like you 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.389
 was explaining lately just enough 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.040
 to launch once minecraft forge more 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.660
 you close it and by doing that it creates 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.769
 one of his fashions his cows craft and 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.599
 that's what you have to do because 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.549
 otherwise it will not work if you 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.109
 create for example if you do 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.760
 forged minecraft you create the same 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.010
 of her boots she will not work 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.120
 I reassure you better to prevent 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.769
 so here hopefully it's going 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.410
 operate normally it has to 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.549
 to work in addition to all that I'll you 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.560
 explain all this in less than five 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.639
 minutes in there is nothing simpler and 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.319
 in addition to that I will show you 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.889
 that it works by swinging a 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:48.260
 little part in creative mode 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:48.739
 So here she is that it works 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.419
 normally 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.530
 there it's just that it puts a little bit of 

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:53.389
 time because my pc is not enough 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.109
 powerful so his time hand which I 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:58.639
 apologize for making you wait 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.440
 but hey it works 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.790
 four active modes so that's for you 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.109
 to say that it works properly the 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.510
 the creative mode so I'm going to launch it 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:12.129
 no need to recreate 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:13.959
 world is great here it should 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.250
 to work it takes a little time it's 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:21.699
 normal my pc is not powerful enough 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:23.320
 I apologize ok it's not bad 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:25.270
 I launched the world but the world does not 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.610
 not work i love i love ya 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.110
 always moments of leaves 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.090
 like that on minecraft and I love 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.350
 I honestly love it so I love it 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.169
 the standard in that should work a 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.100
 game show you here is the bio kraft 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.199
 works great 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.639
 as we can see so there is no 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.320
 of concern well listen my dear friends 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.580
