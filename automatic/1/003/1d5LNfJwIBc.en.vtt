00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
are wireless speakers and I don't know

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.420 
are wireless speakers and I don't know
you<00:01:04.530> know<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.680> don't<00:01:04.890> know<00:01:04.949> what<00:01:05.100> they'll<00:01:05.280> be

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
you know I don't know what they'll be

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.219 
you know I don't know what they'll be
like<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.850> terms<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.180> dropping<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> signal<00:01:07.110> and

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
like in terms of dropping the signal and

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.570 
like in terms of dropping the signal and
whatnot<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.650> that's<00:01:07.950> kind<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.400> why<00:01:08.549> I

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
whatnot and that's kind of why I

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.760 
whatnot and that's kind of why I
purchased<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.390> put<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.659> through<00:01:10.530> its<00:01:10.590> paces

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
purchased it to put it through its paces

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.320 
purchased it to put it through its paces
and<00:01:11.159> see<00:01:11.340> if<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:11.640> actually<00:01:11.850> any<00:01:12.240> good

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
and see if it's actually any good

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.270 
and see if it's actually any good
applicable<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.290> not<00:01:13.439> just<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.799> know<00:01:13.950> saying

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
applicable and not just you know saying

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.870 
applicable and not just you know saying
a<00:01:14.640> nice<00:01:15.270> idea<00:01:15.840> but<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.830> does<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.369> two<00:01:17.610> rear

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
a nice idea but it does have two rear

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.899 
a nice idea but it does have two rear
speakers<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.840> its<00:01:19.080> own<00:01:19.320> some<00:01:19.979> sound<00:01:20.280> bars<00:01:20.670> work

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
speakers of its own some sound bars work

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.800 
speakers of its own some sound bars work
by<00:01:21.119> simulating<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:22.020> surround<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.799> effect<00:01:23.810> just

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
by simulating a surround to effect just

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.560 
by simulating a surround to effect just
with<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.439> bar<00:01:25.650> itself<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.759> it's<00:01:26.909> not<00:01:27.030> actual

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
with the bar itself so it's not actual

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.700 
with the bar itself so it's not actual
surround<00:01:27.990> sound<00:01:28.670> but<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.790> simulates<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.710> this

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
surround sound but it simulates it this

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.090 
surround sound but it simulates it this
is<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.009> first<00:01:32.250> one<00:01:32.490> I've<00:01:32.640> seen<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:33.119> has<00:01:34.100> well

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
is the first one I've seen that has well

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.580 
is the first one I've seen that has well
I'm<00:01:35.400> sure<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:35.820> not<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.090> first<00:01:36.270> one<00:01:36.420> but<00:01:37.350> this

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
I'm sure it's not the first one but this

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.300 
I'm sure it's not the first one but this
unit<00:01:37.920> has<00:01:38.070> its<00:01:38.100> own<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.640> rear<00:01:38.820> surround<00:01:39.299> sound

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
feet here on the bottom that you could

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.860 
feet here on the bottom that you could
set<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.290> flat<00:02:32.940> I'm<00:02:33.940> saying<00:02:34.300> if<00:02:34.420> you<00:02:34.450> have<00:02:34.690> our

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
set it flat I'm saying if you have our

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.280 
set it flat I'm saying if you have our
entertainment<00:02:35.440> system<00:02:36.239> and<00:02:37.239> you<00:02:37.959> can<00:02:38.110> set<00:02:38.260> it

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
entertainment system and you can set it

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.870 
entertainment system and you can set it
flat<00:02:38.470> off<00:02:38.920> somewhere<00:02:39.370> in<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.550> entertainment

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
flat off somewhere in the entertainment

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.240 
flat off somewhere in the entertainment
system<00:02:40.209> here's<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.140> hookups<00:02:41.500> on<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.830> bottom

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
system here's the hookups on the bottom

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.320 
system here's the hookups on the bottom
it<00:02:43.000> has<00:02:43.060> two<00:02:43.510> Digital<00:02:44.020> hookups<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.850> one

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
it has two Digital hookups and one

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.199 
it has two Digital hookups and one
analog<00:02:46.870> hookup<00:02:47.410> so<00:02:48.220> basically<00:02:48.640> it<00:02:48.760> has<00:02:48.880> three

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
analog hookup so basically it has three

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.560 
analog hookup so basically it has three
inputs<00:02:49.390> two<00:02:49.900> digital<00:02:50.320> one<00:02:50.890> analog<00:02:51.370> so<00:02:52.330> you<00:02:52.420> can

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
inputs two digital one analog so you can

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.920 
inputs two digital one analog so you can
take<00:02:52.959> three<00:02:53.470> signals<00:02:53.890> into<00:02:54.220> it<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:55.720> does

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
take three signals into it and it does

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.870 
take three signals into it and it does
have<00:02:56.140> its<00:02:56.290> own<00:02:56.410> surround<00:02:56.830> sound<00:02:57.160> processor

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
have its own surround sound processor

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.560 
have its own surround sound processor
built<00:02:58.420> into<00:02:58.840> it<00:03:00.330> takes<00:03:01.330> Toby<00:03:01.750> Dolby<00:03:02.709> Digital

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
built into it takes Toby Dolby Digital

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.240 
built into it takes Toby Dolby Digital
DTS<00:03:04.570> and<00:03:05.310> then<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.370> PCM<00:03:07.830> it's<00:03:08.830> got<00:03:08.980> its<00:03:09.130> own

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
DTS and then the PCM it's got its own

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.210 
DTS and then the PCM it's got its own
remote<00:03:09.640> little<00:03:09.880> remote<00:03:10.299> here<00:03:11.130> control<00:03:12.130> the

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
remote little remote here control the

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.710 
remote little remote here control the
volume<00:03:12.700> of<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:12.850> surround<00:03:13.209> sound<00:03:13.360> effect<00:03:15.720> so

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
volume of the surround sound effect so

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.340 
volume of the surround sound effect so
you<00:03:16.780> can<00:03:16.930> see<00:03:17.110> that<00:03:18.780> so<00:03:19.780> that's<00:03:19.989> pretty<00:03:20.170> much

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
you can see that so that's pretty much

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.120 
you can see that so that's pretty much
the<00:03:20.560> whole<00:03:20.590> thing<00:03:20.769> here<00:03:21.340> I<00:03:22.260> said<00:03:23.260> it's<00:03:23.410> got<00:03:23.560> you

know - it does have which is kind of a
pain<00:03:27.459> you<00:03:27.940> know<00:03:28.060> three<00:03:28.420> different<00:03:28.540> power

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
pain you know three different power

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.720 
pain you know three different power
cords<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.470> subwoofer<00:03:29.950> has<00:03:30.100> its<00:03:30.280> own<00:03:30.430> power

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
cords the subwoofer has its own power

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.120 
cords the subwoofer has its own power
cord<00:03:31.090> on<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.299> back<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:31.930> then<00:03:32.799> it's<00:03:32.950> got<00:03:33.070> a

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
cord on the back and then it's got a

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.680 
cord on the back and then it's got a
power<00:03:33.430> cord<00:03:34.170> for<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.910> receiver<00:03:36.910> here<00:03:37.299> and

power cord for the receiver here and
then<00:03:38.680> one<00:03:38.920> for<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.280> sound<00:03:39.610> bar<00:03:39.850> itself<00:03:41.549> so

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
then one for the sound bar itself so

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.130 
then one for the sound bar itself so
we'll<00:03:42.760> see<00:03:43.000> how<00:03:43.150> it<00:03:43.299> works<00:03:43.450> out<00:03:43.720> it's<00:03:43.930> supposed

we'll see how it works out it's supposed

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.190 
we'll see how it works out it's supposed
to<00:03:44.230> decrease<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.769> wiring<00:03:45.250> a<00:03:45.400> little<00:03:45.730> bit

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
to decrease the wiring a little bit

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.720 
to decrease the wiring a little bit
there<00:03:47.200> is<00:03:47.230> still<00:03:47.590> some<00:03:47.769> line<00:03:47.980> that<00:03:48.340> needs<00:03:48.489> to

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
there is still some line that needs to

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:55.110 
there is still some line that needs to
be<00:03:48.760> done<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:52.060> know<00:03:52.470> so<00:03:53.470> what<00:03:53.620> I<00:03:53.650> do<00:03:53.970> part<00:03:54.970> of
