underneath<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.290> steering<00:02:19.470> wheel<00:02:19.709> there's<00:02:20.640> a

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
underneath the steering wheel there's a

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.210 
underneath the steering wheel there's a
ribbon<00:02:21.000> style<00:02:21.329> cable<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:21.930> they<00:02:22.049> use<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:23.190> how

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
ribbon style cable that they use and how

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.120 
ribbon style cable that they use and how
this<00:02:24.060> works<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:25.320> they<00:02:25.410> take<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.650> ribbon<00:02:25.890> style

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
this works that they take a ribbon style

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.550 
this works that they take a ribbon style
cable<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.820> they<00:02:27.600> wrap<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:27.870> tight<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.470> then

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
cable and they wrap it tight and then

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.190 
cable and they wrap it tight and then
they<00:02:28.769> loosen<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.459> Center<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.090> then<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:31.109> a

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
they loosen it to Center and then in a

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
they loosen it to Center and then in a
relaxed<00:02:31.650> position<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:33.450> they<00:02:33.570> install<00:02:33.900> that

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
relaxed position and they install that

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.670 
relaxed position and they install that
steering<00:02:35.220> wheel<00:02:35.370> straight<00:02:35.730> ahead<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:37.170> the

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
add a problem with this since they just

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.110 
add a problem with this since they just
give<00:02:52.829> you<00:02:52.859> enough<00:02:53.100> room<00:02:53.400> because<00:02:53.940> there's

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
give you enough room because there's

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.719 
give you enough room because there's

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
allow for so much ribbon cable that if

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.870 
allow for so much ribbon cable that if
you<00:03:00.750> were<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.989> get<00:03:01.139> this

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
you were to get this

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.270 
you were to get this
this<00:03:02.880> clock<00:03:03.120> sprang<00:03:03.540> off<00:03:03.780> one<00:03:04.709> turn<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.190> the

this clock sprang off one turn to the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.000 
this clock sprang off one turn to the
right<00:03:05.489> let's<00:03:05.849> say<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:07.080> you<00:03:07.200> reinstall<00:03:07.950> your

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
right let's say and you reinstall your

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.690 
right let's say and you reinstall your
steering<00:03:08.670> knuckle<00:03:09.470> when<00:03:10.470> you<00:03:10.620> get<00:03:11.459> everything

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
steering knuckle when you get everything

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.430 
steering knuckle when you get everything
buttoned<00:03:12.090> up<00:03:12.360> and<00:03:12.569> you<00:03:12.900> turn<00:03:13.080> your<00:03:13.260> steering

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
buttoned up and you turn your steering

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.740 
buttoned up and you turn your steering
wheel<00:03:13.590> always<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:14.130> stop<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:14.700> right<00:03:14.940> it'll

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
wheel always to stop to the right it'll

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.910 
wheel always to stop to the right it'll
never<00:03:15.959> make<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.530> cable<00:03:16.739> have<00:03:17.220> enough<00:03:17.750> play

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
never make the cable have enough play

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.860 
never make the cable have enough play
will<00:03:19.920> have<00:03:19.950> enough<00:03:20.280> travel<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:21.480> make<00:03:21.630> that

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
will have enough travel to make that

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.820 
will have enough travel to make that
revolution<00:03:22.050> to<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.680> right<00:03:22.980> you<00:03:23.880> will

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
revolution to the right you will

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.170 
revolution to the right you will
eventually<00:03:25.830> run<00:03:26.010> out<00:03:26.040> of<00:03:26.160> cable<00:03:26.640> and<00:03:26.819> it's<00:03:27.030> so

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
eventually run out of cable and it's so

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.900 
eventually run out of cable and it's so
brittle<00:03:27.420> it'll<00:03:28.050> snap

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
brittle it'll snap

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.720 
brittle it'll snap
so<00:03:29.910> it's<00:03:30.060> very<00:03:30.120> important<00:03:31.250> not<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.280> move

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
so it's very important not to move

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.500 
so it's very important not to move

turn<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.799> wheel<00:03:59.090> all<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.150> way<00:04:00.390> let's<00:04:01.019> say<00:04:01.200> to

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
turn the wheel all the way let's say to

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.789 
turn the wheel all the way let's say to
the<00:04:01.500> right<00:04:02.930> turn<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:04.080> to<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.260> right<00:04:04.290> until<00:04:04.620> you

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
the right turn it to the right until you

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.910 
the right turn it to the right until you
start<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.430> feel<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:06.150> ribbon<00:04:06.480> cable<00:04:06.870> get<00:04:07.620> tight

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
start to feel the ribbon cable get tight

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.560 
start to feel the ribbon cable get tight
and<00:04:08.630> stop<00:04:10.310> then<00:04:11.310> count<00:04:11.640> the<00:04:11.760> turns<00:04:12.060> all<00:04:12.510> the

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
and stop then count the turns all the

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.140 
and stop then count the turns all the
way<00:04:12.780> back<00:04:13.049> to<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.380> left<00:04:13.760> so<00:04:14.760> you<00:04:14.790> start

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
way back to the left so you start

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.599 
way back to the left so you start
feeling<00:04:15.329> resistance<00:04:15.780> I<00:04:16.229> usually<00:04:17.190> find<00:04:17.400> it's

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
feeling resistance I usually find it's

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.300 
feeling resistance I usually find it's
right<00:04:17.820> around<00:04:18.030> 5<00:04:18.299> turns<00:04:18.799> then<00:04:19.799> you<00:04:19.890> split<00:04:20.130> the

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
right around 5 turns then you split the

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.870 
right around 5 turns then you split the
difference

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
difference

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.820 
difference
go<00:04:21.209> two<00:04:21.269> and<00:04:21.660> a<00:04:21.690> half<00:04:21.870> turns<00:04:22.109> back<00:04:22.500> to<00:04:22.710> the

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
go two and a half turns back to the

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.850 
go two and a half turns back to the
right<00:04:23.070> that<00:04:24.030> should<00:04:24.270> be<00:04:24.330> your<00:04:24.539> Center<00:04:24.900> and

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
right that should be your Center and

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.130 
right that should be your Center and
then<00:04:26.100> reinstall<00:04:26.370> your<00:04:26.640> number<00:04:27.060> now<00:04:27.690> that's

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
then reinstall your number now that's
