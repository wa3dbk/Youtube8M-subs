never want to do that
now<00:02:15.760> some<00:02:16.060> strollers<00:02:16.510> not<00:02:16.780> very<00:02:17.140> many<00:02:17.380> of<00:02:17.470> them

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
now some strollers not very many of them

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.110 
now some strollers not very many of them
these<00:02:17.830> umbrella<00:02:18.160> strollers<00:02:18.490> come<00:02:18.760> with<00:02:18.940> some

these umbrella strollers come with some

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.550 
these umbrella strollers come with some
sort<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.330> storage<00:02:19.720> mechanism<00:02:20.319> underneath

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
sort of storage mechanism underneath

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.589 
sort of storage mechanism underneath
that<00:02:20.890> gives<00:02:21.099> a<00:02:21.160> low<00:02:21.310> center<00:02:21.610> of<00:02:21.640> gravity<00:02:21.730> it's

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
that gives a low center of gravity it's

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.600 
that gives a low center of gravity it's
within<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.620> base<00:02:23.830> of<00:02:24.040> support<00:02:24.160> and

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
within the the base of support and

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.100 
within the the base of support and
therefore<00:02:25.090> keeps<00:02:25.360> it<00:02:25.510> from<00:02:25.660> tipping<00:02:25.990> over

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
therefore keeps it from tipping over

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.480 
therefore keeps it from tipping over
there's<00:02:26.410> a<00:02:26.470> little<00:02:26.680> harder<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.010> find<00:02:27.040> but

there's a little harder to find but

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.460 
there's a little harder to find but
worth<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:27.790> if<00:02:27.910> you<00:02:28.000> planning<00:02:28.300> on<00:02:28.420> storing<00:02:29.349> some

that the front wheels turn alot so it

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.970
