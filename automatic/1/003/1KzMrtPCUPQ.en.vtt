to<00:01:49.710> be<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.009> least<00:01:50.450> heavily<00:01:51.450> pigmented<00:01:51.930> so

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
to be the least heavily pigmented so

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.370 
to be the least heavily pigmented so
while<00:01:53.369> these<00:01:53.579> colors<00:01:54.000> look<00:01:54.119> fairly<00:01:54.840> dark<00:01:55.140> on

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
while these colors look fairly dark on

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.950 
while these colors look fairly dark on
here<00:01:55.740> it's<00:01:56.189> pretty<00:01:56.640> hard<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.119> get<00:01:57.479> them<00:01:57.750> to

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
here it's pretty hard to get them to

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.039 
here it's pretty hard to get them to
come<00:01:58.140> out<00:01:58.290> really<00:01:59.100> dark<00:01:59.579> on<00:01:59.880> your<00:02:00.509> eyelid<00:02:00.899> so

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
come out really dark on your eyelid so

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.040 
come out really dark on your eyelid so
if<00:02:01.170> you're<00:02:01.350> looking<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.890> do<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.729> dark<00:02:03.299> or

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
palette so you could actually get some

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.449 
palette so you could actually get some
depth<00:03:09.959> of<00:03:10.110> color<00:03:10.350> you<00:03:10.590> could<00:03:10.770> do<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:10.950> smoky<00:03:11.430> eye

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
depth of color you could do a smoky eye

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.370 
depth of color you could do a smoky eye
with<00:03:11.550> these<00:03:11.910> there's<00:03:12.450> nothing<00:03:12.750> really<00:03:12.930> dark

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
with these there's nothing really dark

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.080 
with these there's nothing really dark
dark<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:13.980> know<00:03:14.100> like<00:03:14.340> a<00:03:14.370> black<00:03:14.760> or<00:03:14.790> anything

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
dark you know like a black or anything

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.670 
dark you know like a black or anything
but<00:03:15.300> this<00:03:15.510> would<00:03:15.690> be<00:03:15.780> good<00:03:15.930> for<00:03:15.989> creating<00:03:16.350> a

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
but this would be good for creating a

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.530 
but this would be good for creating a
nice<00:03:17.130> subtle<00:03:17.489> Dayla<00:03:17.940> but<00:03:18.150> they<00:03:18.239> don't<00:03:18.390> really

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
nice subtle Dayla but they don't really

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.540 
nice subtle Dayla but they don't really
have<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:19.050> lot<00:03:19.200> of<00:03:19.260> fall<00:03:19.650> out<00:03:19.680> there<00:03:20.160> they're

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
have a lot of fall out there they're

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.210 
have a lot of fall out there they're
very<00:03:20.910> um<00:03:21.239> silky<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:21.870> creamy<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:23.070> I<00:03:23.100> think

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
very um silky and creamy and so I think

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.920 
very um silky and creamy and so I think
for<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:23.640> money<00:03:23.850> this<00:03:24.120> is<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.330> nice<00:03:24.540> palette<00:03:24.900> I

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
I saw on YouTube someone else reviewed

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.509 
I saw on YouTube someone else reviewed
this<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:00.750> they<00:04:01.110> had<00:04:01.470> one<00:04:01.920> that<00:04:02.160> was<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.370> little

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
this and they had one that was a little

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.670 
this and they had one that was a little
bit<00:04:02.910> thicker<00:04:03.239> and<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.900> had<00:04:04.050> sort<00:04:04.200> of<00:04:04.320> a<00:04:04.410> pull

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
bit thicker and it had sort of a pull

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.140 
bit thicker and it had sort of a pull
out<00:04:04.709> part<00:04:05.190> that<00:04:05.459> actually<00:04:05.970> had<00:04:06.120> the

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
out part that actually had the

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.180 
out part that actually had the
instructions<00:04:06.750> in<00:04:06.900> it<00:04:07.050> mine<00:04:07.709> doesn't

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
instructions in it mine doesn't

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.500 
instructions in it mine doesn't
I<00:04:08.220> think<00:04:08.519> they've<00:04:08.700> changed<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:09.300> packaging

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
I think they've changed the packaging

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.680 
I think they've changed the packaging
gotten<00:04:10.320> rid<00:04:10.500> of<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:10.709> instructions<00:04:11.420> but<00:04:12.420> they

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
gotten rid of the instructions but they

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.330 
gotten rid of the instructions but they
didn't<00:04:13.140> change<00:04:13.350> their<00:04:13.590> sticker<00:04:13.890> on<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.220> back

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
didn't change their sticker on the back

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.490 
didn't change their sticker on the back
which<00:04:14.610> they<00:04:14.790> probably<00:04:15.000> should<00:04:15.390> but<00:04:16.020> anyway

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
which they probably should but anyway

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.310 
which they probably should but anyway
when<00:04:16.799> I<00:04:16.830> for

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320

when I for
got<00:04:17.530> this<00:04:17.770> I<00:04:18.010> was<00:04:18.310> really<00:04:18.340> excited<00:04:18.940> about<00:04:19.270> the

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
got this I was really excited about the

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.390 
got this I was really excited about the
colors<00:04:19.690> then<00:04:20.440> when<00:04:20.650> I<00:04:20.680> got<00:04:20.890> at<00:04:21.040> home<00:04:21.190> and

colors then when I got at home and
started<00:04:21.670> working<00:04:21.970> with<00:04:22.090> it<00:04:22.150> I<00:04:22.480> could<00:04:22.990> not

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
started working with it I could not

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.640 
started working with it I could not
figure<00:04:23.320> out<00:04:23.440> what<00:04:23.590> to<00:04:23.710> do<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:23.980> colors<00:04:24.430> are<00:04:24.670> so

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
figure out what to do the colors are so

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.890 
figure out what to do the colors are so
on<00:04:26.650> the<00:04:27.370> peachy<00:04:28.240> fawni<00:04:29.140> warm<00:04:29.890> brown<00:04:30.520> side<00:04:30.970> that

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
on the peachy fawni warm brown side that

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.960 
on the peachy fawni warm brown side that
it's<00:04:32.410> hard<00:04:32.740> for<00:04:33.040> me<00:04:33.340> to<00:04:33.580> wear<00:04:33.700> them<00:04:33.850> because

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
it's hard for me to wear them because

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.270 
it's hard for me to wear them because
like<00:04:34.270> I<00:04:34.360> said<00:04:34.570> before<00:04:34.690> I<00:04:34.900> don't<00:04:35.080> really<00:04:35.740> go<00:04:35.980> for

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
like I said before I don't really go for

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.850 
like I said before I don't really go for
the<00:04:36.490> warm<00:04:36.820> Browns<00:04:37.570> I<00:04:37.810> go<00:04:37.930> for<00:04:38.140> the<00:04:38.230> cool<00:04:38.560> Browns

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
the warm Browns I go for the cool Browns

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.890 
the warm Browns I go for the cool Browns
I<00:04:39.040> just<00:04:39.220> feel<00:04:39.370> like<00:04:39.490> they<00:04:39.700> look<00:04:40.300> better<00:04:40.570> on<00:04:40.660> my

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
I just feel like they look better on my

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.870 
I just feel like they look better on my
skintone<00:04:41.350> but<00:04:41.590> if<00:04:41.980> they<00:04:42.100> work<00:04:42.250> for<00:04:42.280> you<00:04:42.520> this

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
skintone but if they work for you this

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.730 
skintone but if they work for you this
could<00:04:43.060> be<00:04:43.180> a<00:04:43.210> great<00:04:43.360> palette<00:04:43.780> I<00:04:43.930> actually<00:04:44.350> just

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
could be a great palette I actually just

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.600 
could be a great palette I actually just
did<00:04:45.010> a<00:04:45.280> doe<00:04:45.730> eye<00:04:46.950> tutorial<00:04:47.950> using<00:04:48.490> this

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
did a doe eye tutorial using this

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.640 
did a doe eye tutorial using this
palette<00:04:48.880> and<00:04:49.210> it's<00:04:49.510> really<00:04:49.900> great<00:04:50.080> for<00:04:50.170> that<00:04:50.470> I

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
palette and it's really great for that I

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.830 
palette and it's really great for that I
had<00:04:50.770> been<00:04:50.950> looking<00:04:51.190> for<00:04:51.550> a<00:04:51.820> really<00:04:52.630> warm

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
had been looking for a really warm

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.780 
had been looking for a really warm
peachy<00:04:53.350> color<00:04:53.560> for<00:04:53.860> quite<00:04:54.070> a<00:04:54.100> while<00:04:54.340> and<00:04:54.700> I

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
peachy color for quite a while and I

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.760 
peachy color for quite a while and I
finally<00:04:55.180> found<00:04:55.450> it<00:04:55.630> in<00:04:55.780> this<00:04:56.080> palette<00:04:56.500> trying

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
finally found it in this palette trying

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.080 
finally found it in this palette trying
to<00:04:56.860> come<00:04:57.010> up<00:04:57.040> with<00:04:57.100> combinations<00:04:57.820> of<00:04:57.940> these

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
to come up with combinations of these

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.730 
to come up with combinations of these
I've<00:04:58.360> had<00:04:58.600> a<00:04:58.630> hard<00:04:58.900> time<00:04:59.020> with<00:04:59.410> in<00:04:59.650> the

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
I've had a hard time with in the

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.830 
I've had a hard time with in the
beginning<00:05:00.220> but<00:05:00.820> now<00:05:01.000> that<00:05:01.210> I've<00:05:01.330> used<00:05:01.570> it<00:05:01.750> a

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
beginning but now that I've used it a

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.810 
beginning but now that I've used it a
number<00:05:01.870> of<00:05:02.170> times<00:05:02.410> I<00:05:02.680> love<00:05:03.070> this<00:05:03.280> palette<00:05:03.490> now

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
number of times I love this palette now

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.240 
number of times I love this palette now
these<00:05:03.970> are<00:05:04.210> very<00:05:04.270> highly<00:05:05.230> pigmented<00:05:05.710> colors

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
these are very highly pigmented colors

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.280 
these are very highly pigmented colors
so<00:05:06.430> you<00:05:06.490> can<00:05:06.580> do<00:05:07.000> a<00:05:07.030> lot<00:05:07.330> with<00:05:07.540> them<00:05:07.720> but<00:05:08.140> they

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
so you can do a lot with them but they

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.650 
so you can do a lot with them but they
go<00:05:08.500> on<00:05:08.710> really<00:05:08.980> smooth<00:05:09.490> and<00:05:09.850> sheer<00:05:10.240> so<00:05:10.540> that

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
go on really smooth and sheer so that

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.900 
go on really smooth and sheer so that
you<00:05:10.750> can<00:05:10.930> build<00:05:11.230> it<00:05:11.410> up<00:05:11.470> to<00:05:11.530> the<00:05:11.710> pigment<00:05:12.070> and<00:05:12.250> I

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
you can build it up to the pigment and I

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.610
