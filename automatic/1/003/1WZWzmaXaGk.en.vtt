here we'll fix this house in here or
make<00:03:46.690> the<00:03:46.840> hole<00:03:47.019> smaller<00:03:47.409> and<00:03:48.220> then

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
make the hole smaller and then

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.059 
make the hole smaller and then
manufacture<00:03:49.720> that<00:03:49.870> shaft<00:03:50.170> also<00:03:50.470> with<00:03:50.980> the

and<00:03:53.170> while<00:03:53.859> we're<00:03:54.069> at<00:03:54.160> it<00:03:54.220> like<00:03:54.489> I<00:03:54.579> said<00:03:54.790> the

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
and while we're at it like I said the

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.250 
and while we're at it like I said the
tractor<00:03:55.269> will<00:03:55.450> right<00:03:55.599> here<00:03:55.629> looking<00:03:56.170> the

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
tractor will right here looking the

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.940 
tractor will right here looking the
tractor<00:03:56.680> is<00:03:56.890> seized<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.609> way<00:03:57.760> it<00:03:57.910> sets<00:03:58.180> and

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
tractor is seized the way it sets and

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.170 
tractor is seized the way it sets and
there's<00:03:59.950> someone<00:04:00.129> a<00:04:00.220> block<00:04:00.459> you're<00:04:00.700> done<00:04:01.030> and

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
there's someone a block you're done and

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.180 
there's someone a block you're done and
it's<00:04:01.269> got<00:04:01.540> quite<00:04:01.959> a<00:04:02.079> significant<00:04:02.739> extra

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
it's got quite a significant extra

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.970 
it's got quite a significant extra
practice<00:04:03.819> yes<00:04:07.290> that<00:04:08.290> should<00:04:08.470> be<00:04:08.590> able<00:04:08.799> to<00:04:08.859> be

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
practice yes that should be able to be

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.420 
practice yes that should be able to be
heated<00:04:09.370> push<00:04:09.700> back<00:04:10.030> beat<00:04:10.959> out<00:04:11.280> welded<00:04:12.280> and

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
heated push back beat out welded and

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.550 
heated push back beat out welded and
then<00:04:12.879> we<00:04:13.030> can<00:04:13.209> put<00:04:13.420> this<00:04:13.599> texture<00:04:14.019> back<00:04:14.200> in<00:04:14.440> it

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
then we can put this texture back in it

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.590 
then we can put this texture back in it
so<00:04:14.739> it<00:04:14.859> can't<00:04:15.099> be<00:04:15.190> seen<00:04:15.909> where<00:04:16.090> there's<00:04:16.239> repair

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
so it can't be seen where there's repair

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.259 
so it can't be seen where there's repair
it<00:04:16.750> structurally<00:04:18.239> yes<00:04:19.239> good

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
it structurally yes good

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.600 
it structurally yes good
yes<00:04:21.139> and<00:04:21.440> mainly<00:04:21.769> it<00:04:21.889> probably<00:04:22.280> does<00:04:22.430> not

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
yes and mainly it probably does not

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.040 
yes and mainly it probably does not
leave<00:04:22.910> because<00:04:23.090> this<00:04:23.389> would<00:04:23.569> be<00:04:23.599> the<00:04:23.840> outside

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
leave because this would be the outside

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.839 
leave because this would be the outside
of<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:24.530> bowl<00:04:24.710> or<00:04:25.610> the<00:04:25.729> scuffle<00:04:26.240> and<00:04:26.919> but<00:04:27.919> it<00:04:28.729> is

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
of the bowl or the scuffle and but it is

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:35.650 
of the bowl or the scuffle and but it is
something<00:04:29.090> that<00:04:29.240> needs<00:04:29.389> to<00:04:29.599> be<00:04:34.539> and<00:04:35.539> then

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
something that needs to be and then

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.900 
something that needs to be and then
we'll<00:04:35.810> just<00:04:35.960> have<00:04:36.050> to<00:04:36.229> see<00:04:36.500> once<00:04:36.740> it<00:04:36.889> gets<00:04:37.130> what

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
we'll just have to see once it gets what

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.270 
we'll just have to see once it gets what
you<00:04:38.030> get<00:04:38.180> it<00:04:38.270> apart<00:04:38.569> to<00:04:38.900> see<00:04:38.930> what<00:04:39.410> is<00:04:39.560> froze<00:04:40.009> up

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
you get it apart to see what is froze up

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.559 
you get it apart to see what is froze up
on<00:04:40.460> it<00:04:41.289> be<00:04:42.289> able<00:04:42.530> to<00:04:42.710> fix<00:04:43.190> the<00:04:43.340> cylinder<00:04:43.849> inside

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:44.569 
on it be able to fix the cylinder inside

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:57.870 
on it be able to fix the cylinder inside
also

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.879 

I<00:05:00.190> did<00:05:01.190> manage<00:05:01.400> to<00:05:01.520> find<00:05:01.639> a<00:05:02.360> replacement

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
I did manage to find a replacement

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.420 
I did manage to find a replacement
top<00:05:04.039> tank<00:05:04.370> and<00:05:05.319> it's<00:05:06.319> got<00:05:06.770> quite<00:05:06.949> a<00:05:07.069> little<00:05:07.280> bit

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
top tank and it's got quite a little bit

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:20.559 
top tank and it's got quite a little bit
of<00:05:08.470> surface<00:05:09.470> to<00:05:09.800> determine<00:05:10.900> yes<00:05:19.180> no<00:05:20.180> we<00:05:20.419> can

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:20.569 
of surface to determine yes no we can

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:22.930 
of surface to determine yes no we can
bet<00:05:20.810> we<00:05:21.020> can<00:05:21.169> fill<00:05:21.409> in<00:05:21.590> the<00:05:21.740> rust<00:05:21.949> spots<00:05:22.580> here

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
bet we can fill in the rust spots here

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.969 
bet we can fill in the rust spots here
that's<00:05:23.569> where<00:05:23.750> it's<00:05:23.870> rusted<00:05:24.289> in<00:05:24.440> and<00:05:24.680> then<00:05:24.830> we

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
that's where it's rusted in and then we

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.909 
that's where it's rusted in and then we
can<00:05:25.009> resurface<00:05:25.520> all<00:05:25.909> of<00:05:26.060> this<00:05:26.210> and<00:05:26.539> make<00:05:27.110> it<00:05:27.320> so

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
can resurface all of this and make it so

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.790 
can resurface all of this and make it so
it<00:05:28.070> will<00:05:28.219> seal<00:05:28.490> properly<00:05:28.960> right<00:05:29.960> yep<00:05:30.530> not<00:05:30.740> a

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
it will seal properly right yep not a

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.589 
it will seal properly right yep not a
problem<00:05:30.860> silicones<00:05:31.759> not<00:05:32.030> the<00:05:32.210> answer's<00:05:32.659> no<00:05:33.430> no

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
problem silicones not the answer's no no

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:40.659 
problem silicones not the answer's no no
no<00:05:35.599> we're<00:05:36.229> at<00:05:36.349> the<00:05:36.620> bottom<00:05:39.039> we<00:05:40.039> may<00:05:40.219> run<00:05:40.400> into

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
the same thing which is good we can fill

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.499 
the same thing which is good we can fill
it<00:05:44.389> and<00:05:44.479> resurface<00:05:45.020> it<00:05:45.199> okay<00:05:46.090> and<00:05:47.090> back<00:05:47.270> to

00:05:59.709 --> 00:05:59.719 
machine fit there as well when we didn't

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:01.749
