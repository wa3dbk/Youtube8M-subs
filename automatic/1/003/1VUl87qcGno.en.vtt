competing with other vegetation is just

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.910 
competing with other vegetation is just
simply<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.649> overuse<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.460> water<00:00:41.719> then<00:00:42.920> because

the riparian area here behind the dam

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.090 
the riparian area here behind the dam
looked<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.300> at<00:00:54.480> one<00:00:54.600> time<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.680> can

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
looked like this at one time and you can

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.709 
looked like this at one time and you can
see<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.489> virtually<00:00:57.030> takes<00:00:57.270> over<00:00:57.600> the

see that it virtually takes over the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.990 
see that it virtually takes over the

take a look at this mesquite tree for

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.459 
take a look at this mesquite tree for
example<00:02:01.360> when<00:02:02.360> we<00:02:02.479> visited<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:02.960> first<00:02:03.170> time

example when we visited the first time

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.469 
example when we visited the first time
it<00:02:03.679> was<00:02:03.829> engulfed<00:02:04.280> by<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:04.520> tall<00:02:04.880> green<00:02:05.179> grass

birding the birds don't use the arundel
it<00:03:55.310> has<00:03:55.430> no<00:03:55.609> horizontal<00:03:55.849> structure<00:03:56.630> so<00:03:56.840> they

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
it has no horizontal structure so they

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.690 
it has no horizontal structure so they
don't<00:03:57.109> even<00:03:57.200> make<00:03:57.410> nests<00:03:57.680> in<00:03:57.919> it<00:03:58.040> nothing<00:03:58.190> eats

it they don't even eat the seeds so the
