stop<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.009> from<00:01:47.159> happening<00:01:47.240> and<00:01:48.240> also

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
stop that from happening and also

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.420 
stop that from happening and also
there's<00:01:48.899> many<00:01:48.990> cards<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.619> when<00:01:50.159> they<00:01:50.310> are

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
there's many cards that when they are

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.980 
there's many cards that when they are
normal<00:01:50.790> summoned<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.180> can<00:01:51.329> special<00:01:51.659> summon<00:01:51.689> a

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990

2<00:01:55.200> will<00:01:55.590> stop<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.280> that's<00:01:56.490> why<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.640> have

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
2 will stop that so that's why I have

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.950 
2 will stop that so that's why I have
that<00:01:57.030> at<00:01:57.210> number<00:01:57.630> 9<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:58.439> my<00:01:58.890> top<00:01:59.100> 10<00:01:59.960> counter

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.440 
that at number 9 in my top 10 counter
trap<00:02:01.200> cards<00:02:01.530> then<00:02:01.710> moving<00:02:02.189> on<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.640> number<00:02:02.880> 8<00:02:03.149> is

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
trap cards then moving on to number 8 is

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.959 
trap cards then moving on to number 8 is
a<00:02:03.719> card<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.259> think<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.920> really<00:02:05.759> really

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
a card that I think is really really

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.690 
a card that I think is really really
underused<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.890> could<00:02:07.890> be<00:02:08.009> really<00:02:08.399> good<00:02:08.580> to

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
underused and could be really good to

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.029 
underused and could be really good to
use<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.390> new<00:02:09.629> format<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.289> negates<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
use in this new format it negates the

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.190 
use in this new format it negates the
activation<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.640> effect<00:02:12.000> monster<00:02:12.420> that

you<00:02:20.489> can<00:02:20.670> use<00:02:20.879> the<00:02:21.090> bunk<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.569> stop<00:02:21.870> that

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
you can use the bunk to stop that

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.220 
you can use the bunk to stop that
activation<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:23.099> stop<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:24.330> effect<00:02:24.629> of<00:02:24.780> maxi

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
cause that when are when I was sent to

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.500 
cause that when are when I was sent to
the<00:02:30.989> graveyard<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:32.610> know<00:02:32.760> there<00:02:33.030> special

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
the graveyard and you know there special

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.720 
the graveyard and you know there special
summoned<00:02:33.840> or<00:02:34.080> have<00:02:34.739> some<00:02:34.980> sort<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.280> effect<00:02:35.640> you

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
summoned or have some sort of effect you

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.030 
summoned or have some sort of effect you
can<00:02:35.940> use<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.300> bunk<00:02:36.510> once<00:02:36.840> again<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.620> stop<00:02:37.890> that

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
can use the bunk once again to stop that

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.910 
can use the bunk once again to stop that
activation<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.360> banish<00:02:39.720> that<00:02:39.750> card<00:02:40.200> so<00:02:40.470> this

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
activation and banish that card so this

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.890 
activation and banish that card so this
card<00:02:41.220> is<00:02:41.459> probably<00:02:41.790> really<00:02:42.120> underused<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:42.810> I

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
card is probably really underused and I

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.390 
card is probably really underused and I
think<00:02:43.200> maybe<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:43.620> should<00:02:43.680> have<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.069> higher<00:02:44.220> in

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
think maybe I should have it higher in

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.390 
think maybe I should have it higher in
my<00:02:44.519> top<00:02:44.730> 10<00:02:45.000> but<00:02:45.209> I<00:02:45.900> think<00:02:46.319> people<00:02:46.830> especially

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
my top 10 but I think people especially

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.160 
my top 10 but I think people especially
in<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.670> new<00:02:47.849> format<00:02:48.120> should<00:02:48.510> use<00:02:48.750> this<00:02:48.870> card<00:02:49.110> a

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
in the new format should use this card a

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.380 
in the new format should use this card a
lot<00:02:49.319> more<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:50.160> then<00:02:50.310> moving<00:02:50.459> on<00:02:50.730> we've<00:02:50.880> got<00:02:51.090> 10

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
lot more so then moving on we've got 10

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.460 
lot more so then moving on we've got 10
9<00:02:51.630> 8<00:02:51.930> number<00:02:52.829> 7<00:02:53.190> we<00:02:53.430> have<00:02:53.640> infernity<00:02:54.480> barrier

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
9 8 number 7 we have infernity barrier

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.009 
9 8 number 7 we have infernity barrier
now<00:02:55.769> obviously<00:02:56.519> in<00:02:56.849> an<00:02:56.940> affinity<00:02:57.360> deck<00:02:57.810> when

no cards in your hand be really wary of

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.430 
no cards in your hand be really wary of
his<00:03:20.549> back<00:03:20.790> row<00:03:21.060> because<00:03:21.840> he's<00:03:22.049> more<00:03:22.319> than

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
his back row because he's more than

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.440 
his back row because he's more than
likely<00:03:22.500> gonna<00:03:22.980> have<00:03:23.190> an<00:03:23.400> infernity<00:03:23.940> barrier

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
likely gonna have an infernity barrier

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.740 
likely gonna have an infernity barrier
in<00:03:25.440> his<00:03:25.590> back<00:03:25.799> row<00:03:26.010> so<00:03:26.299> it's<00:03:27.299> a<00:03:27.389> really

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
in his back row so it's a really

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.990 
in his back row so it's a really
annoying<00:03:27.989> car<00:03:28.319> to<00:03:28.440> come<00:03:28.590> up<00:03:28.709> against<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.220> it's

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
annoying car to come up against and it's

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.660
