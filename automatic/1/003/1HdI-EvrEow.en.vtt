00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
interior well if you flip with the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.350 
interior well if you flip with the
hybrids<00:01:03.440> ago<00:01:03.740> you<00:01:04.009> actually<00:01:04.430> get<00:01:04.610> recycled

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
hybrids ago you actually get recycled

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.390 
hybrids ago you actually get recycled
fabric<00:01:05.960> as<00:01:06.080> a<00:01:06.110> standard<00:01:06.590> so<00:01:06.979> it's<00:01:07.189> hundred

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
fabric as a standard so it's hundred

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.760 
fabric as a standard so it's hundred
percent<00:01:07.700> post-industrial<00:01:08.119> recycled<00:01:08.930> fabric

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
percent post-industrial recycled fabric

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.050 
percent post-industrial recycled fabric
but<00:01:10.220> obviously<00:01:10.340> you<00:01:10.700> can<00:01:10.820> get<00:01:10.940> all<00:01:11.030> the

about how we test these cars but with

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.759 
about how we test these cars but with
hybrids<00:02:54.480> because<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.900> engines<00:02:55.200> off<00:02:55.350> most<00:02:55.680> of

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
hybrids because the engines off most of

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.800 
hybrids because the engines off most of
the<00:02:55.830> time<00:02:56.070> you<00:02:56.580> like<00:02:56.880> your<00:02:57.060> typical<00:02:57.239> driving

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
the time you like your typical driving

cycle in city cycle over sixty percent

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.080 
cycle in city cycle over sixty percent
of<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.660> time<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.380> engines<00:03:01.620> off<00:03:01.800> so<00:03:02.430> your<00:03:02.940> oil

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
of the time the engines off so your oil

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.360 
of the time the engines off so your oil
change<00:03:03.480> intervals<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:03.989> up<00:03:04.079> now<00:03:04.350> moved<00:03:05.070> up<00:03:05.220> to

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
change intervals it up now moved up to

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.970 
change intervals it up now moved up to
10,000<00:03:06.030> miles<00:03:06.209> so<00:03:06.480> every<00:03:06.720> 10,000<00:03:07.680> miles<00:03:07.829> you

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
10,000 miles so every 10,000 miles you

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.860 
10,000 miles so every 10,000 miles you
change<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.400> oil<00:03:08.430> part<00:03:08.820> from<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.180> it's<00:03:09.720> all

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
change the oil part from that it's all

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.479 
change the oil part from that it's all
your<00:03:10.019> standard<00:03:10.530> maintenance<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:11.160> know<00:03:11.220> and

your standard maintenance you know and

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.100 
your standard maintenance you know and
the<00:03:11.790> other<00:03:11.880> thing<00:03:12.030> with<00:03:12.299> hybrids<00:03:12.720> are<00:03:12.810> because

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
the other thing with hybrids are because

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.680 
the other thing with hybrids are because
most<00:03:14.040> of<00:03:14.220> your<00:03:14.400> region<00:03:14.880> of<00:03:15.000> your<00:03:15.180> braking<00:03:15.570> is

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
most of your region of your braking is

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.150 
most of your region of your braking is
actually<00:03:16.019> coming<00:03:16.170> from<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:16.500> powertrain<00:03:16.769> in

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
actually coming from the powertrain in

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.580 
actually coming from the powertrain in
city<00:03:17.370> driving<00:03:17.459> you<00:03:18.450> use<00:03:18.690> your<00:03:18.870> friction<00:03:19.380> brake

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
city driving you use your friction brake

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.190 
city driving you use your friction brake
pads<00:03:19.829> very<00:03:20.310> little<00:03:20.790> so<00:03:21.299> you<00:03:21.390> can<00:03:21.570> extend<00:03:22.079> your

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
pads very little so you can extend your

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.710 
pads very little so you can extend your
brake<00:03:22.530> pad<00:03:22.769> life<00:03:23.040> by<00:03:23.670> significant<00:03:24.420> amount<00:03:24.630> of

brake pad life by significant amount of

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.509 
brake pad life by significant amount of
time<00:03:24.780> well<00:03:25.620> here's<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:26.010> question<00:03:26.190> that

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
time well here's the question that

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.880 
time well here's the question that
everybody's<00:03:27.209> been<00:03:27.390> asking<00:03:27.650> for<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.709> last

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
everybody's been asking for the last

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.520 
everybody's been asking for the last
three<00:03:29.130> or<00:03:29.160> four<00:03:29.280> years<00:03:29.579> since<00:03:30.360> they<00:03:30.600> gas

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
three or four years since they gas

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.009 
three or four years since they gas
crisis<00:03:32.130> earlier<00:03:32.670> this<00:03:33.060> year<00:03:33.120> or<00:03:33.570> last<00:03:33.630> year

crisis earlier this year or last year

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.789 
crisis earlier this year or last year
and<00:03:34.470> since<00:03:35.310> hybrids<00:03:36.239> really<00:03:36.810> hit<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.620> mass

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
and since hybrids really hit the mass

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
my while to go from a standard vehicle

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.620 
my while to go from a standard vehicle
to<00:03:46.920> it<00:03:47.040> well<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.280> mean<00:03:47.519> you<00:03:47.790> know<00:03:47.820> his<00:03:48.060> is<00:03:48.420> my

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
to it well I mean you know his is my

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.840 
to it well I mean you know his is my
rationale<00:03:49.170> right<00:03:49.380> with<00:03:49.680> for<00:03:50.250> three<00:03:50.430> thousand

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
rationale right with for three thousand

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.120 
rationale right with for three thousand
dollar<00:03:51.030> more<00:03:51.269> than<00:03:51.329> the<00:03:51.720> scl<00:03:52.170> up<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.769> level<00:03:53.070> of

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
dollar more than the scl up the level of

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.440 
dollar more than the scl up the level of
refinements<00:03:53.760> are<00:03:53.850> getting<00:03:54.120> from<00:03:54.269> this

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
refinements are getting from this

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.289 
refinements are getting from this
powertrain<00:03:54.890> far<00:03:55.890> exceeds<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.549> luxury<00:03:56.880> brands

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
powertrain far exceeds the luxury brands

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.360 
powertrain far exceeds the luxury brands
so<00:03:57.450> I<00:03:57.690> think<00:03:58.230> a<00:03:58.440> twenty-seven<00:03:59.010> thousand

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
so I think a twenty-seven thousand

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.040 
so I think a twenty-seven thousand
dollars<00:03:59.640> you're<00:04:00.120> getting<00:04:00.329> a<00:04:00.390> luxury

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
dollars you're getting a luxury

dollars you're getting a luxury

digg<00:05:28.830> naino<00:05:29.240> take<00:05:30.240> the<00:05:30.330> cost<00:05:30.510> down<00:05:30.780> I<00:05:31.080> get<00:05:31.410> the

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
digg naino take the cost down I get the

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.130 
digg naino take the cost down I get the
weight<00:05:31.650> down<00:05:31.890> and<00:05:32.240> higher<00:05:33.240> fuel<00:05:33.450> economy<00:05:33.810> more

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
weight down and higher fuel economy more

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.570 
weight down and higher fuel economy more
efficiency<00:05:34.560> at<00:05:34.680> the<00:05:34.770> end<00:05:34.890> yeah<00:05:35.010> exactly<00:05:35.220> and

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
efficiency at the end yeah exactly and

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.760 
efficiency at the end yeah exactly and
in<00:05:35.790> fact<00:05:36.000> since<00:05:36.510> the<00:05:36.600> 04<00:05:37.080> escape<00:05:37.530> that<00:05:37.650> was

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
in fact since the 04 escape that was

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.430 
in fact since the 04 escape that was
launched<00:05:38.160> you<00:05:38.430> know<00:05:38.520> with<00:05:38.669> the<00:05:39.030> hybrid<00:05:39.450> every

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
launched you know with the hybrid every

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.470 
launched you know with the hybrid every
year<00:05:40.470> the<00:05:41.310> team<00:05:41.490> has<00:05:41.669> done<00:05:41.820> a<00:05:41.880> wonderful<00:05:41.970> job

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480 
year the team has done a wonderful job

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.690 
year the team has done a wonderful job
in<00:05:42.720> taking<00:05:43.650> more<00:05:43.860> games<00:05:44.130> and<00:05:44.400> fuel<00:05:44.580> economy

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
in taking more games and fuel economy

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.970 
in taking more games and fuel economy
getting<00:05:45.210> more<00:05:45.450> efficiency<00:05:46.110> right<00:05:46.290> so<00:05:46.830> I<00:05:46.860> think

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
getting more efficiency right so I think

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.890 
getting more efficiency right so I think
we'll<00:05:47.340> see<00:05:47.640> more<00:05:47.669> efficiency<00:05:48.450> improvements

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
we'll see more efficiency improvements

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.320 
we'll see more efficiency improvements
in<00:05:48.990> the<00:05:49.080> overall<00:05:49.320> power<00:05:49.530> train<00:05:49.919> or<00:05:50.820> our<00:05:51.090> power

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
in the overall power train or our power

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.480 
in the overall power train or our power
back<00:05:51.540> weight<00:05:51.900> and<00:05:52.169> cost<00:05:52.320> reductions<00:05:52.950> these

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
back weight and cost reductions these

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.860 
back weight and cost reductions these
are<00:05:53.640> things<00:05:53.850> that<00:05:53.910> we're<00:05:54.150> looking<00:05:54.240> for<00:05:54.450> and

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
are things that we're looking for and

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.270 
are things that we're looking for and
we're<00:05:55.020> going<00:05:55.169> to<00:05:55.200> work<00:05:55.410> we<00:05:55.740> continue<00:05:56.070> to<00:05:56.100> work

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
we're going to work we continue to work

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.930 
we're going to work we continue to work
on<00:05:56.430> that

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
on that

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.890 
on that
what's<00:05:57.780> your<00:05:57.990> gut<00:05:58.200> is<00:05:58.530> it<00:05:58.970> the<00:05:59.970> hybrid<00:06:00.450> is<00:06:00.630> that

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
what's your gut is it the hybrid is that

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.190 
what's your gut is it the hybrid is that
the<00:06:01.050> future<00:06:01.440> is<00:06:01.680> it<00:06:02.010> I<00:06:02.220> see<00:06:02.610> we<00:06:02.940> have<00:06:03.200> hydrogen

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
the future is it I see we have hydrogen

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.650 
the future is it I see we have hydrogen
experimental<00:06:04.980> experimental<00:06:05.910> vehicle<00:06:06.420> over

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
experimental experimental vehicle over

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.010 
experimental experimental vehicle over
here<00:06:06.930> we've<00:06:07.560> heard<00:06:07.770> about<00:06:07.950> eco<00:06:08.820> fuels<00:06:09.150> what<00:06:09.780> is

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
here we've heard about eco fuels what is

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.050 
here we've heard about eco fuels what is
your<00:06:10.290> gut<00:06:10.560> where<00:06:10.830> is<00:06:11.100> the<00:06:11.250> world<00:06:11.430> I<00:06:11.610> think<00:06:11.880> they

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
your gut where is the world I think they

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.820 
your gut where is the world I think they
believe<00:06:12.570> that<00:06:12.600> there<00:06:12.870> is<00:06:12.900> a<00:06:13.020> there's<00:06:13.770> a

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
believe that there is a there's a

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.530 
believe that there is a there's a
portfolio<00:06:14.310> products<00:06:14.760> out<00:06:14.880> there<00:06:14.910> that<00:06:15.120> will

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540 
portfolio products out there that will

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.730 
portfolio products out there that will
meet<00:06:15.750> different<00:06:16.110> needs<00:06:16.260> or<00:06:16.530> different

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
meet different needs or different

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.760 
meet different needs or different
customers<00:06:17.190> so<00:06:17.760> I<00:06:18.060> it's<00:06:18.660> hard<00:06:18.720> to<00:06:18.900> say<00:06:19.080> that<00:06:19.110> the

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
customers so I it's hard to say that the

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.320 
customers so I it's hard to say that the
trend<00:06:20.040> is<00:06:20.100> towards<00:06:20.400> hybrids<00:06:20.850> or<00:06:21.000> full

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
trend is towards hybrids or full

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.270 
trend is towards hybrids or full
electrification<00:06:21.810> for<00:06:22.680> example<00:06:23.070> with<00:06:23.160> our

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
electrification for example with our

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.590 
electrification for example with our
EcoBoost<00:06:23.520> strategy<00:06:24.180> you<00:06:24.270> know<00:06:24.330> you're

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 
EcoBoost strategy you know you're

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.780 
EcoBoost strategy you know you're
getting<00:06:24.840> twenty<00:06:25.500> percent<00:06:25.830> more<00:06:26.070> fuel<00:06:26.340> economy

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:26.790 
getting twenty percent more fuel economy

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.870 
getting twenty percent more fuel economy
v8<00:06:27.780> like<00:06:28.020> performance<00:06:28.620> on<00:06:28.800> a<00:06:28.830> v6<00:06:29.340> engine<00:06:29.730> and

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
v8 like performance on a v6 engine and

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.460 
v8 like performance on a v6 engine and
yet<00:06:30.420> you<00:06:30.630> know<00:06:30.750> it's<00:06:30.870> more<00:06:31.050> cost-effective

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
yet you know it's more cost-effective

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.440 
yet you know it's more cost-effective
for<00:06:31.890> most<00:06:32.280> people<00:06:32.640> that<00:06:32.760> might<00:06:33.030> be<00:06:33.210> the<00:06:33.300> better

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.450 
for most people that might be the better

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.780 
for most people that might be the better
solution<00:06:34.050> so<00:06:34.470> it's<00:06:34.890> yet<00:06:35.130> to<00:06:35.160> be<00:06:35.250> seen<00:06:35.370> where

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:35.790 
solution so it's yet to be seen where

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.360 
solution so it's yet to be seen where
the<00:06:35.940> market<00:06:36.360> goes<00:06:36.540> but<00:06:36.960> I<00:06:37.230> think<00:06:37.950> at<00:06:38.190> this

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
the market goes but I think at this

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.890 
the market goes but I think at this
stage<00:06:38.430> in<00:06:38.640> the<00:06:38.820> game<00:06:38.880> we<00:06:39.240> think<00:06:39.480> that<00:06:39.540> there

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
stage in the game we think that there

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.360 
stage in the game we think that there
are<00:06:39.930> different<00:06:40.230> portfolio<00:06:40.680> products<00:06:41.100> and<00:06:41.280> it

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
are different portfolio products and it

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.930 
are different portfolio products and it
could<00:06:41.520> be<00:06:41.640> a<00:06:41.670> mix<00:06:41.910> it<00:06:42.360> could<00:06:42.570> be<00:06:42.660> a<00:06:42.690> mix
