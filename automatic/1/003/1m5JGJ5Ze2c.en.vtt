00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660
 Hi all 

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.310
 I am lux q and this is my first Indo 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.130
 in which we will talk about one of the most terrible things created by the 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.099
 human being 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:10.979
 advertising 

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:15.239
 i that thing that does not leave us in peace and that persecutes us and will persecute us until 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:16.470
 end of times 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.890
 which is where we put the view 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.220
 and that tries to deceive us so that we buy things without any use as 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.619
 a mÃ¡user with fan 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.900
 a phone that detects bad breath 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.630
 today a coffee machine with an internet connection that takes longer to connect 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.520
 that in making coffee 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.090
 and they will ask why advertising is so annoying 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.880
 because in addition to advertising stupid things 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.220
 It is impossible to look at something without a poster that sells you a 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.860
 automatic towel 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.670
 for example 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.540
 It is scientifically proven that there is no website where no 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.860
 those ads appear on the sides 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.310
 These do not bother me so much but I let them really bother they are the ones that jump on you 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.270
 the screen and that you have to close with the 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.260
 those are the ones that younger 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.180
 there are also those that try to make you click 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.030
 like the ones that tell you that you won a prize of one million euros for being the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.659
 visitor number 999 1999 or that you have a message in your mail 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.549
 those who created those ads would have to be killed 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.110
 cut them into three thousand pieces pass them through an industrial processor 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.680
 and use what is supposed to come out as fertilizer to grow soy 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.900
 in the Pampas plain without altering the environment 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.510
 others that bother are those of the tele 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.280
 the worst thing is that in a movie just when it is about to happen what 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.380
 we have been waiting for more than three hours 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.290
 the image of the channel appears and that stupid little sound sounds that it seems that 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.310
 they were dialing a telephone and the 15 minutes of propaganda began 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.400
 the worst channels in this sense are the public 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.220
 as for example in Spain 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.540
 the three 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.330
 not the fifth 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.119
 the sixth 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.560
 and the one eighteenth duo 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.270
 hotel efe 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.229
 in Argentina that sometimes have more than half an hour of propaganda and when 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.909
 the program starts again 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.740
 You are already chemo for the case that you were diagnosed with eye cancer 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:12.309
 put more than 15 minutes of advertising per hour and the TV goes against the 

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.719
 law 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.069
 according to article 34 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.370
 paragraph 56 of the law 15 million 936 thousand 572 of the estate of 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.599
 telecommunications and television signed the 36 opium man of the year 1994 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:28.329
 also 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:32.319
 the publicity that always produces a cerebral disorder of priorities 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.469
 and it's likely that you get a pancreatic tumor in less than a few hours 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:40.189
 thing that would be impossible even exposed to two hundred thousand times the 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:42.589
 radiation released by a supernova 

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:43.439
 for example 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.299
 according to some advertisements 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.390
 it is more important to spend 60 thousand euros in a double bm b that eat or drink and that 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:52.799
 if you do not drink a liter of Coca-Cola per hour 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.559
 you're going to be an unfortunate unfortunate for life 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:59.709
 there are also those advertisements where they show you to a dentist in a robe 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.819
 telling you that sensodyne is a miracle fallen from the sky and that using it to 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.109
 brushing your teeth 'you're going to become absolutely immune to all ills 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.759
 and existing misfortunes for the human being 

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:15.139
 there are many types of advertisements and although you have to admit that there are some 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:17.019
 that can make us laugh 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.179
 there are others that are for throwing the TV through the window 

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:23.169
 one of the most annoying are those that say 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.909
 we know that in life you need someone who is with you 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:31.359
 to accompany you, help you, want someone who is with you in the good 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:35.609
 and in the bad that you get out of trouble that is the first to whom you can 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:38.629
 resort when you have a problem 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:44.379
 oo you have an Acme brand washing machine for only 799 euros or in 12 installments with the 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.299
 English court card 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.079
 I would sue the English court for attacks against humanity and for 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.639
 make all those who have observed her finish in the hospital 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:54.759
 psychiatric 

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:59.049
 there are also those ads with catchy songs like that that says 

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:08.099
 never penna 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.549
 Tony Kanaan 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.549
 according to the measure also to 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.789
 China 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.909
 now free tudela is destroyed 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.460
 comes the beech in the fourth phone store 

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:31.750
 and also pass it every five minutes 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.740
 and at the end the little song hits you and you can not help but go humming the 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.569
 all hours 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:40.559
 while everyone looks at you as if you were an underfed subnormal 

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:45.259
 this is exactly what those companies are looking for because the song gets in 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.030
 the subconscious and it drills your neurons 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.650
 it takes away the ability to think correctly and at the end of form 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.260
 unconscious you end up calling that company to hire the service 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.310
 even if you get three eyes from your face for one of 56 telephone connections 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.240
 kilowatts it takes eight hours to open the google 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.040
 last the other day I saw a propaganda also of the English court 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:08.330
 that said well 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.689
 hi customer of the english court 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:13.789
 how much do you think this wooden table costs 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.060
 then the propaganda that leaves a few seconds of silence to think 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.080
 and I think the table costs 70 euros 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.179
 because in the English court we have only 399 euros 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:32.029
 i also with a discount of zero point 3% during the next fifteen minutes 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:36.939
 and if you are not satisfied we will refund your money in discount vouchers for 

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:41.460
 Chinese restaurants and hotel room reservations is on the moon to 

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:46.340
 from the year 2070 this type of propaganda are already the height 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.380
 because they want us to believe that the prices of a chain of business 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.470
 is the best of all but this propaganda is barely over 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:54.889
 appears the carrefour 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:56.780
 saying exactly the same 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.000
 although in a slightly different way or with something changed 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.110
 but in the end they always end up saying it's not the same thing of the same 

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:05.060
 and then he comes and I think 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.310
 and then walmart 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.400
 and then to the field and in the end you come to the conclusion that it is not 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.000
 a low price war 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.410
 if not a war of advertising creativity to see who can 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.410
 attract more customers with a funny propaganda 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.129
 to sticky another matica to his deadly trap washes pockets 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:24.349
 at the end of everything 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:28.490
 As I said before, you end up with more scrambled brain than a teletubi 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.789
 and become part of the society of zombies who do not think 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:35.550
 and what do they want to eat brains because they want other people to think 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:36.039
 they 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:39.400
 and end up paying attention to everything they see 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.669
 what a good metaphor I just invented 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:44.080
 I am already a sex pillar 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.090
 good friends 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.960
 I think that this is where it is getting a little longer 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.889
 so I'm saying goodbye 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:51.979
 I hope you liked it 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:56.000
 I intend to do more what in two on other topics so comment and leave 

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:57.020
 your criticisms 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.509
 that whenever they are constructive I will accept them 

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:01.849
 see you 

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:02.729
 greets you
