 Naturally I would like to introduce you to the violin that has the times terrain 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.300
 Germany's Horn Steiner for the 5th place 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.340
 It is called 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:30.279

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.110
 In a place where you want a three- point bird 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.110
 It is a musical instrument produced around 1880 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.620
 It feels like this 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.200
 Very expensive 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.200
 After all 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.200
 Because it will be a musical instrument about 130 years ago 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.920
 How to use moving like this 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:03.110
 It's an old instrument, so it's also very bright 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:08.660
 It is soft and deep, and it has become a musical instrument characterized by strong nails like German writing 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:14.020
 So today I also use this instrument to listen to the performance of the instructor who is the ultimate instructor
