 hello youtube friends how are you in 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:05.960
 this video we will learn how 

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:08.660
 download one from the windows store or 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.180
 of the windows store in windows days for 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.910
 that we are going to open our store here 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.250
 we wait for it to load and we see that the 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.830
 The interface of the store in windows 10 is 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.850
 a little different from what we saw in 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.529
 windows 8 and windows 8.1 here we have the 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.250
 start are not the applications anymore 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.860
 popular 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.700
 now it comes by classification between 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.410
 applications and games here we have 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.360
 also the configuration of our 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.030
 profile and good to look for a 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.620
 application example is that for the 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.660
 followers of the series the walking dead ' 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.660

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.600
 and here we see these episodes of walking 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.600
 dead 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:56.960
 is this for windows 8.1 and windows 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.970
 phone 8.1 but now in windows 10 the 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.560
 We can use both of our pc 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.740
 as in our cell phone that 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:08.120

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:12.610
 start the download of our application 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.610
 that the process bar appears 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.440
 we can class qualify the application 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.440
 as well 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:27.619
 now we can here place a 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.619
 description for example I like to be 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:37.550
 and here we can say 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:41.800
 I like that it is updated 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.940
 with all the chapters 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.030
 of the series 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.630

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.690

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:17.080
 in windows 8 and in windows 8.1 every time 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.210
 that we opened we ran an app 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.010
 appeared in full screen of 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.490
 download in windows 10 we can do 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.920
 this 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.050
 we are going to accommodate the one as if 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.710
 was one of the old applications 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.410
 desktop 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:36.880

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:40.910
 windows 10 regarding how to use 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.430
 the apps that we can click here 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.110

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.000
 series that are all of the last 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.000
 season and the final chapter 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.120

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.159
