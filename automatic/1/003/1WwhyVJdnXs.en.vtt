00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.240
 today I bring you a boxing that is a 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.589
 box that arrives monthly at your home 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.719
 has been incorporated very recently 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.160
 market and the characteristic that it has is 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.290
 that all the elements that you are carrying are 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.580
 without gluten and without lactose I do not have 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.139
 no kind of intolerance but 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.000
 talking to other people I realized 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.070
 that this happens to a lot of people 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.539
 much more than I thought and that's why I 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.800
 It seemed like a good idea to collaborate with 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.359
 them to be able to teach them the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.519
 products they have in their homes all 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.349
 the price information web page 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.490
 how to subscribe all that you're going to 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.970
 have down here in the little box 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.970
 information 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:42.829
 How beautiful we are going to see the first thing 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.660
 It is this that makes you enjoy your 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.860
 what box and put the different products 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:53.630
 that brings brings 11 egg products 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:56.150
 and then it takes and then it takes this that a 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.340
 allergen table and in the next 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.960
 sheet puts you the products and points 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.020
 of sale I think it's super 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.239
 complete very well then bring us this 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.710
 little letter from which I can eat that 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.640
 is the website that has been responsible for 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.740
 create these boxes 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.470
 well here it's neat but I'm going to 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.530
 go taking out and I look for it the first thing that I see 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.400
 is this puts in four glitter 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.050
 portions of 50 grams and this is me 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.119
 I have this product and what a coincidence is 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.460
 the surprise product because I told you 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.380
 they came 11 but they are not 12 and you have to 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.520
 put the 6 things that could touch you 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:34.729
 what has touched me today are mini 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.160
 Quince sweet quinces of the 100 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.540
 oyster chiquititas portions is super 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.119
 sweet the quince is usually super 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.800
 sweet and I love to combine it with a 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.320
 Cheese down good with cheese until 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.090
 you die with cheese and connected amazing 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.399
 the next thing that brings these pots 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.160
 of corn puts the field of the brand 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.320
 and that does not lead to good gluten that already 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.750
 it's cooked 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.670
 let's do a moment like this towards the 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.500
 microwave in one minute in the oven to 15 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.530
 minutes and the salt is in 5 it seems to me 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.260
 that this is great 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:09.130
 this is to get said good should be 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.780
 red fruit is ecological although good 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.280
 this one that comes to plan that we 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.820
 take the little bag that needs its 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.820
 infusion to dor 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.370
 but I do not know why 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:28.230
 the following is this 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.160
 are these poles that are liquids that are 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.580
 put in the freezer you know what 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.580
 I say no 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.470
 to freeze these people that now 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.239
 for summer I have a desire to try 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.269
 what is not very normal I will tell you 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.329
 the flavors that carry strawberry melon 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.340
 cherry orange and with blackberry collaborates not 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.349
 I know if I will like it but the rest and 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.970
 melon melon mother mine I think this 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.370
 late there is a powder of these fixed what 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.549
 following that they are croutons for 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.159
 how good these are natural these 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:05.489
 they carry the parsley they are of the mark speed 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:07.690
 and these carry paprika and onion me 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.010
 I think these are 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.500
 I'm in a pint this for the 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.790
 salads what good for soups and 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.200
 all that but now the merit for the 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.790
 salads I think it's called a lot 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.530
 the attention of these products that the 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.450
 first salt is carrying flour 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.630
 chickpea and rice flour also carries 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.030
 this is four corn tortillas 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.370
 because it's a free sample and this 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:34.270
 Well, good, we 're going to fill it 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:37.260
 this base they are like muffins and 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.300
 inside they carry strawberry is that good 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.600
 one 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.960
 the pimp 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.860
 he also carries soy drink from 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.860
 chocolate this I love 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.840
 these machines I thought were difficult 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.470
 of getting but the carrefour by 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.470

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.440
 Flakes are gluten-free I had not seen them 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.430

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:22.360

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.810
 these cereals how can they be so 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:30.669
 good is that I do not understand 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.930
 one thing you do not know about me is that I 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.510
 you can leave next to a box of 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.750

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.530

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.220
