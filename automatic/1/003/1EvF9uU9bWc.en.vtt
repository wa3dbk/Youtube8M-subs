from<00:00:22.779> that<00:00:22.840> day<00:00:23.169> and<00:00:23.349> so<00:00:24.310> i<00:00:24.340> made<00:00:24.700> this<00:00:24.849> one<00:00:25.000> a

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
from that day and so i made this one a

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.790 
from that day and so i made this one a
bit<00:00:25.270> bigger<00:00:25.509> than<00:00:25.810> i<00:00:25.930> normally<00:00:25.989> do<00:00:26.529> so<00:00:26.710> the

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
bit bigger than i normally do so the

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.970 
bit bigger than i normally do so the
covers<00:00:27.189> are<00:00:27.430> 7<00:00:28.000> by<00:00:28.180> 8<00:00:28.210> and<00:00:28.809> the<00:00:29.439> reason<00:00:29.739> i<00:00:29.800> did

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
covers are 7 by 8 and the reason i did

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.920 
covers are 7 by 8 and the reason i did
that<00:00:30.009> is<00:00:30.160> because<00:00:30.309> i<00:00:30.520> wanted<00:00:30.820> to<00:00:30.880> use<00:00:31.059> my<00:00:31.239> 4x6

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
that is because i wanted to use my 4x6

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.080 
that is because i wanted to use my 4x6
pictures<00:00:32.349> on<00:00:32.920> the<00:00:33.100> inside<00:00:33.520> and<00:00:33.640> i<00:00:33.760> didn't<00:00:33.969> want

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
pictures on the inside and i didn't want

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.420 
pictures on the inside and i didn't want
to<00:00:34.149> compromise<00:00:34.420> the<00:00:34.630> size<00:00:35.020> and<00:00:35.440> have<00:00:36.160> to<00:00:36.280> worry

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
to compromise the size and have to worry

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.340 
to compromise the size and have to worry
about<00:00:36.520> cutting<00:00:36.790> them<00:00:37.060> down<00:00:37.300> or<00:00:37.660> using<00:00:37.930> wallet

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
about cutting them down or using wallet

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.190 
about cutting them down or using wallet
size<00:00:38.560> photos<00:00:39.220> or<00:00:39.430> that<00:00:39.550> kind<00:00:39.790> of<00:00:39.850> thing<00:00:40.200> so

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
size photos or that kind of thing so

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.200 
size photos or that kind of thing so
that's<00:00:41.500> the<00:00:41.620> size<00:00:41.830> of<00:00:41.860> the<00:00:42.070> album<00:00:42.490> as<00:00:42.790> you<00:00:43.060> see

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
that's the size of the album as you see

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.450 
that's the size of the album as you see
it<00:00:43.300> turned<00:00:43.480> out<00:00:43.540> pretty<00:00:43.600> sick<00:00:44.140> and<00:00:45.070> i<00:00:45.130> use<00:00:45.250> all

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
it turned out pretty sick and i use all

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.340 
it turned out pretty sick and i use all
different<00:00:45.790> size<00:00:45.970> pages<00:00:46.540> on<00:00:46.660> the<00:00:46.750> inside<00:00:47.140> which

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
different size pages on the inside which

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.560 
different size pages on the inside which
i'll<00:00:47.500> show<00:00:47.680> you<00:00:47.740> and<00:00:48.130> i<00:00:48.760> did<00:00:48.940> find<00:00:49.180> it<00:00:49.360> with<00:00:49.450> my

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
i'll show you and i did find it with my

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.990 
i'll show you and i did find it with my
buying<00:00:49.840> doll<00:00:50.110> which<00:00:50.320> in<00:00:50.530> hindsight<00:00:50.770> it<00:00:51.760> looks

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
buying doll which in hindsight it looks

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.360 
buying doll which in hindsight it looks
kind<00:00:52.300> of<00:00:52.360> funny<00:00:52.600> because<00:00:52.780> it<00:00:53.050> ended<00:00:53.290> up<00:00:53.380> a<00:00:53.680> lot

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
kind of funny because it ended up a lot

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.970 
kind of funny because it ended up a lot
bigger<00:00:54.670> than<00:00:55.120> what<00:00:55.510> my<00:00:55.690> rings<00:00:55.989> can<00:00:56.290> handle<00:00:56.680> so

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
bigger than what my rings can handle so

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.670 
bigger than what my rings can handle so
I<00:00:57.480> probably<00:00:58.480> should<00:00:58.840> have<00:00:58.870> bound<00:00:59.440> it

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
I probably should have bound it

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.560 
I probably should have bound it
differently<00:01:00.130> and<00:01:00.220> I<00:01:00.850> think<00:01:00.910> I<00:01:01.239> am<00:01:01.360> going<00:01:01.480> to

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
differently and I think I am going to

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.560 
differently and I think I am going to
try<00:01:01.750> to<00:01:01.810> go<00:01:01.989> back<00:01:02.170> and<00:01:02.470> change<00:01:02.649> that<00:01:02.950> maybe

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
try to go back and change that maybe

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.230 
try to go back and change that maybe
maybe<00:01:04.570> redo<00:01:05.140> it<00:01:05.259> with<00:01:05.379> some<00:01:05.619> ribbon<00:01:05.829> or<00:01:06.310> find

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
maybe redo it with some ribbon or find

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.510 
maybe redo it with some ribbon or find
bigger<00:01:07.570> binding<00:01:08.170> wire<00:01:08.680> or<00:01:08.920> something<00:01:09.370> like

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
bigger binding wire or something like

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.820 
bigger binding wire or something like
that<00:01:09.760> but<00:01:10.330> for<00:01:10.390> right<00:01:10.990> now<00:01:11.110> it<00:01:11.530> holds<00:01:11.650> it

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
that but for right now it holds it

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.850 
that but for right now it holds it
together<00:01:11.950> and<00:01:12.280> it's<00:01:12.400> fine<00:01:12.670> for<00:01:12.700> right<00:01:13.180> now<00:01:13.210> so

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
together and it's fine for right now so

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.530 
together and it's fine for right now so
the<00:01:14.860> paper<00:01:15.100> line<00:01:15.400> I<00:01:15.670> use<00:01:15.700> for<00:01:16.120> the<00:01:16.210> whole<00:01:16.360> album

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
the paper line I use for the whole album

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.810 
the paper line I use for the whole album
it's<00:01:17.320> all<00:01:17.500> my<00:01:17.680> mind's<00:01:17.950> eye<00:01:18.220> from<00:01:18.700> the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
it's all my mind's eye from the

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.000 
it's all my mind's eye from the
lost-and-found<00:01:19.180> 2<00:01:19.659> collection<00:01:20.229> and<00:01:20.500> I<00:01:20.830> use

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
lost-and-found 2 collection and I use

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.630 
lost-and-found 2 collection and I use
two<00:01:21.340> different<00:01:21.659> collections<00:01:23.220> from<00:01:24.220> that<00:01:24.370> same

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
two different collections from that same

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.789 
two different collections from that same
line<00:01:24.970> so<00:01:25.299> I<00:01:25.330> use<00:01:25.510> the<00:01:25.690> sunshine<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:26.530> the

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
line so I use the sunshine and the

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.070 
line so I use the sunshine and the
breeze<00:01:27.040> collection<00:01:27.670> and<00:01:27.880> so<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.479> sunshine<00:01:28.900> is

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
breeze collection and so the sunshine is

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.070 
breeze collection and so the sunshine is
more<00:01:29.290> the<00:01:29.409> gold<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:31.180> tans<00:01:31.479> and<00:01:31.840> then<00:01:31.990> the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
more the gold and tans and then the

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.200 
more the gold and tans and then the
breeze<00:01:32.350> is<00:01:32.710> more<00:01:32.979> of<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.190> teal<00:01:33.430> blue<00:01:33.729> colors

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
breeze is more of the teal blue colors

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.359 
breeze is more of the teal blue colors
and<00:01:34.450> so<00:01:34.840> I<00:01:34.900> use<00:01:35.080> both<00:01:35.350> in<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.680> album<00:01:36.040> because<00:01:36.250> I

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
and so I use both in the album because I

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.940 
and so I use both in the album because I
love<00:01:36.610> symbols<00:01:37.060> and<00:01:37.420> so<00:01:38.110> my<00:01:38.229> title<00:01:38.440> here<00:01:38.619> as<00:01:38.860> you

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
been able to use it because of the

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.140 
been able to use it because of the
colors<00:02:00.189> like<00:02:00.430> you<00:02:00.549> really<00:02:00.700> need<00:02:00.909> a<00:02:00.970> very

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
colors like you really need a very

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.170 
colors like you really need a very
specific<00:02:01.450> paper<00:02:02.439> line<00:02:02.799> to<00:02:03.070> make<00:02:03.640> it<00:02:03.700> work<00:02:03.970> and

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
so I was so excited that it matched this

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.389

one perfectly there's that one and then

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.069

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
that was perfect cause it tied in with

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.680 
that was perfect cause it tied in with
my<00:02:17.530> title<00:02:17.770> which<00:02:18.130> is<00:02:18.280> really<00:02:18.520> glittery<00:02:18.820> and<00:02:19.030> I

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
and now this side is a picture of my

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.330 
and now this side is a picture of my
brother<00:03:36.550> and<00:03:37.000> his<00:03:37.150> family<00:03:37.360> I<00:03:38.200> just<00:03:38.530> kept<00:03:39.220> it

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.920 
brother and his family I just kept it
really<00:03:39.490> simple<00:03:39.580> and<00:03:39.940> added<00:03:40.210> some<00:03:40.360> lace<00:03:40.600> over

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
really simple and added some lace over

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.970 
really simple and added some lace over
here<00:03:41.520> and<00:03:42.520> then<00:03:42.670> I<00:03:43.230> did<00:03:44.230> a<00:03:44.260> second<00:03:44.620> picture<00:03:44.890> of

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980

them<00:03:45.160> here<00:03:45.610> with<00:03:45.930> other<00:03:46.930> recollections

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
them here with other recollections

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.710 
them here with other recollections
little<00:03:47.920> flower<00:03:48.190> and<00:03:48.370> the<00:03:48.670> leaf<00:03:48.850> and<00:03:49.240> then<00:03:49.480> at

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
little flower and the leaf and then at

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.740 
little flower and the leaf and then at
impulse<00:03:50.110> I<00:03:51.100> believe<00:03:52.060> this<00:03:52.209> is<00:03:52.390> the<00:03:52.510> philosophy

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
impulse I believe this is the philosophy

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.510 
impulse I believe this is the philosophy
tag<00:03:53.230> it<00:03:53.380> says<00:03:53.530> unique<00:03:53.890> and<00:03:54.100> then<00:03:54.190> I<00:03:54.250> tied<00:03:54.459> a

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
tag it says unique and then I tied a

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.210 
tag it says unique and then I tied a
little<00:03:54.790> ribbon<00:03:55.030> on<00:03:55.240> top<00:03:55.450> of<00:03:55.630> there<00:03:56.070> since<00:03:57.070> that

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
little ribbon on top of there since that

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.350 
little ribbon on top of there since that
page<00:03:58.230> now<00:03:59.230> this<00:03:59.470> one<00:03:59.709> I<00:04:00.250> have<00:04:00.730> a<00:04:00.760> picture<00:04:01.150> of<00:04:01.240> my

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
page now this one I have a picture of my

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.780 
page now this one I have a picture of my
family<00:04:01.570> coming<00:04:02.020> up<00:04:02.140> so<00:04:02.350> I<00:04:02.380> wanted<00:04:02.740> this<00:04:02.860> title

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
family coming up so I wanted this title

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.090 
family coming up so I wanted this title
this<00:04:04.480> is<00:04:04.540> I<00:04:04.810> will<00:04:04.990> love<00:04:05.140> you<00:04:05.290> forever<00:04:05.530> in<00:04:05.800> a<00:04:05.890> day

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
this is I will love you forever in a day

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.370 
this is I will love you forever in a day
but<00:04:06.730> I<00:04:06.820> couldn't<00:04:07.180> really<00:04:07.330> fit<00:04:07.690> it<00:04:07.780> on<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.170> page

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
but I couldn't really fit it on the page

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.760 
but I couldn't really fit it on the page
so<00:04:08.680> I<00:04:08.709> used<00:04:09.010> it<00:04:09.160> as<00:04:09.280> its<00:04:09.490> own<00:04:10.050> just<00:04:11.050> tag<00:04:11.320> and<00:04:11.680> its

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
so I used it as its own just tag and its

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.400 
so I used it as its own just tag and its
own<00:04:11.890> page<00:04:12.300> right<00:04:13.300> before<00:04:13.630> that<00:04:13.810> picture<00:04:14.020> and

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
own page right before that picture and

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.430 
own page right before that picture and
so<00:04:14.620> I<00:04:14.650> I<00:04:15.370> took<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:15.910> title<00:04:16.090> I<00:04:16.330> matted<00:04:16.720> it<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:17.140> I

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
so I I took the title I matted it and I

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.379 
so I I took the title I matted it and I
made<00:04:17.650> my<00:04:17.859> own<00:04:17.890> little

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
made my own little

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.589 
made my own little
tagged<00:04:18.629> out<00:04:19.620> of<00:04:19.829> the<00:04:19.949> paper<00:04:20.159> and<00:04:20.549> this<00:04:21.419> little

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
tagged out of the paper and this little

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:22.909 
tagged out of the paper and this little
button<00:04:21.810> is<00:04:22.109> from<00:04:22.319> the<00:04:22.379> my<00:04:22.499> mind's<00:04:22.740> eye

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
button is from the my mind's eye

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.459 
button is from the my mind's eye
collection<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:23.699> then<00:04:23.849> I<00:04:24.139> just<00:04:25.139> added<00:04:25.349> some

00:04:25.459 --> 00:04:25.469 
collection and then I just added some

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:28.909 
collection and then I just added some
ribbon<00:04:25.949> there<00:04:26.159> that<00:04:26.370> it<00:04:26.759> matched<00:04:27.830> and<00:04:28.830> then

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
ribbon there that it matched and then

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.010 
ribbon there that it matched and then
this<00:04:29.069> trim<00:04:29.400> is<00:04:29.430> so<00:04:29.759> pretty<00:04:30.180> it's<00:04:30.419> like<00:04:30.599> a<00:04:30.719> pale

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
this trim is so pretty it's like a pale

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.330 
this trim is so pretty it's like a pale
yellow<00:04:31.259> and<00:04:31.469> I<00:04:31.650> thought<00:04:31.830> it<00:04:31.949> matched<00:04:32.099> the

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
yellow and I thought it matched the

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.730 
yellow and I thought it matched the
collection<00:04:32.729> so<00:04:33.060> well<00:04:33.330> and<00:04:33.629> this<00:04:34.319> is<00:04:34.529> I<00:04:34.560> believe

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
collection so well and this is I believe

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.709 
collection so well and this is I believe
it's<00:04:35.189> may<00:04:35.430> arts<00:04:35.789> but<00:04:36.029> I<00:04:36.210> bought<00:04:36.360> it<00:04:36.419> by<00:04:36.659> the

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:36.719 
it's may arts but I bought it by the

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:38.959 
it's may arts but I bought it by the
yard<00:04:36.990> from<00:04:37.529> archivers<00:04:38.249> something<00:04:38.580> exactly

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:38.969 
yard from archivers something exactly

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:41.450 
yard from archivers something exactly
sure<00:04:39.259> which<00:04:40.259> I've<00:04:40.439> heard<00:04:40.620> that<00:04:40.770> archivers<00:04:41.310> is

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
sure which I've heard that archivers is

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.589 
sure which I've heard that archivers is
stopping<00:04:41.849> that<00:04:41.969> so<00:04:42.180> that's<00:04:42.330> kind<00:04:42.569> of

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:42.599 
stopping that so that's kind of

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:46.279 
stopping that so that's kind of
disappointing<00:04:42.749> but<00:04:44.090> there's<00:04:45.090> that<00:04:45.300> and<00:04:45.719> then

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
disappointing but there's that and then

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.589 
disappointing but there's that and then
