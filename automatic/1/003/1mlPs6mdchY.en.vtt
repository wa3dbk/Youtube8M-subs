something totally different in which
case<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.340> think<00:00:44.370> any<00:00:44.879> change<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.420> good<00:00:45.600> at<00:00:45.719> this

point<00:00:46.110> as<00:00:46.260> long<00:00:46.320> as<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.770> hands<00:00:47.010> of

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
someone who got a clue what they're

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.639 
someone who got a clue what they're
doing<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.480> would<00:00:48.840> say<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:48.989> Triple<00:00:49.350> H<00:00:49.410> does

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
doing and I would say that Triple H does

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.920 
doing and I would say that Triple H does
the<00:00:50.129> time<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:50.700> definitely<00:00:51.360> Triple<00:00:51.629> H<00:00:51.719> does

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the time it's definitely Triple H does

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.959 
the time it's definitely Triple H does
and<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.170> done<00:00:52.440> as<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.860> said<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.070> don't<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.550> don't<00:00:53.579> I

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
and I done as I said I don't I don't I

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.880 
and I done as I said I don't I don't I
don't<00:00:54.090> worry<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:54.750> much<00:00:54.780> about<00:00:54.930> Triple<00:00:55.559> H<00:00:55.649> being

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
don't worry so much about Triple H being

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.799 
don't worry so much about Triple H being
in<00:00:55.980> charge<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.460> long<00:00:56.640> as<00:00:56.730> he<00:00:56.850> can<00:00:57.059> as<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.600> long

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
in charge so long as he can as so long

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.139 
in charge so long as he can as so long
as<00:00:57.989> he<00:00:58.289> can<00:00:58.500> separate<00:00:58.920> himself<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.609> his<00:00:59.910> and

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
as he can separate himself and his and

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.180 
as he can separate himself and his and
the<00:01:00.570> importance<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.260> his<00:01:01.500> character<00:01:01.980> from

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
the importance of his character from

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.729 
the importance of his character from
that<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.359> do<00:01:03.420> think<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.930> there's<00:01:04.229> got<00:01:04.559> to

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
that and I do think that there's got to

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.670 
that and I do think that there's got to
be<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:05.129> sense<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.640> he<00:01:06.060> needs<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.680> occasionally

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
be a sense that he needs to occasionally

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.679 
be a sense that he needs to occasionally
not<00:01:07.860> always<00:01:08.159> necessarily<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:09.150> occasionally

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
not always necessarily but occasionally

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.050 
not always necessarily but occasionally
take<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> step<00:01:10.140> back<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.500> go<00:01:10.619> hang<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.220> what

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
take a step back and go hang on what

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.600 
take a step back and go hang on what
we've<00:01:12.240> just<00:01:12.270> booked<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:13.409> great<00:01:13.770> for<00:01:14.100> me<00:01:14.159> and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.940 
we've just booked it's great for me and
it<00:01:14.880> looks<00:01:15.090> great<00:01:15.360> from<00:01:15.570> from<00:01:16.259> me<00:01:16.409> as<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> bad<00:01:16.920> guy

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
it looks great from from me as a bad guy

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.219 
it looks great from from me as a bad guy
so<00:01:17.549> I'm<00:01:17.700> showing<00:01:18.210> myself<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.630> be<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.900> biggest

so I'm showing myself to be the biggest

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.570 
so I'm showing myself to be the biggest
horror<00:01:19.530> most<00:01:19.740> horrible<00:01:20.100> hill<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.369> world

horror most horrible hill in the world
but<00:01:21.450> whilst<00:01:21.750> I'm<00:01:21.960> doing<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.380> I'm<00:01:22.560> making

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
but whilst I'm doing that I'm making

to for me that's where he needs to think
step<00:01:31.740> back<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.070> what<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.310> would<00:01:32.400> imagine

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.300 
future of what's going to happen
creatively<00:03:16.020> in<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.170> w/e<00:03:16.680> it's<00:03:16.860> almost<00:03:17.070> at<00:03:17.280> a

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
creatively in the w/e it's almost at a

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.229 
creatively in the w/e it's almost at a
point<00:03:17.489> where<00:03:17.670> there<00:03:17.910> really<00:03:17.970> is<00:03:18.209> a

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
point where there really is a

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.350 
point where there really is a
corporation<00:03:19.019> is<00:03:19.200> without<00:03:20.070> any<00:03:20.100> issue<00:03:20.700> in<00:03:21.090> its

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
corporation is without any issue in its

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.570 
corporation is without any issue in its
future<00:03:21.810> in<00:03:22.050> terms<00:03:22.110> of<00:03:22.769> just<00:03:22.950> being<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.340> number

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
future in terms of just being the number

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.949 
future in terms of just being the number
one<00:03:23.610> and<00:03:23.940> there's<00:03:24.060> nothing<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.360> stop<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:24.690> the

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
one and there's nothing to stop it the

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.630 
one and there's nothing to stop it the
real<00:03:25.110> issue<00:03:25.290> now<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.890> creative<00:03:26.250> direction

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
real issue now is the creative direction

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.430 
real issue now is the creative direction
that<00:03:26.970> takes<00:03:27.209> you<00:03:27.630> know<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.900> happens<00:03:28.260> once

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
that takes you know that happens once

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.740 
that takes you know that happens once
Vince<00:03:29.130> I<00:03:29.280> mean<00:03:29.459> you<00:03:29.640> know<00:03:29.730> I<00:03:29.910> mean<00:03:30.480> I<00:03:30.570> think

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
Vince I mean you know I mean I think

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.330 
Vince I mean you know I mean I think
it'd<00:03:30.840> be<00:03:30.870> fair<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.230> say<00:03:31.410> that<00:03:31.620> Vince<00:03:32.040> it's

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
it'd be fair to say that Vince it's

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.250 
it'd be fair to say that Vince it's
probably<00:03:32.670> creatively<00:03:33.209> spent<00:03:33.510> now<00:03:33.720> at<00:03:34.140> this

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
probably creatively spent now at this

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.320 
probably creatively spent now at this
point<00:03:34.470> right<00:03:34.709> because<00:03:35.070> to<00:03:35.550> be<00:03:35.640> doing<00:03:35.880> this<00:03:36.030> for

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
point right because to be doing this for

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.210 
point right because to be doing this for
as<00:03:36.390> long<00:03:36.510> as<00:03:36.570> he<00:03:36.750> has<00:03:36.959> you<00:03:37.830> know<00:03:37.950> you<00:03:38.010> just

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
as long as he has you know you just

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.530 
as long as he has you know you just
don't<00:03:38.280> really<00:03:38.550> see<00:03:38.820> Vince<00:03:39.060> suddenly<00:03:39.330> coming

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
don't really see Vince suddenly coming

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.970 
don't really see Vince suddenly coming
on<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:39.810> go<00:03:39.900> right<00:03:40.140> we<00:03:40.320> need<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.530> shake<00:03:40.739> up<00:03:40.890> the

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
on and go right we need to shake up the

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:41.960 
on and go right we need to shake up the
product<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:41.400> mean<00:03:41.519> if<00:03:41.580> you<00:03:41.670> look<00:03:41.820> historically

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
product I mean if you look historically

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.990 
product I mean if you look historically
vintage<00:03:42.630> away<00:03:42.840> strived<00:03:43.350> with<00:03:44.160> competition<00:03:44.880> is

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
vintage away strived with competition is

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.340 
vintage away strived with competition is
it's<00:03:45.209> always<00:03:45.360> been<00:03:45.660> an<00:03:45.780> us<00:03:45.900> against<00:03:46.170> them

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
it's always been an us against them

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.960 
it's always been an us against them
mentality<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:47.160> I<00:03:47.220> can<00:03:47.400> get<00:03:47.519> dates<00:03:47.760> all<00:03:47.940> the

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
way back to stuff in his childhood if

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.530 
way back to stuff in his childhood if
you<00:03:49.950> read<00:03:50.100> you<00:03:50.370> know<00:03:50.489> some<00:03:50.670> stories<00:03:51.330> about

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
you read you know some stories about

think at this point now it's a very
interesting<00:03:55.380> thing<00:03:55.890> is<00:03:56.010> who<00:03:56.190> is<00:03:56.340> there<00:03:56.549> that's

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
interesting thing is who is there that's

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.070 
interesting thing is who is there that's
going<00:03:56.880> to<00:03:56.940> take<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.299> bull<00:03:57.450> by<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.630> horns<00:03:57.959> so
