what's happening tells us every meter

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.270 
what's happening tells us every meter
that's<00:00:45.600> going<00:00:45.960> down<00:00:45.989> tells<00:00:46.860> us<00:00:46.950> when<00:00:47.100> we're<00:00:47.219> at

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
mark you see it round to 30 so we ought

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.920 
mark you see it round to 30 so we ought
4<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.940> 30<00:00:51.270> there<00:00:51.449> gives<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.809> good

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
4 to 30 there gives you a good

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.240 
4 to 30 there gives you a good
indication<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.500> where<00:00:52.620> their<00:00:52.800> line<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.070> going

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
indication of where their line is going

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.889 
indication of where their line is going
to<00:00:53.309> stop<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.699> obviously<00:00:54.270> if<00:00:54.510> we<00:00:54.690> catch

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
to stop and obviously if we catch

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.180 
to stop and obviously if we catch
something<00:00:55.170> which<00:00:55.440> we<00:00:55.559> should<00:00:55.770> do<00:00:55.920> hopefully

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
something which we should do hopefully

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.729 
something which we should do hopefully
we're<00:00:57.120> gonna<00:00:57.180> be<00:00:57.390> quickly<00:00:58.260> around<00:00:58.410> here<00:00:58.680> is

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
we're gonna be quickly around here is

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.099 
we're gonna be quickly around here is
gonna<00:00:58.800> be<00:00:59.010> some<00:00:59.190> Harper<00:00:59.579> kerb<00:00:59.760> s<00:01:00.000> odd<00:01:00.660> King<00:01:01.020> he

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
gonna be some Harper kerb s odd King he

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.260 
gonna be some Harper kerb s odd King he
may<00:01:01.260> be<00:01:01.320> blue<00:01:01.559> nose<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.850> like<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.090> said

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
may be blue nose so but like you said

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.640 
may be blue nose so but like you said
this<00:01:03.510> sort<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.719> dips<00:01:03.960> make<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.409> sort<00:01:04.589> of

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
this sort of dips make this sort of

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.070 
this sort of dips make this sort of
prospect<00:01:05.070> drop<00:01:05.250> real<00:01:05.610> easy<00:01:06.950> there<00:01:07.950> we<00:01:08.010> go

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
prospect drop real easy there we go

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.200 
prospect drop real easy there we go
235<00:01:10.130> so<00:01:11.130> we'll<00:01:11.280> just<00:01:11.369> bring<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.729> meter<00:01:11.909> or<00:01:12.030> so

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
235 so we'll just bring in a meter or so

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.020 
235 so we'll just bring in a meter or so
off<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.600> bottom<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.369> as<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.520> see<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.820> rod

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
off the bottom and as you see the rod

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.060 
off the bottom and as you see the rod
design<00:01:15.390> we've<00:01:15.630> made<00:01:15.810> for<00:01:16.020> these<00:01:16.170> as<00:01:16.860> we've

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
design we've made for these as we've

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.670 
design we've made for these as we've
gone<00:01:17.220> for<00:01:17.520> an<00:01:17.580> aluminium<00:01:18.150> beam<00:01:18.360> cut<00:01:18.600> what<00:01:19.530> this

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
gone for an aluminium beam cut what this

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.380 
gone for an aluminium beam cut what this
does<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.100> if<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.310> notice<00:01:20.460> how<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.790> rods<00:01:21.090> of

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
does is if you notice how the rods of

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.539 
does is if you notice how the rods of
really<00:01:21.689> nice<00:01:21.869> workable<00:01:22.350> angles<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.070> doesn't

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
really nice workable angles and doesn't

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.980 
really nice workable angles and doesn't
put<00:01:23.670> too<00:01:23.820> much<00:01:23.970> load<00:01:24.240> or<00:01:24.450> point<00:01:24.659> load<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
put too much load or point load the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.600 
put too much load or point load the
rolls<00:01:25.200> with<00:01:25.409> these<00:01:25.530> are<00:01:25.650> very<00:01:25.860> powerful<00:01:26.100> reels

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
rolls with these are very powerful reels

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.210 
rolls with these are very powerful reels
so<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.270> need<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.630> angle<00:01:28.049> obviously<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.950> little

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
so you need the angle obviously a little

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:52.109 
so you need the angle obviously a little
bit<00:01:29.369> especially<00:01:29.790> when<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.030> use

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:02:02.760 

in<00:01:53.119> back

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.719 

this<00:02:03.369> is<00:02:03.670> way<00:02:03.939> easier<00:02:03.970> than<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:06.100> normal<00:02:06.430> type

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
this is way easier than the normal type

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.460 
this is way easier than the normal type
of<00:02:06.939> deepwater<00:02:07.180> fishing<00:02:07.630> on<00:02:07.840> Easter

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
of deepwater fishing on Easter

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.050 
of deepwater fishing on Easter
