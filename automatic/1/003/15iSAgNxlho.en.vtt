has if it is long-sleeve I need to get

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.500 
has if it is long-sleeve I need to get
something<00:02:15.470> large<00:02:15.830> because<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.520> will<00:02:17.210> only<00:02:17.360> end

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
something large because it will only end

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.870 
something large because it will only end
up<00:02:17.750> coming<00:02:18.050> about<00:02:18.230> here<00:02:18.530> on<00:02:18.710> my<00:02:18.860> arms<00:02:19.250> actually

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
up coming about here on my arms actually

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.150 
up coming about here on my arms actually
even<00:02:20.150> this<00:02:20.300> that<00:02:20.480> I'm<00:02:20.570> wearing<00:02:20.750> now<00:02:21.040> it's<00:02:22.040> a

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
even this that I'm wearing now it's a

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.690 
even this that I'm wearing now it's a
slight<00:02:22.430> issue<00:02:22.640> although<00:02:23.420> not<00:02:23.720> too<00:02:23.930> bad<00:02:24.700> so

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
slight issue although not too bad so

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.840 
slight issue although not too bad so
there's<00:02:26.630> things<00:02:26.810> like<00:02:26.960> that<00:02:27.320> and<00:02:27.680> you<00:02:28.460> know

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
there's things like that and you know

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.360 
there's things like that and you know
and<00:02:29.090> as<00:02:29.300> as<00:02:29.690> men<00:02:30.050> were<00:02:30.230> just<00:02:30.370> proportion

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
and as as men were just proportion

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.010 
and as as men were just proportion
differently<00:02:31.790> so<00:02:31.970> there<00:02:32.180> really<00:02:32.390> isn't<00:02:32.750> a

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
differently so there really isn't a

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.350 
differently so there really isn't a
straight<00:02:33.490> conversion<00:02:34.490> one<00:02:34.700> way<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.210> other

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
straight conversion one way to the other

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.730 
straight conversion one way to the other
that<00:02:35.900> said<00:02:36.350> I<00:02:37.280> think<00:02:37.580> you<00:02:38.000> will<00:02:38.330> find<00:02:38.740> that

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
that said I think you will find that

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.480 
that said I think you will find that
shoe<00:02:40.730> size<00:02:41.060> is<00:02:41.540> fairly<00:02:42.260> consistent<00:02:42.620> alphab

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
shoe size is fairly consistent alphab

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.610 
shoe size is fairly consistent alphab
and<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.650> goes<00:02:45.650> up<00:02:45.710> about<00:02:46.340> a<00:02:46.700> size<00:02:47.450> size<00:02:48.320> and<00:02:48.560> a

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
and it goes up about a size size and a

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.910 
and it goes up about a size size and a
half<00:02:48.860> like<00:02:49.580> for<00:02:50.180> me<00:02:50.690> with<00:02:51.020> men's<00:02:51.320> shoes<00:02:51.560> I<00:02:51.740> am<00:02:51.770> a

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
half like for me with men's shoes I am a

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.910 
half like for me with men's shoes I am a
10<00:02:52.160> and<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.340> half<00:02:52.370> in<00:02:52.700> women's<00:02:53.060> I<00:02:53.180> am<00:02:53.510> on<00:02:54.410> 11<00:02:54.800> and

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
10 and a half in women's I am on 11 and

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.180 
10 and a half in women's I am on 11 and
a<00:02:54.950> half<00:02:54.980> or<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:55.400> 12<00:02:55.880> or<00:02:56.840> sometimes<00:02:57.320> an<00:02:57.710> 11<00:02:58.070> and<00:02:58.100> a

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
a half or a 12 or sometimes an 11 and a

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.340 
a half or a 12 or sometimes an 11 and a
half<00:02:58.220> wide<00:02:58.700> which<00:02:59.390> is<00:02:59.570> another<00:02:59.870> thing<00:03:00.140> with

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
half wide which is another thing with

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.050 
half wide which is another thing with
women's<00:03:00.680> shoes<00:03:00.860> they<00:03:01.070> have<00:03:01.310> normal<00:03:01.880> size<00:03:02.030> and

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
women's shoes they have normal size and

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.320 
women's shoes they have normal size and
they<00:03:02.390> have<00:03:02.570> wide<00:03:02.780> so<00:03:03.640> yeah<00:03:04.640> again<00:03:05.030> you'll<00:03:05.270> want

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
they have wide so yeah again you'll want

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.060 
they have wide so yeah again you'll want
to<00:03:05.570> try<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:05.930> find<00:03:06.080> that<00:03:06.230> out<00:03:06.320> but<00:03:06.650> that's

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
to try and find that out but that's

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.700 
to try and find that out but that's
fairly<00:03:07.520> consistent<00:03:08.300> in<00:03:08.450> my<00:03:08.600> experience<00:03:09.230> but

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
fairly consistent in my experience but

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.190 
fairly consistent in my experience but
sizing<00:03:10.640> for<00:03:11.000> any<00:03:11.240> of<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.510> types<00:03:11.750> of<00:03:11.900> clothing

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
sizing for any of the types of clothing

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.810 
sizing for any of the types of clothing
it<00:03:13.840> there's<00:03:14.840> no<00:03:15.050> there's<00:03:15.470> no<00:03:15.650> easy<00:03:16.040> conversion

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
it there's no there's no easy conversion

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.360 
it there's no there's no easy conversion
on<00:03:16.940> that<00:03:17.240> and<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:18.500> really<00:03:18.770> what<00:03:19.070> what<00:03:19.340> I

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
on that and and really what what I

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.180 
on that and and really what what I
recommend<00:03:19.850> is<00:03:19.970> just<00:03:20.000> getting<00:03:20.770> if<00:03:21.770> you<00:03:21.950> don't

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
recommend is just getting if you don't

smaller from there and that will sort of

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.790 
smaller from there and that will sort of
give<00:03:49.760> you<00:03:49.910> what<00:03:50.360> size<00:03:50.810> you<00:03:51.110> should<00:03:51.170> be<00:03:51.530> working

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
give you what size you should be working

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.990 
give you what size you should be working
with<00:03:53.050> it's<00:03:54.050> it's<00:03:54.560> an<00:03:54.740> annoying<00:03:55.100> process<00:03:55.459> to<00:03:55.880> be

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
with it's it's an annoying process to be

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.940 
with it's it's an annoying process to be
honest<00:03:56.300> and<00:03:56.480> again<00:03:56.720> as<00:03:56.900> I<00:03:57.050> said<00:03:57.080> the<00:03:57.410> sizes<00:03:57.830> are

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
honest and again as I said the sizes are

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.010 
honest and again as I said the sizes are
neatly<00:03:58.160> consistent<00:03:58.850> with<00:03:59.030> I've<00:03:59.510> got<00:03:59.810> some
