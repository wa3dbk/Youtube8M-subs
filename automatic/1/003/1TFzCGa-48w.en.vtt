00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:13.690
 Here I installed 6 18650 batteries 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:17.330
 flock for a 12-volt screwdriver 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:22.750
 brought out two power cables for the screwdriver 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:26.270
 and 4 for power for charger 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.430
 I drove the stuffy containers through my 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.400
 iron device that's not all 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.039
 more or less normal capacity of each 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.890
 about 2,000 milliamps there varies in 

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:40.239
 within 100 milliamps that is all 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.430
 ok pokamist I do not put 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:48.230
 battery discharge indicator 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:52.809
 but further we will think of something after 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:55.690
 all podgons left to fix 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.140
 terminals 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.140
 and connector 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:08.450
 and it did with hot melt need 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.430
 warm up the gun well and pour 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:17.390
 a large enough amount of glue to 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.390
 many well established stuck glue 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:35.150
 all the excess ceiling gets heated well and 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.150
 finally collect 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:52.569
 so long awaited moment of this is maximum 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.569
 honey hair 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:06.429
 that is, no problem for both 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.289
 industrial work option somewhere 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:12.200
 far probably not very suitable but for 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.650
 home for life and your port is used 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.709
 not very often where there is a possibility 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.650
 charge it correctly in mode 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.230
 balancing it very much 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.090
 workable model to 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:32.230
 use it somewhere settings 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.680
 probably need to mount here 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.690
 balancing device 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.299
 automatic and i.e. microcircuit 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.709
 balancing also need here 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:46.819
 mount the indicator light and 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:50.239
 sound discharge and also 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.910
 i.e. a chip which will 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:57.650
 control charge battery assembled 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:03:01.810
 tested now need to check how we 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:07.780
 we can charge it we connect 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.780
 the leads of the probes to someone emulator 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:15.469
 power bills you need to plant 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:21.950
 balancing connector here I brought here 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:24.640
 Only here is the connector on the connector for 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.640
 balancing 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:33.370
 so we expose here some kind of charged 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:37.110
 stage so to speak a trial course so 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.110
 here we do not particularly login 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.920
 everything goes burn to many tension on 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.000
 each bank 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.580
 let's get a little closer under it so you 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.040
 were able to see 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:58.230
 there will be tension on each bank 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.269
 we see a charge goes without hemorrhoids can 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.220
 charge the battery for that of course 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.910
 need less smart charger 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.910
 device 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.930
 I have probably returned a dozen self- tapping screws 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:21.530
 shot a pair of holes in the metal and 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:25.070
 silly drill and completion of metal 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:28.650
 almost no bed 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:33.270
 voltage normally works 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:35.160
 barn or some banks in general to all 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.860
 I recommend I hope you have been helpful 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.900
