 and today we have another package from 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:22.949
 China with aliexpress this here such 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.169
 Motors or rather say 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:30.039
 geared motors they arrived as always 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:32.650
 in the garbage bag without any pimples but 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:37.149
 each in its own bag 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.739
 I have certainly watched one motor 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:46.000
 came here like that under with torn off 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:48.149
 wire 2 motor wire in place here 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.429
 these are the motors 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:56.289
 apparently the wires are prilepa 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:58.719
 hot melt itself motor reducer here 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:03.760
 here here under this shiny little thing 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:05.980
 Iron inscriptions here what for what 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.450
 Here is a grandmother for whom 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:12.549
 No to us methane muton 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:15.390
 but the point is not even that 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:19.479
 12 volts 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:24.880
 30 milliamps idle promise 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:27.490
 Chinese and 60 rpm at 12 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.740
 Volts output shaft he has three 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.590
 half millimeter is also like on 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.149
 there are such tiny motors but 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:43.530
 now unfounded let's unscrew 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:44.710
 the head is already a special hex 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.850
 unscrewed 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:52.200
 and see only at home she is a little less 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.200
 I measure now 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.380
 So 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.250
 I will become 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.899
 approximately 12 millimeters output 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:11.209
 shaft total length of the motor 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:16.000
 without contacts 42 centimeters diameter 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:18.709
 this is his fat stuff 16 millimeters 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:27.470
 we weigh now how much is the whole thing 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:30.920
 weighs like loading scales for a long time to me 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.870
 unfortunately kitchen 32 grams 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:38.319
 we have a motor up to this our 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:41.090
 the robot has wheels too 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.890
 spoke a spine by many this is a landing 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.660
 the hole is also three and a half meters with 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:49.780
 you cut yourself beautifully 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.829
 puts on and keeps in our wheels 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.840
 let's try to connect and 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:58.250
 see how much these motors will have 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.290
 eat us so I hooked up our little motor 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.530
 crocodile mig adjustable block 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:08.930
 take away on it the length of 40 and including 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.940
 our motor starts spinning the wheel i 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.579
 specially left the wheel to 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.859
 was watching the rotation here 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:19.250
 about 60 RPM well that is 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:22.069
 so slowly rotates and at the same time 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.420
 idle he lives really 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.420
 about 30 milliamps 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:36.510
 there were exactly 90 our grade length 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.310
 plus or minus 30 milliamps im alive and 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.220
 Now let's try our motor stop 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:48.069
 make it not easy it's enough 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:53.020
 powerful and see that half ampere he lives 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:56.069
 if it is stopped by a very powerful motor 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:00.130
 for its small size 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.950
 here are the motors here today 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.390
 review 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.989
 they cost me completely forgot to tell 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:10.800
 worth three bedrooms bucks one motor then 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:16.120
 there is this order on the current course 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:19.350
 about 200 rubles to 233 now me 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:24.040
 Shows three bedrooms bucks both motors 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:26.770
 7 bucks cost went for a long time without tracking 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:31.360
 numbers but in the end 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:34.890
 Reached for the robot is the most compared 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:40.330
 of course with our old motors they 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:44.440
 Significantly more so here's one little motor 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:47.700
 and 2 motor difference on the face as 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.960
 says but also power, we certainly 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:53.680
 significantly higher than these small 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.890
 motors for our work or yes 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.979
 there he takes a decent part 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:03.820
 spaces but i think them just by 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:08.350
 The diagonal of the camera is close by 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:10.810
 I will put diagonally simply and everything will be 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.590
 fine we are one on one side 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.550
 in front 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.770
 another other country from behind like this 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:22.360
 something like this all will look 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:24.449
 and work oh well 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.900
 everyone who likes motors 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:30.009
 order recommend quite inexpensive and 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.770
 like a metal gearbox 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:35.310
 quality stuff in general put 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:38.520
 thumbs up subscribe to the channel 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.520
