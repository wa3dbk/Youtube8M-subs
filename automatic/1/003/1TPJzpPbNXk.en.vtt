00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.790
 good morning friends subscribers 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:09.030
 youtube I have an incredible news 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:13.130
 super exciting super good and true or 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.130
 be one tells us incredible but true 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.210
 ok guys if you did not see them in Martians 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.540
 a point with which I made an article 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.419
 explaining more the news and the news 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:28.919
 is that the hacker recognized worldwide 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:32.309
 the netbook already has the unter jailbreak 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:35.190
 on your iphone 5 and we can see it on great 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.590
 He said he is not sure why 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.280
 so much pessimism but the reality is that 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:45.120
 I have the iPhone 5 with a previous break 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.760
 in 6 points 0.2 right there he explains the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.220
 reasons why he has not released 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.740
 this serves the public for all 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.380
 us and it's because he wants to use that 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.890
 vulnerability for future your breaks 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:02.550
 that is better is a better idea to wait 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.470
 and using that vulnerability for 6.1 is 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.130
 the same story what is repeated with 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.720
 what happened with the 5.1 that we and 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.229
 you remember we never had 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.340
 the boil for 5.01 what we did was 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.720
 that we wait for apple to release the 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.730
 5.1 already comes with all the errors 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.770
 solved a better system more 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.250
 complete and most of all we have the duty 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.870
 for 5.1.1 the boil with tetro then 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.330
 it's the same situation that is 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.490
 repeating here he says he does not understand by 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.020
 how many people are so pessimistic about 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.120
 that not of what not of what not of not and 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.550
 he says that reality is I come back and 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.000
 I repeat, worth the redundancy the reality 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.790
 is that he has in his hands the iphone5 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.770
 what does this mean a lot of people when 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.090
 write the article people say something 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.890
 have for the function that for me 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.410
 Interested in the iphone 4s as I have 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.530
 said in my videos when they do 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.229
 the jailbreak to the iphone to the most recent 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.840
 to the later that means that 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.910
 we will have the jailbreak for all 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.570
 other devices I repeat it again 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:09.030
 all the other devices are going to have 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.330
 the gervais jon tester is only 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.580
 question of patient wait my people 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.650

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.180

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.470
 many people are very discouraged but with 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.270

 anyone can say that it has snow 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.610

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.220
 a hacker that is already brought us jordi 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.670
