00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:18.509
 after the ready dough it is opened and 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.160
 this stage we call 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:22.890
 mass rolling 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.650
 note that the mass and displacement of several 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.080
 times until a thick blade is 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:35.970
 which is packed in a bag 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:38.309
 plastic and goes to rest the dough 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.420
 rested undergoes a new process of 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.960
 lamination 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.299
 this time to assemble the pastel in 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.010
 house can be opened with cylinders 

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:52.710
 manuals or the wooden roller here 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.140
 the dough is passed through the cylinder that 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.839
 is increasingly reducing the space between 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.100
 the rollers to the desired point of 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:04.140
 thin and resistant to 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.229
 first blade we call the cover 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.570
 bottom and on this layer of space in 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.009
 space we are going to distribute the filling 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.009
 of pastel see 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.830
 quantity may vary depending on the 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.020
 size of the cake to be produced 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.690
 It is very important that the cup filling in the 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.570
 half the area of â€‹â€‹the cake so that 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.150
 vapor expansion within the mass and 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.680
 its growth during the fracture, which 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.600
 gives it the appearance to the side and full 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.369
 distributed filling covers with another 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.500
 blade or the top cover or 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:53.530
 we simply fold the bottom half 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:56.680
 over the fillings then compress with 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.410
 hands firmly gluing both layers 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.850
 it is important that there is no 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.030
 smaller aperture 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:08.110
 otherwise it erupts migraine and 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.630
 during the next 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.580
 The cutting is carried out using a 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.580
 manual mass reel 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.000
 removes the chips that are 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.300
 reprocessed and cut the crayons in the 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.810
 desired shape if the stocking is rectangular 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.090
 moon or other in general in the pastries 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.959
 to differentiate in the 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.300
 attendance 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.760
 the half moon shape is for the pastels 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.000
 filled with meat and the envelope format 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.770
 and for those stuffed with cheese 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.989
 here you see the example of a format 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:48.340
 adopted in this pastry for the filling 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.959
 mozzarella with ham the pastries to 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.870
 as they are being cut and 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.600
 shall be packaged in forms 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.330
 trays sprinkled with flour and 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.560
 covered with a damp cloth or 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.120
 drawers covered with fabric are then 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.330
 sent to the service sector 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.550
 where the fry is given here are 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.110
 stored in places such as this type of 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.260
 cabinet where the drawers fit 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:18.269
 closed and unventilated to maintain the 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.269
 dampness and avoid dryness
