let's crack on with a look at the inside

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.860 
let's crack on with a look at the inside
so<00:05:15.130> to<00:05:15.160> actually<00:05:15.490> open<00:05:15.820> the<00:05:16.090> at<00:05:16.210> rocks<00:05:16.510> up<00:05:16.750> you

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
so to actually open the at rocks up you

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.660 
so to actually open the at rocks up you
literally<00:05:17.200> press<00:05:17.440> this<00:05:17.620> razor<00:05:17.920> button<00:05:18.430> press

did want to color match or change and we

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.090 
did want to color match or change and we
actually<00:05:34.660> got<00:05:34.870> a<00:05:34.930> pulley<00:05:35.200> lever<00:05:35.440> system<00:05:35.950> here

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
actually got a pulley lever system here

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.280 
actually got a pulley lever system here
to<00:05:36.130> actually<00:05:36.370> and<00:05:36.790> keep<00:05:37.030> the<00:05:37.180> case<00:05:37.450> held<00:05:38.050> nice

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
to actually and keep the case held nice

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.160 
to actually and keep the case held nice
and<00:05:38.470> upright<00:05:38.740> if<00:05:39.160> you<00:05:39.280> are<00:05:39.460> working<00:05:39.970> inside

and upright if you are working inside

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.510 
and upright if you are working inside
good<00:05:41.170> thing<00:05:41.380> is<00:05:41.470> as<00:05:41.650> well<00:05:41.800> you<00:05:41.920> also<00:05:41.950> have<00:05:42.220> a

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
good thing is as well you also have a

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.760 
good thing is as well you also have a
removable<00:05:43.230> where<00:05:44.230> you<00:05:44.320> have<00:05:44.440> storage

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
removable where you have storage

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.740 
removable where you have storage
containers<00:05:45.310> father<00:05:45.520> C<00:05:45.700> your<00:05:45.820> removable<00:05:46.300> parts

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
containers father C your removable parts

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.260 
containers father C your removable parts
detachable<00:05:47.200> parts<00:05:47.530> let<00:05:47.740> your<00:05:47.890> cable<00:05:48.340> first<00:05:49.030> of

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
detachable parts let your cable first of

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.970 
detachable parts let your cable first of
all<00:05:49.390> and<00:05:49.660> then<00:05:50.050> the<00:05:50.200> other<00:05:50.350> thing<00:05:50.620> is<00:05:50.830> the

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:50.980 
all and then the other thing is the

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.860 
all and then the other thing is the
actual<00:05:51.250> joystick<00:05:51.850> handle<00:05:52.000> can<00:05:52.390> change<00:05:52.600> to<00:05:52.840> a

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
actual joystick handle can change to a

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.550 
actual joystick handle can change to a
button<00:05:53.410> I<00:05:53.890> think<00:05:54.310> it<00:05:54.520> called<00:05:54.700> it<00:05:54.790> a<00:05:54.820> bat<00:05:55.030> handle

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
button I think it called it a bat handle

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.440 
button I think it called it a bat handle
then<00:05:56.560> you've<00:05:56.710> also<00:05:56.860> got<00:05:57.070> here<00:05:57.550> a<00:05:57.760> tool<00:05:58.150> it

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
then you've also got here a tool it

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.240 
then you've also got here a tool it
looks<00:05:58.510> low<00:05:58.780> cam<00:05:59.020> or<00:05:59.260> posi<00:05:59.560> drive<00:05:59.800> and<00:05:59.980> a<00:06:00.040> flat

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
looks low cam or posi drive and a flat

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.120 
looks low cam or posi drive and a flat
head<00:06:00.280> to<00:06:01.240> obviously<00:06:01.630> change<00:06:02.410> the<00:06:02.590> components

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.130 
head to obviously change the components

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.800 
head to obviously change the components
or<00:06:03.250> do<00:06:03.400> whatever<00:06:03.580> you<00:06:03.760> wish<00:06:03.880> inside<00:06:04.420> the<00:06:04.600> case

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
or do whatever you wish inside the case

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.720 
or do whatever you wish inside the case
but<00:06:05.620> there's<00:06:05.770> loads<00:06:05.860> of<00:06:06.010> room<00:06:06.070> here<00:06:06.430> as<00:06:06.550> well

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:06.730 
but there's loads of room here as well

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.670 
but there's loads of room here as well
so<00:06:06.970> I'd<00:06:07.060> imagine<00:06:07.180> you<00:06:08.080> could<00:06:08.200> put<00:06:08.380> like<00:06:08.470> your

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
so I'd imagine you could put like your

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.440 
so I'd imagine you could put like your
game<00:06:08.920> case<00:06:09.400> in<00:06:09.610> here<00:06:09.730> I<00:06:09.790> think<00:06:10.090> it<00:06:10.180> would<00:06:10.210> just

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
game case in here I think it would just

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.270 
game case in here I think it would just
about<00:06:10.660> fit<00:06:10.720> you<00:06:11.560> could<00:06:11.710> potentially<00:06:11.890> put<00:06:12.250> a

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 
about fit you could potentially put a

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.770 
about fit you could potentially put a
controller<00:06:12.700> in<00:06:12.940> here<00:06:13.120> as<00:06:13.210> well<00:06:13.360> and<00:06:13.420> some<00:06:13.600> more

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:13.780 
controller in here as well and some more

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.840 
controller in here as well and some more
cables<00:06:14.260> or<00:06:14.470> whatever<00:06:15.160> you<00:06:15.310> want<00:06:15.460> to<00:06:15.580> put<00:06:15.730> in

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:15.850 
cables or whatever you want to put in

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.340 
cables or whatever you want to put in
here<00:06:16.000> I'd<00:06:16.090> imagine<00:06:16.480> this<00:06:16.570> room<00:06:16.840> but<00:06:17.080> obviously

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.350 
here I'd imagine this room but obviously

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.960 
here I'd imagine this room but obviously
the<00:06:17.830> good<00:06:17.980> thing<00:06:18.130> is<00:06:18.250> obviously<00:06:18.580> you<00:06:18.640> can<00:06:18.730> open

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
the good thing is obviously you can open

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.270 
the good thing is obviously you can open
up<00:06:19.090> and<00:06:19.240> have<00:06:19.300> a<00:06:19.390> little<00:06:19.600> play<00:06:19.780> around<00:06:20.280> change

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 
up and have a little play around change

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.190 
up and have a little play around change
some<00:06:21.460> components<00:06:22.030> change<00:06:22.210> faulty<00:06:22.660> parts<00:06:23.020> and

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
some components change faulty parts and

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.290 
some components change faulty parts and
stuff<00:06:23.320> for<00:06:23.440> that<00:06:23.590> as<00:06:23.710> well<00:06:24.000> but<00:06:25.000> yeah<00:06:25.180> this

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
stuff for that as well but yeah this

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.970 
stuff for that as well but yeah this
gives<00:06:25.600> you<00:06:25.750> good<00:06:25.930> access<00:06:26.290> to<00:06:26.320> the<00:06:26.560> inside<00:06:26.950> a

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:26.980 
gives you good access to the inside a

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.980 
gives you good access to the inside a
bit<00:06:27.250> more<00:06:27.430> storage<00:06:27.730> as<00:06:27.970> well<00:06:28.150> but<00:06:28.330> to<00:06:28.540> shut<00:06:28.810> it

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
bit more storage as well but to shut it

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.690 
bit more storage as well but to shut it
