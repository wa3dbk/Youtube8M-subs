00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:45.260
They are by your side though you’re walking alone

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.860
Try to enjoy the ride but know you walk alone

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.480
They don’t move a muscle for you

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.260
They make you go slow

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.120
Do and you do alone

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.760
Wait and you wait alone

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.620
Go and you go alone

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.960
Walk and you walk alone

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.840
You’re walking alone

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.180
When you ride with stones

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.840
You give all your blood, but you give alone

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:46.640
Sacrifice yourself but know you’re all alone

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.660
They expect that you will tow them

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.420
While they’re motionless at home

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.800
Now the time has come to show

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.180
Who’s moving and who will be left away

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.480
Do and you do alone

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.360
Wait and you wait alone

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.080
Go and you go alone

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.700
Walk and you walk alone

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.220
You’re walking alone

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.260
Astounded as they drone

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.294
Over and over

00:02:27.294 --> 00:02:29.254
Same old excuses

00:02:29.334 --> 00:02:31.334
Causing permanent bruises

00:02:31.334 --> 00:02:33.100
They won’t change, you’re on your own

00:02:33.106 --> 00:02:35.106
You will pay the highest price

00:02:35.106 --> 00:02:36.994
You will suffer endless nights

00:02:36.994 --> 00:02:38.794
When you see they won’t suffice

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.600
Run away to avoid your demise 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.160
They laugh, you cry

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.974
They go, you stay

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.030
They live, you die

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.774
You go, they stay

00:02:51.774 --> 00:02:53.617
You walk alone

00:02:53.617 --> 00:02:55.554
You’re all alone

00:02:55.554 --> 00:02:57.395
You walk alone

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.800
You’re on your own

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.840
Do and you do alone

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.620
Wait and you wait alone

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.420
Go and you go alone

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.760
Walk and you walk alone

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.820
You’re walking alone

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.600
Like you didn’t know

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.516
Show them what you’ve got

00:03:31.516 --> 00:03:33.494
Show you don’t need them

00:03:33.494 --> 00:03:35.294
If that’s the way it’s got to be

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.440
Show them you can do all alone
