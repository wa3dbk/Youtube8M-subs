 well this is about eating chili peppers 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.730

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:31.189

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.670
 rich 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.250

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.740

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.780
 just in case we're going to start 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.780

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.020
 this temple 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:10.980
 We could not and I'm praying

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.550
 but no 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.860

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.750

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:22.010

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.140
 I'm going to meet even places 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.390

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.760
 hosteltur 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:39.370

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:41.320
 bite a smash of finishing them one 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.180
 then with the only thing that is removed 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:47.470
 good that I calmed down so much was with 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:50.740
 ice but really do not do it but 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.840
 same and we challenge them to do it to see 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.030
 if they do it better than us and they 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.980
 They eat more chiles than us because the 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.889

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:17.589
