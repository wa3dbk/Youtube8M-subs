00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
environment I spoke about earlier on a

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.620 
environment I spoke about earlier on a
windy<00:02:19.920> day<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.549> possible<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.120> close<00:02:21.480> the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
windy day it is possible to close the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.110 
windy day it is possible to close the
vents<00:02:21.900> by<00:02:22.049> 50%<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:23.489> will<00:02:23.670> restrict<00:02:23.940> the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
vents by 50% this will restrict the

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.460 
vents by 50% this will restrict the
airflow<00:02:24.329> going<00:02:24.569> into<00:02:25.049> the<00:02:25.140> barbecue

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
airflow going into the barbecue

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.559 
airflow going into the barbecue
therefore<00:02:26.250> reducing<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.880> oxygen<00:02:27.239> to<00:02:27.420> the

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
therefore reducing the oxygen to the

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.100 
therefore reducing the oxygen to the
coals<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.079> reducing<00:02:28.769> the<00:02:28.829> temperature

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
coals and reducing the temperature

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.990 
coals and reducing the temperature
closing<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.200> vents<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.530> 50%<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.370> also<00:02:32.730> great

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
closing the vents to 50% is also great

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.550 
closing the vents to 50% is also great
