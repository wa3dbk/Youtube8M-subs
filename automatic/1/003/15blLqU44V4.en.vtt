00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:12.420
 today we have to celebrate these 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.219
 beautiful year-old cuckoo mushrooms 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.379
 thousands of names at the regional level but 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.940
 however, it is enough to see this later 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.880
 spectacular orange color that 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.010
 however they are very recognizable that 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.490
 what we do and we want to enhance 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.130
 to the best 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.570
 so we're going to do one 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.040
 very simple omelettes that we will stuff with 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:38.059
 our mushrooms 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.059
 let's start from the oil we light a boule 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:47.870
 I would say that for this pan 4 eggs 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:51.719
 should be sufficient and 4 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.270
 so too quickly we slam and 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.430
 turning because we really don't have to 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:01.829
 to incorporate air 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:06.270
 let's add the salt he had also kept 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:09.150
 a little milk to soften and 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.159
 I will still use a little bit but how 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.159
 just about a spoon 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.590
 here we are at temperature and we go to 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.590
 overturn our eggs 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:30.080
 here we are and we are going to cut our own 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:35.150
 mushrooms trying to wait for them finer 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.640
 possible then you are wonderful for 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:43.990
 eat so raw with just barely one 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.990
 little bit of lemon but also delicious 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.250
 the part more than now leathery but we keep 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:59.060
 aside that we will work to make us a nice 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:02.900
 risotto not being perfectly in 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.970
 floor the kitchen counter tends a little 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.570
 to ruin it but it is enough 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.180
 pay a little for the pan to make 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.510
 then distribute again so 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.090
 uniform anyway we let go 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.840
 let's take another one 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.840
 let's take this 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.980
 also here the part runs through or there 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.980
 take away 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.780
 look at how it moves easily 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.150
 our bitterness 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.680
 which means he is cooking in a way 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.260
 perfect 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.480
 we must not is not an omelette to 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.880
 see always remain very soft 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.540
 so we cook one more 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:06.819
 little else but above must remain but 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:08.620
 if it were damp we do this 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:15.489
 at this point we take our own 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:21.760
 mushrooms and put them in a goal in the 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:24.549
 half of our omelets so so 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.480
 they do not have to go directly to the 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:33.519
 flame and strong heat but must feel 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.540
 hedges just say what you saw that 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.330
 still open 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.049
 a little salt at this point 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.630
 the operation we can also push 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:46.359
 at this point you see also gets up with 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.430
 great ease and let's go to 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:51.720
 fall back like this 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.720
 look at what colors 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.430
 now let's rest for a minute 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.430
 then we have to do an operation 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.780
 of a difficulty 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.100
 incredible we will surely lose a little 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:11.260
 of mushrooms we help each other a little op 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.810
 well i was good i left alone 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.650
 three mushrooms and I would say almost mushroom release 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.650
 on the one hand because I will eat later 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:24.940
 this is our wonderful omelette 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:27.180
 with cookies with eggs with mushrooms 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.180
 enjoy your meal
