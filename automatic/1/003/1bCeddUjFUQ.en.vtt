so<00:00:15.900> these<00:00:16.049> are<00:00:16.259> the<00:00:16.400> clownfish<00:00:17.400> larvae<00:00:17.789> of

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
so these are the clownfish larvae of

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.630 
so these are the clownfish larvae of
these<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.179> ocellaris<00:00:18.599> clownfish<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.640> Nemo

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
these of ocellaris clownfish the Nemo

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.880 
these of ocellaris clownfish the Nemo
clownfish<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.300> everyone<00:00:21.660> knows<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.500> these

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
clownfish is everyone knows and these

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.269 
clownfish is everyone knows and these
guys<00:00:23.099> are<00:00:23.130> about<00:00:24.589> five<00:00:25.589> or<00:00:25.740> six<00:00:25.859> days<00:00:26.099> old

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
guys are about five or six days old

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.720 
guys are about five or six days old
today<00:00:26.990> so<00:00:27.990> they<00:00:28.080> just<00:00:28.230> hatched<00:00:28.380> last<00:00:28.589> week<00:00:28.890> and

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
today so they just hatched last week and

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.500 
today so they just hatched last week and
in<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.599> tank<00:00:31.320> there's<00:00:31.589> probably<00:00:32.190> one<00:00:32.970> to<00:00:33.330> two

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
in this tank there's probably one to two

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.680 
in this tank there's probably one to two
hundred<00:00:34.310> individuals<00:00:35.540> which<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.570> a

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
hundred individuals which is a

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.540 
hundred individuals which is a
relatively<00:00:37.110> small<00:00:39.110> clutch<00:00:40.110> size<00:00:40.350> but<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.400> is

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
relatively small clutch size but this is

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.740 
relatively small clutch size but this is
the<00:00:41.670> first<00:00:41.820> spawn<00:00:42.290> from<00:00:43.820> these<00:00:44.820> pairs<00:00:45.450> since

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
the first spawn from these pairs since

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.980 
the first spawn from these pairs since
they<00:00:45.930> were<00:00:45.990> shipped<00:00:46.320> here<00:00:46.590> about<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.490> month<00:00:47.670> ago

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:47.990 
they were shipped here about a month ago

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.530 
they were shipped here about a month ago
so<00:00:48.990> we're<00:00:49.650> really<00:00:49.830> happy<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.280> see<00:00:50.490> that<00:00:50.790> the

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
so we're really happy to see that the

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.360 
so we're really happy to see that the
eggs<00:00:51.990> are<00:00:52.140> viable<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.770> at<00:00:52.830> the<00:00:52.920> larvae<00:00:53.250> were

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
eggs are viable and at the larvae were

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.520 
eggs are viable and at the larvae were
viable<00:00:53.580> and<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.840> larvae<00:00:55.140> seem<00:00:55.320> really

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
viable and the larvae seem really

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.440 
viable and the larvae seem really
healthy<00:00:55.860> they<00:00:56.250> stay<00:00:56.550> really<00:00:56.700> active<00:00:57.210> and

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
healthy they stay really active and

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.670 
healthy they stay really active and
they're<00:00:57.630> eating<00:00:57.780> well<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.380> they're<00:00:58.500> growing

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
they're eating well and they're growing

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.680 
they're eating well and they're growing
well<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.220> they'll<00:01:00.090> actually<00:01:00.240> start<00:01:00.450> to

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
well and they'll actually start to

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.770 
well and they'll actually start to
resemble<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.110> little<00:01:01.320> clownfish<00:01:01.770> probably<00:01:02.780> two

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
resemble a little clownfish probably two

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.610 
resemble a little clownfish probably two
or<00:01:03.810> three<00:01:03.930> weeks

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
or three weeks

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.490 
or three weeks
you're<00:01:05.800> adults<00:01:06.190> so<00:01:07.150> these<00:01:07.450> are<00:01:07.690> the<00:01:07.840> ocellaris

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
you're adults so these are the ocellaris

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.060 
you're adults so these are the ocellaris
clownfish<00:01:09.190> and<00:01:09.550> these<00:01:10.270> are<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.540> adults<00:01:11.290> the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
clownfish and these are the adults the

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.490 
clownfish and these are the adults the
female<00:01:12.640> is<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:12.880> larger<00:01:13.330> one<00:01:13.510> and<00:01:13.840> the<00:01:13.930> male<00:01:14.260> is

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
female is the larger one and the male is

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.390 
female is the larger one and the male is
the<00:01:14.620> smaller<00:01:14.920> one<00:01:15.010> and<00:01:16.980> the<00:01:17.980> reason<00:01:18.100> why

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
the smaller one and the reason why

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.670 
the smaller one and the reason why
clownfish<00:01:19.120> are<00:01:19.450> particularly<00:01:19.900> useful<00:01:20.230> to

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
clownfish are particularly useful to

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
clownfish are particularly useful to
have<00:01:21.070> around<00:01:21.940> is<00:01:22.330> that<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:23.190> spawning<00:01:24.190> methods

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
have around is that the spawning methods

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.430 
have around is that the spawning methods
and<00:01:24.910> the<00:01:24.970> rearing<00:01:25.300> methods<00:01:25.660> are<00:01:25.780> documented

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
and the rearing methods are documented

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.210 
and the rearing methods are documented
and<00:01:26.650> well<00:01:26.800> well<00:01:27.550> developed<00:01:28.390> and<00:01:28.600> so<00:01:29.500> they're

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
and well well developed and so they're

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
and well well developed and so they're
actually<00:01:30.370> commercially<00:01:31.270> available<00:01:32.940> fish<00:01:33.940> as

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
actually commercially available fish as

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.420 
actually commercially available fish as
far<00:01:34.480> as<00:01:34.570> being<00:01:34.750> cultured<00:01:35.170> which<00:01:35.950> is<00:01:36.130> very

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
far as being cultured which is very

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.860 
far as being cultured which is very
different<00:01:36.820> than<00:01:36.940> the<00:01:37.030> vast<00:01:37.210> majority<00:01:37.720> of<00:01:37.750> the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
different than the vast majority of the

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.140 
different than the vast majority of the
coral<00:01:38.140> reef<00:01:38.290> fish<00:01:38.470> that<00:01:38.680> we're<00:01:38.800> studying<00:01:39.150> and

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
coral reef fish that we're studying and

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.940 
coral reef fish that we're studying and
so<00:01:40.450> by<00:01:40.720> having<00:01:41.050> it<00:01:41.140> this<00:01:41.290> year<00:01:41.500> that<00:01:41.710> we<00:01:41.800> know

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
so by having it this year that we know

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.480 
so by having it this year that we know
we<00:01:42.130> can<00:01:42.160> rear<00:01:42.550> all<00:01:42.760> the<00:01:42.880> way<00:01:43.000> through<00:01:43.330> we<00:01:44.110> can

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
we can rear all the way through we can

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.140 
we can rear all the way through we can
start<00:01:45.490> to<00:01:45.730> train<00:01:46.630> those<00:01:46.900> methods<00:01:47.290> to<00:01:48.070> the

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
start to train those methods to the

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.950 
start to train those methods to the
students<00:01:49.150> that<00:01:49.180> are<00:01:49.360> working<00:01:49.540> with<00:01:49.750> us

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
students that are working with us

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.470 
students that are working with us
because<00:01:50.440> it's<00:01:51.070> a<00:01:51.220> fish<00:01:51.640> that<00:01:51.670> can<00:01:52.060> be<00:01:52.240> reared

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
because it's a fish that can be reared

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.910 
because it's a fish that can be reared
the<00:01:53.050> students<00:01:53.500> can<00:01:54.570> experience<00:01:55.570> all<00:01:56.170> aspects

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
the students can experience all aspects

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.620 
the students can experience all aspects
of<00:01:57.040> the<00:01:57.160> culture<00:01:57.340> cycle<00:01:57.910> from<00:01:58.120> caring<00:01:58.480> from

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
of the larvae to raising the live foods

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.690 
of the larvae to raising the live foods
that<00:02:02.530> are<00:02:02.680> necessary<00:02:03.100> in<00:02:03.220> those<00:02:03.340> types<00:02:03.580> of

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
that are necessary in those types of

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.520 
that are necessary in those types of
things<00:02:03.940> and<00:02:04.390> because<00:02:04.990> it<00:02:05.080> has<00:02:05.200> a<00:02:05.229> relatively

within the timeframe of one semester you

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.890 
within the timeframe of one semester you
could<00:02:11.080> have<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:12.520> know<00:02:12.550> from<00:02:12.970> egg<00:02:13.239> to<00:02:13.600> little

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
could have you know from egg to little

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.620 
could have you know from egg to little
juvenile<00:02:14.320> fish<00:02:14.620> already<00:02:15.520> completed<00:02:15.940> now<00:02:16.300> with

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
oh I there's kind of renewed interest in

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.490 
oh I there's kind of renewed interest in
expanding<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.420> course<00:02:22.630> offerings<00:02:23.140> that
