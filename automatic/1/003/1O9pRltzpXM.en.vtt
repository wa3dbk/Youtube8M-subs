00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
effective and as you can see I wouldn't

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.770 
effective and as you can see I wouldn't
have<00:04:37.979> got<00:04:38.129> this<00:04:38.280> foul<00:04:38.789> or<00:04:39.000> even<00:04:39.270> him<00:04:39.419> get<00:04:39.569> sent

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
that kind of shielded the ball a bit

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.420 
that kind of shielded the ball a bit
meaning<00:04:43.199> he<00:04:43.289> didn't<00:04:43.590> technically<00:04:44.069> get<00:04:44.310> the

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
there was no need to anyway because the

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.800 
there was no need to anyway because the
game<00:04:52.680> finished<00:04:52.919> at<00:04:53.460> one<00:04:53.699> nil<00:04:53.939> and<00:04:54.180> we<00:04:54.599> just
