00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.420
 tires worn out make you the most unstable and safe car 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.949
 even during normal unfairness situation 

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:12.869
 we could verify this consideration during a whole 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.449
 day of dynamic road safety tests 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.939
 on the varano circuit near Parma 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.699
 coordinated assisted by technicians of the international safe driving center of 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:22.789
 andrea de adamich 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.490
 we drove equipped cars now buy blood in good condition 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:29.359
 as defeated treads worn 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.930
 six easily verifiable situations have been recreated on the circuit 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.300
 also on our roads 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.800
 during which we were able to see how much difference it is in the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.570
 face dangerous situations in the street as a place and with how bad 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.750
 state 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.440
 first of all the tread 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.550
 the law sets the minimum wear depth at 1.6 mm 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.780
 the colic you will see in this video have been made with tires in 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.480
 very good condition about 8 mm and we buy worn atc up to 2 millimeters 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.480
 therefore well above the limits of Lecce 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.200
 in the wet the braking distance is known to be about 30% longer 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.890
 phrases with tires maybe you call it 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.300
 with how much distance 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.980
 how you use this distance doubles 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.060
 this app is a car with a train on the wet asphalt the speed of 70 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.710
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.710
 this instead is happy maxicinema 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.080
 the guard dies the test from another angle 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.180
 the yellow cone indicates 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.180
 hidden streams office 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.689
 we have simulated the situation in which a sudden obstacle on the road with 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.549
 fifth quick. overtaking 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.300
 oblige us a sudden change of direction 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.790
 this is the reaction of the painting with swollen tires. quite right 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.190
 this is instead a car to which it was mounted romantic slightly deflated 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.180
 as happens when there is a microfracture that slowly deflates the 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.060
 rubber 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.800
 you notice how the car tnt directionality 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.760
 with the serious risk of invading the opposite roadway a little to lengthen the 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.760
 braking 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:20.769
 in this thing a car that travels at a speed of about 70 kilometers per hour 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.259
 face a curve and immediately 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:26.259
 center of the earth 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.619
 the car with inflated tires and Ferrara duty. with a longer trajectory 

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:32.700
 precise and enter the puddle of water 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.159
 telling the foot injury to a minimum 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.049
 if the tread depth is regular and google inflates engineers 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.219
 4-stage fatigue limit tires 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:43.970
 the car with tires underneath 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.979
 dishes instead will be - 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:48.979
 data on the face of the earth 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:03:00.299
 it is not certain that we run the risk of losing control of the future car 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.789
 only if you go strong 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:05.629
 35 kilometers per hour are enough to lose grip if an obstacle hits 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.609
 the rear axle that the Greek road surface 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:09.859
 a metal plate 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.529
 simona a shot from you 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:16.260
 then the car loses its grip on a sheet of awl resembling a ciato bottom 

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:19.419
 the maneuver to do and the other one 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.419
 snake speed up the way to realign the car before it comes out fishing 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:27.219
 the wear-down car 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:34.499
 tricks list movies there are in excellent condition 

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:48.710
 a car with flat tires as we have seen 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.949
 it is not only dangerous but also more fuel consumption 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:56.029
 the demonstration given by letting a car go down in a hill from a hill and 

00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:59.279
 marking the point where it seems to stop due to inertia 

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:03.399
 the one with flat tires will stop many meters before the tire sign 

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:06.919
 inflated duty meets less friction and then rolls over more asphalt 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:07.889
 easily 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.889
 all this translates into fuel savings 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.680
 finally, even in situations of optimal asphalt, flat tires 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.770
 affect the sensations that the driver has during driving 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:30.400
 driving a car with flat tires on the front we are driving the 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.379
 feeling of oversteer 

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:36.569
 buy um atc back deflated the feeling of me will be a slight loss of the 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:39.199
 rear axle and therefore lighter understeer
