charming and she's rough around the

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:35.539 
charming and she's rough around the
edges<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:34.079> that<00:03:34.379> makes<00:03:34.620> for<00:03:34.859> a<00:03:34.889> good<00:03:35.310> couple

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
edges and that makes for a good couple

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.789 
edges and that makes for a good couple

I'm considering it all now um think of
the<00:05:17.490> materials<00:05:18.060> used<00:05:18.300> to<00:05:18.479> sculpt<00:05:19.020> it<00:05:19.490> jeez

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
the materials used to sculpt it jeez

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.760 
the materials used to sculpt it jeez
yeah<00:05:21.180> I<00:05:21.210> guess<00:05:21.750> we<00:05:21.960> could<00:05:22.110> get<00:05:22.320> rid<00:05:22.530> of<00:05:22.680> the

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
yeah I guess we could get rid of the

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.790 
yeah I guess we could get rid of the
plastic<00:05:23.539> yeah<00:05:24.539> what<00:05:24.960> would<00:05:25.080> we<00:05:25.199> be<00:05:25.229> left<00:05:25.560> with

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
plastic yeah what would we be left with

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.770 
plastic yeah what would we be left with
though<00:05:26.010> I<00:05:26.280> think<00:05:26.699> you'd<00:05:27.210> have<00:05:27.419> just<00:05:27.449> a

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
though I think you'd have just a

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.260 
though I think you'd have just a
gelatinous<00:05:28.310> just<00:05:29.310> you<00:05:29.490> know<00:05:29.610> the<00:05:29.789> skin<00:05:30.030> would

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
gelatinous just you know the skin would

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.290 
gelatinous just you know the skin would
just<00:05:30.479> be<00:05:31.340> hanging<00:05:32.340> there<00:05:32.580> because<00:05:32.789> it's<00:05:33.150> all
