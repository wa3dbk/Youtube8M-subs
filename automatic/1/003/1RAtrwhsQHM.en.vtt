00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
it is made out of glass and aluminum we

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.200 
it is made out of glass and aluminum we
do<00:00:21.750> have<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.109> two-tone<00:00:22.769> design<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.580> it

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
do have that two-tone design and it

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.859 
do have that two-tone design and it
weighs<00:00:24.420> 112<00:00:25.140> grams<00:00:25.410> which<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.310> 20%<00:00:27.300> lighter

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
weighs 112 grams which is 20% lighter

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.150 
weighs 112 grams which is 20% lighter
than<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.470> 4s<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.160> it's<00:00:29.699> also<00:00:30.080> 18%<00:00:31.080> thinner<00:00:31.160> so

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
than the 4s and it's also 18% thinner so

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
it should feel a difference when we hold

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.130 
it should feel a difference when we hold
it<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.440> hand<00:00:34.730> now<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:36.210> does<00:00:36.420> come<00:00:36.450> with<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.899> 4

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
it in a hand now it does come with the 4

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.400 
it in a hand now it does come with the 4
inch<00:00:37.320> Retina<00:00:37.800> display<00:00:38.190> with<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.210> rest<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.809> 11

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
inch Retina display with the rest of 11

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.400 
inch Retina display with the rest of 11
36<00:00:40.890> by<00:00:41.340> 640<00:00:42.210> now<00:00:42.750> one<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.110> biggest

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
36 by 640 now one of the biggest

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.459 
36 by 640 now one of the biggest
features<00:00:43.559> for<00:00:43.920> me<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:45.360> comes<00:00:45.570> with<00:00:45.750> 4G

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
features for me is that it comes with 4G

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.310 
features for me is that it comes with 4G
LTE<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:47.640> it's<00:00:47.760> gonna<00:00:47.879> be<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> lot<00:00:48.390> faster<00:00:48.960> up<00:00:49.170> to

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
LTE so it's gonna be a lot faster up to

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.430 
LTE so it's gonna be a lot faster up to
100<00:00:49.920> megabytes<00:00:50.820> per<00:00:50.879> second<00:00:51.449> now<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.050> all

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
100 megabytes per second now that all

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.650 
100 megabytes per second now that all
really<00:00:52.739> depends<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.489> your<00:00:53.670> service<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.420> your

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
really depends on your service and your

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.110 
really depends on your service and your
area<00:00:55.079> now<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.559> also<00:00:55.739> comes<00:00:56.129> with<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.430> new<00:00:56.579> a6

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
area now it also comes with the new a6

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.970 
area now it also comes with the new a6
chip<00:00:57.239> which<00:00:57.600> gives<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.960> iPhone<00:00:58.379> 2<00:00:58.590> times

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
chip which gives the iPhone 2 times

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.270 
chip which gives the iPhone 2 times
faster<00:00:59.520> CPU<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.390> 2<00:01:00.960> times<00:01:01.350> faster<00:01:01.800> graphics

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
faster CPU and 2 times faster graphics

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.219 
faster CPU and 2 times faster graphics
so<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.550> means<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:03.000> everything<00:01:03.899> should

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
so that means that everything should

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.590 
so that means that everything should
feel<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> lot<00:01:04.830> snappier<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:06.119> lot<00:01:06.330> more

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
feel a lot snappier and a lot more

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.960 
feel a lot snappier and a lot more

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
also gonna have improved low-light

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.080 
also gonna have improved low-light
performance<00:01:43.649> which<00:01:44.369> I'm<00:01:44.520> really<00:01:44.729> looking

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090

forward to that but I'm we're gonna have
to<00:01:47.490> wait<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.790> see<00:01:47.970> how<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.329> plays<00:01:48.630> out<00:01:48.810> I

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
to wait and see how that plays out I

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.499 
to wait and see how that plays out I
will<00:01:49.290> be<00:01:49.439> testing<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:49.979> out<00:01:50.189> in<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.299> full

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509
