back<00:00:00.539> in<00:00:00.659> the<00:00:00.719> 20s<00:00:01.050> and<00:00:01.230> 30s<00:00:01.350> you<00:00:01.709> didn't<00:00:01.890> have

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
back in the 20s and 30s you didn't have

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.070 
back in the 20s and 30s you didn't have
electricity<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.730> run<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:02.970> space<00:00:03.360> heater<00:00:03.659> so<00:00:03.990> if

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
electricity to run a space heater so if

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.320 
electricity to run a space heater so if
you<00:00:04.230> needed<00:00:04.410> some<00:00:04.830> localized<00:00:05.520> warming<00:00:06.180> up

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
you needed some localized warming up

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.909 
you needed some localized warming up
inside<00:00:06.750> your<00:00:06.930> house<00:00:07.109> you<00:00:07.140> got<00:00:07.500> something<00:00:07.890> like

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
inside your house you got something like

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.509 
inside your house you got something like
this<00:00:08.400> this<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.420> Coleman<00:00:09.900> number<00:00:10.230> 16<00:00:10.860> radiant

this this is a Coleman number 16 radiant
heater<00:00:11.820> it's<00:00:12.120> got<00:00:12.389> 7<00:00:13.320> ceramic<00:00:13.889> gradients<00:00:14.460> in

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
heater it's got 7 ceramic gradients in

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.970 
heater it's got 7 ceramic gradients in
it<00:00:14.730> burns<00:00:15.389> Coleman<00:00:15.990> fuel<00:00:16.289> which<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.619> also

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
it burns Coleman fuel which is also

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.400 
it burns Coleman fuel which is also
known<00:00:17.130> as<00:00:17.279> white<00:00:17.460> gas<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.600> was<00:00:18.720> pretty<00:00:18.960> common

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
known as white gas and was pretty common

radiant heater they made a couple bigger
ones<00:00:27.390> they<00:00:27.689> made<00:00:27.900> one<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.289> Marek<00:00:28.529> burned

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769

the this is the gas tank assembly it's
all<00:00:40.410> painted<00:00:41.040> I've<00:00:41.280> seen<00:00:41.579> some<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.210> we're

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
all painted I've seen some that we're

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.729 
all painted I've seen some that we're
done<00:00:42.600> up<00:00:42.750> in<00:00:42.870> brass<00:00:43.610> mines<00:00:44.610> all<00:00:44.850> painted<00:00:45.739> a

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
done up in brass mines all painted a

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.330 
done up in brass mines all painted a
fairly<00:00:47.280> normal<00:00:47.550> stove<00:00:48.539> type<00:00:48.989> generator<00:00:49.710> two

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
fairly normal stove type generator two

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.029 
fairly normal stove type generator two
controls<00:00:50.850> one<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.379> pricker<00:00:52.590> rod<00:00:52.829> like

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
controls one is the the pricker rod like

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.130 
controls one is the the pricker rod like
you'd<00:00:53.219> have<00:00:53.250> on<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.520> stove<00:00:54.120> but<00:00:54.780> then<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.079> is

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
you'd have on a stove but then this is

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.229 
you'd have on a stove but then this is
the<00:00:55.440> actual<00:00:55.739> valve<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.820> what<00:00:56.969> allows

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the actual valve this is what allows

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.920 
the actual valve this is what allows
fuel<00:00:57.629> up<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> generator<00:00:59.780> supposedly<00:01:00.780> it's

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
fuel up to the generator supposedly it's

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.860 
fuel up to the generator supposedly it's
possible<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.890> match<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:03.000> heater<00:01:03.300> I've

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
possible to match like this heater I've

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.390 
possible to match like this heater I've
never<00:01:04.110> been<00:01:04.320> able<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.589> pull<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:04.830> off<00:01:05.010> I

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
never been able to pull that off I

00:01:05.400 --> 00:02:06.270 
never been able to pull that off I
always<00:01:05.670> use<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> propane<00:01:06.570> torch<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.140> preheat

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.180 

there's<00:02:06.850> a<00:02:06.910> little<00:02:07.090> flame<00:02:07.800> there<00:02:08.800> at<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.070> end

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
there's a little flame there at the end

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.710 
there's a little flame there at the end
of<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.369> generator<00:02:09.790> is<00:02:10.030> a<00:02:10.090> good<00:02:10.240> hint<00:02:10.390> that<00:02:10.509> the

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
of the generator is a good hint that the

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.990 
of the generator is a good hint that the
generator<00:02:11.170> on<00:02:11.350> this<00:02:11.560> is<00:02:11.740> dirty<00:02:12.010> it's<00:02:12.820> just

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
generator on this is dirty it's just

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.810 
generator on this is dirty it's just
like<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.180> stove<00:02:13.510> generator<00:02:14.020> there's<00:02:14.350> just<00:02:14.590> a

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
like a stove generator there's just a

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.000 
like a stove generator there's just a
steel<00:02:15.820> tube<00:02:16.090> with<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:16.480> gas<00:02:17.080> tip<00:02:17.350> at<00:02:17.500> one<00:02:17.620> end<00:02:17.800> and

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
steel tube with a gas tip at one end and

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.120 
steel tube with a gas tip at one end and
there's<00:02:18.220> a<00:02:18.540> rod<00:02:19.540> that<00:02:19.780> runs<00:02:19.840> through<00:02:20.380> it<00:02:20.410> with

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
there's a rod that runs through it with

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.720 
there's a rod that runs through it with
the<00:02:21.220> pricker<00:02:21.430> rod<00:02:21.700> so<00:02:22.570> if<00:02:22.630> we<00:02:23.700> tighten<00:02:24.700> down

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
the pricker rod so if we tighten down

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.490 
the pricker rod so if we tighten down
the<00:02:25.060> main<00:02:25.270> valve<00:02:27.270> you<00:02:28.270> can<00:02:28.450> cut<00:02:28.690> off<00:02:28.810> gas<00:02:28.840> flow

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
the main valve you can cut off gas flow

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:46.010 
the main valve you can cut off gas flow
which<00:02:30.070> also<00:02:30.370> cleans<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:31.060> tip

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.380 

and<00:02:46.530> show<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:46.860> where<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.160> generator<00:02:47.610> is<00:02:47.880> and

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
and show you where the generator is and

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.380 
and show you where the generator is and
you<00:02:48.450> can<00:02:48.630> see<00:02:48.870> underneath<00:02:49.320> it<00:02:49.940> is<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:51.000> flame

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
you can see underneath it is a flame

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.830 
you can see underneath it is a flame
that<00:02:51.420> heats<00:02:51.930> just<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.710> generator<00:02:53.630> to<00:02:54.630> make

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
that heats just the generator to make

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.440 
that heats just the generator to make
sure<00:02:55.080> that<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:56.400> generator<00:02:56.880> is<00:02:57.120> always

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
sure that the generator is always

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.290 
sure that the generator is always
producing<00:02:58.050> gas
