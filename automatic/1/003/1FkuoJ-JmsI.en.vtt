00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.500
 and drag this by movement it's all 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.440
 you reduce this picture 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.840
 let's say reduced and that's it 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.150

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.259
 code once there is a picture you want to reduce 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:15.370

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.750
 so that the value string does not wake up 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.930
