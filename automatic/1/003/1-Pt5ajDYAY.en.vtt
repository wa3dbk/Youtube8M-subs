and<00:00:49.940> when<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:50.969> got<00:00:51.269> to<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.480> assignment<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.230> do

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
and when I got to the assignment to do

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.439 
and when I got to the assignment to do
this<00:00:52.500> model<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:52.949> started<00:00:53.670> doing<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:54.120> lot<00:00:54.390> of

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
this model I started doing a lot of

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.040 
this model I started doing a lot of
research<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:56.039> had<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.000> define<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.359> scale<00:00:57.780> of

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
research and I had to define a scale of

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.110 
research and I had to define a scale of
this<00:00:58.170> model<00:00:58.379> since<00:00:58.859> s<00:00:59.039> no<00:00:59.250> minifigures<00:00:59.730> in<00:01:00.000> it

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
this model since s no minifigures in it

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.680 
this model since s no minifigures in it
the<00:01:00.239> scale<00:01:00.480> was<00:01:00.750> up<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.890> me<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.699> did<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> lot<00:01:03.629> of

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
the scale was up to me so I did a lot of

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.020 
the scale was up to me so I did a lot of
research<00:01:04.050> in<00:01:04.290> our<00:01:04.470> element<00:01:04.890> portfolio<00:01:05.610> and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
research in our element portfolio and

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.300 
research in our element portfolio and
had<00:01:06.660> to<00:01:06.780> find<00:01:07.020> some<00:01:07.230> elements<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.830> would<00:01:08.070> be

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
had to find some elements that would be

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.190 
had to find some elements that would be
appropriate<00:01:08.760> for<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.210> one<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.990> biggest

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
appropriate for this one the biggest

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.860 
appropriate for this one the biggest
challenge<00:01:10.620> was<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.800> do<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.160> cockpit<00:01:11.520> part

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
challenge was to do the cockpit part

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.480 
challenge was to do the cockpit part
because<00:01:12.870> it's<00:01:13.050> round<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:14.130> don't<00:01:14.280> have

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
because it's round and we don't have

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.649 
because it's round and we don't have
that<00:01:14.550> many<00:01:14.909> round<00:01:15.479> elements<00:01:16.130> so<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.549> found<00:01:17.909> two

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
that many round elements so I found two

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.810 
that many round elements so I found two
motorcycle<00:01:19.350> wheels<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:20.040> some<00:01:20.640> old

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
motorcycle wheels and some old

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.880 
motorcycle wheels and some old
caterpillar<00:01:21.270> tracks<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:22.110> some<00:01:22.350> power<00:01:22.560> minus

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
caterpillar tracks and some power minus

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.340 
caterpillar tracks and some power minus
wheels<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.460> would<00:01:23.640> would<00:01:24.509> be<00:01:24.540> appropriate<00:01:24.900> i

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
wheels that would would be appropriate i

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.660 
wheels that would would be appropriate i
also<00:01:26.130> found<00:01:26.399> his<00:01:26.610> canopy<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.470> then<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:29.159> kind

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
also found his canopy and then that kind

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.200 
also found his canopy and then that kind
of<00:01:29.790> defined<00:01:30.149> the<00:01:30.299> scale<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.890> rest<00:01:32.100> i<00:01:32.460> also

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
of defined the scale and the rest i also

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.670 
of defined the scale and the rest i also
had<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.540> find<00:01:33.750> elements<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.170> would<00:01:34.350> be

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
had to find elements that would be

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.580 
had to find elements that would be
appropriate<00:01:34.890> for<00:01:35.630> but<00:01:36.630> we<00:01:36.840> do<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.409> lot<00:01:37.530> of

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
appropriate for but we do have a lot of

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.319 
appropriate for but we do have a lot of
angle<00:01:37.979> plates<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.610> different<00:01:38.939> angles<00:01:39.270> and

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
angle plates in different angles and

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.289 
angle plates in different angles and
stuff<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.560> wasn't<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.399> hard<00:01:41.610> these

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
stuff so that wasn't that hard these

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.810 
stuff so that wasn't that hard these
caterpillar<00:01:42.810> tracks<00:01:43.079> up<00:01:43.259> here<00:01:43.320> are

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
caterpillar tracks up here are

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.910 
caterpillar tracks up here are
originally<00:01:44.820> from<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:45.229> 1970s<00:01:46.229> technique

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
originally from a 1970s technique

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.039 
originally from a 1970s technique
bulldozer<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:48.180> never<00:01:48.450> been<00:01:48.719> produced

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
bulldozer and have never been produced

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.749 
bulldozer and have never been produced
in<00:01:49.170> other<00:01:49.320> colors<00:01:49.649> than<00:01:49.799> black<00:01:49.829> but<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.640> this

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
in other colors than black but in this

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.999 
in other colors than black but in this
model<00:01:51.090> they<00:01:51.210> are<00:01:51.329> fitted<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.750> light<00:01:51.960> grey<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.979> I

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
model they are fitted in light grey so I

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.620 
model they are fitted in light grey so I
guess<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.520> will<00:01:53.610> be<00:01:53.789> really<00:01:53.969> unique<00:01:54.360> for<00:01:54.509> this

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
guess it will be really unique for this

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.370 
guess it will be really unique for this
model<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.320> model<00:01:55.530> doesn't<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.670> big

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
model this model doesn't have that big

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.719 
model this model doesn't have that big
part<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.680> movies<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.369> doesn't<00:01:59.640> have

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
part of the movies so it doesn't have

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.120 
part of the movies so it doesn't have
that<00:01:59.850> many<00:02:00.030> functions<00:02:00.600> but<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:01.380> has<00:02:01.590> foldable

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
that many functions but it has foldable

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.940 
that many functions but it has foldable
wings<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:03.090> rotating<00:02:03.570> cockpit<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:06.950> when

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
wings and a rotating cockpit and when

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.140 
wings and a rotating cockpit and when
the<00:02:08.220> Starfighter<00:02:08.820> flies<00:02:09.320> in<00:02:10.320> space<00:02:11.160> the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
the Starfighter flies in space the

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.280 
the Starfighter flies in space the
cockpit<00:02:12.510> will<00:02:12.690> rotate<00:02:13.080> like<00:02:13.230> this<00:02:13.460> and<00:02:15.290> when

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
cockpit will rotate like this and when

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.520 
cockpit will rotate like this and when
it's<00:02:16.470> landing<00:02:17.480> it's<00:02:18.480> got<00:02:18.840> these<00:02:18.989> vulnerable

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
it's landing it's got these vulnerable

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.520 
it's landing it's got these vulnerable
wings

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
wings

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.500 
wings
so<00:02:21.830> it<00:02:21.950> would<00:02:22.100> land<00:02:22.280> like<00:02:22.490> this<00:02:25.060> it's<00:02:26.060> also<00:02:26.270> got

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
so it would land like this it's also got

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.090 
so it would land like this it's also got
a<00:02:26.569> lot<00:02:26.780> of<00:02:26.810> guns<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.700> cannons<00:02:29.890> but<00:02:30.890> they<00:02:31.040> are

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
a lot of guns and cannons but they are

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.100 
a lot of guns and cannons but they are
not<00:02:31.250> non-functional<00:02:32.120> in<00:02:32.300> this<00:02:32.450> model<00:02:32.780> so<00:02:33.080> that

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
not non-functional in this model so that

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.949 
not non-functional in this model so that
just<00:02:33.620> for<00:02:33.770> display<00:02:33.970> my<00:02:34.970> favorite<00:02:35.480> element<00:02:35.810> in

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
just for display my favorite element in

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.900 
just for display my favorite element in
this<00:02:36.080> model<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.920> element<00:02:37.250> that<00:02:37.459> actually

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
this model and the element that actually

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.960 
this model and the element that actually
made<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:39.290> possible<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.250> build<00:02:40.459> this<00:02:40.610> model<00:02:40.910> in

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
made it possible to build this model in

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.900 
made it possible to build this model in
the<00:02:41.090> way<00:02:41.209> I<00:02:41.239> did<00:02:41.390> is<00:02:41.720> this<00:02:42.160> brand<00:02:43.160> new<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.760> buy

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
the way I did is this brand new to buy

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.559 
the way I did is this brand new to buy
to<00:02:44.110> anchor<00:02:45.110> plate<00:02:45.350> with<00:02:45.650> studs<00:02:45.980> on<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.280> sides

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
to anchor plate with studs on the sides

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.340 
to anchor plate with studs on the sides
which<00:02:47.569> allows<00:02:47.959> me<00:02:47.989> to<00:02:48.319> build<00:02:48.530> a<00:02:49.180> in<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:51.200> way<00:02:51.319> I

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
which allows me to build a in the way I

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.870 
which allows me to build a in the way I
do<00:02:51.470> here<00:02:52.420> so<00:02:53.420> I<00:02:53.780> have<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.440> lot<00:02:54.769> of<00:02:54.800> them<00:02:54.980> all<00:02:55.580> the

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
do here so I have a lot of them all the

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.000 
do here so I have a lot of them all the
way<00:02:55.970> down<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.720> spine<00:02:57.050> you<00:02:57.440> could<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:57.980> could

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
way down the spine you could you could

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.530 
way down the spine you could you could
say<00:02:58.390> sits<00:02:59.390> like<00:02:59.570> this<00:02:59.630> and<00:03:00.880> these<00:03:01.880> two<00:03:02.120> parts

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
say sits like this and these two parts

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.740 
say sits like this and these two parts
left<00:03:03.290> and<00:03:03.530> right<00:03:03.680> actually<00:03:04.280> totally<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.720> same

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
left and right actually totally the same

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.259 
left and right actually totally the same
just<00:03:06.200> mirrored<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:06.769> the<00:03:07.730> way<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:07.910> model<00:03:08.209> is

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
just mirrored and the way the model is

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.150 
just mirrored and the way the model is
built<00:03:08.420> as<00:03:08.660> I<00:03:08.870> just<00:03:09.170> place<00:03:09.410> them<00:03:09.560> together<00:03:09.709> like

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
built as I just place them together like

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.080 
built as I just place them together like
this<00:03:11.200> then<00:03:12.200> I<00:03:12.319> have<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.500> lot<00:03:12.709> of<00:03:12.739> parts<00:03:13.190> where<00:03:14.060> I

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
this then I have a lot of parts where I

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.220 
this then I have a lot of parts where I
use<00:03:14.390> these<00:03:14.750> special<00:03:15.290> stats<00:03:15.620> these<00:03:16.459> bricks<00:03:17.230> all

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
use these special stats these bricks all

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.250 
use these special stats these bricks all
the<00:03:18.530> way<00:03:18.650> up<00:03:18.830> here<00:03:19.100> to<00:03:19.930> keep<00:03:20.930> them<00:03:21.110> together

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
the way up here to keep them together

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.229 
the way up here to keep them together
and<00:03:21.620> actually<00:03:22.310> makes<00:03:22.700> a<00:03:22.819> really<00:03:23.030> really

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
and actually makes a really really

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:31.199 
and actually makes a really really
stable<00:03:23.690> model<00:03:24.489> so<00:03:25.489> for<00:03:26.299> this<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:29.540> little

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
stable model so for this and a little

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.080 
stable model so for this and a little
extra<00:03:32.209> parts<00:03:32.510> here<00:03:33.079> and<00:03:33.110> there<00:03:33.880> makes<00:03:34.880> the

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
extra parts here and there makes the

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.900 
extra parts here and there makes the
whole<00:03:35.209> wing<00:03:35.450> and<00:03:36.310> basically<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:37.489> whole<00:03:37.579> model

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
whole wing and basically the whole model

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.440 
whole wing and basically the whole model
is<00:03:38.000> built<00:03:39.040> mirrored<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:40.340> then<00:03:40.970> just<00:03:41.239> put

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
is built mirrored and then just put

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.870 
is built mirrored and then just put
together<00:03:41.769> so<00:03:42.769> what<00:03:42.950> I<00:03:42.980> can<00:03:43.190> do<00:03:43.280> now<00:03:43.489> is<00:03:43.519> take

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
together so what I can do now is take

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.819 
together so what I can do now is take
the<00:03:44.329> top<00:03:44.540> part<00:03:44.780> which<00:03:45.019> is<00:03:45.049> building<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.530> same

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
the top part which is building the same

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:51.430 
the top part which is building the same
way<00:03:46.989> and<00:03:47.989> fit<00:03:48.380> them<00:03:48.410> together<00:03:50.260> click<00:03:51.260> on<00:03:51.380> the

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
way and fit them together click on the

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:58.610 
way and fit them together click on the
wings

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.679 

and<00:04:00.989> lower<00:04:01.989> con<00:04:02.319> at<00:04:03.129> the<00:04:03.310> end<00:04:03.400> and<00:04:03.700> there<00:04:04.629> you

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:04.689 
and lower con at the end and there you

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.019 
and lower con at the end and there you
have<00:04:04.719> the<00:04:04.840> model
