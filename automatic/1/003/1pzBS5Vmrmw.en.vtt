00:00:02.437 --> 00:00:05.094
 Do you think our crash was a coincidence here? 

00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:09.225
 Each of us has been brought here for a reason. 

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:11.297
 And by whom then John? 

00:00:11.827 --> 00:00:12.747
 Through the island. 

00:00:13.137 --> 00:00:17.102
 I looked into this island and what I saw ... 

00:00:21.932 --> 00:00:23.032
 was beautiful. 

00:00:23.352 --> 00:00:26.184
 Why do you find it so hard to believe? - Why do you find it so easy? 

00:00:26.405 --> 00:00:27.787
 It has never been easy! 

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:30.971
 Despite your loyalty to the island .... 

00:00:31.311 --> 00:00:34.151
 you had to watch your daughter get shot in front of your own eyes. 

00:00:34.522 --> 00:00:36.451
 And your reward? You were banned. 

00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:40.690
 And you did all this for a man you've never met. 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.722
 A man named Jacob. 

00:00:44.072 --> 00:00:45.412
 I'm going to see Jacob. 

00:00:53.264 --> 00:00:55.744
 Do you know how much I want to kill you? 

00:00:56.304 --> 00:00:57.134
 Yes. 

00:00:57.334 --> 00:00:59.646
 Someday I find a way, my friend. 

00:01:00.216 --> 00:01:02.856
 Why are we going to Jacob? - So I can kill him. 

00:01:03.535 --> 00:01:04.686
 You've found a way, I see. 

00:01:04.946 --> 00:01:06.538
 Indeed. 

00:01:08.887 --> 00:01:10.168
 If this is Locke ... 

00:01:12.348 --> 00:01:13.289
 then who's in there? 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.031
 Do not leave me. 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.700
 I love you James. - No. 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.020
 I love you so much. - No! 

00:01:24.621 --> 00:01:27.551
 Juliet! No! 

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:30.433
 Come on, asshole! 

00:01:33.877 --> 00:01:35.290
 They are coming. 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.510
 We are still on the island. 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.640
 Where's Jacob? - Jacob is dead. 

00:01:55.802 --> 00:01:56.863
 What are you? 

00:01:59.302 --> 00:02:00.323
 You were wrong! 

00:02:12.336 --> 00:02:14.046
 Don't tell me what I can't do! 

00:02:14.488 --> 00:02:16.348
 What does he want from me? - I do not know! 

00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:20.122
 I promise I'll tell you everything.
