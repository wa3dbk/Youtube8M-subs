polygons

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.930 

so<00:06:27.419> you<00:06:27.509> carrying<00:06:27.900> hot<00:06:28.319> water<00:06:28.560> from<00:06:28.710> here<00:06:29.039> into

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
so you carrying hot water from here into

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.140 
so you carrying hot water from here into
the<00:06:30.900> inner<00:06:31.050> killer<00:06:31.319> down<00:06:31.470> below

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
the inner killer down below

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.980 
the inner killer down below
go<00:06:32.720> there

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.950 

cool<00:06:35.350> water<00:06:35.560> return<00:06:35.920> lines<00:06:36.330> and<00:06:37.330> carry<00:06:37.810> more

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
cool water return lines and carry more

cool water return lines and carry more
eat<00:06:38.110> away<00:06:38.200> so<00:06:38.350> you're<00:06:38.890> actually<00:06:39.100> a<00:06:39.280> two-step

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:39.760 
eat away so you're actually a two-step

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.930 
eat away so you're actually a two-step
process<00:06:39.790> yeah<00:06:40.920> is<00:06:41.920> that<00:06:41.980> in<00:06:42.250> order<00:06:42.310> to<00:06:42.580> get<00:06:42.730> the

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
process yeah is that in order to get the

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.000 
process yeah is that in order to get the
higher<00:06:43.330> efficiency<00:06:43.960> of<00:06:44.230> cooling<00:06:44.590> system<00:06:44.890> in

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.010 
higher efficiency of cooling system in

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.340 
higher efficiency of cooling system in
the<00:06:45.100> small<00:06:45.310> space<00:06:45.610> exactly<00:06:46.600> okay<00:06:46.930> you're

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:47.350 
the small space exactly okay you're

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.710 
the small space exactly okay you're
carrying<00:06:47.710> that<00:06:47.860> new<00:06:48.070> through

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720
