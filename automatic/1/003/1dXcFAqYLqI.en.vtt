 I'm back with all of you and 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.960
 welcome to a new video of gta 5 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.670
 online and today I bring you a new trick a 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.530
 new walk berizzo a new failure in the 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.139
 map that we will be able to shoot 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.699
 absolutely to everyone who passes and does not 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.020
 they are going to be able to shoot at us 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.210
 we are players are the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.760
 police other characters here from the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.650
 own game is so so 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.300
 of an egg in this part of the map we're going 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.490
 to be in this back of the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.140
 showcase this we will be able to see but 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.360
 they will not be able to shoot us according to 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.950
 is going to be the franchable crystal from 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.480
 inside but not from outside they are not going to 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.739
 be able to shoot at us good 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.559
 simply we have to go to this 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.930
 area of ​​the map that you see is very very 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.640
 near the area that is usually the most 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.710
 elapsed of the game near the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.500
 expensive apartments more or less about 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.940
 400 or 500 meters therefore it will be 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.670
 an area that we will be able to use very 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.440
 well to be able to make ours what 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.590
 next we need is a vehicle 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.760
 big can be an all-rounder like 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.989
 karim revel I have not gotten it in fact 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.329
 it's up here that you're going to see it 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.630
 but I recommend you call 911 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.939
 take out the phone the cell phone 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.680
 and already my 911 or the service 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.689
 emergencies and ask for services 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.360
 toilets with the ambulance simply 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.340
 we put it here and go up 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.049
 agree do not worry because it fits 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.329
 perfectly goes up perfectly 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.710
 stairs and let's go to the area is 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:24.270
 that we have here a kind of door 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.619
 of glass there you are seeing the street 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.020
 glimpse with the one that tried before the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.000
 trick but I have not managed to get there I do not know 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.619
 I do not guarantee that it can be done so 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.479
 I have not got it but good as 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.270
 you see here the vehicle looks a little bit and 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.039
 we are going to park in this part of the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.810
 the glass door is simply what 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.670
 we're going to do now lowering of 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.200
 the ambulance we 're going to get on the 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.799
 top of the ambulance and let's go 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.319
 to jump 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.819
 here it's worth we jump and as you see 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:49.200
 we went through the wall above and now 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.390
 very important guys what we have to 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.039
 do is point down and look at 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.420
 what is this hole that I'm going to 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:55.979
 happen now how are you going to see I'm going to do 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.630
 several examples of what you should not 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.819
 do I have to throw around here but 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.950
 If you see me here, I'm going to happen 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.959
 the area and I fall worth this is the part 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.819
 in which you have to turn to the right 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.170
 a little I will repeat here as 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.420
 you are seeing here as you see the 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.039
 part of the ground below you come a 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.020
 little to the right and you caixa and there 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.120
 you want perfectly and 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.100
 be within the gray world now another 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.800
 once you have to take a little care 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.060
 the part where we're within 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.950
 of the showcase as you are seeing here 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.330
 we are inside the east building and what 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.460
 what we have to do is stay in the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.020
 gray corner that we have here if we 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.910
 we go we go here too much to the 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.370
 left as you see we fall and we 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.900
 we kill so you already know exactly 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.220
 where do you have to be that is this area 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.450
 hence, advance a little bit the 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.430
 video in which she has put together a 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.780
 little attention from the police and you go 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.510
 to see that the police can not 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.340
 shoot link like that is done here a 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.380
 little bit the crazy ones a little the Swedes 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.180

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.500
 Do absolutely what you want with 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.940
