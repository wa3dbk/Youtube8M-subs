00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
and the very same can be said about the

and the very same can be said about the
minecraft<00:02:03.790> xbox<00:02:04.180> one<00:02:04.270> it<00:02:04.570> will<00:02:04.659> probably<00:02:04.900> be

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
minecraft xbox one it will probably be

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.679 
minecraft xbox one it will probably be
early<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.979> mid<00:02:06.220> April<00:02:06.670> before<00:02:06.820> we<00:02:07.210> seeders<00:02:07.600> and

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
early to mid April before we seeders and

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.289 
early to mid April before we seeders and
I<00:02:08.409> know<00:02:08.560> it's<00:02:08.830> very<00:02:08.950> disappointing<00:02:09.220> i<00:02:09.849> myself

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 
I know it's very disappointing i myself

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.089 
I know it's very disappointing i myself
was<00:02:10.479> personally<00:02:11.140> hoping<00:02:11.439> we<00:02:11.620> would<00:02:11.830> have<00:02:11.980> in

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
was personally hoping we would have in

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.640 
was personally hoping we would have in
mid-march<00:02:12.459> i<00:02:12.790> had<00:02:13.180> myself<00:02:13.360> convinced<00:02:13.569> i<00:02:14.049> just

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
mid-march i had myself convinced i just

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.830 
mid-march i had myself convinced i just
taught<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:15.099> we<00:02:15.250> would<00:02:15.489> have<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.239> mid<00:02:16.510> March

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
taught that we would have it mid March

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.110 
taught that we would have it mid March
but<00:02:17.109> unfortunately<00:02:17.859> we<00:02:18.159> are<00:02:18.279> not<00:02:18.310> getting<00:02:18.790> it

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
but unfortunately we are not getting it

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.179 
but unfortunately we are not getting it
mid-march<00:02:20.019> I<00:02:20.290> suppose<00:02:20.590> there's<00:02:20.829> so<00:02:21.010> much

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
mid-march I suppose there's so much

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:22.000 
mid-march I suppose there's so much
saying<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.639> ball

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010
