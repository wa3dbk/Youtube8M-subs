00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
those are just the time brackets that

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.950 
those are just the time brackets that
I've<00:01:14.790> specifically<00:01:15.299> picked<00:01:15.450> out<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:15.930> I

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
I've specifically picked out and that I

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.929 
I've specifically picked out and that I
will<00:01:16.290> be<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.650> especially<00:01:17.280> this<00:01:17.430> week<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.820> might

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
will be on especially this week it might

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.670 
will be on especially this week it might
change<00:01:18.210> next<00:01:18.659> week<00:01:18.900> but<00:01:19.110> probably<00:01:19.500> not

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
change next week but probably not

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.109 
change next week but probably not
because<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.189> feel<00:01:20.549> like<00:01:20.580> those<00:01:20.759> times<00:01:21.000> are

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119
