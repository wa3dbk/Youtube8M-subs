00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
you've got a dodgy RF cable you would

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.330 
you've got a dodgy RF cable you would
have<00:01:54.210> no<00:01:54.360> idea<00:01:54.390> if<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.380> console<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.009> actually

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
have no idea if the console is actually

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.209 
have no idea if the console is actually
working<00:01:56.659> that's<00:01:57.659> pretty<00:01:57.840> cool<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.290> they<00:01:59.009> put

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
working that's pretty cool and they put

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.730 
working that's pretty cool and they put
the<00:01:59.310> rear<00:01:59.490> set<00:01:59.729> back<00:01:59.939> at<00:02:00.479> reset<00:02:01.049> button<00:02:01.350> back

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
the rear set back at reset button back

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.029 
the rear set back at reset button back
on<00:02:01.950> grown<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.880> it's<00:02:04.340> 16<00:02:05.340> bit<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.740> yes<00:02:07.740> by<00:02:08.009> the

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
on grown and it's 16 bit and yes by the

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.760 
on grown and it's 16 bit and yes by the
way<00:02:08.160> it's<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.759> Sega<00:02:09.090> Mega<00:02:09.390> Drive<00:02:09.479> number<00:02:10.259> two

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
way it's the Sega Mega Drive number two

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.440 
way it's the Sega Mega Drive number two
I<00:02:11.830> think<00:02:12.220> there<00:02:12.370> are<00:02:12.400> three<00:02:12.700> models<00:02:13.090> and

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
I think there are three models and

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.690 
I think there are three models and
they're<00:02:14.230> all<00:02:14.410> different<00:02:14.710> and<00:02:15.100> this<00:02:15.400> is<00:02:15.490> the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
they're all different and this is the

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.270 
they're all different and this is the
number<00:02:15.820> to<00:02:16.000> model<00:02:16.680> now<00:02:17.680> as<00:02:17.770> you<00:02:17.860> can<00:02:17.950> see<00:02:18.010> this

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
number to model now as you can see this

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.540 
number to model now as you can see this
is<00:02:18.430> really<00:02:18.730> weird<00:02:19.060> hump<00:02:19.750> in<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.980> middle<00:02:21.520> of

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
is really weird hump in the middle of

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.030 
is really weird hump in the middle of
the<00:02:21.610> console<00:02:22.030> there<00:02:22.270> that<00:02:23.050> we<00:02:23.260> put<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.560> master

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
the console there that we put the master

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.400 
the console there that we put the master
system<00:02:24.250> power<00:02:24.850> base<00:02:25.030> converter<00:02:25.200> which<00:02:26.200> means

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
system power base converter which means

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.630 
system power base converter which means
if<00:02:26.530> you<00:02:26.590> buy<00:02:26.770> one<00:02:26.800> of<00:02:26.980> these<00:02:27.160> you<00:02:27.430> have<00:02:27.520> the

if you buy one of these you have the

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.880 
if you buy one of these you have the
converter<00:02:27.970> you<00:02:28.930> can<00:02:29.050> ultimately<00:02:29.170> play<00:02:29.770> all

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890

your Sega Mega Drive and Master System

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.050 
your Sega Mega Drive and Master System
games<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:33.130> that's<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.520> groove<00:02:33.730> where<00:02:33.970> you

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
games and that's the groove where you

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.860 
games and that's the groove where you
put<00:02:34.270> it<00:02:34.300> on<00:02:34.450> top<00:02:34.690> so<00:02:35.260> it's<00:02:35.380> pretty<00:02:35.500> sweet<00:02:35.860> and

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
put it on top so it's pretty sweet and

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.230 
put it on top so it's pretty sweet and
the<00:02:37.870> flap<00:02:38.170> isn't<00:02:38.590> big<00:02:39.100> hatch<00:02:39.400> like<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.850> Master

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
the flap isn't big hatch like the Master

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.040 
the flap isn't big hatch like the Master
System<00:02:41.310> it's<00:02:42.310> got<00:02:42.490> like<00:02:42.610> Louisville<00:02:43.050> things

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050

that's<00:02:44.380> pretty<00:02:44.590> cool<00:02:44.770> now<00:02:45.810> what<00:02:46.810> does<00:02:46.990> the

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
that's pretty cool now what does the

this<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:05.250> thing<00:04:05.460> I<00:04:05.550> like<00:04:05.580> about<00:04:05.760> this<00:04:06.000> console

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
this the thing I like about this console

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.820 
this the thing I like about this console
is<00:04:06.810> it<00:04:07.050> has<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.910> be<00:04:08.990> previously<00:04:09.990> on<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.410> Master

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
is it has a be previously on the Master

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.580 
is it has a be previously on the Master
System<00:04:10.980> you<00:04:11.310> have<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.520> use<00:04:11.640> RF<00:04:12.180> making<00:04:12.870> news<00:04:13.050> AV

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
System you have to use RF making news AV

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.830 
System you have to use RF making news AV
so<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.370> can<00:04:14.460> get<00:04:15.290> better<00:04:16.290> sound<00:04:16.860> quality

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
so you can get better sound quality

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.170 
so you can get better sound quality
however<00:04:18.840> unfortunately<00:04:20.209> um<00:04:21.860> little<00:04:22.860> input<00:04:23.580> is

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
however unfortunately um little input is

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.610 
however unfortunately um little input is
a<00:04:24.240> little<00:04:24.570> bit<00:04:24.660> different<00:04:25.020> to<00:04:25.140> the<00:04:25.230> master

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
a little bit different to the master

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.260 
a little bit different to the master
system<00:04:25.800> and<00:04:26.220> your<00:04:26.670> normal<00:04:26.990> RF<00:04:27.990> cables<00:04:28.740> so<00:04:29.280> you

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
system and your normal RF cables so you

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.180 
system and your normal RF cables so you
can't<00:04:30.450> just<00:04:30.510> use<00:04:30.840> an<00:04:31.110> RF<00:04:31.500> cable<00:04:31.770> it's<00:04:31.980> lying

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
can't just use an RF cable it's lying

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.620 
can't just use an RF cable it's lying
around<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.610> house<00:04:32.850> which<00:04:33.240> is<00:04:33.390> very
