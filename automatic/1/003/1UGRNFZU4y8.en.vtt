00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.130 
it only in the litter box if I can so a
good<00:01:11.100> thing<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.460> have<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:12.060> like<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.479> hay<00:01:12.659> rack<00:01:12.840> or

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
good thing to have is like a hay rack or

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.730 
good thing to have is like a hay rack or
a<00:01:13.200> haven<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:13.979> your<00:01:14.130> litter<00:01:14.310> box<00:01:15.110> right<00:01:16.110> here<00:01:16.380> I

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
a haven in your litter box right here I

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.010 
a haven in your litter box right here I
just<00:01:16.770> have<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.460> sitting<00:01:18.229> on<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.619> litter<00:01:21.020> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
just have it sitting on the litter the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.320 
just have it sitting on the litter the
reason<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.530> don't<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:23.340> way<00:01:23.640> as<00:01:23.820> much<00:01:23.850> is

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
reason I don't like that way as much is

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.289 
reason I don't like that way as much is
because<00:01:24.630> they<00:01:24.810> can<00:01:24.960> pee<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.320> poop<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.729> a

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
because they can pee and poop on it so a

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.480 
because they can pee and poop on it so a
good<00:01:27.720> idea<00:01:28.020> might<00:01:28.229> be<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.470> have<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.890> hay<00:01:29.100> rack<00:01:29.310> or

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
good idea might be to have a hay rack or

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.020 
good idea might be to have a hay rack or
-<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.049> like<00:01:31.170> this<00:01:31.470> though<00:01:31.770> because<00:01:32.040> my

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
- I have it like this though because my

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.859 
- I have it like this though because my
hair<00:01:33.869> acts<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.619> have<00:01:35.360> don't<00:01:36.360> really<00:01:36.630> work

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
hair acts that I have don't really work

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.899

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
something to do with the smell or just a

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.280 
something to do with the smell or just a
psychological<00:03:03.350> thing<00:03:03.800> so<00:03:04.700> yeah<00:03:05.330> that's
