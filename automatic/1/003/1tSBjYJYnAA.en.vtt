want to hit and keys off of the old ones

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.420 
want to hit and keys off of the old ones
because<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.539> can<00:00:30.749> reuse<00:00:31.499> the<00:00:31.679> factory<00:00:31.859> OEM

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
because I can reuse the factory OEM

because I can reuse the factory OEM
plugs<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.210> make<00:00:33.570> another<00:00:33.900> set<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:36.260> computer

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
plugs and make another set of computer

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.540 
plugs and make another set of computer
override<00:00:38.720> lights<00:00:39.720> and<00:00:41.630> so<00:00:43.070> anyway<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.400> deal

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
override lights and so anyway the deal

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.550 
override lights and so anyway the deal
is<00:00:44.820> these<00:00:45.120> are<00:00:45.570> right<00:00:45.660> here<00:00:45.870> with<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.200> sensor

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560 
is these are right here with the sensor

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.240 
is these are right here with the sensor
on<00:00:46.740> them<00:00:46.890> at<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.040> bottom<00:00:47.220> there<00:00:48.980> man<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.010> think

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
on them at the bottom there man I think

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.400 
on them at the bottom there man I think
they<00:00:50.460> cost<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:50.850> much<00:00:51.150> it's<00:00:51.360> ridiculous<00:00:51.840> it's

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
they cost so much it's ridiculous it's

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.100 
they cost so much it's ridiculous it's
it's<00:00:52.829> silly<00:00:53.130> and<00:00:54.140> all<00:00:55.140> these<00:00:55.320> companies

charging you all this money to do the

charging you all this money to do the
little<00:01:00.030> bit<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.300> engineering<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:01.079> takes<00:01:01.320> to

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
little bit of engineering it takes to

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.830 
little bit of engineering it takes to
make<00:01:02.310> it<00:01:02.489> hook<00:01:02.910> up<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.450> way<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.690> doesn't

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
make it hook up that way it doesn't

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.200 
make it hook up that way it doesn't
throw<00:01:04.140> codes<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.829> start<00:01:05.700> reading<00:01:05.880> funny

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
throw codes and start reading funny

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.029 
throw codes and start reading funny
stuff<00:01:06.539> across<00:01:06.840> your<00:01:06.990> -<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.530> everything<00:01:07.859> else

stuff across your - and everything else
and<00:01:08.429> there<00:01:08.969> it<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.499> works<00:01:10.499> like<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> champ<00:01:12.439> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
and there it is works like a champ the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.469 
and there it is works like a champ the

and it's got a lifetime warranty on

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.910 
and it's got a lifetime warranty on
these<00:01:26.600> this<00:01:27.600> with<00:01:27.719> a<00:01:27.749> lifetime<00:01:28.229> warranty

there's<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.490> little<00:01:29.789> LED<00:01:31.670> put<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.789> zip<00:01:32.969> ties

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
there's the little LED put the zip ties

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.580 
there's the little LED put the zip ties
there<00:01:33.569> just<00:01:34.079> just<00:01:34.229> for<00:01:36.049> hold<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.200> up<00:01:37.319> a<00:01:37.439> little

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
there just just for hold it up a little

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.039 
there just just for hold it up a little
bit<00:01:37.799> more<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.069> guess<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:39.090> does<00:01:39.299> have<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> factory

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
bit more I guess it does have a factory

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.649 
bit more I guess it does have a factory
plug<00:01:40.289> that's<00:01:41.249> plugging<00:01:41.819> it<00:01:41.939> through<00:01:42.179> a<00:01:42.329> hole

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
plug that's plugging it through a hole

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.599 
plug that's plugging it through a hole
on<00:01:43.670> to<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.850> actual<00:01:45.179> AR<00:01:45.630> but<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.799> wanted<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.219> I

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:47.609 
on to the actual AR but I wanted to I

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:49.910 
on to the actual AR but I wanted to I
didn't<00:01:48.179> you<00:01:48.929> know<00:01:48.959> because<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.499> the<00:01:49.560> beats<00:01:49.740> in

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
didn't you know because of the beats in

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.399 
didn't you know because of the beats in
this<00:01:50.069> thing<00:01:50.389> everything<00:01:51.389> vibrates<00:01:51.749> then<00:01:52.229> one

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
this thing everything vibrates then one

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.779 
this thing everything vibrates then one
knocked<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.740> ball<00:01:52.889> belt<00:01:53.189> look<00:01:53.369> just

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
knocked the ball belt look just

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.389 
knocked the ball belt look just
vibration<00:01:54.359> so<00:01:54.770> extra<00:01:55.770> little<00:01:55.950> zip<00:01:56.159> ties

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
vibration so extra little zip ties

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.529 
vibration so extra little zip ties
dirtied<00:01:56.969> up<00:01:57.119> anyway<00:01:57.979> working<00:01:58.979> great<00:02:00.619> you<00:02:01.619> know

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
dirtied up anyway working great you know

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.029 
dirtied up anyway working great you know
there's<00:02:03.539> a<00:02:03.689> little<00:02:03.990> your<00:02:04.139> light<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.649> mean<00:02:04.889> it

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
there's a little your light I mean it

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.940 
there's a little your light I mean it
just<00:02:05.219> stays<00:02:05.399> on<00:02:05.579> for<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.909> second

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
just stays on for a second

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.030 
just stays on for a second
goes<00:02:07.430> off<00:02:09.130> it<00:02:10.130> does<00:02:10.340> purge<00:02:11.080> just<00:02:12.080> fine<00:02:12.350> and

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
goes off it does purge just fine and

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.680 
goes off it does purge just fine and
knows<00:02:13.430> when<00:02:13.640> it's<00:02:13.790> too<00:02:13.940> high<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.360> those<00:02:14.510> when

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
knows when it's too high and those when

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.470 
knows when it's too high and those when
it's<00:02:14.810> too<00:02:14.960> low<00:02:15.460> because<00:02:16.460> of<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.820> other<00:02:17.000> sensor

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
it's too low because of the other sensor

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.630 
it's too low because of the other sensor
it's<00:02:18.050> on<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.290> front<00:02:18.500> side<00:02:18.710> of<00:02:18.740> the<00:02:18.860> AR<00:02:19.310> lower

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
it's on the front side of the AR lower

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.680 
it's on the front side of the AR lower
control<00:02:20.000> arm<00:02:20.270> so<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:21.530> know<00:02:22.450> anybody's<00:02:23.450> got

can't<00:02:45.800> be<00:02:45.920> too<00:02:46.100> much<00:02:46.250> resistant<00:02:46.820> so<00:02:46.970> the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
can't be too much resistant so the

can't be too much resistant so the
computer<00:02:47.450> will<00:02:47.630> notice<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.080> difference<00:02:48.500> that

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
computer will notice the difference that

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.140 
computer will notice the difference that
it's<00:02:48.890> not<00:02:49.750> not<00:02:50.750> doing<00:02:51.080> it<00:02:51.200> so<00:02:51.880> there<00:02:52.880> you<00:02:53.000> go

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
it's not not doing it so there you go
