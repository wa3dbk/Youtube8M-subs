00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.099
 yes hello you love 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.710
 There is once again an unboxing video 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.630
 and I have under 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:20.010
 Package from our new sponsors 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.010
 get the company 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:29.070
 and I already have that on facebook 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:32.460
 page made known that one of the 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.699
 company sponsored now fits too 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.840
 All right, the package is already there 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:41.970
 his next weekend 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.720
 at our club club tournament is 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:48.960
 and the versatility above all and us 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.220
 since before on the route still 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.220
 be trained a lot 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:03.559
 Above all, we want the whole thing 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.559
 also try the long haul 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.100
 they coach 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:37.020
 this is more of a starter set for all those 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:41.130
 do not know what it is at all the 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.399
 is a so called headset for the 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.250
 three and for the coach 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:50.069
 and what's more about these victories? 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.700
 is the whole thing running on bluetooth 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:57.330
 the connection here and there is the 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.179
 connection to the rider just a lot 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.179
 better understanding is much better 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.179
 and 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.649
 Now I read what and thought 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.930
 I am really happy about it I have me 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.930
 the color is not selected but 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.370
 pink so the color of the question 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:31.480
 At least that is 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:34.019
 pink exactly look at that are the 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.019
 nazis 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.040
 so 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:54.909
 from the size of the palm 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:03:01.239
 just here, for example, to the bailiff 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:03:02.079
 poke to start and am 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:08.079
 really curious 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:10.060
 have all the way here to charge for 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:15.359
 the outlet is still a cable to 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:19.439
 pads for second devices and of course 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.439
 the headsets themselves 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.780
 Yes 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:54.180
 that's exactly what it is 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:56.659
 yes so-called button in the ear that everyone 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.659
 knows 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.620

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.620
