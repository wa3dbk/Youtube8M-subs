often referred to as neurons your brain
has<00:00:23.310> about<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.699> hundred<00:00:23.880> billion<00:00:24.810> neurons<00:00:25.699> to

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
has about a hundred billion neurons to

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.269 
has about a hundred billion neurons to
give<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.060> an<00:00:27.180> idea<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.599> its<00:00:27.869> size<00:00:28.109> if<00:00:28.619> every

brain cell or neuron was to equal one

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.000 
brain cell or neuron was to equal one
second<00:00:32.850> then<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.690> number<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.260> neurons<00:00:34.770> you

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
second then the number of neurons you

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.370 
second then the number of neurons you
would<00:00:35.160> have<00:00:35.430> would<00:00:35.790> equal<00:00:36.270> eight<00:00:36.540> years<00:00:37.079> and

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
would have would equal eight years and

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.920 
would have would equal eight years and
three<00:00:37.890> months

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
three months

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.510 
three months
imagine<00:00:39.930> counting<00:00:40.410> every<00:00:40.860> second<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.399> your

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
imagine counting every second of your

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.910 
imagine counting every second of your
life<00:00:41.579> both<00:00:42.270> day<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.780> night<00:00:42.989> for<00:00:43.590> eight<00:00:43.890> years

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
life both day and night for eight years

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.029 
life both day and night for eight years
and<00:00:44.640> three<00:00:45.090> months<00:00:45.500> that's<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.739> lot<00:00:46.920> of

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
and three months that's a lot of

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.310 
and three months that's a lot of
counting<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.820> therefore<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> lot<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.899> neurons

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
counting and therefore a lot of neurons

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.580 
counting and therefore a lot of neurons
and<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:50.520> lot<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.120> opportunity<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.410> be

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
and a lot of opportunity for you to be

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.580 
and a lot of opportunity for you to be
clever<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.250> smart<00:00:54.079> the<00:00:55.079> trick<00:00:55.379> is

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
clever and smart the trick is

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.189 
clever and smart the trick is
understanding<00:00:55.800> how<00:00:56.789> your<00:00:57.090> brain<00:00:57.420> works<00:00:57.750> so

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
understanding how your brain works so

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.840 
understanding how your brain works so
that<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.800> can<00:00:59.129> teach<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.699> work<00:01:00.059> for<00:01:00.090> you

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
that you can teach it to work for you

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.170 
that you can teach it to work for you
this<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.090> what<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.300> neuron<00:01:03.719> looks<00:01:04.110> like<00:01:05.180> there

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
this is what a neuron looks like there

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.910 
this is what a neuron looks like there
are<00:01:06.210> many<00:01:06.540> different<00:01:07.080> types<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.650> neurons

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
are many different types of neurons

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.550 
are many different types of neurons
which<00:01:08.340> do<00:01:08.790> different<00:01:09.240> things<00:01:09.299> for<00:01:09.930> example

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
which do different things for example

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.730 
which do different things for example
some<00:01:11.520> look<00:01:11.760> after<00:01:12.060> breathing<00:01:12.299> others<00:01:13.200> chewing

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
some look after breathing others chewing

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.609 
some look after breathing others chewing
food<00:01:14.040> others<00:01:14.970> walking<00:01:15.509> or<00:01:15.720> learning<00:01:16.530> a

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
food others walking or learning a

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.160 
food others walking or learning a
language<00:01:16.770> or<00:01:17.520> even<00:01:18.030> riding<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.570> bike

language or even riding a bike

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.480 
language or even riding a bike
these<00:01:19.920> are<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.430> few<00:01:20.460> examples<00:01:22.490> everything

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
these are just a few examples everything

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.700 
these are just a few examples everything
that<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.790> do<00:01:24.090> comes<00:01:24.600> from<00:01:24.750> your<00:01:25.049> brain<00:01:25.350> cells

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
that you do comes from your brain cells

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.880 
that you do comes from your brain cells
or<00:01:26.009> neurons<00:01:26.780> so<00:01:27.780> let's<00:01:27.990> now<00:01:28.259> have<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.530> look<00:01:28.590> at

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
or neurons so let's now have a look at

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.490 
or neurons so let's now have a look at
how<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> neuron<00:01:29.579> works<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.320> learn

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
how a neuron works so that you can learn

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.109 
how a neuron works so that you can learn
how<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.979> use<00:01:32.130> its<00:01:32.579> amazing<00:01:33.240> power<00:01:34.490> all<00:01:35.490> neurons

across a tiny gap called the synapse
this<00:02:41.900> is<00:02:42.079> referred<00:02:42.560> to<00:02:42.680> as<00:02:42.859> synaptic<00:02:43.790> firing

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
this is referred to as synaptic firing

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.140 
this is referred to as synaptic firing
this<00:02:45.739> is<00:02:45.920> how<00:02:46.159> brain<00:02:46.549> cells<00:02:46.909> or<00:02:47.120> neurons

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
this is how brain cells or neurons

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.069 
this is how brain cells or neurons
communicate<00:02:47.870> with<00:02:48.530> one<00:02:48.739> another

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
communicate with one another

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.259 
communicate with one another
basically<00:02:51.079> what<00:02:51.260> happens<00:02:51.709> is<00:02:51.980> let's<00:02:52.670> say<00:02:53.000> for

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
basically what happens is let's say for

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.569 
basically what happens is let's say for
example<00:02:53.299> when<00:02:54.290> you're<00:02:54.500> learning<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:54.920> walk<00:02:55.250> a

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
example when you're learning to walk a

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.569 
example when you're learning to walk a
group<00:02:56.209> of<00:02:56.359> brain<00:02:56.690> cells<00:02:57.019> or<00:02:57.200> neurons<00:02:57.370> team<00:02:58.370> up

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
group of brain cells or neurons team up

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.339 
group of brain cells or neurons team up
together<00:02:58.790> by<00:02:59.239> communicating<00:03:00.139> with<00:03:00.319> one

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
together by communicating with one

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.030 
together by communicating with one
another<00:03:00.560> by<00:03:01.129> synaptic<00:03:01.760> firing<00:03:02.620> now<00:03:03.620> when<00:03:03.889> you

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
another by synaptic firing now when you

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.280 
another by synaptic firing now when you
first<00:03:04.280> started<00:03:04.730> to<00:03:04.790> walk<00:03:05.120> you<00:03:05.629> probably<00:03:06.019> got

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
first started to walk you probably got

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.250 
first started to walk you probably got
up<00:03:06.500> and<00:03:06.739> then<00:03:06.980> fell<00:03:07.250> down<00:03:07.489> again<00:03:07.810> but<00:03:08.810> after<00:03:09.200> a

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
up and then fell down again but after a

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.080 
up and then fell down again but after a
while<00:03:09.500> you<00:03:09.829> learnt<00:03:10.069> to<00:03:10.190> walk<00:03:10.459> without<00:03:10.700> falling

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
while you learnt to walk without falling

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.349 
while you learnt to walk without falling
down<00:03:11.540> or<00:03:11.780> holding<00:03:12.170> on<00:03:12.290> to<00:03:12.470> anything<00:03:13.209> what<00:03:14.209> was

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
down or holding on to anything what was

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.360 
down or holding on to anything what was
happening<00:03:14.900> in<00:03:15.019> your<00:03:15.200> brain<00:03:15.560> was<00:03:15.950> that<00:03:16.099> a<00:03:16.129> group

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
happening in your brain was that a group

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.759 
happening in your brain was that a group
of<00:03:16.609> neurons<00:03:17.090> joined<00:03:17.540> together<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:18.230> this

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
of neurons joined together and this

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.949 
of neurons joined together and this
group<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.220> neurons<00:03:19.730> then<00:03:20.090> became<00:03:20.540> responsible

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
group of neurons then became responsible

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.520 
group of neurons then became responsible
for<00:03:21.530> your<00:03:21.709> walking<00:03:22.540> at<00:03:23.540> first<00:03:23.930> because<00:03:24.199> the

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
for your walking at first because the

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.229 
for your walking at first because the
neurons<00:03:24.859> didn't<00:03:25.250> know<00:03:25.489> one<00:03:25.730> another<00:03:26.000> very

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
neurons didn't know one another very

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.270 
neurons didn't know one another very
well<00:03:26.389> they<00:03:27.139> were<00:03:27.169> not<00:03:27.470> used<00:03:27.739> to<00:03:27.889> working

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
well they were not used to working

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.339 
well they were not used to working
together<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:28.879> because<00:03:29.690> of<00:03:29.720> that<00:03:29.930> you've

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
together and because of that you've

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.110 
together and because of that you've
found<00:03:30.620> that<00:03:30.799> you<00:03:30.980> could<00:03:31.190> walk<00:03:31.400> a<00:03:31.430> little<00:03:31.910> and

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
found that you could walk a little and

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.680 
found that you could walk a little and
then<00:03:32.569> would<00:03:32.780> fall<00:03:33.019> down<00:03:33.699> as<00:03:34.699> the<00:03:35.060> neurons<00:03:35.449> got

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
then would fall down as the neurons got

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.599 
then would fall down as the neurons got
to<00:03:35.840> know<00:03:36.019> one<00:03:36.230> another<00:03:36.530> and<00:03:36.769> got<00:03:37.280> used<00:03:37.549> to

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
to know one another and got used to

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.619 
to know one another and got used to
teaming<00:03:38.150> up<00:03:38.329> you<00:03:38.840> found<00:03:39.199> that<00:03:39.319> you<00:03:39.470> could<00:03:39.620> walk

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
teaming up you found that you could walk

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.780 
teaming up you found that you could walk
those<00:03:41.629> neurons<00:03:42.230> through<00:03:42.949> repeated<00:03:43.489> contact

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
those neurons through repeated contact

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.970 
those neurons through repeated contact
with<00:03:44.239> one<00:03:44.419> another<00:03:44.449> we're<00:03:45.230> now<00:03:45.410> known<00:03:45.739> as<00:03:45.949> a

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
with one another we're now known as a

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.250 
with one another we're now known as a
team<00:03:46.310> of<00:03:46.489> neurons<00:03:46.879> and<00:03:47.060> they<00:03:47.629> then<00:03:47.959> allowed

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
team of neurons and they then allowed

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.000 
team of neurons and they then allowed
you<00:03:48.440> to<00:03:48.530> walk<00:03:49.840> now<00:03:50.840> your<00:03:51.199> brain<00:03:51.470> cells<00:03:51.799> are

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
you to walk now your brain cells are

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.580 
you to walk now your brain cells are
very<00:03:52.280> clever<00:03:52.579> once<00:03:53.540> they<00:03:53.780> get<00:03:53.959> used<00:03:54.230> to<00:03:54.410> being

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
very clever once they get used to being

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.920 
very clever once they get used to being
together<00:03:54.829> they<00:03:55.579> just<00:03:55.909> automatically<00:03:56.690> get

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
together they just automatically get

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.689 
together they just automatically get
together<00:03:57.319> so<00:03:57.799> you<00:03:57.859> don't<00:03:58.190> have<00:03:58.340> to<00:03:58.459> think

00:03:58.689 --> 00:03:58.699 
together so you don't have to think

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:01.149 
together so you don't have to think
about<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:59.060> process<00:03:59.510> of<00:03:59.629> walking<00:03:59.870> at<00:04:00.139> all<00:04:00.290> all

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:01.159 
about the process of walking at all all

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:03.339 
about the process of walking at all all
you<00:04:01.430> need<00:04:01.639> to<00:04:01.790> think<00:04:02.060> is<00:04:02.239> I<00:04:02.419> would<00:04:02.840> like<00:04:03.019> to<00:04:03.199> go

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
you need to think is I would like to go

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:04.930 
you need to think is I would like to go
from<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.650> lounge<00:04:03.829> room<00:04:04.040> to<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.310> bedroom<00:04:04.430> and

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
from the lounge room to the bedroom and

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.470 
from the lounge room to the bedroom and
your<00:04:05.540> body<00:04:05.750> just<00:04:06.019> does<00:04:06.290> it<00:04:06.470> it<00:04:07.400> is<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.239> same

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
your body just does it it is the same

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.390 
your body just does it it is the same
when<00:04:08.629> you<00:04:08.780> first<00:04:09.049> learn<00:04:09.260> to<00:04:09.290> ride<00:04:09.620> a<00:04:09.650> bike<00:04:09.949> or

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
when you first learn to ride a bike or

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.330 
when you first learn to ride a bike or
play<00:04:10.760> a<00:04:10.790> computer<00:04:11.209> game<00:04:11.359> at<00:04:12.229> first<00:04:12.680> you<00:04:13.129> had<00:04:13.310> to

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
play a computer game at first you had to

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.580 
play a computer game at first you had to
focus<00:04:13.940> and<00:04:14.150> think<00:04:14.690> a<00:04:14.810> lot<00:04:15.019> about<00:04:15.139> what<00:04:15.470> you

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
focus and think a lot about what you

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.159 
focus and think a lot about what you
were<00:04:15.680> doing<00:04:16.039> but<00:04:16.970> after<00:04:17.329> a<00:04:17.359> while<00:04:17.630> when<00:04:18.049> the

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
were doing but after a while when the

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.810 
were doing but after a while when the
brain<00:04:18.409> cells<00:04:18.739> got<00:04:18.979> used<00:04:19.220> to<00:04:19.310> being<00:04:19.579> together

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
brain cells got used to being together

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.789 
brain cells got used to being together
you<00:04:20.570> found<00:04:20.930> that<00:04:21.079> you<00:04:21.200> could<00:04:21.320> do<00:04:21.500> it<00:04:21.680> without

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
you found that you could do it without

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.270 
you found that you could do it without
thinking<00:04:22.250> about<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:23.530> basically<00:04:24.530> everything

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
thinking about it basically everything

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.410 
thinking about it basically everything
you<00:04:25.580> do

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
you do

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.120 
you do
say<00:04:26.870> think<00:04:27.650> and<00:04:27.890> fill<00:04:28.130> works<00:04:28.490> like<00:04:28.730> this<00:04:30.130> now

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
say think and fill works like this now

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.440 
say think and fill works like this now
you<00:04:31.190> might<00:04:31.520> think<00:04:31.550> that<00:04:31.910> your<00:04:32.120> brain<00:04:32.390> is

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
you might think that your brain is

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.470 
you might think that your brain is
pretty<00:04:32.870> cool<00:04:33.460> but<00:04:34.460> why<00:04:34.670> is<00:04:34.730> it<00:04:35.000> you<00:04:35.150> can<00:04:35.300> learn

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
pretty cool but why is it you can learn

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.690 
pretty cool but why is it you can learn
some<00:04:35.870> things<00:04:35.900> easily<00:04:36.890> like<00:04:37.100> walking<00:04:37.580> and

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
some things easily like walking and

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.850 
some things easily like walking and
talking<00:04:37.910> but<00:04:38.720> other<00:04:38.900> things<00:04:39.230> like<00:04:39.470> some<00:04:39.830> of

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
talking but other things like some of

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.090 
talking but other things like some of
your<00:04:40.070> school<00:04:40.430> subjects<00:04:41.060> you<00:04:41.180> find<00:04:41.480> difficult

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
your school subjects you find difficult

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.490 
your school subjects you find difficult
you<00:04:43.100> might<00:04:43.280> be<00:04:43.460> asking<00:04:43.880> yourself<00:04:43.940> is<00:04:44.840> my<00:04:45.170> brain

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
you might be asking yourself is my brain

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.070 
you might be asking yourself is my brain
built<00:04:45.770> differently<00:04:46.250> from<00:04:46.370> other<00:04:46.580> people<00:04:47.080> do

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
built differently from other people do

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.370 
built differently from other people do
other<00:04:48.260> people<00:04:48.650> have<00:04:48.830> smarter<00:04:49.280> brains<00:04:49.550> than<00:04:49.850> me

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
other people have smarter brains than me

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.980 
other people have smarter brains than me
well<00:04:51.380> the<00:04:51.680> answer<00:04:52.040> isn't<00:04:52.190> oh<00:04:52.430> they<00:04:52.640> don't<00:04:52.990> your

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
well the answer isn't oh they don't your

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.890 
well the answer isn't oh they don't your
brain<00:04:54.320> is<00:04:54.620> powerful<00:04:55.070> and<00:04:55.640> amazing<00:04:55.940> and<00:04:56.390> all

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
brain is powerful and amazing and all

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.020 
brain is powerful and amazing and all
you<00:04:57.110> need<00:04:57.320> to<00:04:57.470> do<00:04:57.650> is<00:04:57.860> learn<00:04:58.220> how<00:04:58.280> to<00:04:58.580> make<00:04:58.850> it

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
you need to do is learn how to make it

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.380 
you need to do is learn how to make it
work<00:04:59.210> for<00:04:59.450> you<00:05:00.310> now<00:05:01.310> comes<00:05:01.700> the<00:05:01.910> important

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
work for you now comes the important

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.770 
work for you now comes the important
part<00:05:03.040> every<00:05:04.040> thought<00:05:04.310> you<00:05:04.610> have<00:05:04.880> is<00:05:05.150> linked<00:05:05.570> to

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
part every thought you have is linked to

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.750 
part every thought you have is linked to
a<00:05:05.810> group<00:05:06.080> of<00:05:06.230> neurons<00:05:06.590> which<00:05:07.400> form<00:05:07.700> a

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
a group of neurons which form a

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.630 
a group of neurons which form a
connection<00:05:08.270> with<00:05:08.420> one<00:05:08.600> another<00:05:09.190> so<00:05:10.190> let's<00:05:10.400> say

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
connection with one another so let's say

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.360 
connection with one another so let's say
for<00:05:10.670> example<00:05:11.390> you<00:05:12.080> have<00:05:12.320> a<00:05:12.350> thought<00:05:12.710> that<00:05:13.220> you

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
for example you have a thought that you

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.090 
for example you have a thought that you
can't<00:05:13.640> do<00:05:13.850> maths<00:05:14.120> or<00:05:14.360> spelling<00:05:14.890> and<00:05:15.890> guess

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
can't do maths or spelling and guess

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.220 
can't do maths or spelling and guess
what<00:05:16.400> your<00:05:16.670> brain<00:05:17.060> doesn't<00:05:17.450> say<00:05:17.750> that's<00:05:18.020> a

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
what your brain doesn't say that's a

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.110 
what your brain doesn't say that's a
silly<00:05:18.470> thought<00:05:18.710> it<00:05:19.280> just<00:05:19.610> takes<00:05:19.910> on

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
silly thought it just takes on

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.960 
silly thought it just takes on
everything<00:05:20.690> you<00:05:20.810> tell<00:05:21.020> it<00:05:21.370> so<00:05:22.370> if<00:05:22.520> you<00:05:22.670> think

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
everything you tell it so if you think

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.940 
everything you tell it so if you think
you<00:05:23.180> can't<00:05:23.420> do<00:05:23.720> something<00:05:24.080> a<00:05:24.380> group<00:05:24.740> of

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
you can't do something a group of

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.310 
you can't do something a group of
neurons<00:05:25.280> is<00:05:25.610> going<00:05:25.910> to<00:05:26.060> get<00:05:26.240> together<00:05:26.630> and<00:05:26.900> you

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
neurons is going to get together and you

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.020 
neurons is going to get together and you
will<00:05:27.470> find<00:05:27.740> yourself<00:05:28.100> not<00:05:28.340> being<00:05:28.580> able<00:05:28.700> to<00:05:28.910> do

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
will find yourself not being able to do

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.600 
will find yourself not being able to do
it

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
it

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.850 
it
it<00:05:31.240> is<00:05:31.419> also<00:05:31.629> important<00:05:32.289> for<00:05:32.319> you<00:05:32.530> to<00:05:32.650> know

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
it is also important for you to know

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.709 
it is also important for you to know
that<00:05:33.219> as<00:05:33.340> you're<00:05:33.520> growing<00:05:33.639> up<00:05:34.000> especially<00:05:34.629> in

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:34.719 
that as you're growing up especially in

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:36.899 
that as you're growing up especially in
the<00:05:34.780> first<00:05:34.960> six<00:05:35.289> years<00:05:35.439> of<00:05:35.680> your<00:05:35.800> life<00:05:36.129> your

the first six years of your life your

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:39.360 
the first six years of your life your

grow and develop take on lots of things

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.790 
grow and develop take on lots of things
that<00:05:41.979> other<00:05:42.189> people<00:05:42.580> say<00:05:43.259> for<00:05:44.259> example

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
that other people say for example

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.830 
that other people say for example
someone<00:05:45.400> may<00:05:45.729> have<00:05:45.849> said<00:05:46.090> to<00:05:46.210> you<00:05:46.389> that<00:05:46.569> you

someone may have said to you that you

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.010 
someone may have said to you that you
are<00:05:47.050> stupid<00:05:47.319> or<00:05:47.590> silly<00:05:47.800> and<00:05:48.449> guess<00:05:49.449> what<00:05:49.689> your

are stupid or silly and guess what your

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
neurons went to work and took that on as
