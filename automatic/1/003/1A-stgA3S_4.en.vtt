00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
a little bit more ambiguous looking like

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.030 
a little bit more ambiguous looking like
that<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.280> then<00:01:44.880> these<00:01:45.030> backers<00:01:45.689> are<00:01:46.500> floating

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
that and then these backers are floating

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.649 
that and then these backers are floating
out<00:01:47.159> here<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.700> mean<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.240> would<00:01:48.420> be<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.540> good

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
out here I mean this would be a good

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.310 
out here I mean this would be a good
time<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.049> go<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.610> say<00:01:50.610> outside<00:01:50.970> beer<00:01:51.570> maybe<00:01:52.200> you

player<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.250> would<00:02:02.430> be<00:02:02.520> something<00:02:02.790> you

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
player so this would be something you

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.000 
player so this would be something you
know<00:02:03.180> again<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.750> can

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
know again you can

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.510 
know again you can
go<00:02:04.100> ahead<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:05.440> get<00:02:06.440> an<00:02:06.830> outside<00:02:07.280> view

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
go ahead and get an outside view

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.730 
go ahead and get an outside view
situation<00:02:08.210> going<00:02:08.420> now<00:02:09.080> what<00:02:09.260> I<00:02:09.290> would<00:02:09.440> tell

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
situation going now what I would tell

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.400 
situation going now what I would tell
quarterbacks<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.460> look<00:02:10.640> for<00:02:10.960> if<00:02:11.960> you<00:02:12.110> remember

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
quarterbacks to look for if you remember

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.230 
quarterbacks to look for if you remember
the<00:02:12.530> progression<00:02:13.160> midline<00:02:13.580> finding<00:02:14.180> the

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
the progression midline finding the

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.600 
the progression midline finding the
three<00:02:14.480> or<00:02:15.110> double<00:02:15.470> threes<00:02:15.740> that's<00:02:15.950> awesome<00:02:16.400> if

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
three or double threes that's awesome if

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.220 
three or double threes that's awesome if
there's<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.210> nose<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:17.780> want<00:02:17.960> to<00:02:18.050> run

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
there's a nose and you want to run

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.340 
there's a nose and you want to run
midline<00:02:18.620> find<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.460> loosest<00:02:19.970> tackle<00:02:20.960> lucius

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
midline find the loosest tackle lucius

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.600 
midline find the loosest tackle lucius
for<00:02:21.650> i<00:02:21.680> if<00:02:23.350> inside<00:02:24.350> here<00:02:24.560> find<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.040> one<00:02:25.280> tick

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
for i if inside here find the one tick

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.990 
for i if inside here find the one tick
if<00:02:26.510> there's<00:02:26.810> an<00:02:26.990> a<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.680> B<00:02:27.830> gap<00:02:28.010> defender

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
if there's an a and the B gap defender

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.440 
if there's an a and the B gap defender
like<00:02:29.440> a1<00:02:30.440> Tech<00:02:30.740> and<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.040> 4i<00:02:31.280> then<00:02:32.120> you<00:02:32.270> go<00:02:32.390> to

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
like a1 Tech and a 4i then you go to

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.410 
like a1 Tech and a 4i then you go to
outside<00:02:32.990> their<00:02:33.260> last<00:02:34.130> progression<00:02:34.940> is<00:02:35.120> let's

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
outside their last progression is let's

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.470 
outside their last progression is let's
say<00:02:35.540> like<00:02:35.720> stick<00:02:36.050> with<00:02:36.200> this<00:02:36.350> right<00:02:36.620> here

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
say like stick with this right here

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.180 
say like stick with this right here
there's<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.570> a<00:02:38.990> cap<00:02:39.230> player<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.890> we're<00:02:40.070> going

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
there's a a cap player and we're going

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.700 
there's a a cap player and we're going
to<00:02:40.280> Center<00:02:40.580> a<00:02:40.640> VI<00:02:40.910> player<00:02:41.390> we<00:02:42.260> would<00:02:42.470> probably

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
to Center a VI player we would probably

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.640 
to Center a VI player we would probably
rather<00:02:43.100> run<00:02:43.460> outside<00:02:43.910> beer<00:02:44.240> here<00:02:44.540> because<00:02:45.320> why

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
rather run outside beer here because why

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
rather run outside beer here because why
if<00:02:46.460> you<00:02:46.700> remember<00:02:47.210> the<00:02:47.660> dive<00:02:48.100> player<00:02:49.100> is<00:02:49.430> all

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
if you remember the dive player is all

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.310 
if you remember the dive player is all
the<00:02:49.970> way<00:02:50.090> out<00:02:50.300> here<00:02:50.330> right<00:02:50.900> now<00:02:51.110> because

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
the way out here right now because

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.110 
the way out here right now because
you're<00:02:51.500> going<00:02:51.620> to<00:02:51.710> get<00:02:51.890> those<00:02:52.130> you're<00:02:52.940> going

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
you're going to get those you're going

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.390 
you're going to get those you're going
to<00:02:53.180> get<00:02:53.300> those<00:02:53.540> down<00:02:54.380> blocks<00:02:54.800> push<00:02:55.250> them

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
to get those down blocks push them

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.180 
to get those down blocks push them
through<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.700> backer<00:02:55.940> and<00:02:56.870> that<00:02:57.050> guy<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.650> HVAC

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
through the backer and that guy the HVAC

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.620 
through the backer and that guy the HVAC
is<00:02:58.370> gonna<00:02:58.550> be<00:02:58.670> running<00:02:58.880> inside<00:02:59.390> through<00:02:59.600> the

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
is gonna be running inside through the

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.870 
is gonna be running inside through the
tackle<00:02:59.990> that<00:03:00.800> guy's<00:03:00.950> got<00:03:01.130> a<00:03:01.190> lot<00:03:01.400> of<00:03:01.580> real

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
tackle that guy's got a lot of real

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.510 
tackle that guy's got a lot of real
estate<00:03:02.030> you<00:03:02.270> cover<00:03:02.630> so<00:03:03.230> it'll<00:03:03.500> be<00:03:03.590> a<00:03:03.620> good<00:03:04.040> time

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
estate you cover so it'll be a good time

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.370 
estate you cover so it'll be a good time
to<00:03:04.880> just<00:03:05.090> stick<00:03:05.360> with<00:03:05.510> outside<00:03:05.990> the<00:03:06.140> beer

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
to just stick with outside the beer

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.470 
to just stick with outside the beer
let's<00:03:07.010> get<00:03:07.190> outside<00:03:07.340> of<00:03:07.670> these<00:03:07.760> guys<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.300> run

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
let's get outside of these guys and run

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.380 
let's get outside of these guys and run
now<00:03:09.380> actually<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.220> defense<00:03:10.610> I<00:03:10.760> drew<00:03:11.000> up<00:03:11.090> last

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
now actually the defense I drew up last

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.970 
now actually the defense I drew up last
time<00:03:11.630> would<00:03:11.810> probably<00:03:12.320> be<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.530> little<00:03:12.830> more

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
time would probably be a little more

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.280 
time would probably be a little more
accurate<00:03:13.459> for<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.970> kind<00:03:14.660> of<00:03:14.780> fourth<00:03:15.050> base

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
accurate for the kind of fourth base

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.820 
accurate for the kind of fourth base
playing<00:03:15.590> this<00:03:15.860> called<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.459> rocket<00:03:16.910> toss<00:03:17.150> and

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
playing this called the rocket toss and

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.740 
playing this called the rocket toss and
it<00:03:18.830> is<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.160> toss<00:03:19.430> play<00:03:19.820> and<00:03:20.150> it's<00:03:20.300> even<00:03:20.660> the

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
it is a toss play and it's even the

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.759 
it is a toss play and it's even the
rocket<00:03:21.140> is<00:03:21.260> from<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.680> typical<00:03:22.250> pitch<00:03:22.700> motion

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
rocket is from the typical pitch motion

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.650 
rocket is from the typical pitch motion
let's<00:03:24.769> say<00:03:24.950> we<00:03:25.190> go<00:03:25.340> ahead<00:03:25.489> and<00:03:25.940> have<00:03:26.450> these

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
let's say we go ahead and have these

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.130 
let's say we go ahead and have these
guys<00:03:26.930> let's<00:03:27.230> just<00:03:27.440> say<00:03:27.560> you<00:03:27.620> know<00:03:27.769> one<00:03:28.010> guy

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
guys let's just say you know one guy

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.500 
guys let's just say you know one guy
what<00:03:30.140> I<00:03:30.170> would<00:03:30.470> say<00:03:30.769> is<00:03:31.360> again<00:03:32.360> the

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
what I would say is again the

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.430 
what I would say is again the
quarterbacks<00:03:33.019> if<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.980> last<00:03:34.370> defender<00:03:35.269> if<00:03:36.230> the

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
quarterbacks if the last defender if the

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.340 
quarterbacks if the last defender if the
last<00:03:36.680> defender<00:03:37.400> out<00:03:37.430> there<00:03:37.850> between<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:39.080> the

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
last defender out there between the the

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.720 
last defender out there between the the
last<00:03:39.560> defender<00:03:40.040> out<00:03:40.160> there<00:03:40.340> before<00:03:40.519> the

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
last defender out there before the

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:41.590 
last defender out there before the
cornerback

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
cornerback

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.530 
cornerback
so<00:03:41.989> basically<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.500> last<00:03:42.709> guy<00:03:43.130> out<00:03:43.310> there<00:03:43.610> if

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
so basically the last guy out there if

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.090 
so basically the last guy out there if
he<00:03:45.350> is<00:03:45.680> anywhere<00:03:46.280> touching<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:47.660> wing

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
he is anywhere touching the wing

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.080 
he is anywhere touching the wing
anywhere<00:03:49.100> touching<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:49.580> wing<00:03:49.790> I<00:03:51.519> say<00:03:52.519> he's

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
anywhere touching the wing I say he's

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.130 
anywhere touching the wing I say he's
locked<00:03:53.300> up<00:03:53.510> here<00:03:54.070> touching<00:03:55.070> the<00:03:55.340> wing<00:03:56.140> then

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
locked up here touching the wing then

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.259 
locked up here touching the wing then
this<00:03:57.500> would<00:03:57.680> be<00:03:57.800> a<00:03:57.830> time<00:03:58.130> to<00:03:58.370> check<00:03:58.610> -<00:03:58.880> and<00:03:59.180> I

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
this would be a time to check - and I

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.690 
this would be a time to check - and I
believe<00:03:59.330> would<00:03:59.870> be<00:03:59.930> rockets<00:04:00.590> also<00:04:01.010> a

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
believe would be rockets also a

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.910 
believe would be rockets also a
