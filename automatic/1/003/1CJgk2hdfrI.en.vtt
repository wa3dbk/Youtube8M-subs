let's talk a little bit about the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.869 
let's talk a little bit about the
features<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.230> lens<00:01:01.469> first<00:01:01.980> it's<00:01:02.370> an

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
features of this lens first it's an

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.719 
features of this lens first it's an
all-glass<00:01:03.600> lens<00:01:04.170> which<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:05.010> really<00:01:05.519> good

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
all-glass lens which is a really good

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.880 
all-glass lens which is a really good
thing<00:01:06.000> especially<00:01:06.439> considering<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.500> amount

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
thing especially considering the amount

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.210 
thing especially considering the amount
of<00:01:08.159> glass<00:01:08.490> required<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:10.229> make<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.710> macro

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
of glass required to make this macro

of glass required to make this macro
effect<00:01:11.340> work<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.740> did<00:01:13.740> not<00:01:13.860> appreciate<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
effect work I did not appreciate the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.789 
effect work I did not appreciate the
importance<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.479> all<00:01:15.720> glass<00:01:16.049> filters<00:01:16.500> until<00:01:16.680> I

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
importance of all glass filters until I

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.910 
importance of all glass filters until I
recently<00:01:17.070> recently<00:01:18.000> reviewed<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.840> non<00:01:19.229> glass

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
recently recently reviewed a non glass

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.359 
recently recently reviewed a non glass
filter<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.180> was<00:01:21.360> shocked<00:01:21.780> at<00:01:22.020> how<00:01:22.080> poor<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
filter and I was shocked at how poor the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.359 
filter and I was shocked at how poor the
image<00:01:23.700> quality<00:01:23.880> from<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.450> was<00:01:24.920> this<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> very

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
image quality from it was this is a very

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.969 
image quality from it was this is a very
solid<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.060> heavy<00:01:27.570> lens<00:01:27.960> that's<00:01:28.560> because

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
solid and heavy lens that's because

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.280 
solid and heavy lens that's because
there's<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.220> lot<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.520> glass<00:01:30.030> required<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:31.049> make

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
there's a lot of glass required to make

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.980 
there's a lot of glass required to make
this<00:01:31.530> magnification<00:01:32.070> effect<00:01:32.579> work<00:01:33.210> think

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
this magnification effect work think

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.960 
this magnification effect work think
about<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.530> magnifying<00:01:35.460> glass

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
about a magnifying glass

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.700 
about a magnifying glass
think<00:01:36.150> about<00:01:36.299> how<00:01:36.450> thick<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.110> glasses<00:01:37.350> and

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
think about how thick the glasses and

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.580 
think about how thick the glasses and
those<00:01:37.920> now<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:39.150> lens<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.750> definitely<00:01:40.170> not<00:01:40.409> as

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
those now this lens is definitely not as

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.260 
those now this lens is definitely not as
thick<00:01:40.799> as<00:01:40.890> some<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.130> those<00:01:41.280> but<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.729> does<00:01:41.939> still

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
thick as some of those but it does still

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.160 
thick as some of those but it does still
require<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.930> lot<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.680> glass<00:01:44.310> as<00:01:44.869> you<00:01:45.869> can<00:01:46.020> see

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
require a lot of glass as you can see

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.889 
require a lot of glass as you can see
from<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.409> test<00:01:46.710> shots<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.790> lens<00:01:48.180> does<00:01:48.509> two

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
from the test shots the lens does two

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.960 
from the test shots the lens does two
things<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.320> brings<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.920> focusing<00:01:50.610> just<00:01:50.820> the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
things it brings the focusing just the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.280 
things it brings the focusing just the
focal<00:01:51.329> length<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.659> camera<00:01:51.750> closer

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
focal length of the camera closer

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.350 
focal length of the camera closer
allowing<00:01:52.860> us<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.070> focus<00:01:53.790> specifically<00:01:54.240> on

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
allowing us to focus specifically on

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.200 
allowing us to focus specifically on
what's<00:01:55.259> right<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.950> front<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.280> camera<00:01:56.670> it's

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
what's right in front of the camera it's

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.300 
what's right in front of the camera it's
about<00:01:57.450> two<00:01:57.840> inches<00:01:57.869> away<00:01:58.290> when<00:01:58.920> things<00:01:59.159> are

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
about two inches away when things are

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.359 
about two inches away when things are
crystal<00:01:59.880> clear<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:01.140> if<00:02:01.380> they<00:02:01.619> go<00:02:01.770> about<00:02:01.950> past

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
crystal clear but if they go about past

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.889 
crystal clear but if they go about past
about<00:02:02.610> four<00:02:02.880> or<00:02:03.000> five<00:02:03.270> inches<00:02:03.540> away<00:02:03.689> they

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
about four or five inches away they

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.899 
about four or five inches away they
start<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.229> go<00:02:04.320> out<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.530> focus<00:02:04.860> again<00:02:05.219> so<00:02:05.820> this

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
start to go out of focus again so this

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.249 
start to go out of focus again so this
isn't<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.329> lens<00:02:06.540> you're<00:02:06.659> going<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.840> be<00:02:06.899> able<00:02:07.020> to

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
isn't a lens you're going to be able to

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.619 
isn't a lens you're going to be able to
use<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.740> shoot<00:02:07.950> all<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.819> time<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.330> only

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
use to shoot all the time it's only

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.390 
use to shoot all the time it's only
going<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.200> be<00:02:10.289> used<00:02:10.530> when<00:02:10.830> you're<00:02:11.009> shooting

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
going to be used when you're shooting

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.550 
going to be used when you're shooting
close<00:02:11.519> ups<00:02:11.790> another<00:02:12.780> thing<00:02:12.989> I<00:02:13.079> noticed<00:02:13.110> was

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
close ups another thing I noticed was

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.830 
close ups another thing I noticed was
that<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:14.010> actually<00:02:14.069> kind<00:02:14.879> of<00:02:15.030> corrects<00:02:15.629> for

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
that it actually kind of corrects for

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.399 
that it actually kind of corrects for
the<00:02:16.610> fisheye<00:02:17.610> effect<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.540> GoPro<00:02:18.870> camera

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
the fisheye effect of the GoPro camera

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.520 
the fisheye effect of the GoPro camera
it<00:02:19.920> leaves<00:02:20.220> us<00:02:20.340> with<00:02:20.610> some<00:02:21.030> more<00:02:22.019> straight

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
it leaves us with some more straight

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.259 
it leaves us with some more straight
lines<00:02:22.829> in<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.099> video<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.730> little<00:02:23.970> bit<00:02:24.060> more

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
lines in the video and a little bit more

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.170 
lines in the video and a little bit more
distorted<00:02:25.079> edges<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.799> found<00:02:26.489> it<00:02:26.640> work<00:02:26.819> best

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
distorted edges I found it work best

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.750 
distorted edges I found it work best
when<00:02:27.450> shooting<00:02:27.689> in<00:02:28.109> a<00:02:28.319> narrow<00:02:28.920> or<00:02:29.189> medium

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
when shooting in a narrow or medium

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.179 
when shooting in a narrow or medium
field<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.239> view<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.989> wide<00:02:31.319> and<00:02:31.650> super<00:02:32.040> view

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
field of view the wide and super view

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:34.190 
field of view the wide and super view
field<00:02:32.489> of<00:02:32.670> views<00:02:32.879> kind<00:02:33.209> of<00:02:33.329> just<00:02:33.540> distorted

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
field of views kind of just distorted

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.800 
field of views kind of just distorted
the<00:02:34.349> edges<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.709> little<00:02:34.890> bit<00:02:35.129> too<00:02:35.400> much<00:02:35.810> it's

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
the edges a little bit too much it's

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.300 
the edges a little bit too much it's
probably<00:02:37.230> sharpest<00:02:37.680> right<00:02:37.859> in<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.010> middle

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
probably sharpest right in the middle

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.479 
probably sharpest right in the middle
so<00:02:38.849> using<00:02:39.299> that<00:02:39.450> narrow<00:02:39.840> or<00:02:40.109> medium<00:02:41.099> field<00:02:41.370> of

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
so using that narrow or medium field of

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:42.649 
so using that narrow or medium field of
view<00:02:41.549> really<00:02:41.849> took<00:02:41.970> advantage<00:02:42.329> of<00:02:42.599> that

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
view really took advantage of that

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.599 
view really took advantage of that
awesome<00:02:43.319> because<00:02:43.889> we're<00:02:44.099> trying<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.310> make<00:02:44.459> our

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
awesome because we're trying to make our

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.039 
awesome because we're trying to make our
subjects<00:02:44.970> bigger<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.420> our<00:02:45.480> focus<00:02:45.720> distance

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
subjects bigger and our focus distance

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.460 
subjects bigger and our focus distance
is<00:02:46.409> limited<00:02:46.829> by<00:02:47.430> using<00:02:47.879> a<00:02:48.000> macro<00:02:48.359> lens<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.870> a

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
is limited by using a macro lens and a

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.470 
is limited by using a macro lens and a
little<00:02:49.739> bit<00:02:49.829> more<00:02:49.980> zoom<00:02:50.340> or<00:02:50.579> crop<00:02:50.970> that<00:02:51.209> comes

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
little bit more zoom or crop that comes

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.509 
little bit more zoom or crop that comes
with<00:02:51.629> the<00:02:51.810> narrow<00:02:52.049> field<00:02:52.349> of<00:02:52.440> view<00:02:52.500> would<00:02:53.370> be

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
with the narrow field of view would be

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.020 
with the narrow field of view would be
beneficial<00:02:54.079> so<00:02:55.079> who<00:02:55.889> is<00:02:56.099> this<00:02:56.310> lens<00:02:56.519> for<00:02:56.670> and

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
beneficial so who is this lens for and

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.660 
beneficial so who is this lens for and
should<00:02:57.540> you<00:02:57.750> be<00:02:57.780> investing<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:58.590> one<00:02:58.769> well

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
should you be investing in one well

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.849 
should you be investing in one well

according to the polar Pro packaging and

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.649 
according to the polar Pro packaging and
I<00:03:01.920> can't<00:03:02.159> agree<00:03:02.400> with<00:03:02.459> them<00:03:02.730> on<00:03:02.790> this<00:03:02.849> it's

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
I can't agree with them on this it's

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.289 
I can't agree with them on this it's
designed<00:03:04.139> to<00:03:04.379> push<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.950> creativity<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:05.939> what

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
designed to push the creativity of what

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.020 
designed to push the creativity of what
you<00:03:06.510> can<00:03:06.689> do<00:03:06.870> with<00:03:07.079> your<00:03:07.230> GoPro<00:03:07.829> camera<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.970> I

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
you can do with your GoPro camera and I

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.580 
you can do with your GoPro camera and I
think<00:03:09.269> that<00:03:09.420> pretty<00:03:09.569> much<00:03:09.720> sums<00:03:10.019> up<00:03:10.170> this<00:03:10.349> cat

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
think that pretty much sums up this cat

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.369 
think that pretty much sums up this cat
this<00:03:10.799> lens<00:03:11.040> quite<00:03:11.639> well<00:03:11.879> it's<00:03:12.659> designed<00:03:13.170> to

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
this lens quite well it's designed to

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.699 
this lens quite well it's designed to
make<00:03:13.560> your<00:03:14.310> GoPro<00:03:15.000> take<00:03:15.569> shots<00:03:15.989> which<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.440> not

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
make your GoPro take shots which is not

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.250 
make your GoPro take shots which is not
intended<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.549> do<00:03:17.879> as<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.750> can<00:03:18.780> see<00:03:18.989> from<00:03:19.109> the

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
intended to do as you can see from the

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.809 
intended to do as you can see from the
sample<00:03:19.379> video<00:03:19.769> it<00:03:19.949> takes<00:03:20.220> some<00:03:20.519> pretty

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
sample video it takes some pretty

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.500 
sample video it takes some pretty
amazing<00:03:21.569> images<00:03:22.699> the<00:03:23.699> close-ups<00:03:24.269> look

amazing images the close-ups look

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.869 
amazing images the close-ups look
awesome<00:03:25.109> and<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.530> color<00:03:25.769> is<00:03:26.040> great<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.519> GoPro

is an amazing video camera and being
able<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.590> shoot<00:03:28.769> close-ups<00:03:29.220> like<00:03:29.370> this<00:03:29.549> with

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
able to shoot close-ups like this with

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.259 
able to shoot close-ups like this with
it<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:30.060> pretty<00:03:30.959> cool<00:03:31.489> however<00:03:32.489> having<00:03:33.120> said

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
it is pretty cool however having said

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.659 
it is pretty cool however having said
that<00:03:33.569> it's<00:03:34.019> probably<00:03:34.530> not<00:03:34.829> something<00:03:35.489> that

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
that it's probably not something that

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:37.460 
that it's probably not something that
that<00:03:36.060> many<00:03:36.419> people<00:03:36.540> are<00:03:36.959> going<00:03:37.199> to<00:03:37.290> take

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
that many people are going to take

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.640 
that many people are going to take
advantage<00:03:37.799> of<00:03:38.220> it's<00:03:39.150> a<00:03:39.389> lens<00:03:39.659> for<00:03:39.989> a<00:03:40.049> Pacific

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
advantage of it's a lens for a Pacific

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.860 
advantage of it's a lens for a Pacific
use<00:03:40.919> and<00:03:41.129> that's<00:03:41.340> taking<00:03:41.760> close-up<00:03:42.299> shots<00:03:42.599> if

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
use and that's taking close-up shots if

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.300 
use and that's taking close-up shots if
you<00:03:43.019> don't<00:03:43.229> think<00:03:43.470> you're<00:03:43.620> going<00:03:43.769> to<00:03:43.919> be

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
you don't think you're going to be

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.789 
you don't think you're going to be
taking<00:03:44.760> close-ups<00:03:45.239> super<00:03:46.229> close-ups<00:03:46.620> with

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
taking close-ups super close-ups with

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.890 
taking close-ups super close-ups with
your<00:03:47.040> GoPro<00:03:47.340> then<00:03:47.790> it's<00:03:47.940> probably<00:03:48.150> not<00:03:48.540> for

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
your GoPro then it's probably not for

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.259 
your GoPro then it's probably not for
you<00:03:49.079> if<00:03:49.769> you<00:03:49.889> guys<00:03:50.010> can<00:03:50.250> see<00:03:50.549> the<00:03:50.729> value<00:03:51.150> in

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
you if you guys can see the value in

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.930 
you if you guys can see the value in
this<00:03:51.419> then<00:03:51.780> that's<00:03:51.959> great<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:53.129> one<00:03:53.400> spot<00:03:53.790> I

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
this then that's great the one spot I

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.939
