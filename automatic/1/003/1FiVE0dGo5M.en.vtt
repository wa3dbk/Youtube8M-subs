00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
together what piece does what simple I

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:11.850 
together what piece does what simple I
like<00:01:03.410> simple<00:01:04.840> and<00:01:05.840> here<00:01:06.800> we<00:01:06.920> go<00:01:07.510> next<00:01:09.159> is<00:01:10.510> the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
like simple and here we go next is the

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.090 
like simple and here we go next is the
this<00:01:12.860> looks<00:01:13.070> like<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:13.340> silencer<00:01:14.950> it's<00:01:15.950> got<00:01:16.070> a

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
this looks like the silencer it's got a

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.730 
this looks like the silencer it's got a
good<00:01:16.250> feel<00:01:16.310> open<00:01:17.120> that<00:01:17.210> up<00:01:17.360> in<00:01:17.450> a<00:01:17.540> second<00:01:20.740> next

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
good feel open that up in a second next

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.620 
good feel open that up in a second next
is<00:01:22.240> looks<00:01:23.240> like<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.600> outlet<00:01:24.110> I<00:01:25.420> would<00:01:26.420> imagine

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
is looks like the outlet I would imagine

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.700 
is looks like the outlet I would imagine
you<00:01:26.870> would<00:01:27.020> adjust<00:01:27.890> that<00:01:28.340> top<00:01:28.640> part<00:01:28.909> two<00:01:29.300> I

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
you would adjust that top part two I

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.219 
you would adjust that top part two I
guess<00:01:30.710> change<00:01:31.460> the<00:01:31.729> flow<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:32.360> down<00:01:32.720> there<00:01:32.990> is

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
guess change the flow and down there is

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.640 
guess change the flow and down there is
the<00:01:33.590> reducer<00:01:34.100> for<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:34.370> pump<00:01:35.200> if<00:01:36.200> you<00:01:36.350> see<00:01:36.500> that

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
the reducer for the pump if you see that

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.620 
the reducer for the pump if you see that
right<00:01:37.159> there<00:01:37.220> that<00:01:37.460> is<00:01:37.880> where<00:01:38.150> you<00:01:38.299> connect

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
right there that is where you connect

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:47.500 
right there that is where you connect
your<00:01:38.690> air<00:01:38.990> to<00:01:43.150> is<00:01:44.150> also<00:01:44.600> to<00:01:44.780> trap<00:01:45.290> over<00:01:46.210> so<00:01:47.210> here

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
your air to is also to trap over so here

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:55.080 
your air to is also to trap over so here
we<00:01:47.630> are<00:01:47.840> here<00:01:48.229> is<00:01:48.409> deflection<00:01:49.040> cup

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.290 
different but I've seen a couple people
that<00:06:02.470> have<00:06:02.830> ordered<00:06:03.280> them<00:06:03.460> and<00:06:03.670> got<00:06:03.910> them<00:06:03.940> and

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
that have ordered them and got them and

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.240 
that have ordered them and got them and
this<00:06:04.450> is<00:06:04.660> pretty<00:06:05.140> much<00:06:05.290> the<00:06:05.410> model<00:06:05.920> that<00:06:06.040> they

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
this is pretty much the model that they

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.150 
this is pretty much the model that they
got<00:06:06.490> to<00:06:06.790> so<00:06:07.180> I<00:06:07.450> think<00:06:08.230> this<00:06:08.530> is<00:06:08.590> the<00:06:08.860> standard

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160 
got to so I think this is the standard

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:17.900 
got to so I think this is the standard
that<00:06:09.430> shipping<00:06:09.700> now<00:06:09.970> with<00:06:10.150> the<00:06:10.270> red<00:06:10.450> sticker

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910
