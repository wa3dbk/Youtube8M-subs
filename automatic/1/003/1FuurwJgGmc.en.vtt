00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
Lester takes away the stars and put them

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.359 
Lester takes away the stars and put them
back<00:01:44.119> on<00:01:44.299> but<00:01:45.229> at<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.439> same<00:01:45.680> time<00:01:45.950> it's<00:01:46.219> going

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
back on but at the same time it's going

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:47.830 
back on but at the same time it's going
to<00:01:46.460> be<00:01:46.520> a<00:01:46.579> little<00:01:46.789> bit<00:01:46.939> harder<00:01:47.329> to<00:01:47.359> get<00:01:47.689> away

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
to be a little bit harder to get away

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.289 
to be a little bit harder to get away
from<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.259> cops<00:01:48.500> so<00:01:49.159> I<00:01:49.189> think<00:01:49.310> with<00:01:49.789> more<00:01:50.060> stars

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
from the cops so I think with more stars

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.270 
from the cops so I think with more stars
that<00:01:50.600> actually<00:01:50.960> takes<00:01:51.170> longer<00:01:51.710> so<00:01:51.979> I<00:01:52.009> like<00:01:52.250> to

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
that actually takes longer so I like to

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.490 
that actually takes longer so I like to
do<00:01:52.520> it<00:01:52.609> with<00:01:52.640> just<00:01:52.759> two<00:01:53.149> stars<00:01:53.539> so<00:01:54.200> you<00:01:54.259> do

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
do it with just two stars so you do

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.560 
do it with just two stars so you do
something<00:01:54.829> to<00:01:55.219> get<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:55.520> caps<00:01:55.759> on<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:56.240> to<00:01:56.450> get

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
something to get the caps on you to get

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.230 
something to get the caps on you to get
a<00:01:56.630> 1<00:01:56.899> and<00:01:57.079> level<00:01:57.229> then<00:01:58.100> what<00:01:58.310> you'll<00:01:58.460> do<00:01:58.670> is<00:01:58.969> go

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
glitch is going to work

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.600 
glitch is going to work
core<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:21.990> not<00:02:22.319> going<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.590> work<00:02:22.650> if<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.550> doesn't

core is not going to work if it doesn't

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.580 
core is not going to work if it doesn't
work<00:02:24.090> just<00:02:24.120> keep<00:02:24.600> trying<00:02:24.840> again<00:02:25.200> until<00:02:25.530> it

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.020 
put this on youtube because of its in
accuracy<00:03:25.080> to<00:03:25.260> work<00:03:25.709> but<00:03:26.370> it's<00:03:26.579> kind<00:03:26.820> of<00:03:26.850> like

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
accuracy to work but it's kind of like

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.240 
accuracy to work but it's kind of like
putting<00:03:27.329> a<00:03:27.570> jet<00:03:27.900> in<00:03:28.019> your<00:03:28.140> garage<00:03:28.320> or<00:03:28.769> tanking

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
putting a jet in your garage or tanking

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.550 
putting a jet in your garage or tanking
your<00:03:29.340> garage<00:03:29.760> you<00:03:30.450> have<00:03:30.600> to<00:03:30.780> do<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.140> at<00:03:31.380> the

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
your garage you have to do it at the

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.039 
your garage you have to do it at the
right<00:03:31.590> time<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.850> right<00:03:32.880> moment<00:03:33.090> where<00:03:33.840> the

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
right time the right moment where the

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.170 
right time the right moment where the
game's<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.470> little<00:03:34.769> bit<00:03:34.950> laggy<00:03:35.190> so<00:03:35.880> this<00:03:36.030> is

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
game's a little bit laggy so this is

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.960 
game's a little bit laggy so this is
something<00:03:36.390> that<00:03:36.510> definitely<00:03:36.959> does<00:03:37.920> work<00:03:38.340> but

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
something that definitely does work but

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.600 
something that definitely does work but
it<00:03:39.120> is<00:03:39.299> a<00:03:39.329> hard<00:03:39.870> glitch<00:03:40.500> to<00:03:40.769> do<00:03:40.950> it's<00:03:41.190> not<00:03:41.310> the

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
it is a hard glitch to do it's not the

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.120 
it is a hard glitch to do it's not the
process<00:03:42.090> is<00:03:42.269> really<00:03:42.480> easy<00:03:42.840> it's<00:03:43.560> just<00:03:43.680> getting

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
process is really easy it's just getting

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.920 
process is really easy it's just getting
it<00:03:44.400> to<00:03:44.579> work<00:03:44.820> and<00:03:45.180> be<00:03:45.299> a<00:03:45.329> pain<00:03:45.630> in<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.750> ass

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
it to work and be a pain in the ass

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.050 
it to work and be a pain in the ass
sometimes<00:03:45.959> and<00:03:46.950> when<00:03:47.430> you<00:03:47.549> do<00:03:47.700> get<00:03:47.880> this

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
sometimes and when you do get this

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.120 
sometimes and when you do get this
glitch<00:03:48.329> to<00:03:48.570> work<00:03:48.810> when<00:03:49.440> all<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:49.709> have<00:03:49.829> to<00:03:49.950> do

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
glitch to work when all you have to do

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.759 
glitch to work when all you have to do
is<00:03:50.400> keep<00:03:50.660> calling<00:03:51.660> for<00:03:51.989> another<00:03:52.110> mission

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769
