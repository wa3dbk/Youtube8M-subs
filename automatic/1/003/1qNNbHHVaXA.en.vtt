has<00:00:11.010> just<00:00:11.190> been<00:00:11.370> really<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:12.059> wintry<00:00:12.509> here

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
has just been really a wintry here

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.660 
has just been really a wintry here
though<00:00:13.290> it<00:00:13.440> doesn't<00:00:13.620> look<00:00:13.769> like<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.280> right<00:00:14.460> now

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
though it doesn't look like it right now

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.630 
though it doesn't look like it right now
and<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:15.170> lot<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.230> wind<00:00:16.560> so<00:00:16.859> really<00:00:17.160> bad<00:00:17.369> for

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
and a lot of wind so really bad for

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.330 
and a lot of wind so really bad for
doing<00:00:17.789> videos<00:00:18.770> so<00:00:21.500> that's<00:00:22.500> how<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.740> envisioned

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
doing videos so that's how I envisioned

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.920 
doing videos so that's how I envisioned
it<00:00:23.430> in<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.640> beginning<00:00:23.789> there<00:00:24.240> with<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.630> flat

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
it in the beginning there with the flat

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:36.319 
it in the beginning there with the flat
gray<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.800> black<00:00:26.369> accents<00:00:35.329> still

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
gray and the black accents still

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.420 
gray and the black accents still
wouldn't<00:00:36.630> mind<00:00:36.809> putting<00:00:37.079> some<00:00:37.380> tattoos<00:00:37.980> on

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
wouldn't mind putting some tattoos on

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.840 
wouldn't mind putting some tattoos on
his<00:00:38.610> arm<00:00:38.910> there<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.690> all<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.809> little<00:00:43.850> writing

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
his arm there and all the little writing

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.340 
his arm there and all the little writing
over<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.450> hatches<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.320> for<00:00:46.969> like

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
over the hatches and that for like

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.400 
over the hatches and that for like
hydraulic<00:00:49.350> access<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.579> cpu<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.199> that

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
hydraulic access and cpu this and that

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.139 
hydraulic access and cpu this and that
whatever<00:00:55.190> the<00:00:56.190> lights<00:00:56.430> are<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:56.670> right<00:00:57.120> now

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
whatever the lights are on right now

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:35.670 
whatever the lights are on right now
it's<00:00:57.570> not<00:00:57.629> all<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.079> dark

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.649 

yeah<00:01:36.680> we'll<00:01:37.070> see<00:01:37.310> about<00:01:37.340> weapons<00:01:38.060> or<00:01:38.299> whatever

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
yeah we'll see about weapons or whatever

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.990 
yeah we'll see about weapons or whatever
kind<00:01:39.409> of<00:01:39.500> done<00:01:39.740> with<00:01:39.979> this<00:01:40.130> guy<00:01:40.399> for<00:01:40.460> now<00:01:40.820> he's

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
kind of done with this guy for now he's

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.550 
kind of done with this guy for now he's
just<00:01:41.149> the<00:01:41.240> prototype<00:01:41.540> anyway<00:01:42.350> so<00:01:44.470> whether<00:01:45.470> I

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
just the prototype anyway so whether I

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.969 
just the prototype anyway so whether I
put<00:01:45.860> any<00:01:46.039> on<00:01:46.070> or<00:01:46.369> not<00:01:46.520> we'll<00:01:46.759> see<00:01:46.970> how<00:01:47.119> it<00:01:47.149> goes

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
put any on or not we'll see how it goes

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:57.810 
put any on or not we'll see how it goes
it<00:01:48.979> looks<00:01:49.130> pretty<00:01:49.280> good<00:01:49.549> I<00:01:49.580> think

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.020 

so<00:01:58.480> he's<00:01:58.720> standing<00:01:59.440> behind<00:01:59.710> this<00:02:00.220> prototype

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
so he's standing behind this prototype

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.480 
so he's standing behind this prototype
fence<00:02:03.510> section<00:02:04.920> building<00:02:05.920> for<00:02:06.100> a<00:02:06.160> buddy<00:02:06.400> of

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
fence section building for a buddy of

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:18.570 
fence section building for a buddy of
mine<00:02:09.869> not<00:02:10.869> going<00:02:11.020> to<00:02:11.110> keep<00:02:11.290> him<00:02:11.500> out<00:02:11.680> no<00:02:12.430> no

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.150 

so<00:02:19.210> yeah<00:02:19.450> be<00:02:20.200> good<00:02:20.350> to<00:02:20.410> make<00:02:20.710> one<00:02:20.950> that

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
so yeah be good to make one that

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.340 
so yeah be good to make one that
actually<00:02:21.340> does<00:02:21.790> stuff<00:02:22.240> but<00:02:22.630> you<00:02:22.840> got<00:02:22.960> to<00:02:22.990> start

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
actually does stuff but you got to start

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.100 
actually does stuff but you got to start
somewhere<00:02:23.650> right<00:02:23.890> so<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:25.210> first<00:02:25.360> guy<00:02:25.660> is<00:02:25.720> done

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
somewhere right so the first guy is done

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.340 
somewhere right so the first guy is done
and<00:02:27.120> when<00:02:28.120> I<00:02:28.150> get<00:02:28.390> going<00:02:28.660> on<00:02:28.810> another<00:02:29.050> one<00:02:29.290> here

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
and when I get going on another one here

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.460 
and when I get going on another one here
it's<00:02:29.800> going<00:02:30.100> to<00:02:30.160> be<00:02:30.910> moving<00:02:33.810> not<00:02:34.810> sure<00:02:35.110> what

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
it's going to be moving not sure what

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.040 
it's going to be moving not sure what
will<00:02:35.740> exactly<00:02:36.460> move<00:02:36.700> but<00:02:37.620> he'll<00:02:38.620> do<00:02:38.860> stuff

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
will exactly move but he'll do stuff

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.870 
will exactly move but he'll do stuff
since<00:02:41.050> this<00:02:41.740> isn't<00:02:41.980> enough<00:02:42.400> for<00:02:42.640> some<00:02:42.850> people

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
since this isn't enough for some people

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.000 
since this isn't enough for some people
he'll<00:02:43.480> have<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:43.870> do<00:02:44.020> something<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.590> second

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
he'll have to do something the second

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.070 
he'll have to do something the second
one<00:02:46.230> so<00:02:47.230> that's<00:02:47.410> it<00:02:47.650> anyway<00:02:48.870> I'm<00:02:49.870> going<00:02:49.990> to

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
one so that's it anyway I'm going to

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.810 
one so that's it anyway I'm going to
stick<00:02:50.290> with<00:02:50.350> those<00:02:50.620> colors<00:02:51.070> I<00:02:51.220> think<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:51.550> was<00:02:51.790> a

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
stick with those colors I think it was a

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.930 
stick with those colors I think it was a
shiny<00:02:52.510> gray<00:02:52.960> very<00:02:53.440> briefly<00:02:53.920> looked<00:02:54.370> horrible

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
shiny gray very briefly looked horrible

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.620 
shiny gray very briefly looked horrible
so<00:02:55.270> that<00:02:55.510> was<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.780> end<00:02:55.810> of<00:02:55.990> that<00:02:56.050> and<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:58.390> flat

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
so that was the end of that and the flat

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.350 
so that was the end of that and the flat
pretty<00:02:59.080> much<00:02:59.290> hides<00:02:59.590> all<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.090> roughness<00:03:01.090> of

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
pretty much hides all the roughness of

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.960 
pretty much hides all the roughness of
the<00:03:02.490> welded<00:03:03.490> areas<00:03:03.910> and<00:03:04.120> that<00:03:05.490> so<00:03:06.490> that's<00:03:06.610> him

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
the welded areas and that so that's him

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.270 
the welded areas and that so that's him
