00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.180 
conveniently has these two holes here
and<00:02:01.579> it<00:02:02.579> slides<00:02:02.939> right<00:02:04.490> into<00:02:05.490> where<00:02:05.669> the<00:02:05.819> paper

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
and it slides right into where the paper

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.699 
and it slides right into where the paper
can<00:02:08.190> go<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.819> iPad<00:02:09.270> then<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:10.229> found<00:02:10.440> these

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
can go in the iPad then I found these

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.729 
can go in the iPad then I found these
rings<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:13.170> other<00:02:13.290> part<00:02:13.590> of<00:02:13.620> the

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
rings in the other part of the

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.680 
rings in the other part of the
stationery<00:02:14.220> area

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
stationery area

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.180 
stationery area
these<00:02:15.930> rings<00:02:17.840> just<00:02:18.840> slot<00:02:19.110> into<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.560> holes<00:02:19.770> I

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
these rings just slot into the holes I

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.280 
these rings just slot into the holes I
just<00:02:20.670> used<00:02:20.910> three<00:02:21.210> of<00:02:21.300> them<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.510> got<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.900> size

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
just used three of them I got the size

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.470 
just used three of them I got the size
that<00:02:22.530> was<00:02:22.650> big<00:02:22.860> enough<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:23.340> where<00:02:24.180> I<00:02:24.210> could

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
that was big enough to where I could

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.460 
that was big enough to where I could
create<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:25.110> sort<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:25.590> triangular<00:02:27.470> system

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
create a sort of triangular system

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.770 
create a sort of triangular system
because<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.310> wanted<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.760> water<00:02:30.150> bottle<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.660> be

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
because I wanted the water bottle to be

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.930 
because I wanted the water bottle to be
weighted<00:02:31.140> in<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.320> very<00:02:31.500> center<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.430> iPad

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
weighted in the very center of the iPad

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.750 
weighted in the very center of the iPad
so<00:02:33.300> it<00:02:34.200> would<00:02:35.130> be<00:02:35.310> nice<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.900> balanced<00:02:38.480> and

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
so it would be nice and balanced and

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.570 
so it would be nice and balanced and
voila<00:02:42.080> one<00:02:43.080> thing<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.500> note<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.010> like<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.400> do

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
voila one thing to note is I like to do

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.220 
voila one thing to note is I like to do
my<00:02:44.730> half-hour<00:02:45.120> cardio<00:02:45.570> sessions<00:02:46.050> without

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
my half-hour cardio sessions without
