00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.379
 We were walking in the middle of the street. 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.309
 Today you can not imagine to know 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.920
 to see how many fat people you have 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.199
 in the middle of the street 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.350
 when I was a child it is in the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.990
 my routine an acute woman had a 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.029
 only then did it serve as a point of 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.820
 reference everyone talks will go after 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.310
 of the fat house is there behind the house of the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.560
 Fat girl in front of fat girl's house 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.930
 Fat house 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.340
 today if the reference point are the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.070
 fat people think 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:43.410
 and we are staying in circles that 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.239
 How much fat is it and I 'm coming in? 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.379
 so speaking in a joke 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.110
 It's even fun that the theme 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.430
 It's really complicated, right? 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.469
 we realize that it has a lot of 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.960
 fat people in the middle of the street harmony 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.760
 use the term chubby nÃ© 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.920
 sometimes the person speaks chubby that says 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.339
 who is afraid to offend 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.439
 the offense is not to call fat the offense 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.900
 is to realize that even the people who 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.450
 say they are from the plus size segment 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.030
 she just wants to show on the catwalks in the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.750
 launch of its collections 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:22.140
 It's in your material because it 's advertising, right? 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.340
 your marketing campaigns are models 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.720
 that at most 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.740
 I reached a maximum of 52 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.680
 so I'm not even talking to myself 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.299
 because I 'm fat but I did not arrive 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.750
 in this monique 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:43.020
 but you have to realize that people 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:45.360
 who are there the 54 56 in the 58 60 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.670
 they need to get dressed 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.770
 they are economically active are 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.439
 working people who have family 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.320
 who have children are normal people who 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.630
 can not be regarded as persons 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.210
 losers with relaxed people like 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.659
 people dissatisfied with life 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.180
 keep hurting super easy to lose weight 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.440
 super complicated keeping the weight is more 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.050
 complicated yet 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:14.100
 before we put that thing of 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.620
 judges talk about each other in the pt 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.900
 fat that it's shameless this and that 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.860
 I think we have to start 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.360
 look a little more than our 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.320
 own life and for industries called 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.240
 he size 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.980
 I only have one thing to talk about you 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.620
 need to start showing people 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.960
 normal I say so 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.750
 real life people because in real life 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.020
 There are skinny people who will invest 36 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.910
 38 40 but most of the people I 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.880
 I have seen in the middle of the street do not wear 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.430
 mannequin I've seen in the middle 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.390
 from the gentile street 44 up 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.360
 we have had a quality of life is 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.280
 not so good because we have little 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.920
 time to exercise we end up 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.710
 feeding badly I speak we are the 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.380
 our society then we live times 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.830
 so much concern 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.090
 financial economic stability 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.920
 violence then I think all this 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.500
 It contributes to that we end 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.200
 getting fat so we can see that in the 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.030
 our country the number of obese people 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.290
 increase and it is not only in brazil and in the world 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.739
 all 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.020
 There are a lot of obese people around the world. 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.820
 while these people do not lose weight 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.010
 while these people do not come in. 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.410
 of that pattern that you think all 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.800
 world should have people need 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:38.720
 to get out of the house and how to start 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.730
 invest and show that these people 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.730
 are there any such models 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.530
 really fat on the catwalks 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.540
 How about putting women who have those 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.300
 made enormous because we see the 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:55.230
 huge discontented woman's volume 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:04:00.030
 it is not so rare for a woman to estimate that 52 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:04.080
 of bra and try to dress 48 in the game 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.160
 neither is 50 and 52 and look for a beautiful bra 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.590
 in a store 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.530
 You do not think to find out you 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.830
 even think bra but those I love you 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.790
 You're old. 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.830
 the color of the skin and the color of the skin 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.820
 white people because if it's black or 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:26.670
 color of your skin is stir the people 10 clear 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:30.480
 Anyway I think it has to be shown 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:32.460
 they are real people then in life 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:37.260
 real life in real life there are people who 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:40.920
 weighs 50 kilos 55 60 and 70 100 but has 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:45.240
 people of 150 people of 130 people are here 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:49.440
 up to 200 kilograms of course it is 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.270
 Of course I know that what is wanted is 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.270
 that you want to show on the catwalk is 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.670
 It's that kind of light chubby 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:01.520
 You know that chubby girl at the most 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:07.410
 adjust the chubby needle but the 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:11.370
 light but you need to show the fat 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:14.190
 really fat because that's the one going 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.810
 serve to be loyal as your client is 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.960
 which will find it difficult to 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:22.169
 find a suit to find lingerie 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:25.770
 To close a sweater is that fat and that 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:27.950
 doubt that you have to think about the time 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.330
 to make your advertising campaign 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:33.090
 so I'll see that in the states 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:36.590
 Together they invest like hell in steel. 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:39.590
 and will have the models well-known by the niche 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.720
 beautiful and campaigning millionaire 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.640
 and in Brazil you do not have it here 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.750
 Brazil has here what they call 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:52.050
 fat, right? 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:54.300
 The most you see ends up being a 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.919
 great illusion right? 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:00.660
 What we call the Luis industry 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:02.940
 ice is not always a 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.040
 It's true because there's so much to 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.990
 under the covers if I were to speak everything 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.360
 beyond that my life series of 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:12.270
 Blogger truth that nobody counts right 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.260
 I would have to do another life series 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.970
 of plus size 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.700
 in fact no one when they have 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.470
 stories under the covers for all 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.919
 But I wanted to tell you guys not 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:25.110
 It's to make trouble and trouble. 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:28.710
 no frills or anything like that 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:33.170
 In this you have a store investing in 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:37.710
 fat women really border because 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:41.400
 have the following you need to make your 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:44.040
 and the fat women are there with 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.500
 money waiting for the products they 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.520
 were happy when these products 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.400
 they arrived 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.530
 they will consume money has no way 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.050
 do not have sex, do not have weight because 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:58.890
 prejudice at the time of making clothes 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:00.570
 or a lingerie with a fat wake up 

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.700
 Oh people, for God's sake, I'm so 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:09.420
 Sage is not up to tell me camila. 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:10.350
 because I sincerely ruffled confusion and 

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.260
 screaming 

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:17.900
 I 'm a little tired of seeing you know 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:19.890
 certain are messi says injustices 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.050
 especially with people I like 

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:24.560
 I just say I will not get involved in 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.820
 poll where nobody goes of companies 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:30.360
 end up involving the retina even with the 

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:32.400
 people and understand the mole I'm already 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.440
 getting old geek of the coin 

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.150
 then end up involving affectively with 

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.760
 the people I see certain 

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:40.560
 injustices I have to talk 

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.440
 It is not a time of 

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.530
 morning and still left rich and famous 

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.660
 Powerful and then love and turn right cover 

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:51.210
 of the faces, I apologize, Antonio 

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:52.650
 joking but it's my way even me 

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.970
 I think serious matters can be 

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:56.730
 spoken in a more relaxed way 

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:58.890
 but ultimately they avoid the fat of 

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:03.830
 The truth is that this antics of de 

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:05.940
 44 56 max Ta which exchange 

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.980
 completely out of the way 

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:10.160
 finally this is a kiss for you 

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:13.160
 especially for you who can 

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.160
 bye
