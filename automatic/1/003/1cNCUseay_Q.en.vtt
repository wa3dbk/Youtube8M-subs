00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
only going for about 10 to 15 k right

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.670 
only going for about 10 to 15 k right
now<00:03:10.910> which<00:03:11.480> i<00:03:11.600> think<00:03:11.660> is<00:03:11.870> a<00:03:11.930> bargain<00:03:12.290> for<00:03:12.620> a

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
now which i think is a bargain for a

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.100 
now which i think is a bargain for a
monster<00:03:13.070> cornerback<00:03:13.520> like<00:03:13.730> grimes<00:03:14.110> another

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
monster cornerback like grimes another

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.800 
monster cornerback like grimes another
bargain<00:03:15.500> is<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:16.310> dee<00:03:16.489> milliner<00:03:16.670> card<00:03:17.180> who<00:03:17.660> is

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
bargain is the dee milliner card who is

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.600 
bargain is the dee milliner card who is
probably<00:03:18.049> going<00:03:18.320> for<00:03:18.530> like<00:03:18.590> 4k<00:03:19.190> right<00:03:19.430> now

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
probably going for like 4k right now

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.580 
probably going for like 4k right now
pretty<00:03:20.299> good<00:03:20.570> in<00:03:20.660> coverage<00:03:20.870> and<00:03:21.290> he<00:03:21.350> catches

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
pretty good in coverage and he catches

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.699 
pretty good in coverage and he catches
everything<00:03:22.310> he<00:03:23.269> is<00:03:23.690> probably<00:03:24.049> my<00:03:24.440> leading

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
everything he is probably my leading

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.530 
everything he is probably my leading
touchdown<00:03:25.280> score<00:03:25.580> for<00:03:25.760> my<00:03:25.850> defense<00:03:26.269> right<00:03:26.510> now

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
touchdown score for my defense right now

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.140 
touchdown score for my defense right now
as<00:03:26.900> we<00:03:27.470> go<00:03:27.650> ahead<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.190> open<00:03:28.519> up<00:03:28.610> another<00:03:28.820> pack

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
Nelson is definitely one of the most

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.270 
Nelson is definitely one of the most

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
Deion Sanders as you

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.459 
Deion Sanders as you
I<00:04:23.169> probably<00:04:24.159> don't<00:04:24.610> know<00:04:24.879> Dashon<00:04:25.629> Goldson<00:04:26.259> and

00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:26.469 
I probably don't know Dashon Goldson and

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:28.920 
I probably don't know Dashon Goldson and
Donte<00:04:27.009> Whitner<00:04:27.159> are<00:04:27.430> my<00:04:27.550> safety<00:04:28.030> so<00:04:28.629> if<00:04:28.840> I

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
Donte Whitner are my safety so if I

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.480 
Donte Whitner are my safety so if I
could<00:04:29.139> have<00:04:29.409> them<00:04:29.650> playing<00:04:29.949> closer<00:04:30.219> to<00:04:30.400> the

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
could have them playing closer to the

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.189 
could have them playing closer to the
line<00:04:30.639> of<00:04:30.789> scrimmage<00:04:30.819> not<00:04:31.689> having<00:04:31.900> to<00:04:32.169> worry

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
line of scrimmage not having to worry

about<00:04:32.409> my<00:04:32.770> two<00:04:32.830> outside<00:04:33.430> corner<00:04:33.759> backs

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:33.939 
about my two outside corner backs

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:35.969 
about my two outside corner backs
getting<00:04:34.210> beat<00:04:34.449> deep<00:04:34.779> I<00:04:35.050> think<00:04:35.590> that's<00:04:35.740> only

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
getting beat deep I think that's only

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.339 
getting beat deep I think that's only
going<00:04:36.249> to<00:04:36.340> help<00:04:36.580> my<00:04:36.699> team<00:04:36.969> it's<00:04:37.629> probably<00:04:38.139> not

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:38.349 
going to help my team it's probably not

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:40.739 
going to help my team it's probably not
like<00:04:38.529> the<00:04:38.680> most<00:04:38.889> clever<00:04:39.249> idea<00:04:39.849> but<00:04:40.509> like<00:04:40.629> I

00:04:40.739 --> 00:04:40.749 
like the most clever idea but like I

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:42.570 
like the most clever idea but like I
said<00:04:40.810> in<00:04:41.259> my<00:04:41.319> last<00:04:41.560> commentary<00:04:42.219> I<00:04:42.310> like<00:04:42.490> to

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
said in my last commentary I like to

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.239 
said in my last commentary I like to
keep<00:04:42.729> my<00:04:42.909> linebackers<00:04:43.629> and<00:04:43.930> coverage<00:04:44.409> so<00:04:44.650> one

00:04:45.239 --> 00:04:45.249 
keep my linebackers and coverage so one

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:46.830 
keep my linebackers and coverage so one
thing<00:04:45.430> for<00:04:45.729> me<00:04:45.909> is<00:04:46.150> making<00:04:46.539> sure<00:04:46.719> my

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
thing for me is making sure my

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.749 
thing for me is making sure my
linebackers<00:04:47.379> have<00:04:47.529> good<00:04:47.740> coverage<00:04:47.979> going<00:04:48.699> to

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759 
linebackers have good coverage going to

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:50.129 
linebackers have good coverage going to
have<00:04:48.879> my<00:04:48.999> Safety's<00:04:49.419> kind<00:04:49.629> of<00:04:49.689> playing<00:04:49.870> close

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
have my Safety's kind of playing close
