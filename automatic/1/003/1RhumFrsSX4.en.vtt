here<00:01:27.270> because<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.990> studs<00:01:28.350> I'm<00:01:29.070> going<00:01:29.280> to

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
here because this is studs I'm going to

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.330 
here because this is studs I'm going to
use<00:01:29.550> a<00:01:29.580> match<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.930> she's<00:01:31.260> more<00:01:31.470> rigid<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.130> I
