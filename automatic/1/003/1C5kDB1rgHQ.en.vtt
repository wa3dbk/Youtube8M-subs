00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
the same as drawing a horse and there's

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.490 
the same as drawing a horse and there's
a<00:00:38.030> smaller<00:00:38.270> circle<00:00:38.600> at<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:38.720> end<00:00:38.899> for<00:00:39.260> the

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
a smaller circle at the end for the

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
where the mouth and the nose are going

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.319 
where the mouth and the nose are going
to<00:00:41.149> go<00:00:43.120> really<00:00:44.120> fast<00:00:44.239> real<00:00:44.720> simple<00:00:45.050> shapes<00:00:45.290> and

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
to go really fast real simple shapes and

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.000 
to go really fast real simple shapes and
I'm<00:00:47.329> just<00:00:47.510> going<00:00:47.660> to<00:00:47.690> draw<00:00:47.870> a<00:00:47.899> line<00:00:48.199> over<00:00:48.379> here

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
I'm just going to draw a line over here

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.040 
I'm just going to draw a line over here
that's<00:00:49.370> going<00:00:49.519> to<00:00:49.640> be<00:00:49.699> the<00:00:49.789> neck<00:00:50.000> and<00:00:50.300> because

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
that's going to be the neck and because

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.799 
that's going to be the neck and because
this<00:00:51.260> is<00:00:51.440> a<00:00:51.469> stylized<00:00:52.480> illustration<00:00:53.480> I'm<00:00:53.690> not

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
this is a stylized illustration I'm not

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.240 
this is a stylized illustration I'm not
really<00:00:54.079> going<00:00:54.230> for<00:00:54.500> realism<00:00:54.800> or<00:00:55.100> anything

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
really going for realism or anything

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.119 
really going for realism or anything
which<00:00:56.239> makes<00:00:56.570> it<00:00:56.750> a<00:00:56.929> lot<00:00:57.079> easier<00:00:57.469> to<00:00:57.710> draw<00:00:58.039> it

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
which makes it a lot easier to draw it

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.579 
which makes it a lot easier to draw it
quickly<00:00:58.539> next<00:00:59.539> I'm<00:00:59.719> drawing<00:00:59.899> the<00:01:00.050> ears<00:01:00.289> now

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
quickly next I'm drawing the ears now

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:03.790 
quickly next I'm drawing the ears now
zebras<00:01:01.129> have<00:01:01.370> really<00:01:01.760> long<00:01:02.269> ears<00:01:03.260> compared<00:01:03.739> to

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
zebras have really long ears compared to

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.980 
zebras have really long ears compared to
horses<00:01:04.190> so<00:01:04.460> I'm<00:01:05.030> along<00:01:05.330> dating<00:01:05.750> these<00:01:05.930> a

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
horses so I'm along dating these a

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.980 
horses so I'm along dating these a
little<00:01:06.290> bit<00:01:10.120> and<00:01:11.120> I'm<00:01:11.420> going<00:01:11.510> to<00:01:11.600> draw<00:01:11.720> a<00:01:11.750> line

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
little bit and I'm going to draw a line

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.720 
little bit and I'm going to draw a line
through<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.320> middle<00:01:12.350> of<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:12.830> front<00:01:13.190> of<00:01:13.460> the

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
through the middle of the front of the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.540 
through the middle of the front of the
zebras<00:01:14.240> space<00:01:14.690> just<00:01:15.530> to<00:01:15.680> get<00:01:15.890> a<00:01:16.190> little<00:01:16.370> bit

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
zebras space just to get a little bit

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.950 
zebras space just to get a little bit
more<00:01:16.700> form<00:01:17.060> here<00:01:17.390> with<00:01:17.690> more<00:01:17.900> dimension<00:01:18.439> and

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
more form here with more dimension and

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:27.260 
more form here with more dimension and
that's<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.200> cheek

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.149 

I'm<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:28.020> rounding<00:01:28.170> out<00:01:28.560> things<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:29.040> little

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
I'm just rounding out things a little

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.399 
I'm just rounding out things a little
bit<00:01:29.369> now<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.110> chin<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.260> the<00:01:31.380> zebra<00:01:33.409> that's

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
bit now the chin of the zebra that's

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.530 
bit now the chin of the zebra that's
where<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:35.390> brow<00:01:36.390> bone<00:01:36.690> is<00:01:37.020> same<00:01:37.619> for<00:01:37.890> horses

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
where the brow bone is same for horses

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.580 
where the brow bone is same for horses
so<00:01:39.540> if<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.720> wanted<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.960> do<00:01:40.080> a<00:01:40.110> horse<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.470> could

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
so if you wanted to do a horse you could

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.070 
so if you wanted to do a horse you could
follow<00:01:40.830> this<00:01:41.100> same<00:01:41.340> design<00:01:41.880> I'll<00:01:42.720> get<00:01:42.930> around

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
follow this same design I'll get around

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.920 
follow this same design I'll get around
to<00:01:43.170> doing<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.500> course<00:01:43.530> one<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.400> these<00:01:44.580> days

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
to doing of course one of these days

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.749 
to doing of course one of these days
this<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:46.110> just<00:01:46.350> for<00:01:46.500> fun<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.740> saw<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.250> design

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
this is just for fun I saw this design

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.010 
this is just for fun I saw this design
and<00:01:48.000> my<00:01:48.090> sketchbook<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.690> thought<00:01:48.840> whew

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
and my sketchbook and I thought whew

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.980 
and my sketchbook and I thought whew
this<00:01:49.979> would<00:01:50.130> be<00:01:50.220> fun<00:01:50.479> next<00:01:51.479> I'm<00:01:51.720> doing<00:01:51.750> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
this would be fun next I'm doing the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.080 
this would be fun next I'm doing the
mane<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.380> zebra<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:54.229> it's<00:01:55.229> kind<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:56.090> stiff

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
mane of the zebra and it's kind of stiff

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
mane of the zebra and it's kind of stiff
so<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:58.020> really<00:01:58.200> easy<00:01:58.470> just<00:01:58.830> draw<00:01:59.610> that<00:02:00.110> long

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
so it's really easy just draw that long

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.999 
so it's really easy just draw that long
shape<00:02:01.440> there<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.119> do<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.149> simple<00:02:03.479> mouth<00:02:03.890> in<00:02:04.890> a

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
shape there and do a simple mouth in a

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.980 
shape there and do a simple mouth in a
single<00:02:05.340> nostril<00:02:05.759> there<00:02:05.910> again<00:02:06.450> really<00:02:06.750> simple

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
single nostril there again really simple

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.480 
single nostril there again really simple
it's<00:02:07.590> all<00:02:07.679> stylized

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.970 

and<00:02:13.640> these<00:02:14.270> stripes<00:02:14.630> are<00:02:14.780> going<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:15.020> be<00:02:15.200> I'm

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
and these stripes are going to be I'm

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.250 
and these stripes are going to be I'm
going<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.220> eventually<00:02:16.370> close<00:02:16.760> in<00:02:17.230> with<00:02:18.230> a

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
going to eventually close in with a

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.690 
going to eventually close in with a
sharpie<00:02:18.650> black<00:02:19.460> and<00:02:19.640> white<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:24.430> now<00:02:25.430> I'm<00:02:25.550> just

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
sharpie black and white and now I'm just

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.340 
sharpie black and white and now I'm just
going<00:02:25.850> to<00:02:25.880> add<00:02:26.060> some<00:02:26.090> stripes<00:02:26.750> here<00:02:27.020> again

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
going to add some stripes here again

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.980 
going to add some stripes here again
this<00:02:27.950> is<00:02:28.010> all<00:02:28.340> stylized<00:02:28.940> I<00:02:29.180> really<00:02:29.750> didn't

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
this is all stylized I really didn't

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.710 
this is all stylized I really didn't
bother<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.530> look<00:02:30.950> up<00:02:31.580> zebras<00:02:32.090> at<00:02:32.240> this<00:02:32.390> point

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
bother to look up zebras at this point

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.880 
bother to look up zebras at this point
because<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:33.020> thought<00:02:33.170> you<00:02:33.320> know<00:02:33.440> this<00:02:33.710> is<00:02:33.860> just

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
because I thought you know this is just

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.150 
because I thought you know this is just
going<00:02:34.070> to<00:02:34.190> be<00:02:34.250> for<00:02:34.400> fun<00:02:34.810> um<00:02:36.010> it's<00:02:37.010> not

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
going to be for fun um it's not

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.200 
going to be for fun um it's not
something<00:02:37.370> I<00:02:37.400> want<00:02:37.490> to<00:02:37.580> spend<00:02:37.760> a<00:02:37.850> whole<00:02:37.940> lot<00:02:38.000> of

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
something I want to spend a whole lot of

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.850 
something I want to spend a whole lot of
time<00:02:38.390> on<00:02:38.420> but<00:02:38.870> something<00:02:39.560> that's<00:02:39.650> still

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
time on but something that's still

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.590 
time on but something that's still
pretty<00:02:40.390> it's<00:02:41.390> fun<00:02:41.600> to<00:02:41.720> draw

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
pretty it's fun to draw

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.970 
pretty it's fun to draw
I'll<00:02:44.600> probably<00:02:44.780> get<00:02:44.960> around<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.350> a<00:02:45.380> realistic

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
I'll probably get around to a realistic

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.900 
I'll probably get around to a realistic
one<00:02:46.100> later<00:02:49.870> nice<00:02:50.870> thing<00:02:51.050> about<00:02:51.110> this<00:02:51.500> is<00:02:51.910> you

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
one later nice thing about this is you

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.380 
one later nice thing about this is you
know<00:02:53.030> it<00:02:53.120> doesn't<00:02:53.300> take<00:02:53.450> that<00:02:53.600> long<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.990> make

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
know it doesn't take that long to make

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.020 
know it doesn't take that long to make
um<00:02:56.680> I'm<00:02:57.680> going<00:02:57.890> to<00:02:57.980> add<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.070> little<00:02:58.220> highlight

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
um I'm going to add a little highlight

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.760 
um I'm going to add a little highlight
here<00:02:59.390> I<00:03:00.130> like<00:03:01.130> where<00:03:01.310> that<00:03:01.460> went<00:03:02.770> some

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
here I like where that went some

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.300 
here I like where that went some
eyelashes<00:03:05.620> okay<00:03:06.620> I<00:03:06.800> don't<00:03:06.920> like<00:03:07.070> where<00:03:07.220> that

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
eyelashes okay I don't like where that

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
eyelashes okay I don't like where that
highlight<00:03:07.700> is<00:03:07.850> so<00:03:08.150> I'm<00:03:08.390> gonna<00:03:08.540> move<00:03:08.720> it<00:03:10.240> it's<00:03:11.240> a

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
highlight is so I'm gonna move it it's a

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.350 
highlight is so I'm gonna move it it's a
little<00:03:11.630> better<00:03:11.870> I<00:03:12.200> don't<00:03:12.500> know<00:03:12.650> we'll<00:03:13.040> see

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
little better I don't know we'll see

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.970 
little better I don't know we'll see
we'll<00:03:14.360> see<00:03:14.390> how<00:03:14.570> I<00:03:14.600> feel<00:03:14.810> later<00:03:15.080> after<00:03:15.680> finish

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
we'll see how I feel later after finish

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.240 
we'll see how I feel later after finish
outlining<00:03:16.340> everything

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.640 

and<00:03:22.340> if<00:03:23.330> you<00:03:23.480> familiar<00:03:23.870> with<00:03:23.900> my<00:03:24.020> videos<00:03:24.440> up<00:03:24.470> to

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
and if you familiar with my videos up to

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.710 
and if you familiar with my videos up to
now<00:03:24.860> I<00:03:25.190> you<00:03:25.730> know<00:03:25.850> I<00:03:25.880> try<00:03:26.090> to<00:03:26.150> stay<00:03:26.330> close<00:03:26.510> to

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
now I you know I try to stay close to

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.420 
now I you know I try to stay close to
the<00:03:26.810> lines<00:03:26.990> but<00:03:27.350> I'm<00:03:27.740> also<00:03:29.170> I<00:03:30.190> do<00:03:31.190> it

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
the lines but I'm also I do it

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.100 
the lines but I'm also I do it
intuitively<00:03:31.940> you<00:03:32.390> know<00:03:32.420> I<00:03:32.510> draw<00:03:32.750> these<00:03:32.900> lines

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
intuitively you know I draw these lines

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.340 
intuitively you know I draw these lines
these<00:03:33.620> final<00:03:34.070> outlines<00:03:34.880> intuitively<00:03:35.420> so<00:03:35.780> it

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
these final outlines intuitively so it

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.990 
these final outlines intuitively so it
looks<00:03:36.620> a<00:03:36.740> little<00:03:36.920> bit<00:03:37.160> different<00:03:37.640> than<00:03:37.790> what<00:03:37.940> I

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
looks a little bit different than what I

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.820 
looks a little bit different than what I
originally<00:03:38.120> draw<00:03:38.750> and<00:03:41.410> it<00:03:42.410> keeps<00:03:42.830> the<00:03:43.190> action

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
originally draw and it keeps the action

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.130 
originally draw and it keeps the action
the<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:46.160> movement<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:46.760> energy<00:03:47.150> because<00:03:47.990> if<00:03:48.080> I

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
the the movement the energy because if I

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.200 
the the movement the energy because if I
try<00:03:48.350> to<00:03:48.410> draw<00:03:48.620> it<00:03:48.680> perfectly<00:03:48.970> exactly<00:03:49.970> how<00:03:50.090> it

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 
try to draw it perfectly exactly how it

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.710 
try to draw it perfectly exactly how it
is<00:03:50.360> then<00:03:50.660> it<00:03:50.960> gets<00:03:51.170> some<00:03:51.470> I<00:03:51.740> get<00:03:52.250> too<00:03:52.400> stiff<00:03:52.790> and

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
is then it gets some I get too stiff and

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.770 
is then it gets some I get too stiff and
it<00:03:53.810> just<00:03:53.960> doesn't<00:03:54.110> look<00:03:54.230> as<00:03:54.500> good<00:03:54.700> so<00:03:55.750> give<00:03:56.750> it

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
it just doesn't look as good so give it

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.720 
it just doesn't look as good so give it
a<00:03:56.959> try<00:03:57.020> when<00:03:57.380> you're<00:03:57.500> drawing<00:04:00.070> you<00:04:01.070> know<00:04:01.100> don't

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
a try when you're drawing you know don't

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.690 
a try when you're drawing you know don't
don't<00:04:01.880> stiffen<00:04:02.300> up<00:04:02.540> and<00:04:02.750> worry<00:04:03.020> about<00:04:03.050> how

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
don't stiffen up and worry about how

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.910 
don't stiffen up and worry about how
exact<00:04:04.700> it<00:04:04.880> is<00:04:05.110> give<00:04:06.110> yourself<00:04:06.380> some<00:04:06.530> freedom

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
exact it is give yourself some freedom

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.230 
exact it is give yourself some freedom
of<00:04:07.070> movement<00:04:08.650> yeah<00:04:09.650> I<00:04:10.130> don't<00:04:10.790> like<00:04:11.090> that

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
of movement yeah I don't like that

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.240 
of movement yeah I don't like that
highlight<00:04:11.600> either<00:04:11.840> so<00:04:12.080> I'm<00:04:12.380> just<00:04:12.590> gonna<00:04:12.709> leave

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
highlight either so I'm just gonna leave

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.120 
highlight either so I'm just gonna leave
it'll<00:04:13.430> you<00:04:13.910> know<00:04:13.940> empty<00:04:14.830> and<00:04:15.830> when<00:04:16.010> I'm

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
it'll you know empty and when I'm

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.470 
it'll you know empty and when I'm
finished<00:04:16.489> filling<00:04:16.700> in<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:16.970> rest<00:04:17.180> of

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
finished filling in the rest of

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.780 
finished filling in the rest of
everything<00:04:18.049> oh<00:04:18.440> I'll<00:04:19.070> figure<00:04:19.310> it<00:04:19.430> out<00:04:19.609> I'll

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
everything oh I'll figure it out I'll

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.450 
everything oh I'll figure it out I'll
get<00:04:19.970> a<00:04:20.000> better<00:04:20.150> feel<00:04:20.510> for<00:04:20.890> how<00:04:21.890> I<00:04:22.010> want<00:04:22.250> it<00:04:22.310> to

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
get a better feel for how I want it to

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:29.409 
get a better feel for how I want it to
look<00:04:24.490> and<00:04:25.490> that<00:04:26.150> happens<00:04:26.510> a<00:04:26.600> lot<00:04:26.630> to<00:04:27.440> me<00:04:28.419> you

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
look and that happens a lot to me you

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.210 
look and that happens a lot to me you
know<00:04:29.540> I'll<00:04:29.780> change<00:04:30.260> my<00:04:30.320> mind<00:04:30.410> doing<00:04:30.950> the<00:04:31.070> whole

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
know I'll change my mind doing the whole

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.909 
know I'll change my mind doing the whole
drawing<00:04:31.460> process<00:04:32.290> not<00:04:33.290> like<00:04:33.440> you<00:04:33.590> know<00:04:33.680> what

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
drawing process not like you know what

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.650 
drawing process not like you know what
this<00:04:34.340> doesn't<00:04:34.730> look<00:04:34.790> as<00:04:34.940> good<00:04:35.120> anymore<00:04:35.180> as<00:04:35.570> I

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
this doesn't look as good anymore as I

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.909 
this doesn't look as good anymore as I
thought<00:04:35.810> it<00:04:35.960> would<00:04:36.140> I<00:04:36.440> want<00:04:36.650> to<00:04:36.680> try<00:04:36.860> this

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
thought it would I want to try this

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.130 
thought it would I want to try this
instead<00:04:40.240> see<00:04:41.240> I'm<00:04:41.510> doing<00:04:41.660> it<00:04:41.870> here<00:04:41.930> with<00:04:42.080> the

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
instead see I'm doing it here with the

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.620 
instead see I'm doing it here with the
stripes<00:04:42.440> I'm<00:04:42.740> not<00:04:43.520> worrying<00:04:43.820> about<00:04:43.940> pulling

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
stripes I'm not worrying about pulling

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.390 
stripes I'm not worrying about pulling
it<00:04:44.690> exactly<00:04:45.229> it's<00:04:45.410> just<00:04:45.440> it's<00:04:46.010> a<00:04:46.070> starting

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
it exactly it's just it's a starting

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.880 
it exactly it's just it's a starting
point<00:04:46.430> and<00:04:47.180> eyeball<00:04:48.169> it<00:04:50.260> I'm<00:04:51.260> done<00:04:51.500> outlining

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
point and eyeball it I'm done outlining

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.430 
point and eyeball it I'm done outlining
everything<00:04:52.070> so<00:04:52.840> time<00:04:53.840> to<00:04:53.990> get<00:04:54.110> rid<00:04:54.260> of<00:04:54.290> all

just<00:05:55.170> black<00:05:55.320> and<00:05:55.500> white<00:05:55.650> but<00:05:55.800> I<00:05:55.860> think<00:05:56.010> it'd<00:05:56.100> be

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
just black and white but I think it'd be

just black and white but I think it'd be
really<00:05:56.220> fun<00:05:56.400> to<00:05:57.000> also<00:05:57.300> do<00:05:57.420> it<00:05:57.570> say<00:05:58.080> in<00:05:58.200> purple

or pink or do rainbow colors it's simple

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.560 
or pink or do rainbow colors it's simple
enough<00:06:02.220> you<00:06:02.400> could<00:06:02.670> really<00:06:02.880> play<00:06:03.330> with<00:06:03.480> the

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570
