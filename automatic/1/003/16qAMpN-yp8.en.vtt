desperate desperate need for shampoo and
conditioner<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.830> i<00:00:20.550> really<00:00:20.820> like<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.119> herbal

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
essence shampoo and conditioners I think

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.820 
essence shampoo and conditioners I think
they<00:00:23.490> work<00:00:23.640> really<00:00:23.789> well<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.330> my<00:00:25.289> hair<00:00:25.560> has

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
they work really well and my hair has

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.269 
they work really well and my hair has
been<00:00:26.070> extremely<00:00:26.789> dry<00:00:27.449> lately<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:28.980> found

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
been extremely dry lately and so I found

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.330 
been extremely dry lately and so I found
this<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.730> it's<00:00:29.910> called<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.330> hello<00:00:30.539> hydration

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
this and it's called the hello hydration

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.670 
this and it's called the hello hydration
shampoo<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.790> then<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.690> got<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.140> conditioner

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
shampoo and then I got the conditioner

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.180 
shampoo and then I got the conditioner
to<00:00:35.430> go<00:00:35.550> with<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.110> I<00:00:37.110> haven't<00:00:37.620> ever<00:00:37.739> used<00:00:37.890> it

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
to go with it and I haven't ever used it

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.440 
to go with it and I haven't ever used it
so<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.340> can't<00:00:38.550> really<00:00:38.670> talk<00:00:38.910> too<00:00:39.059> much<00:00:39.180> about<00:00:39.239> it

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
so I can't really talk too much about it

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.690 
so I can't really talk too much about it
but<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:40.200> know<00:00:40.559> most<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:41.040> their<00:00:41.219> stuff<00:00:41.309> works

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
but I know most of their stuff works

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.920 
but I know most of their stuff works
really<00:00:41.879> well<00:00:42.000> like<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.360> dangerously

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
really well like the dangerously

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.930 
really well like the dangerously
straight<00:00:43.379> or<00:00:43.559> something<00:00:43.890> like<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.730> works

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
straight or something like that it works

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.150 
straight or something like that it works
really<00:00:45.210> really<00:00:45.360> really<00:00:45.719> good<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.260> I'm<00:00:46.920> excited

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
really really really good so I'm excited

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.190 
really really really good so I'm excited
about<00:00:47.309> these<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:47.940> think<00:00:48.120> these<00:00:48.239> were<00:00:48.480> three

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
about these and I think these were three

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.229 
about these and I think these were three
dollars<00:00:49.620> or<00:00:49.770> four<00:00:49.920> dollars<00:00:50.190> each<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.370> it's<00:00:51.120> not

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
dollars or four dollars each so it's not

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.660 
dollars or four dollars each so it's not
too<00:00:51.390> bad<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:52.670> also<00:00:53.670> got<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:55.070> heat<00:00:56.070> tamer<00:00:56.250> spray<00:00:56.640> I

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
too bad I also got a heat tamer spray I

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.610 
too bad I also got a heat tamer spray I
always<00:00:57.059> picked<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.390> up<00:00:57.449> I've<00:00:58.170> been<00:00:58.320> out<00:00:58.440> for

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
always picked this up I've been out for

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.200 
always picked this up I've been out for
a<00:00:58.680> while<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.190> really<00:00:59.460> needed<00:00:59.640> one<00:00:59.940> and
