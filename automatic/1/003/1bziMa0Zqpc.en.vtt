00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
think it's that necessary now on the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.640 
think it's that necessary now on the
sides<00:01:25.860> it's<00:01:26.130> like<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:27.479> ground<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.259> really

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
sides it's like the ground is really

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.190 
sides it's like the ground is really
wavy<00:01:29.400> which<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:30.030> could<00:01:30.299> not<00:01:30.479> figure<00:01:31.049> out

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
wavy which I just could not figure out

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.380 
wavy which I just could not figure out
how<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.470> make<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.640> game<00:01:32.880> because<00:01:33.360> of

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
how to make that in this game because of

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.840 
how to make that in this game because of
the<00:01:33.570> limitations<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.500> has<00:01:34.650> if<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.189> don't

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
the limitations that it has if you don't

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.550 
the limitations that it has if you don't
if<00:01:36.119> you're<00:01:36.270> just<00:01:36.479> randomly<00:01:36.990> here<00:01:37.259> researching

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
if you're just randomly here researching

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.749 
if you're just randomly here researching
straily<00:01:37.979> photos<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.340> don't<00:01:38.460> even<00:01:38.579> know<00:01:38.670> what

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
straily photos you don't even know what

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.850 
straily photos you don't even know what
skate<00:01:39.000> three<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.299> but<00:01:39.570> yeah<00:01:40.259> there's<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
skate three is but yeah there's the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.609 
skate three is but yeah there's the
information<00:01:41.310> about<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:42.000> because<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:43.049> game

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
information about that because this game

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.230 
information about that because this game
has<00:01:43.649> long<00:01:44.070> limitations<00:01:44.729> which<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.030> why<00:01:45.180> this

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
has long limitations which is why this

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.870 
has long limitations which is why this
park<00:01:45.960> wouldn't<00:01:46.290> look<00:01:46.409> exactly<00:01:47.040> like<00:01:47.310> how<00:01:47.759> it

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
park wouldn't look exactly like how it

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.789 
park wouldn't look exactly like how it
does<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.180> real<00:01:48.360> life<00:01:48.540> like<00:01:49.229> obviously<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
does in real life like obviously the

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.039 
does in real life like obviously the
ledges<00:01:50.130> they<00:01:50.159> make<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:51.000> game<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.540> not<00:01:51.930> in

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
ledges they make in this game on not in

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.780 
ledges they make in this game on not in
this<00:01:52.140> game<00:01:52.320> I<00:01:52.380> mean<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:53.070> real<00:01:53.280> life<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
this game I mean in real life and the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.639 
this game I mean in real life and the
Street<00:01:54.090> League<00:01:54.119> parks<00:01:54.540> are<00:01:54.720> just<00:01:55.409> they<00:01:55.500> look

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
Street League parks are just they look

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.469 
Street League parks are just they look
they<00:01:55.829> look<00:01:55.860> like<00:01:56.280> works<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.939> art<00:01:57.119> like<00:01:57.270> they're

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
they look like works of art like they're

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.539 
they look like works of art like they're
like<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:57.930> perfect<00:01:58.200> but<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.070> can't<00:01:59.280> make<00:01:59.399> all

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
like so perfect but you can't make all

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.330 
like so perfect but you can't make all
of<00:01:59.700> them<00:01:59.790> in<00:01:59.880> skate<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.509> that's<00:02:01.189> that's<00:02:02.189> just

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
of them in skate so that's that's just

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.990 
of them in skate so that's that's just
how<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.700> is

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
how it is

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.230 
how it is
and<00:02:03.090> that's<00:02:03.840> how<00:02:03.930> it's<00:02:04.049> going<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.290> be<00:02:04.350> um<00:02:05.240> so

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
and that's how it's going to be um so

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.190 
and that's how it's going to be um so
yeah<00:02:06.329> that's<00:02:06.479> about<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.719> about<00:02:06.930> this

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200
