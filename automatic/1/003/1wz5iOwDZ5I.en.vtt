there's<00:00:00.900> a<00:00:00.960> completely<00:00:01.350> redesigned<00:00:01.620> patient

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
there's a completely redesigned patient

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.090 
there's a completely redesigned patient
car<00:00:02.490> and<00:00:02.790> then<00:00:03.240> a<00:00:03.319> certain<00:00:04.319> cocktail<00:00:04.859> which<00:00:04.980> is

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
car and then a certain cocktail which is

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.920 
car and then a certain cocktail which is
actually<00:00:05.520> pretty<00:00:06.359> much<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.750> same

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
actually pretty much the same

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.500 
actually pretty much the same
structurally<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:07.740> that's<00:00:07.859> by<00:00:08.010> design<00:00:08.360> so<00:00:09.360> now

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
structurally and that's by design so now

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.589 
structurally and that's by design so now
we<00:00:09.570> have<00:00:09.840> is<00:00:10.160> you<00:00:11.160> know<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.370> biggest<00:00:12.330> thing

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
we have is you know the biggest thing

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.660 
we have is you know the biggest thing
that<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:12.840> look<00:00:13.049> at<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.349> annotation<00:00:14.009> car<00:00:14.219> is

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
that I look at is annotation car is

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.330 
that I look at is annotation car is
that's<00:00:14.969> actually<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.410> cool<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.619> so<00:00:16.770> it's<00:00:17.220> almost

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
that's actually a cool it so it's almost

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.250 
that's actually a cool it so it's almost
like<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.580> boom<00:00:17.820> now<00:00:18.029> Francisco<00:00:18.570> but<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.320> has<00:00:19.470> the

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
like a boom now Francisco but it has the

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.210 
like a boom now Francisco but it has the
ability<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.699> turn<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.850> room<00:00:24.060> if<00:00:24.420> needed<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.470> what

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
ability to turn a room if needed so what

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.620 
ability to turn a room if needed so what
you'll<00:00:26.340> see<00:00:26.400> is<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.760> robot<00:00:27.060> can<00:00:27.180> be<00:00:27.240> driven<00:00:27.449> in

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
you'll see is the robot can be driven in

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.470 
you'll see is the robot can be driven in
the<00:00:27.720> same<00:00:27.960> same<00:00:28.710> spot<00:00:29.039> every<00:00:29.400> single<00:00:29.550> time<00:00:29.849> but

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
the same same spot every single time but

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.519 
the same same spot every single time but
it<00:00:30.599> can<00:00:30.689> be<00:00:30.779> docked<00:00:30.990> anywhere<00:00:31.439> around

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
it can be docked anywhere around

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.250 
it can be docked anywhere around
stations<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.250> mobile<00:00:32.870> connections<00:00:33.870> moving

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
stations the mobile connections moving

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.420 
stations the mobile connections moving
spin<00:00:34.469> around<00:00:34.820> you<00:00:35.820> know<00:00:36.480> also<00:00:37.160> going<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.309> more

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
spin around you know also going to more

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.910 
spin around you know also going to more
detail<00:00:38.790> but<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.059> camera<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.930> actually<00:00:40.500> as

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
detail but the camera is actually as

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.740 
detail but the camera is actually as
small<00:00:41.309> as<00:00:41.489> your<00:00:41.579> laparoscopic<00:00:42.239> camera<00:00:42.570> and

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
small as your laparoscopic camera and

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.750 
small as your laparoscopic camera and
the<00:00:43.260> optics<00:00:43.739> are<00:00:43.890> actually<00:00:44.190> on<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.430> tip<00:00:44.730> of

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
the optics are actually on the tip of

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.720 
the optics are actually on the tip of
the<00:00:44.969> ESCO<00:00:45.329> Center<00:00:45.930> said<00:00:46.170> if<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.160> name<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.489> name

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
the ESCO Center said if the name is name

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.029 
the ESCO Center said if the name is name
so<00:00:48.539> what<00:00:48.690> enables<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.289> names<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.710> Port

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
so what enables the names you to Port

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.350 
so what enables the names you to Port
hop<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.460> any<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.940> different<00:00:51.210> boards

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
hop in any of the different boards

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.319 
hop in any of the different boards
during<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.379> seizure<00:00:53.239> perspective<00:00:54.239> is

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
during the seizure perspective is

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.360 
during the seizure perspective is
different<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.469> now<00:00:55.500> I'll<00:00:55.800> have<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:56.070> guys<00:00:56.190> all

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
different so now I'll have you guys all

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.849 
different so now I'll have you guys all
come<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.760> back<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.180> system<00:00:57.739> you<00:00:58.739> know

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
come to the back of the system you know

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.560 
come to the back of the system you know
the<00:00:59.100> other<00:00:59.370> things<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.699> notice<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.270> we

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
the other things you notice is that we

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.709 
the other things you notice is that we
passed<00:01:00.809> with<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.379> with<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.489> newer<00:01:02.940> arms<00:01:03.449> and

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
passed with the with the newer arms and

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:04.820 
passed with the with the newer arms and
the<00:01:04.019> patient<00:01:04.350> cart<00:01:04.530> you're<00:01:04.650> going<00:01:04.769> to

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
the patient cart you're going to

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.190 
the patient cart you're going to
actually<00:01:04.949> be<00:01:05.100> able<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.400> have<00:01:05.519> multiple<00:01:06.299> multi

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
actually be able to have multiple multi

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.440 
actually be able to have multiple multi
fork<00:01:07.470> or<00:01:07.920> quadrant<00:01:08.280> access<00:01:08.640> with<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> single

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
fork or quadrant access with a single

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.090 
fork or quadrant access with a single
time<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.140> you're<00:01:10.229> going<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.380> be<00:01:10.470> able<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.710> work

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
time so you're going to be able to work

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.200 
time so you're going to be able to work
around<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.430> patient<00:01:11.700> I'll<00:01:11.760> show<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.030> exactly

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
around the patient I'll show you exactly

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.670 
around the patient I'll show you exactly
how<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.450> works<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.200> what<00:01:13.290> we<00:01:13.439> did<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.650> we

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
how that works so what we did is we

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.990 
how that works so what we did is we
selected<00:01:14.540> just<00:01:15.540> adjust<00:01:15.869> for<00:01:16.080> basic

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
selected just adjust for basic

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.249 
selected just adjust for basic
demonstration<00:01:18.000> purposes<00:01:18.360> upper<00:01:18.689> abdominal

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
demonstration purposes upper abdominal

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.660 
demonstration purposes upper abdominal
we're<00:01:19.680> driving<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.130> from<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.340> patient's

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
we're driving it from the patient's

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.370 
we're driving it from the patient's
right<00:01:20.790> hand<00:01:21.030> side<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.869> now<00:01:21.990> what<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.229> here

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
right hand side so now what I have here

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.030 
right hand side so now what I have here
is<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.799> can<00:01:23.040> actually<00:01:23.159> move<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.150> move<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> cart

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
is I can actually move it move the cart

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.649 
is I can actually move it move the cart
it's<00:01:26.040> about<00:01:26.189> 600<00:01:26.549> pounds<00:01:27.030> heavier<00:01:27.390> than<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
it's about 600 pounds heavier than the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.719 
it's about 600 pounds heavier than the
prior<00:01:27.900> system<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:29.070> reason<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
prior system and the reason is that the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.670 
prior system and the reason is that the
mobile<00:01:29.939> coolers<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.110> community

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
mobile coolers in the community

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.380 
mobile coolers in the community
great<00:01:31.920> balance<00:01:32.310> here<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.970> now<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.090> can<00:01:33.240> press

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
great balance here so now I can press

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.539 
great balance here so now I can press
bolt<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.990> press<00:01:34.170> both<00:01:34.409> buttons<00:01:34.439> push<00:01:35.430> it

bolt to press both buttons push it

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.609 
bolt to press both buttons push it
forward<00:01:35.850> now<00:01:35.939> what<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.210> can<00:01:36.329> see<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:37.110> actually

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
forward now what you can see is actually

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.679 
forward now what you can see is actually
a<00:01:37.650> laser<00:01:38.130> target<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.210> going<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.479> show<00:01:39.630> you

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
a laser target so it's going to show you

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.240 
a laser target so it's going to show you
actually<00:01:40.049> where<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.380> want<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.680> put<00:01:40.799> your<00:01:40.979> your

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
actually where you want to put your your

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.460 
actually where you want to put your your
your<00:01:42.090> cannula<00:01:42.479> your<00:01:42.869> initial<00:01:43.170> targeted

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
your cannula your initial targeted

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.990

cannula is where we're going to we're
going<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.180> get<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.659> crosshair

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
going to get the crosshair

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.740 
going to get the crosshair
when<00:01:46.650> we<00:01:46.740> drive<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:47.250> prior<00:01:48.090> prior<00:01:48.450> driving

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
when we drive it in prior prior driving

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.790 
when we drive it in prior prior driving
and<00:01:49.020> what<00:01:49.110> we're<00:01:49.200> going<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.410> do<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.650> when<00:01:49.770> a

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
and what we're going to do and when a

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.490 
and what we're going to do and when a
deploy<00:01:50.520> for<00:01:50.820> docking<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.630> hold<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.290> button

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.520 
deploy for docking I hold this button
down<00:01:52.740> here<00:01:53.840> consider<00:01:54.840> walk<00:01:55.050> it's<00:01:55.260> the<00:01:55.380> voice

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
down here consider walk it's the voice

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.020 
down here consider walk it's the voice
activation<00:01:55.950> here<00:01:56.190> walks<00:01:56.400> I<00:01:56.580> can<00:01:56.760> give<00:01:56.910> you

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
activation here walks I can give you

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:08.680 
activation here walks I can give you
kind<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.300> crosses<00:01:57.630> two<00:01:57.780> steps<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:58.800> we<00:01:58.890> need

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.930 

okay<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:10.080> now<00:02:10.200> we<00:02:10.259> have<00:02:10.500> somebody<00:02:11.430> help<00:02:11.820> me

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
okay so now we have somebody help me

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.160 
okay so now we have somebody help me
actually<00:02:12.120> I'm<00:02:12.420> going<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.600> come<00:02:12.720> in<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:12.960> drive

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
actually I'm going to come in and drive

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.760 
actually I'm going to come in and drive
over<00:02:13.200> this<00:02:13.710> port<00:02:14.100> here<00:02:14.660> somebody<00:02:15.770> probably

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
over this port here somebody probably

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:37.640 
over this port here somebody probably
directed<00:02:17.670> for<00:02:17.850> just<00:02:18.090> one<00:02:18.210> right<00:02:18.360> here

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.979 

and<00:02:38.099> over<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.370> crosshairs<00:02:38.760> now<00:02:38.940> tell<00:02:39.690> me<00:02:39.780> what

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.350 

there<00:02:42.989> you<00:02:43.050> go<00:02:43.140> right<00:02:43.440> there

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
there you go right there

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.309 
there you go right there
how's<00:02:45.360> that<00:02:45.480> looking<00:02:45.780> tap<00:02:45.989> it<00:02:47.060> okay<00:02:48.060> okay<00:02:48.480> okay

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
how's that looking tap it okay okay okay

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.520 
how's that looking tap it okay okay okay
perfect<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:50.040> now<00:02:50.430> we<00:02:51.180> come<00:02:51.360> over<00:02:51.390> there<00:02:51.750> as<00:02:52.349> you

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
perfect so now we come over there as you

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.089 
perfect so now we come over there as you
can<00:02:52.590> see<00:02:53.360> you<00:02:54.360> know<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.480> think<00:02:54.660> that<00:02:55.099> they're

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
can see you know I think that they're

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.759 
can see you know I think that they're
smaller<00:02:56.459> thinner<00:02:56.819> arms<00:02:57.269> so<00:02:57.930> it<00:02:58.140> minimizes<00:02:58.319> the

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
smaller thinner arms so it minimizes the

00:02:58.769 --> 00:02:59.930 
smaller thinner arms so it minimizes the
abilities<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.459> don't<00:02:59.670> have<00:02:59.760> those

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
abilities that you don't have those

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.670 
abilities that you don't have those
collisions<00:03:00.269> you<00:03:00.510> have<00:03:00.750> see<00:03:00.989> colorectal

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
collisions you have see colorectal

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.830 
collisions you have see colorectal
procedure<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.790> know<00:03:02.849> and<00:03:03.180> have<00:03:03.330> it<00:03:03.450> refine

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
procedure you know and have it refine

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.130 
procedure you know and have it refine
the<00:03:03.989> docking<00:03:04.410> so<00:03:04.950> then<00:03:05.099> you<00:03:05.190> also<00:03:05.310> have<00:03:06.140> you

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
the docking so then you also have you

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.520 
the docking so then you also have you
have<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.410> ability<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:08.269> look<00:03:09.269> at<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.870> docking

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
have the ability to look at the docking

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.160 
have the ability to look at the docking
in<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.920> bottom<00:03:11.549> we<00:03:11.670> streamline<00:03:12.120> so<00:03:12.840> you<00:03:12.989> have

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
in the bottom we streamline so you have

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.699 
in the bottom we streamline so you have
here<00:03:13.640> it<00:03:14.640> is<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.819> more<00:03:15.090> fitting<00:03:15.510> for<00:03:15.540> this<00:03:15.900> so<00:03:16.680> I

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
here it is a more fitting for this so I

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.199 
here it is a more fitting for this so I
can<00:03:16.860> grab<00:03:17.099> your<00:03:17.340> call<00:03:17.579> to<00:03:17.670> grab<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:17.970> new

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
can grab your call to grab a new

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.809 
can grab your call to grab a new
function<00:03:18.690> that's<00:03:19.620> what<00:03:19.799> I<00:03:19.829> do<00:03:20.040> like<00:03:20.459> a<00:03:20.489> move<00:03:20.700> in

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
function that's what I do like a move in

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.030 
function that's what I do like a move in
here<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.329> I'm<00:03:22.049> going<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.230> dock<00:03:22.500> this<00:03:22.739> arm

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
here and I'm going to dock this arm

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.710 
here and I'm going to dock this arm
right<00:03:23.250> here<00:03:23.310> so<00:03:23.670> now<00:03:23.819> it<00:03:23.970> hold<00:03:24.209> it<00:03:24.360> just<00:03:24.510> like<00:03:24.629> a

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
right here so now it hold it just like a

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.190 
right here so now it hold it just like a
remote<00:03:24.989> later<00:03:25.230> traditionally<00:03:25.799> I<00:03:26.040> let<00:03:26.700> go<00:03:26.940> and

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
remote later traditionally I let go and

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.630 
remote later traditionally I let go and
then<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:28.230> hold<00:03:28.500> down<00:03:28.680> this<00:03:28.799> tab<00:03:29.069> and<00:03:29.250> I<00:03:29.310> just<00:03:29.519> the

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
then I hold down this tab and I just the

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.360 
then I hold down this tab and I just the
poor<00:03:29.879> flush<00:03:30.150> button<00:03:30.450> right<00:03:30.569> here<00:03:30.599> and<00:03:31.049> I<00:03:32.040> dock

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
poor flush button right here and I dock

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.520 
poor flush button right here and I dock
that<00:03:32.610> arm

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
that arm

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.500 
that arm
so<00:03:34.530> what's<00:03:34.769> it<00:03:34.920> thought<00:03:35.190> now<00:03:35.790> installed<00:03:36.360> and

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
so what's it thought now installed and

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.300 
so what's it thought now installed and
asked<00:03:37.200> me<00:03:37.349> to<00:03:37.410> install<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.860> endoscope<00:03:38.190> and

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
asked me to install the endoscope and

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.509 
asked me to install the endoscope and
now<00:03:38.430> this<00:03:38.549> endoscope<00:03:39.410> basically<00:03:40.410> is<00:03:40.590> like<00:03:41.340> we

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
now this endoscope basically is like we

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.220 
now this endoscope basically is like we
said<00:03:41.700> it's<00:03:41.819> a<00:03:41.940> form<00:03:42.180> factor<00:03:42.359> the<00:03:42.569> same<00:03:42.900> as<00:03:43.109> all

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
said it's a form factor the same as all

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.590 
said it's a form factor the same as all
the<00:03:43.380> other<00:03:43.500> all<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.130> other<00:03:44.160> courts<00:03:44.579> so<00:03:45.209> we

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
the other all the other courts so we

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.930 
the other all the other courts so we
could<00:03:45.720> put<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:45.989> into<00:03:46.170> any<00:03:46.290> any<00:03:46.709> any<00:03:47.100> port<00:03:47.430> so

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
could put it into any any any port so

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.539 
could put it into any any any port so
now<00:03:48.060> what<00:03:48.209> I<00:03:48.239> do<00:03:48.329> is<00:03:48.540> I<00:03:49.040> insert<00:03:50.040> it<00:03:50.190> in<00:03:52.400> 2050<00:03:53.400> up

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
now what I do is I insert it in 2050 up

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.550 
now what I do is I insert it in 2050 up
at<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.790> target<00:03:54.120> Anatomy<00:03:54.599> and<00:03:54.959> press<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:55.380> hold

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
at the target Anatomy and press and hold

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.800 
at the target Anatomy and press and hold
the<00:03:55.739> targeting<00:03:56.160> button<00:03:56.459> so<00:03:57.090> now<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.239> corny

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
the targeting button so now a corny

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.229 
the targeting button so now a corny
let's<00:03:58.049> say<00:03:58.170> this<00:03:58.349> pod<00:03:58.620> down<00:03:58.950> here<00:03:59.250> is<00:04:00.030> the

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
let's say this pod down here is the

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.059 
let's say this pod down here is the
target<00:04:01.700> so<00:04:02.700> if<00:04:02.790> I<00:04:02.880> find<00:04:03.180> that<00:04:03.299> target<00:04:03.750> I<00:04:04.069> have

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
target so if I find that target I have

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.500 
target so if I find that target I have
it<00:04:05.220> there<00:04:05.370> then<00:04:05.549> what<00:04:05.670> I<00:04:05.700> do<00:04:05.790> is<00:04:05.880> I<00:04:06.030> stabilize

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
it there then what I do is I stabilize

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.300 
it there then what I do is I stabilize
the<00:04:06.660> cannula

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.360 

and<00:04:10.310> I<00:04:10.340> press<00:04:10.549> this<00:04:10.640> button<00:04:10.700> on<00:04:11.769> my<00:04:12.769> scope<00:04:13.040> and

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
and I press this button on my scope and

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.860 
and I press this button on my scope and
it's<00:04:13.790> going<00:04:13.909> to<00:04:13.969> move<00:04:14.090> the<00:04:14.269> arms<00:04:14.569> so<00:04:14.719> they're

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
it's going to move the arms so they're

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.620 
it's going to move the arms so they're
perfectly<00:04:15.319> placed<00:04:15.680> to<00:04:16.039> to<00:04:16.699> God<00:04:16.910> I<00:04:17.239> can

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
perfectly placed to to God I can

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.900 
perfectly placed to to God I can
complete<00:04:18.079> connect<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:18.919> rest<00:04:19.070> of<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.400> arms<00:04:19.759> so

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
complete connect the rest of the arms so

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.180 
complete connect the rest of the arms so
now<00:04:20.060> I<00:04:20.090> do<00:04:20.239> just<00:04:20.630> like<00:04:20.750> grab<00:04:21.350> here<00:04:21.650> grab<00:04:21.979> and

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
now I do just like grab here grab and

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.540 
now I do just like grab here grab and
move<00:04:22.360> calm<00:04:23.360> down<00:04:24.880> and<00:04:25.880> dock<00:04:27.220> make<00:04:28.220> sure<00:04:28.400> that

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
move calm down and dock make sure that

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.790 
move calm down and dock make sure that
just<00:04:28.910> like<00:04:29.120> any<00:04:29.360> traditional<00:04:30.050> robotics<00:04:30.590> we're

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
just like any traditional robotics we're

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.800 
just like any traditional robotics we're
going<00:04:30.919> to<00:04:30.979> make<00:04:31.220> sure<00:04:31.340> we're<00:04:31.550> in<00:04:31.639> it<00:04:31.820> we're<00:04:32.780> in

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
going to make sure we're in it we're in

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.320 
going to make sure we're in it we're in
the<00:04:32.990> remote<00:04:33.229> center<00:04:33.560> there<00:04:33.910> lock<00:04:34.910> this<00:04:35.090> arm

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
the remote center there lock this arm

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.689 
the remote center there lock this arm
grab<00:04:35.660> and<00:04:35.870> move<00:04:35.900> as<00:04:36.800> you<00:04:36.979> can<00:04:37.099> see<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.340> docking

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
grab and move as you can see the docking

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:42.400 
grab and move as you can see the docking
can<00:04:37.880> be<00:04:38.530> extremely<00:04:39.530> efficient<00:04:41.259> make<00:04:42.259> sure

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
can be extremely efficient make sure

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:54.730 
can be extremely efficient make sure
that<00:04:42.560> I<00:04:42.620> dock<00:04:42.800> this<00:04:43.009> one

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.070 

so<00:04:55.740> now<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:55.920> instruments<00:04:56.550> are<00:04:56.670> actually<00:04:57.080> the

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
so now the instruments are actually the

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.110 
so now the instruments are actually the
housing<00:04:58.530> is<00:04:58.650> going<00:04:58.680> to<00:04:58.860> be<00:04:58.920> thinner<00:04:59.220> and<00:04:59.490> it's

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
housing is going to be thinner and it's

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.330 
housing is going to be thinner and it's
also<00:05:00.300> 2<00:05:00.480> inches<00:05:00.990> longer<00:05:01.290> so<00:05:02.100> you<00:05:02.160> have

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
also 2 inches longer so you have

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.890 
also 2 inches longer so you have
actually<00:05:02.580> more<00:05:03.120> reach<00:05:03.360> than<00:05:03.390> you've<00:05:03.690> ever<00:05:03.750> had

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
actually more reach than you've ever had

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.970 
actually more reach than you've ever had
before<00:05:04.020> and<00:05:05.780> the<00:05:06.780> the<00:05:07.350> scope<00:05:07.650> and<00:05:07.890> the

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
before and the the scope and the

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.230 
before and the the scope and the
instruments<00:05:08.310> of<00:05:08.340> yester<00:05:08.640> they're<00:05:08.910> all<00:05:09.030> 2

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
instruments of yester they're all 2

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.150 
instruments of yester they're all 2
inches<00:05:09.480> longer<00:05:09.690> yep<00:05:10.290> so<00:05:10.800> you<00:05:10.830> have<00:05:10.950> a<00:05:10.980> longer

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
inches longer yep so you have a longer

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.030 
inches longer yep so you have a longer
scope<00:05:13.460> 2<00:05:14.460> inches<00:05:14.700> longer<00:05:14.910> than<00:05:15.030> the<00:05:15.150> in<00:05:15.510> the<00:05:15.720> 8

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
scope 2 inches longer than the in the 8

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:26.120 
scope 2 inches longer than the in the 8
they'd<00:05:17.040> have<00:05:17.340> a<00:05:18.240> scrub<00:05:24.680> so<00:05:25.680> then<00:05:25.800> I<00:05:25.860> went<00:05:25.950> for

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
they'd have a scrub so then I went for

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.950 
they'd have a scrub so then I went for
these<00:05:26.250> instrument<00:05:26.669> centers<00:05:27.030> and<00:05:27.390> then<00:05:27.870> I'll

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
these instrument centers and then I'll

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.810 
these instrument centers and then I'll
go<00:05:28.080> through<00:05:28.410> another<00:05:28.950> function<00:05:29.430> that<00:05:29.490> will<00:05:29.700> go

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
go through another function that will go

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:46.520 
go through another function that will go
to<00:05:29.880> console<00:05:44.720> now<00:05:45.720> for<00:05:46.020> those<00:05:46.140> of<00:05:46.200> you<00:05:46.410> that

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
to console now for those of you that

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.440 
to console now for those of you that
currently<00:05:46.919> do<00:05:47.070> robotics<00:05:47.430> we<00:05:48.180> talked<00:05:48.330> about

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
currently do robotics we talked about

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.430 
currently do robotics we talked about
driving<00:05:48.900> in<00:05:49.169> the<00:05:50.419> patient<00:05:51.419> car<00:05:51.570> and<00:05:51.810> having

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
driving in the patient car and having

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.110 
driving in the patient car and having
potentially<00:05:53.190> not<00:05:53.370> being<00:05:53.580> able<00:05:53.669> to<00:05:53.790> clear<00:05:54.000> the

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
potentially not being able to clear the

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.270 
potentially not being able to clear the
patient<00:05:54.540> with<00:05:55.380> the<00:05:55.500> arms<00:05:55.770> being<00:05:55.980> in<00:05:56.070> the<00:05:56.130> way

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
patient with the arms being in the way

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.950 
patient with the arms being in the way
so<00:05:56.850> it's<00:05:56.880> a<00:05:57.000> call<00:05:57.150> that<00:05:57.300> was<00:05:57.419> application

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
so it's a call that was application

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.310 
so it's a call that was application
clearance<00:05:58.320> button<00:05:58.620> here<00:05:58.800> which<00:05:59.550> enables<00:06:00.320> you

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
clearance button here which enables you

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.350 
clearance button here which enables you
to<00:06:01.350> actually<00:06:01.770> not<00:06:01.919> just<00:06:02.220> the<00:06:02.340> arms<00:06:02.669> to<00:06:03.210> move

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
to actually not just the arms to move

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.810 
to actually not just the arms to move
out<00:06:03.600> of<00:06:03.630> the<00:06:03.780> way<00:06:03.810> a<00:06:03.930> patient<00:06:04.500> you<00:06:05.310> also<00:06:05.490> have

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
out of the way a patient you also have

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.530 
out of the way a patient you also have
the<00:06:06.000> opposite<00:06:06.479> of<00:06:06.510> that<00:06:06.690> which<00:06:07.380> is<00:06:08.180> the<00:06:09.180> robot

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
the opposite of that which is the robot

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.279 
the opposite of that which is the robot
traditionally<00:06:10.350> had<00:06:10.500> worked<00:06:11.100> well<00:06:11.400> away<00:06:11.850> from

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:12.289 
traditionally had worked well away from

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.859 
traditionally had worked well away from
he'll<00:06:12.409> now<00:06:13.309> with<00:06:13.550> this<00:06:13.729> does<00:06:13.999> when<00:06:14.300> we<00:06:14.479> make

00:06:14.859 --> 00:06:14.869 
he'll now with this does when we make

00:06:14.869 --> 00:06:17.589 
he'll now with this does when we make
that<00:06:15.020> adjustment<00:06:15.110> it<00:06:15.889> allows<00:06:16.210> the<00:06:17.210> robot<00:06:17.419> to

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 
that adjustment it allows the robot to

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:20.709 
that adjustment it allows the robot to
actually<00:06:17.839> work<00:06:18.289> away<00:06:19.189> from<00:06:19.219> itself<00:06:19.759> this<00:06:20.449> way

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:20.719 
actually work away from itself this way

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:23.320 
actually work away from itself this way
like<00:06:21.349> it<00:06:21.499> like<00:06:21.770> it<00:06:21.800> never<00:06:22.009> has<00:06:22.249> before<00:06:22.399> so<00:06:23.270> it

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
like it like it never has before so it

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.119 
like it like it never has before so it
allows<00:06:23.569> for<00:06:23.599> prophecy<00:06:24.379> for<00:06:24.589> more<00:06:24.770> access

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:25.129 
allows for prophecy for more access

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:28.389 
allows for prophecy for more access
within<00:06:25.309> the<00:06:25.430> patient<00:06:26.559> so<00:06:27.559> now<00:06:27.710> we'll<00:06:28.219> do<00:06:28.369> a

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:28.399 
within the patient so now we'll do a

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:29.920 
within the patient so now we'll do a
demonstration<00:06:28.849> watch<00:06:29.300> and<00:06:29.479> have<00:06:29.569> dr.<00:06:29.719> Maas

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
demonstration watch and have dr. Maas

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.619 
demonstration watch and have dr. Maas
Park<00:06:30.169> are<00:06:30.259> on<00:06:30.349> there<00:06:30.559> we'll<00:06:31.039> have<00:06:31.509> you'll<00:06:32.509> be

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:32.629 
Park are on there we'll have you'll be

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:34.359 
Park are on there we'll have you'll be
able<00:06:32.689> to<00:06:32.869> go<00:06:32.990> to<00:06:33.050> multiple<00:06:33.770> projects<00:06:34.189> within

00:06:34.359 --> 00:06:34.369 
able to go to multiple projects within

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:36.999 
able to go to multiple projects within
patient<00:06:34.789> on<00:06:35.059> a<00:06:35.089> single<00:06:35.509> doc<00:06:35.689> now<00:06:36.259> obviously<00:06:36.680> we

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:37.009 
patient on a single doc now obviously we

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:38.950 
patient on a single doc now obviously we
also<00:06:37.159> see<00:06:37.430> that<00:06:37.520> the<00:06:37.669> ports<00:06:38.119> are<00:06:38.240> much<00:06:38.659> closer

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
also see that the ports are much closer

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.529 
also see that the ports are much closer
so<00:06:39.770> it's<00:06:40.249> a<00:06:40.339> more<00:06:40.550> forgiving<00:06:40.939> port<00:06:41.180> placement

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:41.539 
so it's a more forgiving port placement

00:06:41.539 --> 00:07:18.410 
so it's a more forgiving port placement
based<00:06:41.659> on<00:06:41.899> the<00:06:42.050> instructions<00:06:43.569> so<00:06:44.569> now

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:18.420 

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:23.400 

it's<00:07:19.420> just<00:07:19.630> that<00:07:19.780> they're<00:07:19.960> recording<00:07:22.410> us

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:23.410 
it's just that they're recording us

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.770 
it's just that they're recording us
because<00:07:23.890> you<00:07:24.820> still<00:07:25.060> need<00:07:25.210> a<00:07:25.300> nurse<00:07:25.480> to<00:07:25.510> go

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:25.780 
because you still need a nurse to go

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:33.210 
because you still need a nurse to go
turning<00:07:26.170> on<00:07:29.430> me<00:07:30.430> native<00:07:30.850> yeah
