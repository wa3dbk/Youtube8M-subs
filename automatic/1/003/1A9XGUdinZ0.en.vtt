twist down all the way down and twist
the<00:01:49.870> floral<00:01:50.230> tape<00:01:50.470> then<00:01:50.890> you<00:01:50.920> can<00:01:51.130> rip<00:01:51.310> it<00:01:52.950> you

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
the floral tape then you can rip it you

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.650

have that nice finished bottom look
right<00:01:55.870> there<00:01:56.550> and<00:01:57.550> now<00:01:57.700> you<00:01:57.760> could<00:01:58.000> always<00:01:58.120> cut

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
right there and now you could always cut

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.570 
right there and now you could always cut
it<00:01:58.660> if<00:01:58.810> you<00:01:58.930> think<00:01:59.170> it's<00:01:59.290> too<00:01:59.560> too<00:02:00.280> big<00:02:02.580> so

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
it if you think it's too too big so

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.950 
it if you think it's too too big so
that's<00:02:03.640> a<00:02:03.790> little<00:02:03.910> too<00:02:04.150> long<00:02:04.330> so<00:02:04.390> I<00:02:04.570> just<00:02:04.720> cut

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
that's a little too long so I just cut

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.350 
that's a little too long so I just cut
it<00:02:05.050> down<00:02:05.200> and<00:02:05.770> then<00:02:06.490> if<00:02:06.700> you<00:02:06.820> want<00:02:07.030> to<00:02:07.090> get<00:02:07.240> this

it down and then if you want to get this

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.400 
it down and then if you want to get this
design<00:02:07.780> like<00:02:08.080> I<00:02:08.170> did<00:02:08.350> on<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.560> other<00:02:08.740> run<00:02:10.410> you
