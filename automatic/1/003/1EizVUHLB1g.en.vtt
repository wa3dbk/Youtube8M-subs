and tune your nursery needle for your
nitro<00:00:40.880> RC<00:00:41.150> vehicle<00:00:41.510> now<00:00:41.840> down<00:00:42.110> here<00:00:42.140> we<00:00:42.380> have

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
nitro RC vehicle now down here we have

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.730 
nitro RC vehicle now down here we have
the<00:00:43.120> nitrous<00:00:44.120> tech<00:00:44.240> but<00:00:44.420> also<00:00:44.660> using<00:00:44.990> SH<00:00:45.380> 18

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:45.740 
the nitrous tech but also using SH 18

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.860 
the nitrous tech but also using SH 18
engine<00:00:46.070> and<00:00:46.280> first<00:00:46.940> thing<00:00:47.180> I'm<00:00:47.420> going<00:00:47.630> to<00:00:47.750> be

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
engine and first thing I'm going to be

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.470 
engine and first thing I'm going to be
looking<00:00:48.380> at<00:00:48.560> is<00:00:48.770> how<00:00:49.040> to<00:00:49.610> properly<00:00:49.970> tune<00:00:50.330> the

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
looking at is how to properly tune the

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.270 
looking at is how to properly tune the
most<00:00:50.660> weak<00:00:50.870> needle<00:00:51.230> so<00:00:51.440> I'm<00:00:51.770> going<00:00:51.980> to<00:00:52.040> start

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
most weak needle so I'm going to start

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.520 
most weak needle so I'm going to start
on<00:00:52.489> the<00:00:52.580> engine<00:00:52.910> and<00:00:53.060> this<00:00:53.360> setting<00:00:53.690> is<00:00:54.110> how<00:00:54.500> a

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
on the engine and this setting is how a

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.090 
on the engine and this setting is how a
properly<00:00:55.220> tuned<00:00:55.840> nitro<00:00:56.840> engine<00:00:57.260> should<00:00:57.890> be

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
properly tuned nitro engine should be

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:23.960 
properly tuned nitro engine should be
like<00:00:58.309> this<00:00:58.730> is<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:59.030> properly<00:00:59.450> tuned<00:00:59.720> okay

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.530 

okay<00:01:24.970> then<00:01:25.150> so<00:01:25.390> that<00:01:25.840> was<00:01:26.110> how<00:01:26.350> a<00:01:26.590> properly<00:01:27.190> to

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
okay then so that was how a properly to

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.330 
okay then so that was how a properly to
Alison<00:01:28.540> or<00:01:28.870> nursery<00:01:29.080> needle<00:01:29.680> should<00:01:30.010> sound

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
Alison or nursery needle should sound

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.300 
Alison or nursery needle should sound
you<00:01:31.000> can<00:01:31.180> see<00:01:31.360> that<00:01:31.600> I<00:01:31.840> pitched<00:01:32.440> the<00:01:32.830> fuel<00:01:33.100> line

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
you can see that I pitched the fuel line

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.610 
you can see that I pitched the fuel line
and<00:01:33.610> that<00:01:34.180> is<00:01:34.330> one<00:01:34.540> way<00:01:34.720> if<00:01:34.780> you<00:01:35.050> pinch<00:01:35.350> the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
and that is one way if you pinch the

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.440 
and that is one way if you pinch the
fuel<00:01:35.920> line<00:01:36.100> that<00:01:36.640> is<00:01:36.790> the<00:01:36.910> best<00:01:37.180> way<00:01:37.420> to

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
fuel line that is the best way to

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.650 
fuel line that is the best way to
determine<00:01:38.020> how<00:01:38.920> well<00:01:39.520> set<00:01:39.970> from<00:01:40.360> low<00:01:40.600> speed

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
determine how well set from low speed

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.920 
determine how well set from low speed
needle<00:01:41.380> is<00:01:41.790> ideally<00:01:42.790> the<00:01:42.940> engine<00:01:43.390> should<00:01:43.630> take

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
needle is ideally the engine should take

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.760 
needle is ideally the engine should take
around<00:01:44.530> three<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:45.640> five<00:01:45.910> six<00:01:46.480> seven<00:01:46.840> edge<00:01:47.140> to

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
around three to five six seven edge to

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.460 
around three to five six seven edge to
quit<00:01:48.040> after<00:01:48.520> you<00:01:49.480> have<00:01:49.630> actually<00:01:50.050> pinched

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
quit after you have actually pinched

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.400 
quit after you have actually pinched
your<00:01:50.770> fuel<00:01:51.130> line<00:01:51.160> so<00:01:52.060> if<00:01:52.360> it<00:01:52.510> takes<00:01:52.750> ages<00:01:53.080> to

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
your fuel line so if it takes ages to

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.310 
your fuel line so if it takes ages to
quit<00:01:53.740> it<00:01:54.010> means<00:01:54.280> your<00:01:54.790> nozbe<00:01:55.270> needle<00:01:55.660> is<00:01:56.020> too

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
quit it means your nozbe needle is too

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.540 
quit it means your nozbe needle is too
rich<00:01:57.280> if<00:01:57.880> it<00:01:58.090> takes<00:01:58.360> just<00:01:59.260> hardly<00:02:00.040> any<00:02:00.280> time

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
rich if it takes just hardly any time

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.400 
rich if it takes just hardly any time
after<00:02:00.820> you<00:02:01.119> pinch<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.600> fuel<00:02:01.869> line<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:02.260> it

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
after you pinch the fuel line and it

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.690 
after you pinch the fuel line and it
just<00:02:02.650> cuts<00:02:03.100> out<00:02:03.250> almost<00:02:04.979> immediately<00:02:05.979> that

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
just cuts out almost immediately that

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.840 
just cuts out almost immediately that
means<00:02:06.970> that<00:02:07.330> it<00:02:07.570> is<00:02:07.600> running<00:02:08.080> too<00:02:08.440> lean<00:02:08.800> so<00:02:09.520> the

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
means that it is running too lean so the

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.130 
means that it is running too lean so the
way<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.030> adjust<00:02:10.540> this<00:02:10.720> is<00:02:12.810> remember<00:02:13.810> your<00:02:13.930> nose

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
way to adjust this is remember your nose

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.190 
way to adjust this is remember your nose
be<00:02:14.410> needle<00:02:14.830> is<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.370> one<00:02:15.550> is<00:02:16.120> in<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.660> middle<00:02:16.990> of

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
be needle is the one is in the middle of

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.699 
be needle is the one is in the middle of

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
very very rich low speed needle setting

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.860 
very very rich low speed needle setting
okay

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.860

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
okay so you saw there the dosqueen

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.090 
okay so you saw there the dosqueen
needle<00:03:07.000> is<00:03:07.150> very<00:03:07.450> rich<00:03:07.870> because<00:03:08.080> it<00:03:08.560> started

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
needle is very rich because it started

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.300 
needle is very rich because it started
on<00:03:09.190> on<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.490> high<00:03:09.820> RPM<00:03:10.420> then<00:03:11.020> the<00:03:11.350> RPM<00:03:11.830> would<00:03:12.010> very

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
on on a high RPM then the RPM would very

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.790 
on on a high RPM then the RPM would very
very<00:03:12.400> no<00:03:12.820> over<00:03:13.240> small<00:03:13.510> round<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.260> then<00:03:14.560> it

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
very no over small round and then it

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.930 
very no over small round and then it
actually<00:03:15.340> quit

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
actually quit

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.820 
actually quit
let<00:03:16.240> me<00:03:16.330> written<00:03:16.690> it<00:03:16.780> a<00:03:16.930> bit<00:03:17.170> more<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:20.380> we<00:03:20.680> will

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
let me written it a bit more and we will

see okay so you saw there if you have a
look<00:03:29.350> down<00:03:29.500> here<00:03:29.560> you<00:03:30.490> saw<00:03:30.730> there<00:03:30.970> as<00:03:31.360> soon<00:03:31.600> as

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
look down here you saw there as soon as

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.080 
look down here you saw there as soon as
I<00:03:31.810> release<00:03:31.990> the<00:03:32.320> igniter<00:03:32.740> the<00:03:33.130> engine<00:03:33.460> quits

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:48.840 

you<00:03:37.090> see<00:03:46.350> okay<00:03:47.350> so<00:03:47.410> all<00:03:47.800> of<00:03:48.040> that<00:03:48.220> is<00:03:48.460> actually

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
you see okay so all of that is actually

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.680 
you see okay so all of that is actually
signs<00:03:49.420> of<00:03:49.840> your<00:03:50.500> low<00:03:50.980> speed<00:03:51.370> needle<00:03:51.820> being<00:03:52.180> far

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
signs of your low speed needle being far

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:53.490 
signs of your low speed needle being far
too<00:03:52.720> rich

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
too rich

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.770 
too rich
the<00:03:53.770> signs<00:03:54.070> are<00:03:54.400> when<00:03:55.090> you<00:03:55.240> remove<00:03:55.630> the

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
the signs are when you remove the

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.160 
the signs are when you remove the
igniter<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.710> engine<00:03:57.130> quits<00:03:57.490> or<00:03:57.820> you<00:03:58.780> have<00:03:59.020> to

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
igniter the engine quits or you have to

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.610 
igniter the engine quits or you have to
have<00:03:59.350> quite<00:03:59.770> high<00:04:00.310> throttle<00:04:01.180> apply<00:04:01.630> in<00:04:02.080> order

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
have quite high throttle apply in order

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.830 
have quite high throttle apply in order
for<00:04:02.740> the<00:04:02.830> engine<00:04:03.160> to<00:04:03.340> start<00:04:03.610> you<00:04:04.150> can<00:04:04.330> see<00:04:04.540> just

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
for the engine to start you can see just

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.190 
for the engine to start you can see just
on<00:04:05.050> the<00:04:05.170> standard<00:04:05.890> idle<00:04:06.610> gap<00:04:06.880> it<00:04:07.270> just<00:04:07.960> pokes

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
on the standard idle gap it just pokes

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:17.880 
on the standard idle gap it just pokes
up<00:04:08.530> there's<00:04:09.040> so<00:04:09.310> much<00:04:09.430> fuel<00:04:09.700> in<00:04:09.940> there<00:04:16.739> but<00:04:17.739> so

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
up there's so much fuel in there but so

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.670 
up there's so much fuel in there but so
you<00:04:18.010> see<00:04:18.250> now<00:04:18.580> where<00:04:19.090> it<00:04:19.210> is<00:04:19.299> very<00:04:19.660> very<00:04:19.989> rich

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
you see now where it is very very rich

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.470 
you see now where it is very very rich
now<00:04:21.250> once<00:04:21.610> again<00:04:21.760> let<00:04:22.060> me<00:04:22.090> show<00:04:22.180> you<00:04:22.390> the

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
now once again let me show you the

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.730 
now once again let me show you the
correct<00:04:22.810> setting<00:04:23.200> remember<00:04:23.530> once<00:04:23.680> you

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
correct setting remember once you

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.620 
correct setting remember once you
picture<00:04:24.190> for<00:04:24.310> your<00:04:24.400> line<00:04:24.580> it<00:04:25.180> should<00:04:25.390> take

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
picture for your line it should take

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:43.689 
picture for your line it should take
about<00:04:25.810> three<00:04:26.260> to<00:04:27.100> six<00:04:27.340> seconds<00:04:27.940> to<00:04:28.090> quit

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.909 

okay<00:04:44.699> so<00:04:44.970> that<00:04:45.120> was<00:04:45.240> six<00:04:45.509> seconds<00:04:46.229> or<00:04:46.380> five<00:04:46.680> or

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
okay so that was six seconds or five or

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.400 
okay so that was six seconds or five or
six<00:04:47.190> so<00:04:47.850> that<00:04:48.210> is<00:04:48.330> the<00:04:48.419> proper<00:04:48.660> setting<00:04:49.050> now

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
six so that is the proper setting now

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.370 
six so that is the proper setting now
I'm<00:04:49.620> going<00:04:49.919> to<00:04:50.040> do<00:04:50.190> is<00:04:50.490> lean<00:04:51.210> out<00:04:51.660> the

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
I'm going to do is lean out the

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.439 
I'm going to do is lean out the
low-speed<00:04:52.800> need<00:04:53.039> the<00:04:53.220> revenue<00:04:53.430> is<00:04:54.090> the

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
low-speed need the revenue is the

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.430 
low-speed need the revenue is the
clockwise<00:04:55.080> terms<00:04:56.660> okay<00:04:57.660> so<00:04:57.990> I'm<00:04:58.050> just<00:04:58.110> needing

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
clockwise terms okay so I'm just needing

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.620 
clockwise terms okay so I'm just needing
it<00:04:58.740> now

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.140 

you'll<00:05:05.630> notice<00:05:05.870> the<00:05:06.500> idol<00:05:07.190> goes<00:05:07.490> very<00:05:07.910> very

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
you'll notice the idol goes very very

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:22.240 
you'll notice the idol goes very very
high

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.430 

okay<00:05:23.250> so<00:05:23.640> that<00:05:23.790> is<00:05:23.970> a<00:05:24.000> mean<00:05:24.330> setting<00:05:24.750> because

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
okay so that is a mean setting because

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.770 
okay so that is a mean setting because
you<00:05:25.590> saw<00:05:25.890> the<00:05:26.250> wheels<00:05:26.790> were<00:05:27.060> spinning<00:05:27.210> the

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
you saw the wheels were spinning the

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.590 
you saw the wheels were spinning the
idle<00:05:28.230> was<00:05:28.500> very<00:05:28.890> very<00:05:29.100> high<00:05:29.370> that<00:05:30.060> shows<00:05:30.390> that

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
idle was very very high that shows that

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.170 
idle was very very high that shows that
it<00:05:30.750> is<00:05:30.780> very<00:05:31.590> lean<00:05:32.040> let<00:05:32.520> me<00:05:32.640> show<00:05:32.850> you<00:05:32.910> once

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
it is very lean let me show you once

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:52.020 
it is very lean let me show you once
again

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.540 

that<00:05:53.030> was<00:05:53.210> just<00:05:53.510> two<00:05:53.900> seconds<00:05:54.410> once<00:05:55.100> I<00:05:55.280> pitched

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
that was just two seconds once I pitched

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.570 
that was just two seconds once I pitched
the<00:05:55.730> fuel<00:05:55.970> line<00:05:56.120> that<00:05:56.540> shows<00:05:56.750> you<00:05:56.810> that<00:05:57.580> your

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
the fuel line that shows you that your

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.820 
the fuel line that shows you that your
low-end<00:05:58.910> is<00:05:59.030> very<00:05:59.480> very<00:05:59.750> lean<00:06:00.020> those<00:06:00.500> things

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
low-end is very very lean those things

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.530 
low-end is very very lean those things
restore<00:06:01.190> the<00:06:01.280> engine<00:06:01.610> does<00:06:02.030> not<00:06:02.180> have<00:06:02.330> enough

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 
restore the engine does not have enough

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.020 
restore the engine does not have enough
fuel<00:06:02.750> to<00:06:02.810> lubricate<00:06:03.290> properly<00:06:03.770> so<00:06:04.400> you've

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.030 
fuel to lubricate properly so you've

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.540 
fuel to lubricate properly so you've
seen<00:06:05.360> the<00:06:05.720> concepts<00:06:06.230> of<00:06:06.500> having<00:06:06.890> a<00:06:07.010> tube<00:06:07.310> rich

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
seen the concepts of having a tube rich

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.600 
seen the concepts of having a tube rich
I<00:06:07.820> mostly<00:06:08.780> mean<00:06:09.020> setting<00:06:09.350> and<00:06:09.650> also<00:06:09.860> a<00:06:10.040> to<00:06:10.340> lean

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
I mostly mean setting and also a to lean

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.480 
I mostly mean setting and also a to lean
idle<00:06:11.060> speed<00:06:11.300> setting<00:06:11.720> so<00:06:12.320> the<00:06:12.530> way<00:06:12.650> to<00:06:12.710> do<00:06:13.340> that

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
idle speed setting so the way to do that

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.940 
idle speed setting so the way to do that
once<00:06:13.790> again<00:06:14.120> is<00:06:14.360> to<00:06:14.690> simply<00:06:15.110> pinch<00:06:15.410> the<00:06:15.680> fuel

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
once again is to simply pinch the fuel

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.450 
once again is to simply pinch the fuel
line<00:06:16.190> if<00:06:16.730> you<00:06:16.940> are<00:06:16.970> having<00:06:17.210> troubles<00:06:17.750> and

having troubles with your low-speed
movers<00:06:20.870> tuning<00:06:21.320> then<00:06:21.830> pinch<00:06:22.250> the<00:06:22.460> fuel<00:06:22.700> line

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
movers tuning then pinch the fuel line

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.960 
movers tuning then pinch the fuel line
see<00:06:23.480> how<00:06:23.690> long<00:06:24.020> it<00:06:24.440> takes<00:06:24.740> to<00:06:24.860> quit<00:06:25.190> if<00:06:25.820> it

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:25.970 
see how long it takes to quit if it

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.630
