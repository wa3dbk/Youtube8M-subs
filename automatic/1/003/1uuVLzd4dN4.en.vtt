it's<00:00:42.590> gonna<00:00:42.680> play<00:00:42.860> out<00:00:42.950> I<00:00:43.160> don't<00:00:43.370> know<00:00:43.550> I<00:00:43.579> can't

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.370 
it's gonna play out I don't know I can't
obviously<00:00:44.000> good<00:00:44.300> to<00:00:44.660> tell<00:00:44.840> this<00:00:45.020> stuff<00:00:45.200> but

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.380 
obviously good to tell this stuff but

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.410 
obviously good to tell this stuff but
even<00:00:46.070> play<00:00:46.250> out<00:00:46.370> in<00:00:46.489> a<00:00:46.520> beautiful<00:00:46.940> way<00:00:47.030> I<00:00:47.060> think

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
even play out in a beautiful way I think

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.270 
even play out in a beautiful way I think
you'd<00:00:47.630> be<00:00:47.780> right<00:00:47.960> it<00:00:48.020> was<00:00:48.110> just<00:00:48.260> kind<00:00:49.100> of<00:00:49.130> in

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
you'd be right it was just kind of in

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.590 
you'd be right it was just kind of in
the<00:00:49.370> way<00:00:49.850> that<00:00:49.970> they<00:00:50.060> want

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
the way that they want

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.079 
the way that they want
so<00:00:52.390> there<00:00:53.390> is<00:00:53.480> a<00:00:53.510> lot<00:00:53.780> of<00:00:54.670> devastation<00:00:55.670> that's

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
so there is a lot of devastation that's

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.840 
so there is a lot of devastation that's
