00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hello, let's show today that 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.890
 make more precise how to get the paper out 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.700
 hewlett packard laserjet pro printer 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.570
 400 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.379
 series 400 of how the jam occurred either 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:21.590
 and healed at us sticking a sheet she our 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.590
 our display appears such inscriptions 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.429
 jams in balta cartridges in the area to 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.170
 open the lid remove the jam 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:35.640
 notice in the area I ride everything in a circle 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.530
 spinning these two messages lit flashing 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.559
 Light-emitting diode ! 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:46.340
 i.e. what the printer does 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:53.329
 de-energize it is not possible to de-energize it already 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:57.090
 at your personal request i'm here it is 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:01.469
 de-energized disconnect power now so that 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.949
 pull out the paper close the lid get 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.949
 cartridge 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:11.390
 our cracked to be something broke 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.390
 now let's try 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.550
 pull the sheet out that is here 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:25.230
 neatly take over the edges and 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:27.690
 neatly drag it principle sheet all 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.550
 we have no problems left the main thing is not 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:37.800
 pull no effort any 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:40.500
 superfluous to break nothing so here 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:46.800
 there is still such a kitty something not 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:49.620
 drawn when something with a stove need 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:57.150
 this cap is also understandable why are you so 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:59.360
 do well in general principle 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.130
 clear that is the main thing 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.530
 disconnect the stove is better to get cute stu 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.590
 away on maybe hotter put away 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.929
 a cartridge so that it is still somewhere not 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.979
 we press held the paper and pull it out 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.970
 either above 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:19.940
 or if your paper has healed 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.940
 Initially, you can do something 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:38.040
 pull out the tray to drag notches to remove it 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:41.130
 let's put the printer on its side if 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.870
 the paper is not completely gone capture 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.940
 us in the machine and it can be pulled out 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.920
 father's point is the juicer of paper from here 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.440
 hang around you can try to pull out 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.910
 from here but the main thing is to have an Internet strongly 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.040
 because if somewhere a paper hurt 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.170
 she can go one way to another 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.959
 the side does not go let's not go below 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.580
 then try to hide this cap and 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:07.560
 somewhere here already catching her and pulling 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.900
 the main effort the movie is a big effort not 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.390
 We are applying not to tear off this paper 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.820
 do not tear it if you tear the paper and 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.980
 some piece of paper 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.560
 will remain 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.810
 inside the device it is possible to block 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.170
 one of the sensors needed to work and 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.840
 the printer will always swear 18th century 3g 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.050
 on the lack of paper either already be 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.120
 talk about paper jam empty as we 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:36.959
 some of the sheets pulled out such 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.790
 there are cases and even happened to 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:43.310
 eliminate such an occupation had 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:46.220
 disassemble the entire apparatus here billov from 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.570
 20-30 minutes higher looking for problems 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.370
 all if the video turned out to be useful to you 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.910
 like a subscription to the channel to all 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.910
 good luck bye
