hey it's phase 2 online renovation of my
apartment<00:00:06.569> member<00:00:06.899> we're<00:00:07.170> going<00:00:07.440> from<00:00:08.280> white

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
apartment member we're going from white

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.150 
apartment member we're going from white
into<00:00:09.210> color<00:00:09.450> and<00:00:09.750> so<00:00:10.320> I<00:00:10.349> decided<00:00:10.830> not<00:00:10.980> only

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
into color and so I decided not only

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.799 
into color and so I decided not only
just<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.550> go<00:00:11.670> into<00:00:11.820> color<00:00:11.969> but<00:00:12.240> also<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.630> go

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
just to go into color but also to go

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.140 
just to go into color but also to go
into<00:00:13.019> size<00:00:13.230> so<00:00:13.679> instead<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.190> having<00:00:14.490> that

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
into size so instead of having that

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.990 
into size so instead of having that
little<00:00:15.480> desk<00:00:16.109> area<00:00:16.470> here<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.160> decided<00:00:17.789> with

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
little desk area here I decided with

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.820 
little desk area here I decided with
this<00:00:18.119> ginormous<00:00:18.480> blue<00:00:19.439> couch<00:00:20.689> chair<00:00:21.689> couch<00:00:21.960> so

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
this ginormous blue couch chair couch so

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.320 
this ginormous blue couch chair couch so
that<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.070> know<00:00:23.160> when<00:00:23.310> my<00:00:23.550> kids<00:00:23.820> are<00:00:23.970> here<00:00:24.180> and

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
that you know when my kids are here and

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.820 
that you know when my kids are here and
they're<00:00:24.420> hanging<00:00:24.570> out<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:25.109> can<00:00:25.289> actually<00:00:25.500> be

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
they're hanging out I can actually be

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.470 
they're hanging out I can actually be
here<00:00:26.130> we<00:00:26.369> can<00:00:26.519> actually<00:00:26.609> be<00:00:26.880> reading<00:00:27.180> together

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
here we can actually be reading together

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.359 
here we can actually be reading together
so<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.380> kitchen<00:00:28.560> becomes<00:00:28.949> more<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.310> a

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
so that the kitchen becomes more of a

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.800 
so that the kitchen becomes more of a
cozy<00:00:29.580> area<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.150> not<00:00:30.269> just<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.570> place<00:00:30.779> for

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
cooking but more of a place for really

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.729 
cooking but more of a place for really
really<00:00:33.059> hanging<00:00:33.480> out<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.630> mean<00:00:33.989> it's<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
really hanging out I mean it's the

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.160 
really hanging out I mean it's the
perfect<00:00:35.010> it's<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.399> core<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.630> house<00:00:36.809> and
