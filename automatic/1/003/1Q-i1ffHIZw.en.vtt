00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.020 
rotating while I broke that loose
it<00:01:44.189> was<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:46.280> of<00:01:47.280> course<00:01:47.549> there's<00:01:47.729> no<00:01:47.820> size

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
it was a of course there's no size

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.730 
it was a of course there's no size
stamped<00:01:48.390> on<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.630> wrench<00:01:48.840> Oh<00:01:49.110> fifteen

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
stamped on this wrench Oh fifteen

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.679 
stamped on this wrench Oh fifteen
sixteenths<00:01:50.159> okay<00:01:50.520> should<00:01:50.970> be<00:01:51.090> metric<00:01:51.479> but<00:01:51.659> I

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
sixteenths okay should be metric but I

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.310 
sixteenths okay should be metric but I
didn't<00:01:51.990> have<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.110> metric<00:01:52.439> in<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.710> size<00:01:54.320> this

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
didn't have a metric in that size this

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.539 
didn't have a metric in that size this
was<00:01:56.000> good<00:01:57.000> enough<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.509> do<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.750> job

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
was good enough to do the job

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.760 
was good enough to do the job
the<00:01:59.689> second<00:02:00.689> piece<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.140> need<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.350> break<00:02:01.530> loose

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
the second piece you need to break loose

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.980 
the second piece you need to break loose
is<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.610> bolt<00:02:02.939> on<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.149> end<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.570> tie<00:02:03.750> rod

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
is the bolt on the end of the tie rod

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.090 
is the bolt on the end of the tie rod
here<00:02:04.229> which<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.500> can<00:02:04.619> see<00:02:04.740> I've<00:02:04.860> already<00:02:04.979> done

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
here which you can see I've already done

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.190 
here which you can see I've already done
that<00:02:05.399> it's<00:02:05.579> still<00:02:05.759> kind<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:05.969> tight<00:02:06.149> on<00:02:06.299> there<00:02:06.479> I

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
that it's still kind of tight on there I

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.010 
that it's still kind of tight on there I
had<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.160> pick<00:02:08.340> up<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:09.379> give<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.500> size<00:02:10.800> here

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
had to pick up a give you the size here

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.950 
had to pick up a give you the size here
these<00:02:12.470> are<00:02:12.560> not<00:02:12.680> sizes<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:13.220> most<00:02:13.400> people

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
these are not sizes that most people

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.030 
these are not sizes that most people
typically<00:02:14.960> having<00:02:15.260> their<00:02:15.380> little<00:02:15.500> tool<00:02:15.740> box

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
typically having their little tool box

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.570 
typically having their little tool box
it<00:02:16.370> is<00:02:16.550> a<00:02:16.580> 21<00:02:17.420> millimeter<00:02:17.890> socket<00:02:18.890> the

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
it is a 21 millimeter socket the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.760 
it is a 21 millimeter socket the
replacement<00:02:20.330> part<00:02:20.600> is<00:02:20.870> actually<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.380> 22

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
replacement part is actually a 22

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.230 
replacement part is actually a 22
millimeter<00:02:22.220> so<00:02:22.760> I'm<00:02:22.880> glad<00:02:23.060> I<00:02:23.590> got<00:02:24.590> both<00:02:25.240> paid

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
millimeter so I'm glad I got both paid

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.150 
millimeter so I'm glad I got both paid
the<00:02:26.360> extra<00:02:26.780> dollar<00:02:27.380> for<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.770> deep<00:02:27.950> well

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
the extra dollar for the deep well

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.440 
the extra dollar for the deep well
sockets<00:02:28.640> in<00:02:28.760> case<00:02:28.910> I<00:02:28.940> had<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.090> beat<00:02:29.270> them<00:02:29.360> with

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
sockets in case I had to beat them with

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.780 
sockets in case I had to beat them with
a<00:02:29.480> hammer<00:02:29.690> or<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:30.200> impact<00:02:30.890> sockets<00:02:31.160> you<00:02:31.700> know

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
a hammer or the impact sockets you know

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.320 
a hammer or the impact sockets you know
what<00:02:31.910> I<00:02:31.940> mean<00:02:32.560> so<00:02:33.560> 21<00:02:34.340> millimeter<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.940> take<00:02:35.120> off

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
what I mean so 21 millimeter to take off

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.720 
what I mean so 21 millimeter to take off
the<00:02:35.900> existing<00:02:36.620> part<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:37.190> then<00:02:37.280> I<00:02:37.340> just<00:02:37.490> got<00:02:37.610> my

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
the existing part and then I just got my

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.850 
the existing part and then I just got my
big<00:02:37.880> breaker<00:02:38.150> bar<00:02:38.420> here<00:02:38.830> and<00:02:41.410> 22<00:02:42.410> millimeter

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
big breaker bar here and 22 millimeter

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.020 
big breaker bar here and 22 millimeter
to<00:02:43.010> put<00:02:43.160> on<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.370> new<00:02:43.490> part<00:02:43.730> I<00:02:43.790> think<00:02:43.880> I

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
to put on the new part I think I

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.090 
to put on the new part I think I
actually<00:02:44.150> this<00:02:44.840> box<00:02:45.110> here's<00:02:45.380> my<00:02:45.500> trash<00:02:45.830> I

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
actually this box here's my trash I

00:02:46.100 --> 00:03:11.950 
actually this box here's my trash I
think<00:02:46.280> I've<00:02:46.340> left<00:02:46.490> a<00:02:46.610> new<00:02:46.730> one

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.600 

so<00:03:14.120> placement<00:03:15.120> part<00:03:16.220> anybody<00:03:17.220> has<00:03:17.340> ever<00:03:17.460> done

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
so placement part anybody has ever done

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.860 
so placement part anybody has ever done
this<00:03:17.670> kind<00:03:17.820> of<00:03:18.000> work<00:03:18.060> before<00:03:18.480> it's<00:03:18.660> pretty

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
this kind of work before it's pretty

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.560 
this kind of work before it's pretty
intuitive<00:03:19.170> for<00:03:19.470> how<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.650> do<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:20.210> this<00:03:21.210> is<00:03:21.270> the

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
intuitive for how to do it this is the

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.360 
intuitive for how to do it this is the
replacement<00:03:21.900> part<00:03:22.440> I'm<00:03:22.890> not<00:03:22.920> going<00:03:23.070> to<00:03:23.220> show

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
replacement part I'm not going to show

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.590 
replacement part I'm not going to show
the<00:03:23.490> whole<00:03:23.610> process<00:03:23.760> here<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.180> think<00:03:24.360> get<00:03:24.480> the

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
the whole process here I think get the

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.640 
the whole process here I think get the
idea<00:03:24.810> from<00:03:24.960> this<00:03:25.080> video<00:03:27.590> so<00:03:28.590> all<00:03:29.070> you<00:03:29.280> do<00:03:29.430> is

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
idea from this video so all you do is

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.890 
idea from this video so all you do is
take<00:03:31.650> this<00:03:31.860> nut<00:03:32.190> off<00:03:32.370> once<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.300> have<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.660> off

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
take this nut off once you have that off

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.790 
take this nut off once you have that off
you're<00:03:34.530> probably<00:03:34.830> going<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.250> need<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.610> use<00:03:35.640> a

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
you're probably going to need to use a

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.530 
you're probably going to need to use a
puller<00:03:38.240> to<00:03:39.240> get<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.900> old<00:03:40.050> tie<00:03:40.260> rod<00:03:40.530> out<00:03:41.540> and

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
puller to get the old tie rod out and

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.210 
puller to get the old tie rod out and
what<00:03:42.720> you<00:03:42.840> do<00:03:42.990> is<00:03:43.200> you<00:03:45.260> put<00:03:46.260> it<00:03:46.350> hard<00:03:47.070> to<00:03:47.130> do

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
what you do is you put it hard to do

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.440 
what you do is you put it hard to do
with<00:03:47.340> only<00:03:47.490> one<00:03:47.550> hand<00:03:47.850> here<00:03:48.120> but<00:03:48.270> you<00:03:48.360> know

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
with only one hand here but you know

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.010 
with only one hand here but you know
basically<00:03:49.200> put<00:03:49.380> it<00:03:49.470> like<00:03:49.620> this<00:03:49.830> and<00:03:50.630> then<00:03:51.630> grab

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
basically put it like this and then grab

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.370 
basically put it like this and then grab
the<00:03:52.050> bottom<00:03:52.620> of<00:03:53.610> the<00:03:53.940> steering<00:03:54.900> knuckle<00:03:54.990> it's

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
the bottom of the steering knuckle it's

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.880 
the bottom of the steering knuckle it's
a<00:03:55.470> technical<00:03:55.950> term<00:03:56.040> for<00:03:56.100> this<00:03:57.380> you<00:03:58.380> just<00:03:58.590> put<00:03:58.860> a

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
a technical term for this you just put a

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.860 
a technical term for this you just put a
socket<00:03:59.670> wrench<00:03:59.820> on<00:04:00.090> here<00:04:00.240> and<00:04:00.330> crank<00:04:00.540> down<00:04:00.690> on

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
socket wrench on here and crank down on

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.600 
socket wrench on here and crank down on
this<00:04:00.960> until<00:04:01.170> it<00:04:01.290> pops<00:04:01.500> out<00:04:01.680> cuz<00:04:02.220> that<00:04:02.400> pieces

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
this until it pops out cuz that pieces

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.490 
this until it pops out cuz that pieces
in<00:04:02.880> there<00:04:03.000> tightens<00:04:03.450> easily<00:04:03.930> don't<00:04:04.260> have<00:04:04.350> any

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
in there tightens easily don't have any

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.140 
in there tightens easily don't have any
luck<00:04:04.680> beating<00:04:05.280> on<00:04:05.460> the<00:04:05.550> top<00:04:05.730> of<00:04:05.880> it<00:04:06.000> with<00:04:06.120> a

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
luck beating on the top of it with a

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.450 
luck beating on the top of it with a
hammer<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:06.510> push<00:04:06.720> it<00:04:06.870> out<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:08.190> one<00:04:08.340> other

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460
