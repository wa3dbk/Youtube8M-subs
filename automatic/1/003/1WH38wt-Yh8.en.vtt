mounts<00:05:25.120> so<00:05:25.210> you<00:05:25.300> get<00:05:25.479> a<00:05:25.660> lot<00:05:26.020> more<00:05:26.050> comfort

when you're running in rougher water
conditions<00:05:28.240> we<00:05:28.540> set<00:05:28.750> this<00:05:28.870> boat<00:05:29.080> up<00:05:29.110> so<00:05:29.380> that

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
conditions we set this boat up so that

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.260 
conditions we set this boat up so that
it<00:05:29.590> can<00:05:29.680> be<00:05:29.800> run<00:05:30.040> as<00:05:30.250> a<00:05:30.280> foot<00:05:30.550> throttle<00:05:30.880> by<00:05:31.000> a

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
it can be run as a foot throttle by a

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.510 
it can be run as a foot throttle by a
single<00:05:31.990> driver<00:05:32.260> or<00:05:32.620> it<00:05:32.740> can<00:05:32.860> also<00:05:32.979> be<00:05:33.100> split<00:05:33.490> up

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
single driver or it can also be split up

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.190 
single driver or it can also be split up
so<00:05:33.610> you<00:05:33.790> could<00:05:33.910> drive<00:05:34.120> in<00:05:34.300> throttle<00:05:34.690> in<00:05:34.810> a

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
so you could drive in throttle in a

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.659 
so you could drive in throttle in a
traditional<00:05:35.350> offshore<00:05:36.040> kind<00:05:36.310> of<00:05:36.400> a<00:05:36.460> manner
