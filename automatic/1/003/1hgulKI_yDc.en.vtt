00:00:00.273 --> 00:00:03.925
"Sound Effects"!
For Anderson and César.

00:00:03.925 --> 00:00:08.495
Daniel and Elidio will pick two people from the
audience, who will provide us with the sounds

00:00:08.495 --> 00:00:12.176
of Anderson and César's improvisation.

00:00:12.176 --> 00:00:15.777
I'd like you guys in the front
to give me a hobby.

00:00:16.577 --> 00:00:18.178
Killing birds!

00:00:18.178 --> 00:00:21.449
It's a thing from childhood and stuff...

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.298
Killing birds is the scene
they will improvise

00:00:25.298 --> 00:00:28.419
while two people from the audience
will make the sounds.

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.021
Who are those people?
Let's meet the players!

00:00:32.021 --> 00:00:35.581
I'm here with Bruna, who's here to win!

00:00:35.782 --> 00:00:41.162
And who's with Daniel at the other side
of the field? Daniel Nascimento-to-to!

00:00:41.162 --> 00:00:44.144
Actually, I'm at the same side, Bruno...

00:00:44.254 --> 00:00:48.524
I'm here with none other than Cláudia!

00:00:48.524 --> 00:00:50.514
Bruna and Cláudia, you will make
the sound effects of the scene.

00:00:50.514 --> 00:00:53.685
Bruna will do Anderson's sounds.

00:00:53.685 --> 00:00:56.985
Cláudia will do César's sounds.

00:00:56.985 --> 00:01:02.376
Let's play "Sound Effects".
The hobby is to kill birds, starting now!

00:01:02.435 --> 00:01:05.176
I can't reach the birds, man!

00:01:05.176 --> 00:01:07.987
I don't know if the problem's
on my slingshot or my aim...

00:01:08.587 --> 00:01:11.357
I brought a BB gun!

00:01:11.357 --> 00:01:14.077
It's in the locker, let me open it.

00:01:17.238 --> 00:01:20.551
I'm just gonna take this cat out...

00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:23.160
It's my pet cat!

00:01:25.331 --> 00:01:27.361
I'll pick up the gun...

00:01:30.142 --> 00:01:33.492
You can tell it's silent!

00:01:33.732 --> 00:01:38.203
- Hold it. 
- I don't like guns,man... Oh, I'm nervous!

00:01:38.203 --> 00:01:40.474
Let me close the locker.

00:01:42.304 --> 00:01:45.884
It has velcro, you see?

00:01:46.153 --> 00:01:49.133
Yeah. I see the bird.

00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:50.706
I can even hear the bird.

00:01:53.436 --> 00:01:56.576
There's a lot of them, dude!

00:01:56.576 --> 00:01:59.466
- Which one do I choose?
- Pull the trigger first.

00:02:02.116 --> 00:02:04.418
There's no bullets, dude!

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:07.400
Let me open.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.621
- Shit, man!
- The thing's broken, damn!

00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:15.710
We'll have to go back to the slingshot!

00:02:15.951 --> 00:02:18.470
Come on, pick up the slingshot.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.174
I don't know if the
rubber strip is bad, take a look.

00:02:24.494 --> 00:02:25.874
Stretch some more.

00:02:28.254 --> 00:02:32.364
- Let's try.
- I'll pick up a pebble, then.

00:02:44.897 --> 00:02:48.538
I told you to take your
hand away when you shoot...

00:02:48.538 --> 00:02:51.699
- You do it then!
- I'll explain for you, look!

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:54.069
Pay attention!

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.180
Pay attention!

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.072
I bought it from Donald Duck, see?

00:03:09.283 --> 00:03:11.442
Pay attention!

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:12.923
I'm shooting!

00:03:16.346 --> 00:03:20.417
You... Hit my grandma!

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.649
Now you hit it!

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.099
Hit that chicken!

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:37.379
- Hit the chicken and the duck!
- I will!

00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:40.533
I'll take this shotgun...

00:03:42.883 --> 00:03:46.133
- I'll load the shotgun.
- Load it!

00:03:48.293 --> 00:03:50.043
Shoot!

00:03:52.323 --> 00:03:55.265
You got it!

00:03:57.316 --> 00:03:59.377
I'm loading it!

00:04:05.648 --> 00:04:07.818
You want to start a song?

00:04:11.057 --> 00:04:12.409
Three, two, one!

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.110
