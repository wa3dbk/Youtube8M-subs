00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.780
 hello to all guys welcome to this 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.360
 new video this is let's say another 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.390
 video of the series on the critics ai 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:30.170
 big and big youtube youtubers 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:35.210
 sorry the repetition is there with me but 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:37.730
 in short they put three I July and 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.950
 so basically it will help me say a 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.670
 talk about this subject very much 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.910
 hard 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.739
 very well then as the title says today 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.140
 you know we will talk about the capobastone 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:54.340
 then pass the word directly to 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:57.800
 mine that has something to be mine 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.720
 then I would like to start by saying immediately 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.850
 which has been done knows little of which 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.340
 check however we obviously want 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:10.670
 go digging the culprits at the bottom and 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.470
 see let's start talking about these right away 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.290
 different colors 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.770
 at first he only did ever saw 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:22.940
 all the facts and that's how if I do 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:29.710
 the Shiites who fall are less than mine 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:34.810
 sense and that now that all sites 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.790
 both to varying his who made of 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.100
 video only that you are completely 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.460
 deviated from minecraft what he had 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.759
 led to the success of god I do not 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:50.320
 I follow more because I follow him 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:52.330
 now ends here so here's if this 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.210
 let's say something quite interesting 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.280
 to comment because precisely we say 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.350
 can be a good initiative to do 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.410
 diversified gameplay to attract 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.440
 different public, however, as mine said 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.750
 has completely moved the situation 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.970
 so I too must say that with 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.400
 difficulty then returned to look at her 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.420
 channel to see some videos of the rough 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.880
 2 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.260
 in short, the videos make him so let's say 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.300
 that this is a bit a point in his 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.080
 disadvantage even if it is right that 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.300
 there is some variation that no 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.500
 there is also the case of bonino networks 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:35.250
 own idea, however, some roofs 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:41.320
 put educate at yours to 22 okay me 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:44.739
 no wishing I could but never started later 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.200
 the end is not a criticism 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.610
 no there is not much to criticize are 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.320
 I would say more than anything else 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.769
 we say that surely the capobastone 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.440
 has kept for years if they are years now 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:02.709
 sincerely it will definitely be will be 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.440
 years we say work on youtube always 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.870
 a very high quality level of its own 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.790
 for example the use not of the 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.900
 microphone but of loquendo anyway of 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:17.120
 programs that simulate 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:19.700
 so virtual and 15 so let's say that 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.379
 on this nothing to say 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.390
 the only aspect we wanted 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.519
 to criticize this which this aspect 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.200
 so variation of the videos that anyway 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.510
 it may be interesting but it appears to us 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.090
 too exaggerated his first video le 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.269
 sante less than a year ago and collector of 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.269
 two 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.780
 just that soon after helped with but me 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.030
 I think but if nothing bad if we go 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.189
 to see the videos no for example there is a 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.950
 period in which he always made videos of 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:53.920
 minecraft a little varied well worn e 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:56.450
 now when after a christmas more or less 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.239
 own brand video is certain 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.489
 we can understand that by now we say art 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.379
 and of the campobassano of griffin that it is 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.019
 become an auction is very difficult to 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.670
 apply current servers that have 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.980
 so thousands of protection could 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.650
 becoming a defender also making videos 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.329
 always innovative in racing than in the 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.539
 end is based on the usual things ie 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:20.060
 destroy throw lava and water and tnt 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:21.829
 if you are lucky enough to have them then 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.330
 perhaps the capobastone wanted 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.090
 simply have a bit of paris 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.930
 action however has not found anymore we say 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.940
 useful topics in his style on 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.570
 minecraft has therefore remained on this 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:39.320
 side of samo games i believe but 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:42.590
 multiplex stops at half dead hired for 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.389
 me but yes for me first and let's say this 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.030
 character is definitely one of the 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:50.510
 best of gaming characters are 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.190
 minecraft reduced and therefore is 10 I love 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.440
 a person to follow absolutely 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.970
 so I advise you as opposed to 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.040
 many other youtubers that we will go to 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.720
 review to visit his channel of 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.600
 sign up if you don't know it yet 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.150
 very unlikely thing so I would say 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.220
 which for this video is everything and with mines 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.990
 we will hear from you with the next video on 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.700
 criticism of another famous person 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.700
 images hi bye to all
