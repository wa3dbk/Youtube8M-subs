00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:02.229
 we are now returning to 

00:00:02.229 --> 00:00:04.399
 airfield long-range aviation you 7 where 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:05.759
 leave the minute flies by 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.849
 upgraded bomber Tu 160 3 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.419
 or as pilots call it themselves in white 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:12.679
 swan 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.730
 the aircraft has been updated on 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.830
 Kazan Aircraft Designer 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.529
 significantly improved on the characterization 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.050
 which concerns sighting 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.400
 navigation equipment and 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.149
 Air Force Command hopes annually 

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:23.990
 upgrade 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.180
 yes three aircraft of this modification in 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.039
 year 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.919
 these frames 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.840
 we get real time 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.310
 it is no secret why the plane was above 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.400
 It is named white swan probably 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.960
 the percentage of those who are now watching this 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.930
 live broadcast children 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.540
 first of all immediately guess 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.300
 just because it looks like white 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.100
 swan 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.880
 not for the fact that any taxes with 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.050
 historical events or something 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.360
 others just 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.560
 analogy 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.980
 2 d and now jsc tehnefteinvest 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.880
 leaf of this plane they are also strongly 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.920
 impressive 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.350
 flying distance without refueling around 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.220
 thirteen thousand kilometers 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.080
 the machine can reach speeds up to 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.190
 two thousand yes three hundred kilometers per hour and this 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.860
 besides 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.180
 and this despite the fact that 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.540
 this plane weighs 110 tons this mass 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.850
 it's a little this mass of an empty plane and 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.860
 This way it can transport more than 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.360
 twice the weight of your place 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.100
 It is worth recalling that the maximum 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.100
 takeoff weight of this aircraft is 275 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.770
 and here this upgrade 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.560
 the plane is now landing in 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.530
 Goa airport and the percentage of Wenger itself 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.619
 It is worth reminding that this product 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.790
 cloakroom attendant can say with experience he 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.570
 was built in 87 year then passed 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.009
 Egor 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.009
 the first flights out was supposed to be 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.849
 genuine Soviet breakthrough 

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:51.280
 strategic aviation 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.860
 this is the fourth generation missile carrier 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.150
 it is also included in the classification of nato 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.000
 where he is called black jack 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.200
 it was developed in its own way 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.150
 time as some kind of response to appearing in 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.270
 us bomber plane would 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.989
 one 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.799
 but after the collapse of the Soviet Union 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.560
 almost all available at that time in 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.939
 serial then the 160 is 19 aircraft left on 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:19.460
 Ukraine on 1 base Priluki 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.270
 90 second year the first aircraft of this type 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.310
 entered service Russian air force 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.379
 she is now 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.790
 first sample of early modernized 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.769
 aircraft all my upgrades for now 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:32.900
 concerns only sighting 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.129
 navigation equipment and 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.709
 in command of the air force stated that 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.900
 will be upgraded annually 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.049
 through supplying the council with a sample of technology 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.340
 the third model of Russian aviation 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.470
 parts
