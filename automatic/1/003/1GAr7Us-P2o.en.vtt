Heisenberg ER and his super powers so as

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.549 
Heisenberg ER and his super powers so as
you<00:00:35.820> can<00:00:36.000> see<00:00:36.059> I've<00:00:36.480> done<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.780> square<00:00:37.170> killing

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
you can see I've done the square killing

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.650 
you can see I've done the square killing
technique<00:00:38.070> for<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.399> head<00:00:38.610> shape<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.300> then

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
technique for the head shape and then

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.060 
technique for the head shape and then
I've<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.930> one<00:00:40.170> eye<00:00:40.200> bigger<00:00:40.590> than<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.950> other

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
I've the one eye bigger than the other

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.520 
I've the one eye bigger than the other
for<00:00:41.430> afridi<00:00:41.879> effect<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.660> I've<00:00:42.960> done<00:00:43.170> detailed

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
for afridi effect and I've done detailed

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.400 
for afridi effect and I've done detailed
top<00:00:44.100> teeth<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.730> less<00:00:45.180> detail<00:00:45.719> bottom<00:00:46.140> teeth

top teeth and less detail bottom teeth

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.350 
top teeth and less detail bottom teeth
now<00:00:47.129> here's<00:00:47.430> where<00:00:47.700> things<00:00:47.760> get<00:00:48.300> really

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
now here's where things get really

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.639 
now here's where things get really
complicated<00:00:49.340> I'm<00:00:50.340> actually<00:00:50.610> gonna<00:00:51.030> use<00:00:51.120> a

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
complicated I'm actually gonna use a

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.250 
complicated I'm actually gonna use a
psychological<00:00:52.649> trick<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.430> I'm<00:00:53.820> gonna<00:00:53.969> raise

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
psychological trick and I'm gonna raise

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.110 
psychological trick and I'm gonna raise
Heisenberg<00:00:55.260> azam<00:00:55.590> slightly<00:00:56.430> away<00:00:56.699> from<00:00:56.730> his

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
Heisenberg azam slightly away from his

dangering technique why does is it gives

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.260 
dangering technique why does is it gives
a<00:01:03.510> message<00:01:03.719> for<00:01:04.140> Heisenberg<00:01:04.979> er<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
a message for Heisenberg er is the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.630 
a message for Heisenberg er is the
danger<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.650> don't<00:01:07.890> mess<00:01:08.159> with<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
danger and you don't mess with the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.370 
danger and you don't mess with the
danger<00:01:09.240> because<00:01:10.200> it's<00:01:10.740> dangerous<00:01:12.380> because
