00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.050 
him get more involved in the offensive
attack<00:03:16.130> I'm<00:03:16.310> sure<00:03:16.459> that's<00:03:16.609> what<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:16.819> brain

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
attack I'm sure that's what the brain

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.690 
attack I'm sure that's what the brain
trust<00:03:17.329> is<00:03:17.540> talking<00:03:17.900> about<00:03:17.989> there<00:03:18.380> for<00:03:18.859> Iona<00:03:19.310> he

trust is talking about there for Iona he
and<00:03:19.849> I<00:03:20.000> think<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.329> game<00:03:20.540> is<00:03:20.569> going<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:20.930> open<00:03:21.139> up

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
and I think the game is going to open up

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.809 
and I think the game is going to open up
drastically<00:03:21.530> in<00:03:21.919> the<00:03:21.950> second<00:03:22.340> half<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:22.639> we

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
drastically in the second half and we

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.750 
drastically in the second half and we
would<00:03:23.780> love<00:03:23.810> to<00:03:23.989> see<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:24.919> know<00:03:25.040> having<00:03:25.639> it<00:03:25.700> on
