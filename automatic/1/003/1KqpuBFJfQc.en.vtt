I'm<00:00:48.570> going<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.170> crack<00:00:49.890> open<00:00:50.309> this

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
I'm going to do is crack open this

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.380 
I'm going to do is crack open this
buzzer<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.570> get<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.289> guts<00:00:52.440> out<00:00:53.270> so<00:00:54.270> I've

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
buzzer and get the guts out so I've

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.910 
buzzer and get the guts out so I've
cracked<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.719> open<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.079> there's<00:00:55.230> not<00:00:55.410> much<00:00:55.620> to

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
cracked it open and there's not much to

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.720 
cracked it open and there's not much to
it<00:00:56.030> two<00:00:57.030> wires<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.809> two<00:00:58.559> very<00:00:58.859> thin<00:00:59.190> wafers

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
it two wires and two very thin wafers

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.080 
it two wires and two very thin wafers
that<00:00:59.969> touch<00:01:00.390> each<00:01:00.600> other<00:01:01.820> that's<00:01:02.820> all<00:01:02.910> there

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
that touch each other that's all there

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.500 
that touch each other that's all there
is<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.439> next<00:01:04.439> thing<00:01:04.530> I'm<00:01:04.650> going<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.799> do<00:01:04.979> is

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
is to it next thing I'm going to do is

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.039 
is to it next thing I'm going to do is
solder<00:01:06.510> these<00:01:06.780> lines<00:01:07.650> onto<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:09.180> wires<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.750> it

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
solder these lines onto the wires and it

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.510 
solder these lines onto the wires and it
really<00:01:10.200> doesn't<00:01:10.409> matter<00:01:10.650> which<00:01:10.920> why<00:01:11.250> are<00:01:11.310> you

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
really doesn't matter which why are you

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.780 
really doesn't matter which why are you
connect<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.810> other<00:01:13.310> so<00:01:14.310> i<00:01:14.340> soldered<00:01:14.760> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
connect to the other so i soldered the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.090 
connect to the other so i soldered the
two<00:01:15.060> wires<00:01:15.330> from<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.840> buzzer<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.950> two

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
two wires from the buzzer to the two

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.240 
two wires from the buzzer to the two
wires<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:18.270> lead<00:01:18.720> from<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.409> quarter<00:01:20.130> inch

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
wires that lead from the quarter inch

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.740 
wires that lead from the quarter inch
jack<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:22.130> above<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.430> below<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.090> points

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
jack and above and below the points

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.539 
jack and above and below the points
where<00:01:24.869> i<00:01:24.930> solder<00:01:25.229> them<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.650> put<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> little<00:01:26.310> bit

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
where i solder them I put a little bit

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.640 
where i solder them I put a little bit
of<00:01:26.729> duct<00:01:27.060> tape<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.619> try<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.770> keep<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.820> stress

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
of duct tape to try and keep the stress

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.920 
of duct tape to try and keep the stress
from<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.829> joints<00:01:32.189> themselves<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.659> when

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
from the joints themselves so that when

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.960 
from the joints themselves so that when
I'm<00:01:34.049> carrying<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.470> around<00:01:34.530> or<00:01:35.070> using<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.790> i'm

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
I'm carrying it around or using it i'm

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.740 
I'm carrying it around or using it i'm
not<00:01:37.250> not<00:01:38.250> compromising<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.500> joints<00:01:41.750> so

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
not not compromising the the joints so

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.389 
not not compromising the the joints so
let's<00:01:42.960> take<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.680> plug<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.040> into<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.220> amp

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
let's take it and plug it into the amp

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.340 
let's take it and plug it into the amp
just<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.180> make<00:01:45.329> sure<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.930> damn<00:01:46.079> thing

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
just to make sure that the damn thing

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.649 
just to make sure that the damn thing
works<00:01:46.670> all<00:01:47.670> I've<00:01:47.820> really<00:01:48.030> done<00:01:48.180> here<00:01:48.509> is

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
works all I've really done here is

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.749 
works all I've really done here is
taking<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.409> buzzer<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.009> wired<00:01:50.579> it

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
taking this buzzer and wired it

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.499 
taking this buzzer and wired it
explicitly<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.540> quarter<00:01:51.930> inch<00:01:52.049> jack<00:01:52.310> any

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
explicitly to a quarter inch jack any

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.940 
explicitly to a quarter inch jack any
vibrations<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.720> these<00:01:54.899> two<00:01:55.140> plates<00:01:55.409> pick<00:01:55.740> up

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
vibrations that these two plates pick up

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.830 
vibrations that these two plates pick up
by<00:01:56.219> right<00:01:56.399> together<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:57.210> going<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.450> be<00:01:57.540> set

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
by right together is going to be set

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.450 
by right together is going to be set
information<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.649> be<00:01:58.740> sent<00:01:58.920> down<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.280> lines

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
information to be sent down the lines

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.969 
information to be sent down the lines
and<00:01:59.670> into<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.969> amplifier<00:02:03.649> you<00:02:04.649> can<00:02:04.770> hear<00:02:04.920> that

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
and into the amplifier you can hear that

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.850 
and into the amplifier you can hear that
it<00:02:05.189> obviously<00:02:05.640> works<00:02:05.969> being<00:02:06.509> amplified<00:02:06.860> so

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
it obviously works being amplified so

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.020 
it obviously works being amplified so
now<00:02:08.069> we<00:02:08.129> can<00:02:08.489> take<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.970> hook<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.690> up<00:02:09.810> to

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
now we can take it and hook it up to

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.260 
now we can take it and hook it up to
something<00:02:10.240> interesting<00:02:10.840> like<00:02:11.020> the<00:02:11.590> dryer<00:02:12.270> so

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
something interesting like the dryer so

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.040 
something interesting like the dryer so
I<00:02:13.330> got<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.569> cord<00:02:13.840> plug<00:02:14.080> into<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.380> amp<00:02:14.790> and

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
I got the cord plug into the amp and

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.800 
I got the cord plug into the amp and
then<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.380> other<00:02:17.410> side<00:02:17.850> got<00:02:18.850> it<00:02:18.970> plugged<00:02:19.240> in<00:02:19.510> to

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
then the other side got it plugged in to

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.699 
then the other side got it plugged in to
our<00:02:20.250> microphone<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.720> it's<00:02:22.720> duct<00:02:23.050> tape<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:23.560> the

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
our microphone and it's duct tape to the

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:31.630 
our microphone and it's duct tape to the
dryer<00:02:24.930> set<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.080> dryer<00:02:28.050> turns<00:02:29.050> up

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.910 

now<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.700> can<00:02:32.940> hear<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.270> sound<00:02:33.450> from<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.920> from

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
now you can hear the sound from the from

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.290 
now you can hear the sound from the from
the<00:02:34.950> dryer

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
the dryer

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.060 
the dryer
what<00:02:36.810> happens<00:02:37.140> if<00:02:37.290> we<00:02:37.410> do<00:02:37.560> something<00:02:37.920> like

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
what happens if we do something like

00:02:38.070 --> 00:04:52.350 
what happens if we do something like
throw<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.730> shoe<00:02:39.330> in<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:40.650> dryer

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.330 

so<00:04:53.360> there<00:04:53.570> you<00:04:53.660> have<00:04:53.720> it<00:04:53.900> he<00:04:54.830> is<00:04:54.919> a<00:04:54.950> buzzer

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
so there you have it he is a buzzer

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.940 
so there you have it he is a buzzer
connected<00:04:56.000> to<00:04:56.090> the<00:04:56.180> quarter<00:04:56.450> inch<00:04:56.570> jack

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
connected to the quarter inch jack

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:03.220 
connected to the quarter inch jack
simple<00:04:58.270> useful<00:04:59.270> and<00:05:00.220> noisy
