00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
to wet that because it'll just help

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.760 
to wet that because it'll just help
slide<00:01:50.369> through<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.880> plastic<00:01:52.579> turn<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.820> round

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
slide through that plastic turn it round

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.319 
slide through that plastic turn it round
you<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:55.920> see<00:01:56.250> there<00:01:56.520> where<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.790> needs<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.060> come

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
you can see there where it needs to come

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.039 
you can see there where it needs to come
out<00:01:57.439> just<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.619> matter<00:01:58.860> then<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.899> pinning<00:02:00.899> that

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
out just a matter then of pinning that

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.859 
out just a matter then of pinning that
straight<00:02:01.590> up<00:02:01.799> through<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:03.210> back<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.659> bait

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
straight up through the back of the bait

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.270 
straight up through the back of the bait
and<00:02:04.500> we've<00:02:05.460> got<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:06.030> weedless<00:02:06.930> rigged<00:02:07.439> 6-inch

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
and we've got a weedless rigged 6-inch

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.220 
and we've got a weedless rigged 6-inch
hollow<00:02:08.430> belly<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.480> other<00:02:09.570> thing<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.990> like

jerk shad hollow belly you can rig that

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.890 
jerk shad hollow belly you can rig that
in<00:02:33.820> a<00:02:33.880> different<00:02:34.240> way<00:02:34.360> you<00:02:34.420> can<00:02:34.720> use<00:02:34.870> a

in a different way you can use a

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.540 
in a different way you can use a
conventional<00:02:35.200> jig<00:02:35.800> on<00:02:35.920> it<00:02:36.040> if<00:02:36.130> you<00:02:36.250> want<00:02:36.460> to

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
conventional jig on it if you want to

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.900 
conventional jig on it if you want to
that's<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:37.030> normal<00:02:37.590> nitro<00:02:38.590> style<00:02:39.250> of<00:02:39.490> jig<00:02:39.730> in

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
that's the normal nitro style of jig in

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.180 
that's the normal nitro style of jig in
an<00:02:40.480> appropriate<00:02:40.990> size<00:02:41.230> of<00:02:41.530> course<00:02:41.770> that<00:02:42.040> will

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
an appropriate size of course that will

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.130 
an appropriate size of course that will
work<00:02:42.430> on<00:02:42.670> these<00:02:42.820> because<00:02:43.240> there's<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:43.930> little

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
work on these because there's a little

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.870 
work on these because there's a little
bit<00:02:44.260> more<00:02:44.410> meat<00:02:44.650> in<00:02:44.800> the<00:02:44.920> head<00:02:45.130> but<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.670> can

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
bit more meat in the head but you can

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.600 
bit more meat in the head but you can
send<00:02:46.240> awake<00:02:46.480> these<00:02:46.720> as<00:02:46.930> well<00:02:46.980> just<00:02:47.980> using<00:02:48.430> a
