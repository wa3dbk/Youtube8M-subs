00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.140
 interest in the national federation 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.790
 fishing in France it's 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.400
 represent recreational fishing in water 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.529
 sweet with the general public since that 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.779
 takes place during school holidays and 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.320
 that all of France comes to the show of 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.759
 agriculture 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.670
 the goal is to promote fishing 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.500
 with the general public in fact so we 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.090
 welcomes people on the stand so he 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.800
 there is a lot of sin of course so we have 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.480
 a documentation wall for all 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.730
 fishermen looking for corners of 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.019
 fishing accommodations know how that 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.970
 works who not always know 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.890
 necessarily big and they go fishing 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.960
 then go non fishermen who come in 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.850
 mass to discover a little bit what 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.079
 it is that the leisure fishing for the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.730
 kids it's going to be holding for the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.590
 first time a fishing rod for 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.059
 parents is the discovery of leisure 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.800
 of an activity that can do in 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.629
 family so they will always be curious 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.470
 to see what we will do 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.000
 how much does it cost? 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.080
 because they do not necessarily understand 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.030
 how it works 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.440
 so we teach them what it's all about 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.590
 what is the leisure how they 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.550
 can practice where to go 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.950
 they do not know the hair removal system 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.240
 associations so we inform them 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.020
 in it really that for that it do 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.020
 discover the leisure 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.100
 so we have several animation sites 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.080
 one of the fun animations that 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.630
 allow young and old to 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.070
 discover the leisure fishing so a game 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.800
 addressed with a throw mat on 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.170
 target we also have a simulator of 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.270
 fishing that allows grown-ups 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.430
 and grandchildren also been by the 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.140
 animators who are on the stand of 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.180
 to try the sensation of a first 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.890
 taken last saturday sunday we had 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.170
 also the task models.com Association 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.660
 who came to do a good animation 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.240
 particular for children and 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.259
 adults it's a game of address 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.580
 reproduce a little the conditions of 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.550
 fishing and the fishing environment 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.170
 we 've had three or four days of 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.610
 flies mounting so of course that's 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.500
 no fly to go fishing 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.020
 it's the fly to raise awareness 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.540
 children to the pleasures that it can be of 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.160
 to do a little view of the manual of the 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.920
 accuracy before going fishing 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.120
 and then we put forward also a little 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.430
 the role of environmental protection 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.380
 aquatic plays the national federation 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.260
 through the federations 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.230
 French departmental we have a 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.660
 hatchery hatchery so that was 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.340
 reproduced here on the stand and we have 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.110
 live outbreaks that shot into the 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.160
 public who discovers what it is that the 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.420
 birth of a small fish 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.980
 we also 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:43.569
 on the stand the opportunity to take 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:45.069
 a fishing card the law actually said 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.440
 that you need a fishing map to go 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.730
 to fish in rivers in France then 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.680
 this fishing card it allows 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.620
 many things 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.600
 first it allows associations 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.690
 to organize locally the life of 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.209
 the association and then of between me guy 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.930
 rented places where we do not fished 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.400
 locally 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.500
 and then at the federation level 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.840
 Departmental at the departmental level 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.959
 it creates jobs in fact 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.640
 jobs with agents who are 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.760
 technical missionaries on one side 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.049
 and that who deals only with the 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.090
 protection of aquatic environments 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.650
 will take care of the studies of the interview 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.060
 books or know how many fish 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.920
 in the river by counting and 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.630
 electric fishing and a lot of 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.850
 things that relate to the protection of 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.799
 aquatic environments and then we also 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.170
 development agents or 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.280
 also issue charges that deals badly 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.260
 to promote them fishing in the 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.209
 department to go to schools 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.150
 to go to the recreation centers 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.799
 to go into the works councils of 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.510
 to discover the fishing the office of 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.530
 tourism also for people who 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.640
 come on vacation die who know 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.680
 though that's because they can do 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.100
 without actually knowing it with the money from 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.140
 this card 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.760
 Well, that's nice to have the right 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.470
 to go fishing it also allows to be 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.400
 citizen helped to maintain his river 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.400
 know 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.220
 so today these are not 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.900
 employees of the federations and 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.640
 volunteers from associations and federations 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.440
 who join us every year with 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.210
 pleasure on the stand 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.550
 you must know that yes, I talked about it 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.990
 just now the fishing card not 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.880
 now it's jobs but not 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.350
 that actually if you want we have 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.610
 a lot of volunteers in all 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.980
 departmental federations and in 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:24.390
 all the associations that help us 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:27.780
 who runs nature fishing workshops that 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:30.660
 bring the local association to life 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.790
 organizing the competitions by informing 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.500
 fishermen from the state of the rivers of 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.910
 the opening of what happens at the end of 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.100
 life of associations volunteers 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.020
 are very involved but we need 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.130
 always people joining a small 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:46.170
 little by little all there is the whole community in 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.580
 Fishermen's Day we need to 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.160
 that everyday I fight to renew 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.150
 for for going to accompany us in 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.480
 done in the awareness process 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.430
 from the public to what we do and that's it and 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.000
 to live in France 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.000
 not the leisure fishing 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.060
 we have very good communication 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.240
 of all institutional audiences for 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.320
 sensitize them to the missions have made 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.090
 all year long and what do the 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.440
 federations all year long and then a 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.620
 other side we have a big task too 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.420
 base of awareness and 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.640
 Improvement of the image of leisure 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.860
 Fishing kameni a somewhat outdated image 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:25.220
 so we work a lot and we have 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.470
 launched a promotional campaign on the 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.550
 recreational fishing for non-fishermen 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.380
 they have the urge to go fishing 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.990
 already before being able to invest in 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.790
 leisure fishing may eventually find 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.900
 people who have the love of fishing and 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.900
 the pleasure of going fishing 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:51.469
 we
