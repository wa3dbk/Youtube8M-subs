hi<00:00:01.170> Tom<00:00:01.650> walls<00:00:01.979> carbide<00:00:02.490> processors<00:00:03.270> want<00:00:03.959> to

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
hi Tom walls carbide processors want to

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.519 
hi Tom walls carbide processors want to
talk<00:00:04.319> about<00:00:04.500> impact<00:00:05.310> driver<00:00:05.879> bits<00:00:06.540> get<00:00:07.410> my

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
talk about impact driver bits get my

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.180 
talk about impact driver bits get my
finger<00:00:07.859> out<00:00:07.980> of<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.130> way<00:00:08.990> look<00:00:09.990> like<00:00:10.230> ordinary

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
finger out of the way look like ordinary

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.180 
finger out of the way look like ordinary
they<00:00:12.030> look<00:00:12.240> like<00:00:12.389> ordinary<00:00:12.740> screwdriver<00:00:13.740> bits

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
they look like ordinary screwdriver bits

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.200 
they look like ordinary screwdriver bits
with<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.880> little<00:00:15.210> plastic<00:00:16.049> like<00:00:16.529> material

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
with a little plastic like material

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.660 
with a little plastic like material
around<00:00:18.210> them<00:00:18.560> but<00:00:19.560> they<00:00:19.740> work<00:00:20.010> much<00:00:20.340> much

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
around them but they work much much

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.880 
around them but they work much much
better<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.810> read<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.230> literature<00:00:22.439> and

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
better and I read the literature and

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.950 
better and I read the literature and
they<00:00:22.980> said<00:00:23.189> impact<00:00:23.550> absorbing<00:00:24.060> stuff<00:00:24.600> in<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
they said impact absorbing stuff in the

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.189 
they said impact absorbing stuff in the
middle<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.350> what<00:00:25.560> not<00:00:25.910> which<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:27.570> was<00:00:27.810> curious

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
middle and what not which I was curious

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.349 
middle and what not which I was curious
so<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.410> took<00:00:28.529> one<00:00:28.830> apart<00:00:28.949> because<00:00:29.490> that's<00:00:30.150> what

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
so I took one apart because that's what

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.250 
so I took one apart because that's what
guys<00:00:30.570> do<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.019> guess<00:00:31.349> anyway<00:00:31.850> this<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.270> one<00:00:34.140> of

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
guys do I guess anyway this is one of

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.060 
guys do I guess anyway this is one of
these<00:00:34.410> bits<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:37.489> first<00:00:38.489> thing<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.820> did<00:00:39.030> was

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
these bits and first thing I did was

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.889 
these bits and first thing I did was
first<00:00:41.070> thing<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.399> did<00:00:41.640> was<00:00:41.850> was<00:00:42.329> bite<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
first thing I did was was bite the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.100 
first thing I did was was bite the
plastic<00:00:43.469> see<00:00:43.739> how<00:00:43.860> hard<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.340> was<00:00:44.719> it<00:00:45.719> was<00:00:45.899> hard

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
plastic see how hard it was it was hard

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.049 
plastic see how hard it was it was hard
so<00:00:46.739> then<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:46.980> got<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.219> pocket<00:00:47.670> knife<00:00:47.820> out

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
so then I got a pocket knife out

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.630 
so then I got a pocket knife out
figuring<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.690> was<00:00:48.870> going<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.110> shave<00:00:49.410> off<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
figuring I was going to shave off the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.299 
figuring I was going to shave off the
plastic<00:00:51.120> coating<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.750> didn't<00:00:52.140> work<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.649> I

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
plastic coating that didn't work so I

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.950 
plastic coating that didn't work so I
got<00:00:53.579> out<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.789> dremel<00:00:54.329> with<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.510> cutting<00:00:54.930> wheel

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
got out to dremel with a cutting wheel

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.939 
got out to dremel with a cutting wheel
on<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.920> same<00:00:56.160> thing<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.550> used<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.739> to<00:00:58.739> cut

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
on it the same thing I used to to cut

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.389 
on it the same thing I used to to cut
metal<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.609> cut<00:01:00.739> actually<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.010> same<00:01:02.219> way

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
metal to cut actually it's the same way

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.700 
metal to cut actually it's the same way
the<00:01:02.789> last<00:01:02.969> project<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.629> used<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:04.019> for<00:01:04.049> was<00:01:04.530> to

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
the last project I used it for was to

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.969 
the last project I used it for was to
cut<00:01:04.890> through<00:01:05.220> some<00:01:05.869> three<00:01:06.869> eight<00:01:07.020> three<00:01:07.950> eight

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
cut through some three eight three eight

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.109 
cut through some three eight three eight
stainless<00:01:08.640> steel<00:01:08.850> bolts<00:01:09.390> because<00:01:11.000> because<00:01:12.000> we

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
stainless steel bolts because because we

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.120 
stainless steel bolts because because we
got<00:01:12.270> some<00:01:12.450> bad<00:01:12.600> nylon<00:01:13.080> nuts<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.650> they<00:01:13.740> jammed

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
got some bad nylon nuts and they jammed

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.249 
got some bad nylon nuts and they jammed
okay<00:01:14.610> but<00:01:14.970> anyway<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.330> it'll<00:01:15.990> cut<00:01:16.229> through

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
okay but anyway so it'll cut through

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.649 
okay but anyway so it'll cut through
that<00:01:16.619> there<00:01:17.189> was<00:01:17.369> half<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.909> wheel<00:01:18.119> left<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.630> I

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
that there was half a wheel left so I

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.420 
that there was half a wheel left so I
used<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.140> on<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.799> cut<00:01:20.009> through<00:01:20.250> this

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
used it on this and it cut through this

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.230 
used it on this and it cut through this
fine<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:22.020> what's<00:01:22.290> inside<00:01:22.670> it's<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.970> same

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
fine this is what's inside it's the same

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.830 
fine this is what's inside it's the same
it's<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.990> it's<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.740> single<00:01:26.299> forged<00:01:27.299> piece

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
it's a it's it's a single forged piece

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.120 
it's a it's it's a single forged piece
right<00:01:28.200> but<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.950> gets<00:01:29.189> smaller<00:01:29.670> inside<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:31.130> it

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
right but it gets smaller inside and it

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.870 
right but it gets smaller inside and it
has<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.759> tight<00:01:33.380> plastic<00:01:34.380> oops

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
has the tight plastic oops

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.130 
has the tight plastic oops
ratty<00:01:35.880> ball<00:01:36.210> see<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.570> just<00:01:36.810> search<00:01:36.930> a

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
ratty ball see and I just search a

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.260 
ratty ball see and I just search a
picture<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.590> them<00:01:37.710> rapping<00:01:38.520> on<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.700> outside

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
picture of them rapping on the outside

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.240 
picture of them rapping on the outside
so<00:01:41.150> as<00:01:42.150> it's<00:01:42.840> working<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.380> your<00:01:43.530> impact<00:01:43.890> driver

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
so as it's working in your impact driver

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.030 
so as it's working in your impact driver
if<00:01:44.850> everything's<00:01:45.479> fine<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:46.470> just<00:01:46.799> keeps

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
if everything's fine this just keeps

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.300 
if everything's fine this just keeps
working<00:01:47.369> nothing<00:01:48.000> at<00:01:48.149> all<00:01:48.470> it's<00:01:49.470> thinner<00:01:50.009> in

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
working nothing at all it's thinner in

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.490 
working nothing at all it's thinner in
the<00:01:50.340> middle<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:51.450> if<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.810> start<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.290> run<00:01:52.470> into

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
the middle so if you start to run into

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.410 
the middle so if you start to run into
trouble<00:01:53.180> this<00:01:54.180> acts<00:01:55.610> sort<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.700> like<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.850> torsion

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
trouble this acts sort of like a torsion

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.740 
trouble this acts sort of like a torsion
type<00:01:57.659> shock<00:01:58.079> absorber<00:01:59.390> McPherson<00:02:00.390> struts

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
type shock absorber McPherson struts

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.020 
type shock absorber McPherson struts
maybe<00:02:01.460> along<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.640> same<00:02:02.850> idea<00:02:03.380> so<00:02:04.759> this<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:06.000> a

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
maybe along the same idea so this is a

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.029 
maybe along the same idea so this is a
little<00:02:06.390> thinner<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:07.259> instead<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.619> breaking

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
little thinner so instead of breaking

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.869 
little thinner so instead of breaking
this<00:02:08.849> yields<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.720> little<00:02:10.289> bit<00:02:10.410> slowly<00:02:11.009> but<00:02:11.730> like

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
this yields a little bit slowly but like

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.430 
this yields a little bit slowly but like
anything<00:02:12.150> else<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.690> only<00:02:12.780> yields

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
anything else and only yields

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.670 
anything else and only yields
far<00:02:13.800> so<00:02:14.580> when<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.820> get<00:02:15.000> an<00:02:15.120> excess<00:02:15.680> excess

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
far so when you get an excess excess

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.540 
far so when you get an excess excess
force<00:02:17.460> an<00:02:17.760> excess<00:02:18.090> rotational<00:02:18.780> force<00:02:19.550> this

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
force an excess rotational force this

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.210 
force an excess rotational force this
yields<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.090> little<00:02:21.330> bit<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:21.780> basically<00:02:22.320> these

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
yields a little bit so basically these

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.480 
yields a little bit so basically these
are<00:02:23.370> like<00:02:23.700> cars<00:02:24.470> this<00:02:25.470> is<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.680> shot<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.190> really

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
are like cars this is a shot it really

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.670 
are like cars this is a shot it really
is<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.670> shock<00:02:27.060> absorber<00:02:27.630> like<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.780> McPherson<00:02:28.530> and

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
is a shock absorber like a McPherson and

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.730 
is a shock absorber like a McPherson and
we're<00:02:30.560> like<00:02:31.730> sorry<00:02:32.730> guys<00:02:32.960> like<00:02:33.960> a<00:02:33.990> McPherson

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
we're like sorry guys like a McPherson

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.030 
we're like sorry guys like a McPherson
like<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.430> McPherson<00:02:36.120> strut<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.750> that's<00:02:37.620> how<00:02:37.830> it

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
like a McPherson strut and that's how it

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.670 
like a McPherson strut and that's how it
works<00:02:38.280> now<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.180> know<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.750> this<00:02:39.810> it's<00:02:40.290> cool

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
works now I know and this it's cool

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.400 
works now I know and this it's cool
these<00:02:40.920> things<00:02:41.220> really<00:02:42.060> really<00:02:42.240> do<00:02:42.720> work<00:02:42.960> more

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
these things really really do work more

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.900 
these things really really do work more
and<00:02:43.530> more<00:02:43.680> we<00:02:43.830> have<00:02:43.950> customers<00:02:44.610> that<00:02:44.640> are

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
bits and just going with these four

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.870 
bits and just going with these four
screwdrivers<00:02:50.880> even<00:02:51.270> as<00:02:51.420> well<00:02:51.630> as<00:02:51.780> impact<00:02:52.200> bits

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
screwdrivers even as well as impact bits

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.550 
screwdrivers even as well as impact bits
definitely<00:02:53.880> impact<00:02:54.270> bits<00:02:54.540> thanks<00:02:55.350> have<00:02:55.530> a

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
definitely impact bits thanks have a

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.370 
definitely impact bits thanks have a
