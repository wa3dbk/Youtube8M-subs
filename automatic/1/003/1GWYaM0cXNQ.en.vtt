00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.960
 OK... 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.660
 Many thanks to the Broadcast Film Critics Association for naming me as the most valuable of 2014. 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.220
 I searched for MVP in Google ... 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.120
 ... and the definition that I liked is that of a "player" that is valuable to your team ... 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.080
 ... I loved the phrase "being part of a team". 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.180
 Sometimes we actors 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.160
 we are the ones who receive all the recognition 

00:00:31.195 --> 00:00:33.195
 however there are as many people 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.600
 They deserve it just like us. 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.840
 I had the opportunity to record, act, and promote 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.640
 the four films in 2014, thanks to all the brilliant 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.460
 team with which I worked. 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.500
 I love you guys, thank you very much. 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.760
 I learned a lot thanks to my directors during 2014 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.120
 about what it really is to be an artist, 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.800
 each of the characters in his films was very different 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.840
 thanks to its different and unique points of view. 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.600
 I am very grateful to work in an industry where there are people like them. 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.140
 In all the movies that I was in 2014 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.580
 there were extraordinary actors, 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.100
 but also staff members 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.660
 who worked hard every day, 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.900
 and they did it for much more than a paycheck, 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.240
 they did it because it really meant something to them 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.900
 and for that reason each of them deserve a prize equal to this one. 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.980
 Today is the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr., 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.160
 so, 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.580
 it made me think 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.560
 on the need to build and strengthen diversity in our industry 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:57.660
 and being together against homophobic, sexist, misogynist and racist agendas. 

00:01:58.777 --> 00:02:01.157
 I'm an optimist, 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.380
 and I can not help feeling hope about the future of the industry, 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.740
 especially seeing people so beautiful that they are in this room. 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:14.169
 And as Marthin Luther King Jr. said, 

00:02:14.455 --> 00:02:16.455
 "Our lives begin to end, 

00:02:16.455 --> 00:02:18.455
 the day we keep silent 

00:02:18.455 --> 00:02:20.455
 about the things that really matter " 

00:02:20.455 --> 00:02:22.935
 So I invite everyone here, 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.020
 Please SPEAK and DO NOT BE CALLED. 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.020
 Thank you.
