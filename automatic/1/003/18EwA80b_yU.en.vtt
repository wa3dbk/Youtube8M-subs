00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
question for you because this is to me I

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:23.860 
question for you because this is to me I
was<00:03:22.280> trying<00:03:22.459> to<00:03:22.490> think<00:03:22.670> about<00:03:22.820> this<00:03:23.000> so<00:03:23.240> for

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
was trying to think about this so for

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.600 
was trying to think about this so for
girls<00:03:24.170> I<00:03:24.350> can<00:03:24.500> imagine<00:03:24.680> let's<00:03:25.040> say<00:03:25.100> it<00:03:25.280> was

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
girls I can imagine let's say it was

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.010 
girls I can imagine let's say it was
hypothetically<00:03:26.300> speaking<00:03:26.420> like<00:03:26.750> really

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
hypothetically speaking like really

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.360 
hypothetically speaking like really
normal<00:03:27.350> for<00:03:27.470> girls<00:03:27.500> to<00:03:27.740> have<00:03:27.860> facial<00:03:28.010> hair<00:03:28.280> and

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
normal for girls to have facial hair and

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.100 
normal for girls to have facial hair and
grow<00:03:28.490> facial<00:03:28.670> hair<00:03:28.820> I<00:03:29.120> would<00:03:29.720> think<00:03:29.810> that<00:03:29.900> most

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
grow facial hair I would think that most

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.000 
grow facial hair I would think that most
girls<00:03:30.350> including<00:03:30.709> myself<00:03:31.160> I<00:03:32.440> was<00:03:33.440> there<00:03:33.709> it's

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
girls including myself I was there it's

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.930 
girls including myself I was there it's
