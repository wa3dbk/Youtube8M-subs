00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:06.069
 and to end the day friends we 

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:08.050
 accompanies anna marÃ­a portillo del 11 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:11.080
 Lord hysteria that brings some things 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.929
 truly spectacular that a beauty 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.940
 tell me a little bit about that so flowery 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:19.449
 is what is now as fashionable not 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.220
 We 've seen it out there, good ones 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:24.699
 flowers created that is a theme that never 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.640
 it goes out of fashion but in the case of 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:30.099
 I relate it a lot with the flowers 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.740
 colors with the types of flowers but 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.080
 especially the colors with the with the 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.570
 fashion with the fault is true because 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.270
 always the colors of season are 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.320
 of the flowers are always always good 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.960
 related to the season 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.660
 of fashion as the neurosis of 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:54.059
 colors that are fashionable then and if 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.730
 there are now a large range of flowers and 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.370
 types of flowers and colors that 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.050
 really before you did not have them 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.920
 I take a chance for the flowers that are 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.720
 he sees you but I love he hears one thing 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.570
 so in this case let's say this 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.940
 is what is fashionable now what 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.380
 is the fashion these colors in the 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.380
 combination of colors as vibrant 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.770
 we are in fashion with those colors 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:27.330
 we also have on the other side a 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.910
 a palette of pink also fuchsia with 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.720
 a little bit of resemblance to a purple 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:36.180
 a lilac we organize many weddings 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:40.350
 You are famous in the country by or by wedding 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:44.220
 this you meet with the client with the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.259
 girlfriend and you see everything that is going to be done 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.869
 who wants to do the wedding concept 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.840
 aid in that part on the subject of 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.259
 flowers and decoration with flowers and 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.000
 some settings yes true but not 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.530
 in everything we achieve everything there are no people 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.659
 specialized in the subject they make 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.040
 coordination of the assemblies of the 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.430
 tables chairs 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.430
 in lighting that's art 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:18.210
 but the decoration is something super cute 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.860
 because really in most of the 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.020
 people that I have worked with 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.630
 fashion we always end up in a relationship 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.330
 super pretty of a lot of affection of a lot 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.540
 friendship because if you're all born with talk 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.180
 with ideas and with the girls they come with their 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.610
 doubt dreamed of truth and all have the 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.900
 magic word that I want something 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.910
 super different then I think one of 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.020
 the things that really we 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.690
 as montse let's make beautiful weddings I have 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.450
 to tell him that we really 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.580
 we put soul life and heart to every wedding 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.220
 to each topic we take it as something good 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.320
 thief to not then first is a 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.810
 interview with the girls with their mom 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.930
 they had to decide until the 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.620
 sisters the best friend the graphic that 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.620
 if more 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.670
 but the first meetings as there are 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.130
 other girls who only arrive alone 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.110
 or with your mom or sometimes they come with your 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.330
 string organizer but the theme that 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.810
 start you start with an idea the 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.910
 Most of them are girls who already 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.830
 They come already and also had 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.230
 I want color I do not want color I want 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.050
 traditional I do not want to betray I want 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.340
 modern truth lighter I want something 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.880
 fine classic 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.390
 and then and from that then 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.030
 we started talking to see ideas to me 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.040
 I really love how to work with 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.910
 my own folders of all my work 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.920
 that of all the work we have done and 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.740
 help us a lot of bibliography and be 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.860
 updated also what is it 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.180
 as the colors is still knows well age 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.430
 I cut the time that I do not have these 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.870
 Furniture tell a little bit of worth 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.450
 this beauty 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:10.410
 good this product 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:13.140
 We brought it a couple of years ago but 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.700
 has been until this year that we will 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.120
 we have given a little more push 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:21.359
 and we went to a fair with one of my 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:25.229
 children and really one of the at the fair 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:29.190
 one of the producers is one is one 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:32.400
 Russian married to an Ecuadorian in the 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.080
 Ecuador, there are a lot of people 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.000
 which is dedicated to the productions tests 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.460
 but is she has developed a 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.740
 technique and it has its fresh flowers but 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.190
 of its fresh flowers has developed 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.979
 this technique of preserving the flowers 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:49.820
 then these are are natural because 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.780
 They are natural but the roses are 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.880
 dehydrated 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.220
 off camera I told him that 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.460
 it really is a process that is called 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.460
 lyophilization and it is a process that is used 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.400
 a lot in medicine and food 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.190
 where they are extracted until the last 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.070
 drop of water then that allows them to 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:15.750
 them last says the producer that three 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.790
 years us us for the 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.180
 conditions of our country that is a 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:23.130
 tropical country very humid because really 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.810
 we say a year the truth but if yes 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:28.050
 a beauty can last a year 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.880
 normal temperature conditions with 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:35.280
 our warmth but there is not much 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:36.810
 water humidity unlike the 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.230
 medicines for example a vitamin 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:43.290
 b12 that the best or a soup really like 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.870
 the dehydrated and you put the water and 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:48.960
 can reactivate the rose not be 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:52.800
 reactive the rose is damaged is made 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:56.520
 and it does not last longer then 0 water 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.530
 0 water and she will be able to have a year that 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.569
 it's like a detail you can put it in 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.300
