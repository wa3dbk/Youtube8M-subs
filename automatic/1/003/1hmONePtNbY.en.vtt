then finally the snake snake and you'll

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.610 
then finally the snake snake and you'll
be<00:00:54.329> taking<00:00:54.660> these<00:00:54.809> animals<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.350> stacking

be taking these animals and stacking
them<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:56.129> top<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.360> crocodile<00:00:57.629> trying<00:00:58.230> not

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
them on top of this crocodile trying not

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.290 
them on top of this crocodile trying not
to<00:00:58.469> make<00:00:58.710> them<00:00:58.920> fall<00:00:59.219> off<00:00:59.250> let's<00:01:00.000> show<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.210> a

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
to make them fall off let's show you a

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.639 
to make them fall off let's show you a
little<00:01:00.539> bit<00:01:00.629> about<00:01:00.719> how<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.020> game<00:01:01.230> works

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
little bit about how the game works

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.490 
little bit about how the game works
one<00:01:02.579> more<00:01:02.789> animal<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.510> penguin<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.049> so

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
one more animal is the penguin and so

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.410 
one more animal is the penguin and so
you<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:05.010> seven<00:01:05.430> different<00:01:05.549> animals<00:01:06.119> at<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
you have seven different animals at the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.539 
you have seven different animals at the
beginning<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.900> each<00:01:07.020> game<00:01:07.350> each<00:01:07.920> player<00:01:07.950> gets

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
beginning of each game each player gets

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.070 
beginning of each game each player gets
seven<00:01:09.030> animals<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.479> front<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.780> them

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
seven animals in front of them

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.320 
seven animals in front of them
the<00:01:10.470> alligators<00:01:11.070> or<00:01:11.430> crocodiles<00:01:11.850> place<00:01:12.180> the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
the alligators or crocodiles place the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.179 
the alligators or crocodiles place the
middle<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.630> table<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.770> roll<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> die

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
middle of the table and you roll a die

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.370 
middle of the table and you roll a die
let's<00:01:15.180> say<00:01:15.330> for<00:01:15.509> example<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.900> just<00:01:16.080> rolled<00:01:16.290> a

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
let's say for example I just rolled a

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.410 
let's say for example I just rolled a
one<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:17.040> means<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.310> need<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.460> put<00:01:17.700> one<00:01:17.970> animal

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
one that means I need to put one animal

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.469 
one that means I need to put one animal
on<00:01:18.630> top<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.350> crocodile<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.369> put<00:01:20.729> here

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
on top of the crocodile so I put here

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.760 
on top of the crocodile so I put here
the<00:01:21.840> monkey<00:01:22.650> now<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.250> roll<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.670> die<00:01:24.770> okay

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
the monkey now you roll the die okay

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.640 
the monkey now you roll the die okay
let's<00:01:25.979> say<00:01:26.100> she<00:01:26.310> rolls<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.970> hand<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:28.320> allows

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
let's say she rolls the hand that allows

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.440 
let's say she rolls the hand that allows
her<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:28.950> give<00:01:29.189> me<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> piece<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.299> put

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
her to give me a piece and I have to put

whenever you make pieces fall off you

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.600 
whenever you make pieces fall off you
have<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:42.990> keep<00:01:43.259> up<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.710> two<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.890> them<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.399> this

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
have to keep up to two of them in this

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.520 
have to keep up to two of them in this
case<00:01:44.790> there<00:01:44.970> only<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.240> two<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.869> these<00:01:46.020> two<00:01:46.320> come

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
case there only is two so these two come

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.469 
case there only is two so these two come
in<00:01:46.619> front<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.920> me<00:01:47.009> otherwise<00:01:47.729> if<00:01:48.240> there<00:01:48.360> have

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
in front of me otherwise if there have

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.730 
in front of me otherwise if there have
been<00:01:48.600> let's<00:01:48.750> say<00:01:48.810> three<00:01:49.079> or<00:01:49.200> four<00:01:49.380> piece<00:01:49.560> that

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
been let's say three or four piece that

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.139 
been let's say three or four piece that
fall<00:01:49.950> off<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.250> caused<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.640> whole<00:01:50.759> thing<00:01:51.030> to

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
fall off I caused the whole thing to

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.999 
fall off I caused the whole thing to
collapse<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.720> would<00:01:52.229> have<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.470> put<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.740> extra

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
collapse I would have to put the extra

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.319 
collapse I would have to put the extra
ones<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.399> Box<00:01:53.610> which<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.030> good<00:01:54.210> because

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
ones in the Box which is good because

one player has no animals up in front of
them<00:03:31.480> they<00:03:31.930> win<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.290> game<00:03:32.320> the<00:03:33.130> quality<00:03:33.610> of

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
them they win the game the quality of

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.699 
them they win the game the quality of
the<00:03:33.820> components<00:03:34.030> are<00:03:34.510> tremendously<00:03:35.110> high<00:03:35.350> all

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
the components are tremendously high all

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.530 
the components are tremendously high all
the<00:03:36.130> different<00:03:36.459> pieces<00:03:36.610> are<00:03:37.030> wooden<00:03:37.330> pieces

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
the different pieces are wooden pieces

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.300 
the different pieces are wooden pieces
with<00:03:37.959> different<00:03:38.290> colors<00:03:38.620> so<00:03:39.040> that<00:03:39.070> they're

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
with different colors so that they're

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.680 
with different colors so that they're
easy<00:03:39.490> to<00:03:39.670> differentiate<00:03:40.030> from<00:03:40.360> each<00:03:40.480> other

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
easy to differentiate from each other

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.170 
easy to differentiate from each other
very<00:03:41.530> much<00:03:41.650> different<00:03:42.160> shapes<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.730> snake<00:03:43.000> is

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
very much different shapes the snake is

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.640 
very much different shapes the snake is
very<00:03:43.390> different<00:03:43.840> than<00:03:44.020> the<00:03:44.260> sheep<00:03:44.470> and

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
very different than the sheep and

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.370 
very different than the sheep and
they're<00:03:45.640> chunky<00:03:46.239> easy<00:03:46.600> for<00:03:46.900> kids<00:03:47.020> to<00:03:47.140> handle

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
they're chunky easy for kids to handle

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.720 
they're chunky easy for kids to handle
the<00:03:47.680> kids<00:03:47.860> are<00:03:47.950> going<00:03:48.040> to<00:03:48.130> like<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.430> idea<00:03:48.640> of

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
the kids are going to like the idea of

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.460 
the kids are going to like the idea of
animals<00:03:49.180> sacking<00:03:49.540> on<00:03:49.600> top<00:03:49.780> of<00:03:49.900> each<00:03:50.020> other<00:03:50.200> and

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
animals sacking on top of each other and

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.710 
animals sacking on top of each other and
I<00:03:50.770> admit<00:03:51.100> I<00:03:51.160> find<00:03:51.400> it<00:03:51.520> fun<00:03:51.700> to<00:03:51.910> I<00:03:51.940> mean<00:03:52.300> adults

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
I admit I find it fun to I mean adults

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.760 
I admit I find it fun to I mean adults
could<00:03:52.870> play<00:03:53.020> this<00:03:53.170> game<00:03:53.260> with<00:03:53.500> each<00:03:53.590> other

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
could play this game with each other

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.100 
could play this game with each other
because<00:03:53.980> it's<00:03:54.250> not<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.700> easiest<00:03:55.110> dexterity

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
because it's not the easiest dexterity

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.500 
because it's not the easiest dexterity
game<00:03:56.260> as<00:03:56.470> stacking<00:03:56.920> these<00:03:57.040> animals<00:03:57.550> the<00:03:58.030> dyads

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
game as stacking these animals the dyads

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.090 
game as stacking these animals the dyads
a<00:03:58.690> bit<00:03:58.810> of<00:03:58.900> randomness<00:03:59.200> in<00:03:59.410> the<00:03:59.530> game<00:03:59.709> but<00:03:59.950> it's

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
a bit of randomness in the game but it's

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.580 
a bit of randomness in the game but it's
really<00:04:00.250> not<00:04:00.489> that<00:04:00.550> bad<00:04:01.150> because<00:04:01.840> you're<00:04:02.230> going

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
really not that bad because you're going

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.380 
really not that bad because you're going
to<00:04:02.680> put<00:04:02.830> one<00:04:03.010> or<00:04:03.040> two<00:04:03.250> pieces<00:04:03.459> unlikely<00:04:04.150> unless

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
to put one or two pieces unlikely unless

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.910 
to put one or two pieces unlikely unless
you're<00:04:04.660> lucky<00:04:04.930> enough<00:04:04.959> to<00:04:05.080> get<00:04:05.260> the<00:04:05.410> hand<00:04:05.680> and

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
you're lucky enough to get the hand and

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.440 
you're lucky enough to get the hand and
then<00:04:06.310> you<00:04:06.400> get<00:04:06.520> the<00:04:06.640> piece<00:04:06.820> of<00:04:06.970> someone<00:04:07.270> else

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
then you get the piece of someone else

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.840 
then you get the piece of someone else
likely<00:04:08.410> someone<00:04:08.800> who's<00:04:08.950> winning<00:04:09.340> and<00:04:09.550> a<00:04:09.670> piece

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
likely someone who's winning and a piece

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.550 
likely someone who's winning and a piece
that's<00:04:10.060> difficult<00:04:10.270> for<00:04:10.600> them<00:04:10.840> to<00:04:10.870> get<00:04:11.110> on<00:04:11.140> so

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
that's difficult for them to get on so

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.229 
that's difficult for them to get on so
the<00:04:11.650> game<00:04:11.800> is<00:04:11.920> a<00:04:11.950> bit<00:04:12.130> self-correcting<00:04:13.060> there

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
the game is a bit self-correcting there

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.240 
the game is a bit self-correcting there
in<00:04:13.330> case<00:04:13.540> one<00:04:14.140> player<00:04:14.380> is<00:04:14.530> an<00:04:14.620> expert<00:04:14.980> stacker

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
in case one player is an expert stacker

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.039 
in case one player is an expert stacker
you<00:04:15.880> have<00:04:15.970> a<00:04:16.030> hard<00:04:16.209> piece<00:04:16.419> you<00:04:16.570> have<00:04:16.600> no<00:04:16.810> idea
