this is one not many may know about and
is<00:01:51.360> what<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.690> can<00:01:51.870> use<00:01:51.900> to<00:01:52.290> make<00:01:52.440> a<00:01:52.500> house<00:01:52.740> of

the proper view we're now going to go
over<00:03:50.830> a<00:03:50.860> couple<00:03:51.250> other<00:03:51.489> important<00:03:52.030> controls

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
over a couple other important controls

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.140 
over a couple other important controls
if<00:03:52.930> you<00:03:53.470> want<00:03:53.680> to<00:03:53.769> continually<00:03:54.280> stack<00:03:54.640> objects

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
if you want to continually stack objects

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.790 
if you want to continually stack objects
but<00:03:55.390> you<00:03:55.510> find<00:03:55.780> that<00:03:55.930> when<00:03:56.110> you<00:03:56.200> try<00:03:56.440> to<00:03:56.500> place

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
but you find that when you try to place

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.830 
but you find that when you try to place
one<00:03:57.040> on<00:03:57.069> top<00:03:57.340> of<00:03:57.400> another<00:03:57.610> all<00:03:58.120> you<00:03:58.599> do<00:03:58.720> is

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
one on top of another all you do is

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.960 
one on top of another all you do is
knock<00:03:59.019> them<00:03:59.260> down<00:03:59.470> then<00:04:00.010> press<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:00.310> R<00:04:00.640> key

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
knock them down then press the R key

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.449 
knock them down then press the R key
this<00:04:01.630> raises<00:04:02.110> the<00:04:02.140> object<00:04:02.620> higher<00:04:02.860> so<00:04:03.160> you<00:04:03.250> can

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
this raises the object higher so you can

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.960 
this raises the object higher so you can
stack<00:04:03.730> objects<00:04:04.239> higher<00:04:04.480> than<00:04:04.750> normal<00:04:05.970> another

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
stack objects higher than normal another

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.630 
stack objects higher than normal another
hidden<00:04:07.269> gem<00:04:07.599> is<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:07.959> push<00:04:08.200> key<00:04:08.500> hold<00:04:09.220> shift

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
hidden gem is the push key hold shift

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.240 
hidden gem is the push key hold shift
and<00:04:09.910> start<00:04:10.150> pushing<00:04:10.360> objects<00:04:10.900> around<00:04:11.200> now<00:04:12.190> you

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
and start pushing objects around now you

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.220 
and start pushing objects around now you
can<00:04:12.549> push<00:04:12.790> objects<00:04:13.299> without<00:04:13.540> having<00:04:13.989> to<00:04:14.080> pick

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
can push objects without having to pick

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.110 
can push objects without having to pick
them<00:04:14.410> up<00:04:14.530> this<00:04:15.190> is<00:04:15.400> great<00:04:15.580> when<00:04:15.849> you<00:04:15.940> want<00:04:15.970> to
