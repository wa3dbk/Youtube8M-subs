small like a poly bag here and you can

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.470 
small like a poly bag here and you can
see<00:02:38.570> these<00:02:39.570> are<00:02:40.790> quality<00:02:41.790> fasteners<00:02:42.330> and

millimeter head got one of each over

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.030 
millimeter head got one of each over
here<00:02:48.390> let's<00:02:48.690> start<00:02:48.900> putting<00:02:49.020> together<00:02:49.170> it's

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
here let's start putting together it's

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:57.980 
here let's start putting together it's
the<00:02:50.100> front<00:02:52.940> here<00:02:53.940> is<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.560> one<00:02:55.560> side<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.990> just

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
the front here is the one side and just

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.020 
the front here is the one side and just
to<00:02:58.980> make<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.160> easier<00:02:59.550> for<00:02:59.820> me<00:03:00.380> here<00:03:01.380> is<00:03:01.710> the

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
to make it easier for me here is the

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.260 
to make it easier for me here is the
other<00:03:03.030> side<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:04.310> what<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.340> really<00:03:05.910> liked<00:03:06.120> about

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
other side and what I really liked about

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.440 
other side and what I really liked about
what<00:03:09.770> t-rex<00:03:10.770> had<00:03:10.950> done<00:03:11.130> yep<00:03:11.880> they<00:03:12.240> did<00:03:12.390> the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
what t-rex had done yep they did the

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.950 
what t-rex had done yep they did the
same<00:03:12.630> thing<00:03:12.900> they<00:03:13.410> actually<00:03:13.860> weld<00:03:14.160> a<00:03:14.640> nut<00:03:15.360> or

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
same thing they actually weld a nut or

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.580 
same thing they actually weld a nut or
the<00:03:15.990> threads<00:03:16.470> on<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.430> inside<00:03:17.940> here<00:03:18.660> you<00:03:19.440> just

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
the threads on the inside here you just

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.870 
the threads on the inside here you just
got<00:03:19.770> to<00:03:19.890> kind<00:03:20.220> of<00:03:20.310> get<00:03:20.400> them<00:03:20.550> started<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:22.880> that

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
got to kind of get them started and that

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.350 
got to kind of get them started and that
really<00:03:24.360> takes<00:03:24.630> a<00:03:24.720> lot<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:24.990> the<00:03:25.200> guesswork<00:03:25.860> out

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
really takes a lot of the guesswork out

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.310 
really takes a lot of the guesswork out
because<00:03:27.360> all<00:03:27.510> you<00:03:27.630> have<00:03:27.750> to<00:03:27.840> do<00:03:27.930> is<00:03:28.050> get<00:03:28.200> it

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
because all you have to do is get it

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.750 
because all you have to do is get it
started<00:03:28.770> you<00:03:28.830> want<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.070> make<00:03:29.220> sure<00:03:29.340> not<00:03:29.700> to

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
started you want to make sure not to

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.970 
started you want to make sure not to
cross<00:03:30.120> thread<00:03:30.510> these<00:03:32.090> there<00:03:33.090> we<00:03:33.180> go<00:03:33.360> just

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
cross thread these there we go just

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:43.940 
cross thread these there we go just
tighten<00:03:34.980> them<00:03:35.070> up

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.760 

it<00:03:44.730> is<00:03:44.940> multi-piece<00:03:45.870> meaning<00:03:46.350> this<00:03:46.410> is<00:03:46.590> not

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
it is multi-piece meaning this is not

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.570 
it is multi-piece meaning this is not
one<00:03:47.070> complete<00:03:47.490> piece<00:03:47.730> but<00:03:48.000> let<00:03:48.540> me<00:03:48.660> tell<00:03:48.870> you

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
one complete piece but let me tell you

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.960 
one complete piece but let me tell you
five<00:03:50.580> years<00:03:50.850> of<00:03:51.030> ownership<00:03:51.180> that<00:03:51.570> stand<00:03:51.900> is

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
five years of ownership that stand is

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.880 
five years of ownership that stand is
solid<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:54.450> I<00:03:54.660> really<00:03:54.960> like<00:03:55.140> these<00:03:55.290> supporting

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
solid and I really like these supporting

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.620 
solid and I really like these supporting
pieces<00:03:56.310> might<00:03:56.550> has<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.880> exact<00:03:57.120> same<00:03:57.150> thing

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
pieces might has the exact same thing

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.320 
pieces might has the exact same thing
gives<00:03:58.200> it<00:03:58.320> a<00:03:58.380> tremendous<00:03:58.680> tremendous<00:03:59.520> amount

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
gives it a tremendous tremendous amount

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.570 
gives it a tremendous tremendous amount
of<00:04:00.420> stability<00:04:00.600> I<00:04:01.080> have<00:04:01.560> never<00:04:01.830> seen<00:04:02.160> so<00:04:02.400> much

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
of stability I have never seen so much

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.420 
of stability I have never seen so much
as<00:04:02.760> any<00:04:03.030> kind<00:04:03.510> of<00:04:03.600> flex<00:04:03.870> for<00:04:04.680> my<00:04:04.770> t-rex<00:04:05.010> rear

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
as any kind of flex for my t-rex rear

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.130 
as any kind of flex for my t-rex rear
stand<00:04:05.640> and<00:04:05.940> I<00:04:06.030> would<00:04:06.240> suspect<00:04:06.420> that<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.870> front

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
stand and I would suspect that the front

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.500 
stand and I would suspect that the front
stand<00:04:07.380> is<00:04:07.530> just<00:04:07.770> as<00:04:08.640> strong<00:04:08.820> because<00:04:09.150> it<00:04:09.300> looks

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
stand is just as strong because it looks

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.310 
stand is just as strong because it looks
just<00:04:09.750> as<00:04:09.930> beefy<00:04:11.510> so<00:04:12.510> let's<00:04:12.660> finish<00:04:12.840> this<00:04:13.080> up

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
just as beefy so let's finish this up

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.170 
just as beefy so let's finish this up
and<00:04:13.940> we'll<00:04:14.940> see<00:04:15.330> how<00:04:15.510> it<00:04:15.630> goes<00:04:15.810> all<00:04:16.770> right<00:04:16.830> now

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
and we'll see how it goes all right now

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.760 
and we'll see how it goes all right now
everything<00:04:18.180> is<00:04:18.209> in<00:04:18.390> what<00:04:18.570> kind<00:04:18.720> of<00:04:18.780> snug<00:04:19.650> them

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
everything is in what kind of snug them

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:25.880 
everything is in what kind of snug them
up<00:04:22.340> for<00:04:23.340> this<00:04:23.490> I<00:04:23.700> actually<00:04:23.820> prefer<00:04:24.360> a<00:04:24.890> box

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
up for this I actually prefer a box

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.180 
up for this I actually prefer a box

know I just like the way it feels you
don't<00:04:33.960> have<00:04:34.050> to<00:04:34.170> gorilla<00:04:34.620> tighten<00:04:34.950> these

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
don't have to gorilla tighten these

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.340 
don't have to gorilla tighten these
things<00:04:35.310> just<00:04:36.060> snug<00:04:36.390> them<00:04:36.420> down<00:04:36.570> nice<00:04:37.320> and

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
things just snug them down nice and

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.150 
things just snug them down nice and
tight<00:04:37.560> like<00:04:38.430> I<00:04:38.550> said<00:04:38.990> I<00:04:39.990> really<00:04:40.740> haven't<00:04:41.010> had

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
tight like I said I really haven't had

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.630 
tight like I said I really haven't had
to<00:04:42.230> mess<00:04:43.230> with<00:04:43.380> my<00:04:43.560> rear<00:04:43.740> stand<00:04:43.980> hardware<00:04:44.460> at

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
to mess with my rear stand hardware at

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.460 
to mess with my rear stand hardware at
all<00:04:44.880> I<00:04:44.910> think<00:04:45.150> I've<00:04:45.330> checked<00:04:45.570> it<00:04:45.720> twice<00:04:45.930> in<00:04:46.380> the

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
all I think I've checked it twice in the

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.350 
all I think I've checked it twice in the
PES<00:04:46.680> in<00:04:46.890> those<00:04:47.040> five<00:04:47.310> years<00:04:47.340> just<00:04:48.030> to<00:04:48.180> make

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
PES in those five years just to make

00:04:48.360 --> 00:05:01.410 
PES in those five years just to make
sure<00:04:48.390> she<00:04:48.810> looked<00:04:48.990> okay<00:04:49.380> and<00:04:50.900> always<00:04:51.900> has<00:04:52.080> been

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.340 

so<00:05:02.420> there<00:05:02.630> she<00:05:02.840> is<00:05:04.810> it's<00:05:05.810> pretty<00:05:06.050> good<00:05:06.170> I<00:05:06.230> do

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
so there she is it's pretty good I do

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.170 
so there she is it's pretty good I do
like<00:05:06.590> it<00:05:06.770> so<00:05:07.310> let's<00:05:07.340> take<00:05:07.670> the<00:05:07.850> bike<00:05:08.000> outside

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
like it so let's take the bike outside

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.710 
like it so let's take the bike outside
and<00:05:08.570> see<00:05:08.690> how<00:05:08.810> this<00:05:08.930> works

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
and see how this works

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.960 
and see how this works
so<00:05:11.720> my<00:05:12.200> CBR<00:05:12.650> 600<00:05:13.100> Double<00:05:13.310> R<00:05:13.430> is<00:05:13.520> equipped<00:05:13.850> with

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
so my CBR 600 Double R is equipped with

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.270 
so my CBR 600 Double R is equipped with
rear<00:05:14.180> spools<00:05:14.720> and<00:05:14.930> if<00:05:15.080> you<00:05:15.200> watch<00:05:15.410> what<00:05:16.040> you<00:05:16.130> do

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
rear spools and if you watch what you do

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.240 
rear spools and if you watch what you do
is<00:05:16.460> you<00:05:16.550> engage<00:05:16.940> the<00:05:17.270> rear<00:05:17.480> spools<00:05:18.080> with<00:05:18.530> the

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
is you engage the rear spools with the

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.400 
is you engage the rear spools with the
hooks<00:05:19.580> on<00:05:19.880> the<00:05:20.060> rear<00:05:20.240> stand<00:05:20.540> I<00:05:20.840> usually<00:05:21.320> hold

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
hooks on the rear stand I usually hold

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.740 
hooks on the rear stand I usually hold
the<00:05:21.530> backseat<00:05:22.040> just<00:05:22.070> a<00:05:22.460> little<00:05:22.730> bit<00:05:22.910> and<00:05:23.150> push

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
the backseat just a little bit and push

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.500 
the backseat just a little bit and push
it<00:05:23.930> straight<00:05:24.140> down<00:05:24.760> as<00:05:25.760> long<00:05:26.030> as<00:05:26.210> you<00:05:26.330> have

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
it straight down as long as you have

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.160 
it straight down as long as you have
both<00:05:26.930> spools<00:05:27.860> locked<00:05:28.400> in<00:05:28.670> it's<00:05:29.330> incredibly

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.170 
both spools locked in it's incredibly

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.870 
both spools locked in it's incredibly
stable<00:05:30.560> and<00:05:31.070> the<00:05:31.220> first<00:05:31.430> time<00:05:31.610> you<00:05:31.700> get<00:05:31.850> a

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
stable and the first time you get a

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.260 
stable and the first time you get a
little<00:05:32.150> uneasy<00:05:32.420> but<00:05:33.520> after<00:05:34.520> that<00:05:34.640> it's<00:05:34.850> pretty

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
little uneasy but after that it's pretty

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.690 
little uneasy but after that it's pretty
easy<00:05:35.530> now<00:05:36.530> putting<00:05:36.800> the<00:05:36.950> Front's<00:05:37.280> down<00:05:37.460> on<00:05:37.580> is

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
easy now putting the Front's down on is

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.220 
easy now putting the Front's down on is
a<00:05:37.730> little<00:05:38.300> bit<00:05:38.420> different<00:05:38.780> now<00:05:38.810> the<00:05:38.930> front

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
a little bit different now the front

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.130 
a little bit different now the front
stand<00:05:39.500> depends<00:05:40.250> on<00:05:40.610> the<00:05:40.850> rear<00:05:41.030> stand<00:05:41.300> what<00:05:42.020> you

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
stand depends on the rear stand what you

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.940 
stand depends on the rear stand what you
have<00:05:42.320> to<00:05:42.530> do<00:05:42.710> is<00:05:43.010> engage<00:05:43.250> both<00:05:43.880> pads<00:05:44.710> in<00:05:45.710> the

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
have to do is engage both pads in the

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.210 
have to do is engage both pads in the
front<00:05:46.280> and<00:05:46.460> in<00:05:47.210> the<00:05:47.240> back<00:05:47.740> underneath<00:05:48.740> the

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
front and in the back underneath the

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.280 
front and in the back underneath the
force<00:05:49.700> now<00:05:50.360> what<00:05:50.510> I<00:05:50.540> usually<00:05:50.690> try<00:05:50.930> to<00:05:50.960> do<00:05:51.169> is

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
force now what I usually try to do is

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.230 
force now what I usually try to do is
line<00:05:51.620> up<00:05:51.890> the<00:05:52.130> pads<00:05:52.430> so<00:05:52.700> they're<00:05:52.970> kind<00:05:53.210> of

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
line up the pads so they're kind of

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.300 
line up the pads so they're kind of
equidistant<00:05:53.990> and<00:05:54.470> once<00:05:54.680> that's<00:05:54.890> in<00:05:55.070> there

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
equidistant and once that's in there

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.560 
equidistant and once that's in there
simply<00:05:56.090> push<00:05:56.450> down<00:05:56.480> and<00:05:57.110> I<00:05:57.260> usually<00:05:57.560> hold<00:05:57.890> the

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
simply push down and I usually hold the

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.030 
simply push down and I usually hold the
right<00:05:59.570> hand<00:05:59.780> side<00:06:00.020> grip<00:06:00.380> just<00:06:00.710> for<00:06:00.860> stability

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:01.040 
right hand side grip just for stability

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.250 
right hand side grip just for stability
and<00:06:01.520> that's<00:06:01.940> it<00:06:02.180> the<00:06:02.540> rear<00:06:02.750> stand<00:06:02.990> does<00:06:03.169> the

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
and that's it the rear stand does the

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.350 
and that's it the rear stand does the
majority<00:06:03.410> of<00:06:03.770> the<00:06:03.950> work<00:06:04.100> never<00:06:04.910> put<00:06:05.330> a

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
majority of the work never put a

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.630 
majority of the work never put a
motorcycle<00:06:06.050> on<00:06:06.110> a<00:06:06.169> front<00:06:06.530> stand<00:06:06.800> when<00:06:07.460> there

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640 
motorcycle on a front stand when there

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.820 
motorcycle on a front stand when there
is<00:06:07.820> not<00:06:08.120> a<00:06:08.390> rear<00:06:08.630> stand<00:06:08.930> there's<00:06:09.320> no<00:06:09.590> stability

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
is not a rear stand there's no stability

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.520 
is not a rear stand there's no stability
there<00:06:10.280> it<00:06:10.490> will<00:06:10.700> fall<00:06:11.060> and<00:06:11.419> once<00:06:12.200> it's<00:06:12.380> up

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
there it will fall and once it's up

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.800 
there it will fall and once it's up
there<00:06:12.740> you're<00:06:13.580> ready<00:06:13.760> to<00:06:13.910> go<00:06:14.060> and<00:06:14.419> you<00:06:14.690> could

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
there you're ready to go and you could

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.420 
there you're ready to go and you could
do<00:06:14.960> just<00:06:14.990> about<00:06:15.350> any<00:06:15.620> type<00:06:15.919> of<00:06:15.950> maintenance

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
do just about any type of maintenance

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.030 
do just about any type of maintenance
now<00:06:16.820> you<00:06:16.880> could<00:06:17.330> do<00:06:17.419> chain<00:06:17.840> you<00:06:18.200> can<00:06:18.380> wash<00:06:18.620> you

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
now you could do chain you can wash you

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.370 
now you could do chain you can wash you
can<00:06:19.220> wax<00:06:19.490> you<00:06:20.270> can<00:06:20.450> do<00:06:20.540> an<00:06:20.660> oil<00:06:20.840> change<00:06:20.960> and

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380 
can wax you can do an oil change and

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.070 
can wax you can do an oil change and
it's<00:06:21.530> a<00:06:21.650> lot<00:06:22.070> a<00:06:22.370> lot<00:06:22.640> easier<00:06:23.150> and<00:06:23.419> they're<00:06:23.900> very

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
it's a lot a lot easier and they're very

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.840 
it's a lot a lot easier and they're very
simple<00:06:24.650> and<00:06:24.800> the<00:06:24.860> more<00:06:25.010> you<00:06:25.160> use<00:06:25.190> them<00:06:25.550> the

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
simple and the more you use them the

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.980 
simple and the more you use them the
more<00:06:25.880> comfortable<00:06:26.630> you'll<00:06:26.840> be<00:06:27.050> with<00:06:27.320> them

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
more comfortable you'll be with them
