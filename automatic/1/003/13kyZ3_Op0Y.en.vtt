00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.830
 I call only in neuss and 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.270
 while looking for red entry 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.670
 free 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.230
 yes i think so for highway in 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.360
 find Germany is essential 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.400
 right and so no highway but 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.000
 monthly enemy like sophie to the co2 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.950
 Reduction to 95 grams 130 135 grams 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.509
 you currently the standard europe more 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.919
 must be respected but the 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.189
 industry has to come down 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:33.829
 as I said on 95 dr michael year of 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:37.340
 pierburg of k spg minor declared that 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.550
 go and I'm going right now 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.550
 it's 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:01:02.479
 michael hey hello jackie yes my trip 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:04.759
 Red Sea or told me that 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:07.610
 can explain so get there how to make 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:10.100
 We drove approach procedures the 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.399
 So we drive back again so drive 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.399
 large 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.260
 what i know is that a variable one 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.140
 timing system 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.860
 but as honest as how you want 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.370
 do that 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:33.760
 we have such a type of rubber 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.760
 Curls 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.049
 we can make the wind i look big 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.840
 make it small just like the engine 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.179
 needs ok so almost best example we 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.360
 drive with just with a 400 hp 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:48.829
 motor accurate and efficient when you bois 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.679
 Welti fully earned 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.049
 left this is just the most inefficient 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.700
 moment in the moment we would now 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.890
 I drove with the little wickie and me 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.819
 would the great movement understands the 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.829
 what you are doing right now with the 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.299
 Throttle make yes and we then with 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.280
 the active when a throttle 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.259
 he still never got inefficient 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.179
 but still the whole valve away 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.099
 nobody needs the user currently the 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.510
 good to get exactly air he is looking for 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.370
 I generate the same and he has 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.630
 you pulled the tie and 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.549
 trying now but 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.799
 still wanted to take in bodybuilders 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.840
 back in the giant country and christin what he 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:24.110
 with the rubber novella her engine tells her 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.319
 what work on it as if you have a 1.4 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:31.040
 liter motor would make sense so that 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.660
 lab down there we drive down and 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.040
 then I explain the uni 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.560
 forest features I am very excited 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.730
 Michael and there we gumminoppen we 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.730
 So learn very clearly
