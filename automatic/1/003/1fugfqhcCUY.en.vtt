ice fishing tackle box when it comes to
ice<00:00:51.159> fishing<00:00:51.579> a<00:00:51.760> lot<00:00:51.940> of<00:00:52.089> your<00:00:52.360> tackle<00:00:53.290> is

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
ice fishing a lot of your tackle is

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.250 
ice fishing a lot of your tackle is
downsized<00:00:54.190> your<00:00:54.850> hooks<00:00:55.059> are<00:00:55.210> downsized<00:00:55.720> your

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
downsized your hooks are downsized your

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.799 
downsized your hooks are downsized your
rods<00:00:56.860> are<00:00:57.070> downsized<00:00:57.580> and<00:00:58.030> pretty<00:00:58.720> much

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
rods are downsized and pretty much

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.210 
rods are downsized and pretty much
everything<00:00:59.290> and<00:00:59.379> just<00:00:59.439> become<00:00:59.799> smaller

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
everything and just become smaller

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.100 
everything and just become smaller
mostly<00:01:00.580> because<00:01:00.699> the<00:01:01.390> fish<00:01:01.600> are<00:01:01.689> more<00:01:01.839> subtle

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
mostly because the fish are more subtle

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.710 
mostly because the fish are more subtle
you're<00:01:02.710> in<00:01:02.949> a<00:01:03.040> hole<00:01:03.250> that's<00:01:03.430> about<00:01:03.640> a<00:01:03.970> big<00:01:04.449> and
