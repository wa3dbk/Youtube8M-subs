00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.629
 or what is also less here I am 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.270
 again I'm going to do a tutorial today 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.740
 of a song that you're talking about 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:14.160
 there, very popular, it's been a while since 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.500
 after the song took off style 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:22.869
 mariachi with this man 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:25.750
 the sinaloa chapo very little song 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.990
 very very pretty the trumpet introduction 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.930
 she called my attention and 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:36.420
 so the tone in it is a bit 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.420
 difficult the tone but this does not 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.359
 you can touch and if you can not touch it 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:46.140
 they can play it in a tone of fa the tone is 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:48.390
 Fa Sharp Scaled Sharp If Not The 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.300
 they have out there is the one that leads almost 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.570
 all sustained to be all the two 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.579
 sustained 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.950
 already with the 2 obtained we would be touching 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.760
 the key of C sharp 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:04.699
 forgiveness except the sustained yes that is 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.420
 the natural gift and nothing else 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:12.940
 to put sustained the song has 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.940
 sustained the scale with sharp sound 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.750
 and 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.560
 next the chord with the tonic and the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.730
 chord tonic 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.180
 Let's see 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:39.060
 then they are fixed on the bread scale 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.250
 natural would be the same notes so 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.740
 the notes that I give them if they can not 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.910
 to touch is that in sharp fas 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.860
 local around the fa that would be a 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.680
 halftone below the original tone of the 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.730
 song that is being recorded this 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.960
 song then in this case I would 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.300
 I recommend that you practice it in tone 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.040
 sustained because this is good 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.640
 tranship everything not know of all kinds 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.530
 of tones is very is it helps one like 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.660
 trumpeter nothing else not just stay 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.920
 in four or five tone tones 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.230
 common that this happened to me usually and 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.810
 it keeps happening to me or it is recharged it is not 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.690
 some more this tone not touch me 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.420
 I do not touch it very long when it's 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.980
 weird when I have it, they do not touch it anymore 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.340
 mariachis in the bands us with 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.260
 this kind of tones this group because 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.420
 it's true let's play the bass 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.980
 sustained and the song sounds like that the 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:41.440
 introduction starts at the sharp 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.440
 he is still dead 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.120

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:43.460

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:49.700

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:51.150
