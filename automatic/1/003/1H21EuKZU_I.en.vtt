00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 hello today there will be a video about 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.060
 what are we on the phone 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.770
 so many requests on this topic to all 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.530
 for some reason, I wonder what I have 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.719
 in the phone so let's get started so 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.190
 ifhone 5 suits me perfectly 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.900
 your last point 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.940
 the only thing that I ever miss 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.420
 memory but this is another story 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.970
 Today, not about it, and so we turn on 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.099
 saver is the most standard i used to be 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.810
 put my photos then I realized that 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.119
 they don't just get bored like that 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.920
 my phone looks like here on 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.950
 I have everything on the main page 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.170

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.079

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.030
 delete the message camera photo well in general 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.760
 right in the middle of my bottom tape 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.489
 telephone program for finding 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.430
 music shazam google chrome browser 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.520
 because i don't like using 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.199
 safari which costs and folder music 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.420
 which is absolutely empty because u 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.460
 I always lack memory and yaran 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.559
 phone unfortunately I do not download music 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.989
 I don't use anything here soon 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.450
 camera posts and photos well and 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.960

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.380
 I spend time so the first utility folder 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.960
 in this folder everything that was also 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.060

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.729
 further application is an application for us 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.460
 girls emoticons translator posts 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.400

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:01.320
 minaev media sapiens further issue 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:03.630
 This is such a collection I would say everyone 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.450
 possible journals that you can 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.819

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.760

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.799

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.500
 if read it correctly especially in 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:25.049
 This application is not but I like it 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.750
 here that is, the functions of how to pray that it 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.819
 mask there pimple do not know what 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.450
 that defect and that is here in this regard he 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.909
 helps there he world this application with 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.890
 see filters 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:40.409
 just for fun it increases the faces 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.440
 reduces face that is just laugh 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:45.269
 Fishha this application is clear to everyone 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.760
 die deciding so i use 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.099
 the application sometimes afterlight all 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.510
 known photoshop application well i'm it 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.970
 did not love at all 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.329
 also bought for money useless for 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.390
 me all her reflection and this application 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:03.810
 where you can do let's say so double 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.450
 I make pictures for example wherever I can 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.150
 down up down but it's crazy so that 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.489
 That is, it is clear the proposal to do 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.569
 mirror image in my games 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:18.030
 the most popular why i have them most often 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.620
 periodically scan and delete 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.720
 This cost me as soon as I bought 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.609
 phone I rarely play on his buns 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.500
 impossible to play it 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.139
 difference love playing scanwords when 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.530
 nothing to do it collect diamonds and 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:33.629
 no longer for it all sounded the b-class is 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.669
 change the words we just play around with 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:40.169
 friends hands up also played friends and 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:41.910
 fool herself my last ambush so in 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:44.280
 him to play with us ducks on 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.569
 instagram as standard VKontakte and 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.959
 youtube doubles 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.910
 here are the ask.fm insta nozzles the site that is if 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.980
 you do not fit in the frame instagram 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.500
 This application reduces it. 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.900
 really like it the simplest of all and 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.359
 who either saw why I use 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.470
 only them and here are two just my 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.019
 the most frequent 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.109
 applications is this a site or how much 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.810
 here is a huge range of photography on 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:11.549
 which can impose various 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.980
 filters here are simply unrealistic choices 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.760
 any filters and which can 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.299
 buy more 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:22.109
 they are not all cheap but they are all at all 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:24.659
 just awesome that is very very 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.190
 a lot of filters are shorter here is the whole 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:28.720
 the tape I already won 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.960
 how much did she buy me in this business 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.120
 the master and here is the store that you can 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.070
 still buy a huge amount so 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.100
 I still have enough of this to continue 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.200

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.320

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.450
 a huge number of sentences like 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.150
 I have seen others for photoshop and all sorts 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.130
 applications as a game utility in general 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.930
