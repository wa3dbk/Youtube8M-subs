00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.269
 with another update video of the 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.730
 server because there is something to say 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.429
 the service that best time ever again 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.809
 under great reason not really it 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.490
 just is n't fun 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.050
 to run a standard server 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.060
 we think 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.920
 I come across too much correctly 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.600
 about people being planned going 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.119
 to fuck them that sit sperm who 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.189
 go the people to do that go all 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.130
 try crazy things with shaving then 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.350
 all have family and like that 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.079
 we now put a wide it is sir bob 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.200
 but no him aloha lessons will this is 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.120
 a server with factions is where you 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.430
 must make money there in you is one 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.840

 You can't beat Chris and that kind of beat 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.329
 shit 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.719
 but you can often be your own 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.940
 to build 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.850

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.899
 powerd you want to continue 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.539
 but is there anything else in you you must 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.630
 sign up via a message on 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.640

 come up with something how you can contact us 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.479

 website what soon but the we know 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.590
 not sure what you are doing is calling you 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.600
 with a group of four people 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.479
 minimal and a group of 8 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.729
 maximum number of people you go with that group 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.580
 start a faction 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.829
 8 person fashion is a maximum with 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.210
 the group you go as beautiful as possible 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.869
 build affection if you can with the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.360
 group 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.250
 are you going to be the richest and me the one 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.990
 who after a while is the kingdom who has 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.600
 be helped 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.170
 well that would n't be the ones 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.860
 who is rich in a few days 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.810
 no that really goes on for a long time and the 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.170
 come really fight because you can 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.450
 of course attack another camp 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.579
 now you did not cleaver now tnt 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.299
 they cut things like that 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.229
 no but a camp always has the 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.799
 Entrance 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.880
 always wanted is already underground 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.920
 above the ground 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.750
 project a secret entry I do n't understand 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.430
 know but you come in so you can 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.050
 annemans camps as true attacks 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.530
 when the for this a person online 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.580
 is 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.680
 what a person a man you them with 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.900
 six ok opwijk pot 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.140
 live your 50 bucks on it or 20 is it 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.459
 just gives you extra money 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.319
 the reason why we do this in teams is 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.090
 to keep it nice and cozy and the 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.200
 cracks the reason is worldwide 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.300
 the same 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.550
 those even more to have riders 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.040
 the thing which is what built 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.690
 because we don't want a whole fucking 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.760
 ugly once in torrents we want 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.530
 not ugly 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.850
 half trees top trees that are so whole 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.920
 particularly I found this piece of the tree 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.360
 take it away that sat down anyway 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.880
 we don't want that either and then I will go 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.900
 we check the inspector 's choir 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.130
 So it is well beyond gonna devised 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.620
 he thinks yes, but then you too 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.440
 yes if yes here is through elite 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:02.519
 honest i show you eh 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:06.930
 s i'm drink m in all the way on pax user 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.940
 gkn elvis i group put admin on it 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.319
 I can't even do what I do 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.209
 already owns admin 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.340
 but i can take my drink that is and it 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:19.560
 mid April or to normal place 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:22.820
 falter an extra like ban oh me 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.739
 am generally wrong 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.239
 Apparently what a him, an additional 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.489
 is I set the permissions' well not 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.750
 all come just as the one who thinks 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.900
 that he just sits down puts the 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.070
 permissions flow at what we extra 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.739
 can be as admin the 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:43.829
 tension kick role birch and it was that 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.780
 it was that is the only thing we have extra 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.910
 can be as admin the he can be one 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.560
 no game oh change 'we can do it ourselves 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.630
 not to make one 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.030
 neighborhood and ourselves nothing else they can 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.220
 us quickly slash shoot hen we do 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.730
 We can figure out who is selling it and such 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.250
 lots of money 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.000
 because by many forms for whom it 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.400
 farms 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.930
 and that they earn some money shit times 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.440
 we get or buy one via slash 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.440
 space hand 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:14.519
 I can't hope that my we make sense 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.989
 but I can't sell dirt because it 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.060
 is just too easy to get it is 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.880
 only for least what you can sell 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.400
 Well I do not know if such particles 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.229
 carrots and such are already in because as 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.180
 we were not in essence mine 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.250
 okay fee if they each have 12 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.419
 article also in and so you can do well 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:35.039
 make money through a big one 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:39.449
 mistakes but notice is a form 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:43.080
 to destroy in a and who camp 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:45.449
 so what you can do is just the nmi 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.000
 lego we like the shape that is just 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:50.180
 all possible and that is also possible 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.530
 you can bother the emmy with the shape 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.050
 was the only thing I could venture on to 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.270
 the nmi the money you had from the and who 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.580
 that they count things a week chilly 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:03.389
 You know that leap just may chill 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.830
 also what you do now is it and who camps in 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.210
 put lava pots 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.610
 that is also not possible because they have claimed 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.280
 and there are also some rules 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.190
 about where you claim your country 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.190
 because for example there somewhere somewhere 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.380
 you rebuild it at our faction 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.849
 and other fuel for you see we say no 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.949
 can not 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:24.960
 you go a bit further because 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.599
 we want the factions a lot 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.520
 hello k are just very broken 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:30.930
 plus we have to map it between 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.460
 people who aren't just able to take lessons 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.050
 look at what we are now 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.699
 are all doing 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.010
 of course you could also do it 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.599
 sober and stuff like that but we go 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.900
 of course not everything will be greeks 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.919
 because then he betray all our stuff and 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.720
 that is not the intention 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:47.400
 but we will also record as yours 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.669
 land are being raided and things like that 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.280
 it was just a very professional one 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:56.430
 factions euros where you just have one 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.449
 team must survive as a team money 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.580
 must earn if the team must 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:03.060
 cooperate to the enemy team 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:05.039
 overpower as it were and kill 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.509
 that is the whole point that the want 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:09.419
 well then we are still looking for one 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:11.669
 number of people of course because we have 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:13.470
 all our team the gkn or team goes like this 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.389
 don't eat but and have another one 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.159
 team all those with 4 people can still 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:18.509
 4 b and if people still want to 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:20.630
 in fact, should be so happy to contact me 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:20.630
 record 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:26.430
 that is still possible and you don't go like that 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:29.099
 giving up ensures that your team has you 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.070
 and the timon on we say on skype one 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:36.150
 time don't start spamming with your name 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:39.659
 I don't care about that and confirm 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.830
 for a moment that you don't have to mess around 

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:43.620
 is going to build 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.720
 and that you just accept the rules 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.449
 as i prefer not to leave the 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.370
 boast top notch and do n't scam 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:53.100
 and that 's things because we make it 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.090
 hear a very nice faction server 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.030

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.350
 where we just really nice with all his 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.419
 each other can be chilly 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:03.360
 and overpower and become the richest 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:04.560
 from the map of the minecraft world 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.600
 they people don't come the ones that can 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.910
 all follow 4 time web that can then 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:11.040
 just look at that they can see what 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.690
 where we walk what we do 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.430
 go add a 3d option then you can 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:19.620
