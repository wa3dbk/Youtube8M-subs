00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 the water and the blood of all our people 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.160
 ancestors we send what they want 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.809
 these two old ones coming these two 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.969
 tantalites know humans a lot 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.910
 better than anyone else 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:20.609
 and of course much longer 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:23.820
 good evening my name is winston and I am 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.689
 I call georgina we were both born more 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.699
 700 years ago on the island that is found 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.099
 in the heart of the pacific ocean 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.590
 all these years it happened to us 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.850
 meet many human beings who have 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.200
 stolen they killed and destroyed every 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.379
 thing 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.390
 many many times and we left that 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.760
 happen 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.239
 and precisely because of this we have 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.570
 lost all our home marta 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.809
 unfortunately no longer exists where once 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.320
 flowers of all colors bloomed 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.320
 now the head 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.800
 the invitation that once vibrated with the air 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.800
 5 of a thousand varieties of birds 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.950
 now there is only silence where once 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.840
 the forks the creatures of the ocean 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.500
 every form of the game played between the routes 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.320
 life is distinguishing the galapagos la 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.930
 our wonderful home are now little 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.140
 more of a horror film from my dark and 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:30.810
 oily the whole world is nothing but a 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:34.290
 horrid enough dark black and oily all 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.780
 apart from this place but if you don't 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.759
 you will do something to stop them too 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.670
 this way will remain only a stain 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.009
 deserves what is not like a thief who 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.030
 he comes at night and I take away from the earth 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.030
 in what outside 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.040
 and here is like a snake feeding 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.970
 of its own comfortable to survive 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:04.120
 but the triad does not belong to man e 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.190
 that he is a tiny part 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.039
 there was no place to weave the web of 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.260
 life on earth and I am one of the children 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.440
 of the landslide in all of us 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.880
 we share the same breath la 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.490
 fog rising among the green 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.950
 lush of forests coolness 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.550
 the breezes of the rocky mountains the 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:30.670
 scent of the wind after the rain 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.670
 the plants men and he animals 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.470
 what man does not understand and that 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:40.720
 what inflicts on the earth in the end it 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:43.240
 inflicts on itself and when one day 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.000
 will have been destroyed and the animals 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.410
 they will have been crushed or exterminated 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.870
 He will reign on earth man alone 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.460
 then also i 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.950
 it will disappear from the face of the earth 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.830
 well a very thin consolation for him 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.230
 now because all of you will soon perish 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.770
 if you don't decide to defend me against 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.770
 mankind 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.950

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.569
 you made a beautiful full speech 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.849
 of wisdom 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.050
 certainly because the thoughts I gave 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:36.400
 voice 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:39.730
 they were your words exceed whatever 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.300
 Thought and in any case nothing of what I have 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.680
 say 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:46.710
 you can match the years spent with 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.260
 all our dispute 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:55.650
 it was wonderful 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.650
