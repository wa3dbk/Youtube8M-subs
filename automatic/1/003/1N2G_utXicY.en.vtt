00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.140 

also<00:00:26.130> installed<00:00:26.430> underneath<00:00:26.730> you're<00:00:26.970> going

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
also installed underneath you're going

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:38.090 
also installed underneath you're going
to<00:00:27.240> be<00:00:27.330> in<00:00:27.420> okay<00:00:27.779> shape<00:00:36.710> you<00:00:37.710> actually<00:00:37.980> going

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
to be in okay shape you actually going

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.569 
to be in okay shape you actually going
to<00:00:38.160> put<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.489> power<00:00:38.850> steering<00:00:39.090> bracket<00:00:39.660> and

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
to put on the power steering bracket and

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.119 
to put on the power steering bracket and
you<00:00:41.579> as<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.850> could<00:00:41.969> tell<00:00:42.649> this<00:00:43.649> down<00:00:43.890> here

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
you as you could tell this down here

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.799 
you as you could tell this down here
lines<00:00:44.399> up<00:00:44.550> with<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.210> one<00:00:45.420> will<00:00:45.570> line<00:00:45.690> up

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
lines up with this this one will line up

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.840 
lines up with this this one will line up
here<00:00:45.960> with<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.219> so<00:00:47.219> for<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.430> time<00:00:47.610> being

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
here with that so for the time being

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.190 
here with that so for the time being
since<00:00:48.180> everything<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.539> loose<00:00:48.750> you're<00:00:48.989> still

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
since everything is loose you're still

00:00:49.200 --> 00:01:22.440 
since everything is loose you're still
okay

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.399 

now<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.510> reason<00:01:23.810> why<00:01:23.870> I've<00:01:24.020> been<00:01:24.110> tighten

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
now the reason why I've been tighten

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:25.960 
now the reason why I've been tighten
anything<00:01:24.590> up<00:01:24.800> yet<00:01:25.040> to<00:01:25.550> leave<00:01:25.700> everything

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
anything up yet to leave everything

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.060 
anything up yet to leave everything
loose<00:01:26.240> because<00:01:26.720> this<00:01:26.960> is<00:01:27.170> one<00:01:27.500> bolt<00:01:27.770> you<00:01:27.950> will

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
loose because this is one bolt you will

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.530 
loose because this is one bolt you will
not<00:01:28.190> be<00:01:28.310> able<00:01:28.370> to<00:01:28.550> get<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:28.760> you<00:01:28.850> once<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:29.300> power

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
not be able to get to you once the power

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.820 
not be able to get to you once the power
steering<00:01:29.869> is<00:01:30.050> in<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.260> way<00:01:30.350> because<00:01:30.500> the

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
steering is in the way because the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.609 
steering is in the way because the
pulley<00:01:31.119> is<00:01:32.119> much<00:01:32.420> larger<00:01:32.930> so<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:33.320> best<00:01:33.470> thing

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
pulley is much larger so the best thing

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.060 
pulley is much larger so the best thing
to<00:01:33.650> do<00:01:33.830> is<00:01:34.010> to<00:01:34.159> start<00:01:34.490> it<00:01:34.550> by<00:01:34.670> hand<00:01:34.909> here

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
to do is to start it by hand here

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.020 
to do is to start it by hand here
afterward<00:01:37.070> you<00:01:37.190> will<00:01:37.340> be<00:01:37.460> able<00:01:37.520> to<00:01:37.610> tighten<00:01:37.940> it

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
afterward you will be able to tighten it

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.210 
afterward you will be able to tighten it
but<00:01:38.210> you<00:01:38.330> will<00:01:38.540> need<00:01:38.690> a<00:01:38.750> wrench<00:01:39.220> underneath

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
but you will need a wrench underneath

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.770 
but you will need a wrench underneath
the<00:01:40.430> pulley<00:01:40.610> to<00:01:40.790> do<00:01:40.940> it<00:01:41.090> so<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:41.450> best<00:01:41.570> thing<00:01:41.720> to

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
the pulley to do it so the best thing to

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.910 
the pulley to do it so the best thing to
do<00:01:41.869> is<00:01:41.990> get<00:01:42.110> it<00:01:42.200> started<00:01:42.530> now<00:01:42.619> leave

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
do is get it started now leave

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.370 
do is get it started now leave
everything<00:01:43.300> just<00:01:44.300> finger<00:01:44.690> tight<00:01:44.900> because

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
everything just finger tight because

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.780 
everything just finger tight because
everything<00:01:45.920> is<00:01:46.040> going<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.430> need<00:01:46.550> to<00:01:46.640> move

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
everything is going to need to move

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.010 
everything is going to need to move
again<00:01:47.090> once<00:01:47.360> you<00:01:47.420> put<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:47.630> power<00:01:47.810> steering

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
again once you put the power steering

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:57.999 
again once you put the power steering
pump<00:01:48.140> on<00:01:54.399> depending<00:01:55.399> on<00:01:55.490> where<00:01:55.670> your<00:01:57.009> ground

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
pump on depending on where your ground

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.160 
pump on depending on where your ground
wire<00:01:58.220> goes<00:01:58.550> it<00:01:58.789> comes<00:01:58.970> off<00:01:59.119> the<00:01:59.149> back<00:01:59.450> of<00:01:59.720> the

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
wire goes it comes off the back of the

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.170 
wire goes it comes off the back of the
alternator<00:02:00.500> will<00:02:01.310> come<00:02:01.700> through<00:02:01.820> that<00:02:01.970> hole

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
alternator will come through that hole

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.090 
alternator will come through that hole
I've<00:02:02.869> seen<00:02:03.170> some<00:02:03.350> that<00:02:03.470> go<00:02:03.590> here<00:02:03.920> and

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
I've seen some that go here and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.010 
I've seen some that go here and
something<00:02:04.369> to<00:02:04.490> go<00:02:04.580> here<00:02:04.880> so<00:02:05.180> when<00:02:05.630> you<00:02:05.750> took<00:02:05.869> it

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
apart you'll remember which one is

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.249 
apart you'll remember which one is
supposed<00:02:07.550> to<00:02:07.670> go<00:02:07.789> to<00:02:07.850> mine<00:02:08.690> actually<00:02:08.899> went<00:02:09.200> to

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
supposed to go to mine actually went to

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.870 
supposed to go to mine actually went to
