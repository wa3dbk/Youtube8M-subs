don't<00:00:54.840> think<00:00:54.870> actually<00:00:55.140> did<00:00:55.440> they<00:00:56.010> have

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
don't think actually did they have

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.180 
don't think actually did they have
multiplayer<00:00:57.379> no<00:00:58.379> doesn't<00:00:58.739> seem<00:00:58.949> like<00:00:59.100> they

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
multiplayer no doesn't seem like they

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.900 
multiplayer no doesn't seem like they
have<00:00:59.309> multiplayer<00:01:01.219> that<00:01:02.219> would<00:01:02.370> be<00:01:02.489> pretty

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
have multiplayer that would be pretty

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.509 
have multiplayer that would be pretty
freaking<00:01:03.359> awesome<00:01:03.420> if<00:01:03.690> they<00:01:03.809> have<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.519> yeah

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
freaking awesome if they have but yeah

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.899 
freaking awesome if they have but yeah
of<00:01:05.790> course<00:01:06.210> they<00:01:06.390> can't<00:01:06.659> have<00:01:06.930> multiplier

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
of course they can't have multiplier

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:18.350 
of course they can't have multiplier
that's<00:01:08.909> overkill
