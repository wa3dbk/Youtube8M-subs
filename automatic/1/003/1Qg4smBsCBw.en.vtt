but is it cute it's beautiful this may

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.080 
but is it cute it's beautiful this may
not<00:05:26.450> have<00:05:26.720> many<00:05:26.930> extras<00:05:27.590> or<00:05:27.950> it<00:05:28.400> may<00:05:28.610> not<00:05:28.760> be<00:05:29.000> as

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
versatile as the other nindroids but I

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.960 
versatile as the other nindroids but I
see<00:05:32.900> this<00:05:33.110> particular<00:05:33.470> one<00:05:33.770> as<00:05:34.280> taking<00:05:34.850> a

see this particular one as taking a

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.420 
see this particular one as taking a
different<00:05:35.420> approach<00:05:35.720> from<00:05:36.080> the<00:05:36.260> norm<00:05:36.590> this<00:05:37.310> is

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
different approach from the norm this is

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.310 
different approach from the norm this is
more<00:05:37.670> of<00:05:37.760> a<00:05:37.820> display<00:05:38.210> type<00:05:38.480> figure<00:05:38.840> than<00:05:39.110> other

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
more of a display type figure than other

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.830

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
proximately like the original ultimate

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.020 
proximately like the original ultimate
Monica<00:05:53.950> or<00:05:54.950> at<00:05:55.070> least<00:05:55.250> that's<00:05:55.490> what<00:05:55.700> it<00:05:56.000> is

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
Monica or at least that's what it is

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.320 
Monica or at least that's what it is
like<00:05:56.150> for<00:05:56.540> me<00:05:56.690> so<00:05:57.650> while<00:05:57.830> it<00:05:57.980> may<00:05:58.160> seem<00:05:58.580> like<00:05:58.610> it

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
like for me so while it may seem like it

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.450 
like for me so while it may seem like it
does<00:05:59.630> things<00:05:59.930> a<00:06:00.050> little<00:06:00.140> differently<00:06:00.740> or<00:06:01.070> it

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
does things a little differently or it

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.550 
does things a little differently or it
might<00:06:01.670> even<00:06:01.700> fall<00:06:02.150> short<00:06:02.510> as<00:06:02.810> a<00:06:02.870> mentor<00:06:03.410> in

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
might even fall short as a mentor in

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.660 
might even fall short as a mentor in
some<00:06:03.950> pieces<00:06:04.690> just<00:06:05.690> as<00:06:05.870> a<00:06:05.900> figure<00:06:06.500> I<00:06:06.800> think

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:07.670 
some pieces just as a figure I think

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:15.220 
some pieces just as a figure I think
it's<00:06:07.790> brilliant
