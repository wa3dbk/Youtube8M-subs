00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.630
 Now knead three hours 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.480
 at rest 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.860
 of medium values for the sample as 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.870
 I had done before 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.870
 and now we take it out of the mountain 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.660
 i 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.660
 to stretch a little 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.920
 which we are collecting 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.920
 in the middle 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.600
 here 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.250
 I am a little 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.750
 and now we can in this pain unemployed 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.750
 with a little flour 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.009
 and there we leave it 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.009
 [Applause] 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.980
 you wait a little 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.380
 and now 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.730
 another tip of the flour we look like 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.370
 we are here let it rest 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.570
 shadows three goals 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:24.270
 and it will be two or three hours 2 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.270
 now the memories of other dams 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.580
 good happened three hours 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.140
 repose 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.140
 Subtract 3 Science 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.030
 a program appears and now we walk 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.160
 [Music] 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.320
 Y 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.070
 [Applause] 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.070
 when 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.349
 [Applause] 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.920
 it's a complicated job it 's a shame 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.189
 we have to right a little more of 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.189
 flour 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.470
 good 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.410
 if you order a little more we will make a 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.910
 little Japanese 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.910
 until done little more than sand 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.410
 now we tell you 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.960
 ah 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.270
 directly as rice 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.270
 and we have it 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.260
 to this one 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.069
 but we have 240 degrees 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.290
 but we have more or less a base hour 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:20.180
 although we will take off 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.730
 to see how they are going to see how it jumps 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.730
 ah 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.730
 ah 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.340
 let's see the being a fan 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.340
 but 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.300
 to wake up, we have it, ma'am 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.610
 How to say 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.140
 and the inverse 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.140
 in the grid 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.510
 [Music] 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.909
 to 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.030
 the house that not to suffer now that 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.030
 she 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.480
 although I'm a bit weird way 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.060
 because when unmolding and you have seen that 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.680
 follow a bit weird 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.680
 for the king of the loaves 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.800
 to remove
