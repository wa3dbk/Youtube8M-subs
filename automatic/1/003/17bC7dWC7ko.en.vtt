massive<00:00:51.239> loop<00:00:51.539> i<00:00:51.719> guess<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.140> i<00:00:52.170> didn't<00:00:52.440> really

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
massive loop i guess so i didn't really

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.799 
massive loop i guess so i didn't really
have<00:00:52.739> anything<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.610> show<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.879> guys<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.449> very

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
good i guess i did go through a few

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.959 
good i guess i did go through a few
ideas<00:00:58.079> together<00:00:58.469> with<00:00:58.770> hyper<00:00:58.949> Stan<00:00:59.280> which

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
ideas together with hyper Stan which

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.429 
ideas together with hyper Stan which
concluded<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.690> like<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.109> will<00:01:01.350> Carol<00:01:01.850> or<00:01:02.850> a

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:03.439 
concluded of like a will Carol or a

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:06.649 
concluded of like a will Carol or a
version<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.530> home<00:01:04.739> alone<00:01:05.070> or<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:06.150> don't<00:01:06.540> know

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
version of home alone or I don't know

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.960 
version of home alone or I don't know
things<00:01:06.990> like<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.350> basically<00:01:07.970> every

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
things like that basically every

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.580 
things like that basically every
paragraph<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.510> hey<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:09.930> not<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.140> much<00:01:10.380> to

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
paragraph that hey it's not that much to

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.370 
paragraph that hey it's not that much to
do<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.250> we'd<00:01:12.180> rather<00:01:12.390> do<00:01:12.689> something<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.350> little

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
do so we'd rather do something a little

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.469 
do so we'd rather do something a little
bit<00:01:13.890> i<00:01:13.979> can<00:01:14.610> speak<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> little<00:01:14.939> bit<00:01:15.090> more<00:01:15.330> simple

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
bit i can speak a little bit more simple

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.910 
bit i can speak a little bit more simple
i<00:01:15.720> guess<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.350> ended<00:01:16.560> up<00:01:16.680> with<00:01:16.860> something

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
i guess and we ended up with something

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.429 
i guess and we ended up with something
as<00:01:17.549> weird<00:01:18.299> as<00:01:19.189> what<00:01:20.189> was<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.490> there<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:21.439> few

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
as weird as what was that there a few

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.260 
as weird as what was that there a few
things<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.890> can<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:23.490> do<00:01:23.670> during

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
things you can you can do during

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.149 
things you can you can do during
christmas<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.869> think<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.200> 12<00:01:25.530> things<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.979> do

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
christmas to think it's 12 things to do

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.899 
christmas to think it's 12 things to do
during<00:01:26.909> christmas<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.799> the<00:01:28.799> idea<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:29.850> that

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
during christmas and the idea is that

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.580 
during christmas and the idea is that
can<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.180> random<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.659> guess<00:01:30.869> it's<00:01:31.140> kind<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.439> just

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
can I random I guess it's kind of just

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.830 
can I random I guess it's kind of just
made<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:32.040> entertain<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.970> little<00:01:33.090> bit<00:01:33.329> kind

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840
