00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.480
 late several parts we will do it with the 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.480
 eye because no 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:15.970
 we shape it and then we trace where 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.970
 the nose is going to go and the other 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.480
 i 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.560
 i 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.950
 we draw the snout and the shapes 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.950
 general 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.019
 it's good to start drawing clear because 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:50.289
 surely there will be corrections and 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:53.739
 as we are more secure we can 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.739
 darken the line 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.670
 to create the effect of some hairs 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.100
 whites we can use the technique of 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:14.119
 old ballpoint pen without ink with which 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.119
 we scratch the paper 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.870
 after that we started to shade 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.220
 so 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.570
 we detail the eye the external part of the 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:40.329
 iris as well as the pupil are going to go very 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:44.100
 black but in the pupil we leave a 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.100
 reflex to give it some life 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.560
 the iris can be shaded with hatches 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.560
 toward the center 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.450
 in the top part the shadow would fall 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.450
 of the eyelid 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.380
 I'm using a pen with 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.960
 lace 3 sees the complete list of 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.310
 You can find materials in the 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.310
 information under the video 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:41.900
 here you can start to see that the effect 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.770
 of the white hairs that we created 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.770
 scratching the paper 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.600
 two 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.990
 little by little we shadow and do the 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.990
 mane 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.620
 ah 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.390
 it is good to do the shading in the 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:17.720
 where you want them to go 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:20.810
 the hairs on the chin will be very clear 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.040
 and will have a shadow down to 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.040
 help us stand out 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.610
 two 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.530
 the hair does not go one by one but 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.970
 which is formed as by tufts so 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.970
 I will try to give that effect 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.129
 ah 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.930
 We can give you more detail and also 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.900
 darken the shadow so that it still stands out 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.439
 plus 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.439
 two 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:31.540
 if you want to clear some strands what 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.540
 you can do with the moldable eraser 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.490
 two 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.770
 like it looks a little stiff the 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.530
 so I'm going to blur it with the 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.699
 brush and taking advantage also I will give 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.699
 some shadows with this 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:57.840
 so you're better off if you liked it 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.840
 please give him the
