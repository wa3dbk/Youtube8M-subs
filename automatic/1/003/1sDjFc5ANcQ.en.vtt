five<00:01:35.300> or<00:01:35.330> ten<00:01:35.630> minutes<00:01:35.929> depending<00:01:36.080> on<00:01:36.440> how<00:01:36.560> it

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
five or ten minutes depending on how it

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:44.410 
five or ten minutes depending on how it
goes<00:01:41.020> all<00:01:42.020> right<00:01:42.409> we're<00:01:42.619> back<00:01:43.149> it's<00:01:44.149> been<00:01:44.299> out

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
goes all right we're back it's been out

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.320 
goes all right we're back it's been out
five<00:01:44.690> minutes<00:01:45.310> as<00:01:46.310> you<00:01:46.459> can<00:01:46.580> see<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:46.940> temp<00:01:47.179> on

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
five minutes as you can see the temp on

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.180 
five minutes as you can see the temp on
it<00:01:47.479> it's<00:01:47.630> about<00:01:47.780> up<00:01:47.929> to<00:01:48.049> 450<00:01:48.409> but<00:01:48.770> that's<00:01:48.950> kind

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
it it's about up to 450 but that's kind

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.760 
it it's about up to 450 but that's kind
of<00:01:49.220> false<00:01:49.490> advertising<00:01:50.209> because<00:01:50.539> it<00:01:50.780> the

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
of false advertising because it the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.319 
of false advertising because it the
flame<00:01:52.039> so<00:01:52.280> hot<00:01:52.460> in<00:01:52.579> there<00:01:52.700> right<00:01:52.789> now<00:01:52.850> but

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
flame so hot in there right now but

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:54.219 
flame so hot in there right now but
we're<00:01:53.450> going<00:01:53.479> to<00:01:53.630> start<00:01:53.840> shutting<00:01:54.140> it<00:01:54.200> down

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
we're going to start shutting it down

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.910 
we're going to start shutting it down
and<00:01:54.820> get<00:01:55.820> it<00:01:55.939> ready<00:01:56.060> for<00:01:56.210> smoke<00:01:56.689> so<00:01:57.110> first<00:01:57.770> put

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
and get it ready for smoke so first put

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.580 
and get it ready for smoke so first put
that<00:01:58.130> on<00:01:58.509> but<00:01:59.509> more<00:01:59.840> importantly<00:02:00.350> we're<00:02:00.560> going

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
that on but more importantly we're going

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.789 
that on but more importantly we're going
to<00:02:00.740> close<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.399> vent<00:02:01.640> down<00:02:01.789> here<00:02:02.530> stop<00:02:03.530> the

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
to close the vent down here stop the

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.420 
to close the vent down here stop the
airflow<00:02:04.579> from<00:02:05.299> coming<00:02:05.659> in<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.840> bottom<00:02:06.430> and

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
airflow from coming in the bottom and

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.940 
airflow from coming in the bottom and
we're<00:02:07.549> going<00:02:07.670> to<00:02:07.700> start<00:02:08.179> about<00:02:08.450> right<00:02:10.329> there

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
we're going to start about right there

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.410 
we're going to start about right there
until<00:02:12.950> we<00:02:13.070> can<00:02:13.190> regulate<00:02:13.549> it<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.030> we'll<00:02:14.209> close

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
until we can regulate it and we'll close

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.140 
until we can regulate it and we'll close
it<00:02:14.450> up<00:02:14.690> way<00:02:14.989> more<00:02:15.230> than<00:02:15.440> that<00:02:15.590> but<00:02:15.859> for<00:02:15.890> now

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
it up way more than that but for now

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.880 
it up way more than that but for now
what<00:02:17.150> I<00:02:17.180> could<00:02:17.420> keep<00:02:17.690> some<00:02:17.750> airflow<00:02:18.380> through

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
what I could keep some airflow through

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.259 
what I could keep some airflow through
but<00:02:19.840> not<00:02:20.840> too<00:02:21.049> little<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.440> not<00:02:21.530> too<00:02:21.680> much<00:02:22.269> and

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
but not too little and not too much and

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.380 
but not too little and not too much and
out<00:02:23.390> on<00:02:23.510> top<00:02:23.780> I'm<00:02:24.440> going<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.590> keep<00:02:24.829> this<00:02:25.010> thing

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
out on top I'm going to keep this thing

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.319 
out on top I'm going to keep this thing
basically<00:02:26.390> wide<00:02:26.780> open<00:02:28.209> until<00:02:29.209> the

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
basically wide open until the

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:30.880 
basically wide open until the
temperature<00:02:29.750> regulates<00:02:30.170> so<00:02:30.410> it<00:02:30.470> should<00:02:30.680> stay

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
temperature regulates so it should stay

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.880 
temperature regulates so it should stay
on<00:02:30.920> this<00:02:31.130> about<00:02:31.280> for<00:02:32.019> five<00:02:33.019> to<00:02:33.260> seven<00:02:33.560> minutes

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
on this about for five to seven minutes

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.250 
on this about for five to seven minutes
and<00:02:34.070> it<00:02:34.190> should<00:02:34.370> get<00:02:34.640> down<00:02:34.880> around<00:02:35.260> between

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
and it should get down around between

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:44.050 
and it should get down around between
150<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.280> 200<00:02:42.459> okay<00:02:43.459> it's<00:02:43.640> been<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:43.820> couple

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
150 and 200 okay it's been a couple

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.170 
150 and 200 okay it's been a couple
minute<00:02:44.420> tour<00:02:44.690> back<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:46.040> it<00:02:46.519> came<00:02:46.760> back<00:02:47.120> down

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
minute tour back and it came back down

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.319 
minute tour back and it came back down
to<00:02:47.690> 250<00:02:48.230> pretty<00:02:48.500> quickly<00:02:48.739> so<00:02:49.120> we're<00:02:50.120> gonna<00:02:50.209> get

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
to 250 pretty quickly so we're gonna get

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:51.970 
to 250 pretty quickly so we're gonna get
the<00:02:50.450> inside<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:50.900> this<00:02:51.019> thing<00:02:51.230> set<00:02:51.560> up<00:02:51.590> like<00:02:51.829> we

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
the inside of this thing set up like we

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.849 
the inside of this thing set up like we
need<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:52.340> for<00:02:52.609> long<00:02:52.819> smoke<00:02:53.410> you<00:02:54.410> can<00:02:54.560> see<00:02:54.739> it's

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:54.859 
need to for long smoke you can see it's

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:56.560 
need to for long smoke you can see it's
nice<00:02:55.250> simmer<00:02:55.609> down<00:02:55.730> there<00:02:56.060> so<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.359> first

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
nice simmer down there so the first

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.770 
nice simmer down there so the first
thing<00:02:56.690> we're<00:02:56.810> going<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:56.959> do<00:02:58.389> put<00:02:59.389> this<00:02:59.510> place

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
thing we're going to do put this place

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.110 
thing we're going to do put this place
header<00:03:00.019> back<00:03:00.260> in<00:03:01.989> and<00:03:02.989> put<00:03:03.199> it<00:03:03.320> in<00:03:03.410> feet<00:03:03.680> up<00:03:04.120> and

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
header back in and put it in feet up and

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.259 
header back in and put it in feet up and
always<00:03:05.419> put<00:03:05.750> this<00:03:06.519> third<00:03:07.519> triangle<00:03:08.030> at<00:03:08.180> the

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
always put this third triangle at the

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.390 
always put this third triangle at the
back<00:03:08.479> of<00:03:08.660> this<00:03:08.889> because<00:03:09.889> the<00:03:09.979> heats<00:03:10.190> going<00:03:10.310> to

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
back of this because the heats going to

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.090 
back of this because the heats going to
come<00:03:10.549> up<00:03:10.699> the<00:03:10.790> back<00:03:10.820> and<00:03:11.799> that's<00:03:12.799> the<00:03:12.919> hottest

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
come up the back and that's the hottest

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.129 
come up the back and that's the hottest
part<00:03:13.519> to<00:03:13.669> disperse<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.269> heat<00:03:14.299> you<00:03:14.750> put<00:03:15.019> that

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:15.139 
part to disperse the heat you put that

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:16.960 
part to disperse the heat you put that
there<00:03:15.410> so<00:03:15.650> it<00:03:15.769> separates<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.549> heat<00:03:16.729> on<00:03:16.850> this

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
there so it separates the heat on this

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.939 
there so it separates the heat on this
side<00:03:17.180> and<00:03:17.269> this<00:03:17.359> side<00:03:17.419> so<00:03:17.780> this<00:03:17.930> side<00:03:18.079> doesn't

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:18.949 
side and this side so this side doesn't

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.909 
side and this side so this side doesn't
get<00:03:19.040> too<00:03:19.160> hot<00:03:19.340> back<00:03:19.519> here<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:21.500> then<00:03:21.620> as<00:03:21.769> an

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:21.919 
get too hot back here and then as an

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:35.650 
get too hot back here and then as an
added<00:03:22.010> bonus<00:03:22.340> I<00:03:32.769> put<00:03:33.769> a<00:03:33.799> water<00:03:34.040> pan<00:03:34.310> in<00:03:34.519> this<00:03:35.510> is

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
added bonus I put a water pan in this is

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.530 
added bonus I put a water pan in this is
totally<00:03:35.989> optional<00:03:36.169> for<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:36.620> big<00:03:36.799> green<00:03:37.010> egg<00:03:37.040> I

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
totally optional for the big green egg I

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.819 
totally optional for the big green egg I
prefer<00:03:38.540> to<00:03:38.660> do<00:03:38.810> it<00:03:38.930> it<00:03:39.109> creates<00:03:39.440> a<00:03:39.530> little<00:03:39.709> bit

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
prefer to do it it creates a little bit

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.670 
prefer to do it it creates a little bit
more<00:03:40.070> moisture<00:03:40.340> so<00:03:41.019> that<00:03:42.019> just<00:03:42.199> sits<00:03:42.380> right<00:03:42.440> on

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
more moisture so that just sits right on

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.090 
more moisture so that just sits right on
there

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
there

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.430 
there
and<00:03:44.470> then<00:03:45.470> you're<00:03:45.590> going<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:45.739> put<00:03:45.919> the<00:03:47.440> grate

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
and then you're going to put the grate

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.199 
and then you're going to put the grate
right<00:03:48.470> on<00:03:48.799> top<00:03:49.009> of<00:03:49.040> that<00:03:49.250> so<00:03:49.519> that's<00:03:49.639> setup<00:03:50.060> you

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
right on top of that so that's setup you

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.379 
right on top of that so that's setup you
see<00:03:50.389> how<00:03:50.449> that<00:03:50.540> is<00:03:51.759> that<00:03:52.759> meat<00:03:52.970> sits<00:03:53.209> right<00:03:53.329> on

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
see how that is that meat sits right on

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:55.120 
see how that is that meat sits right on
top<00:03:53.540> of<00:03:53.720> it<00:03:53.930> it's<00:03:54.229> going<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.410> drop<00:03:54.620> juice<00:03:54.949> down

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
top of it it's going to drop juice down

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:01.289 
top of it it's going to drop juice down
in<00:03:55.340> there<00:03:55.900> create<00:03:56.900> a<00:03:56.959> lot<00:03:57.109> of<00:03:57.229> moisture<00:03:57.590> so

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.509 

let's<00:04:02.299> shut<00:04:02.540> this<00:04:02.690> down

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
let's shut this down

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.090 
let's shut this down
we're<00:04:04.519> going<00:04:04.639> to<00:04:04.729> I'm<00:04:04.940> going<00:04:05.000> to<00:04:05.150> dial<00:04:05.359> it<00:04:05.600> in

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
we're going to I'm going to dial it in

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.229 
we're going to I'm going to dial it in
about<00:04:07.100> like<00:04:07.340> I'd<00:04:07.519> have<00:04:07.669> it<00:04:07.850> when<00:04:07.940> I'm<00:04:08.060> cooking

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
about like I'd have it when I'm cooking

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.020 
about like I'd have it when I'm cooking
a<00:04:08.660> long<00:04:09.290> brisket<00:04:09.829> maybe<00:04:10.100> a<00:04:10.190> little<00:04:10.459> more<00:04:10.669> open

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
a long brisket maybe a little more open

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.430 
a long brisket maybe a little more open
so<00:04:11.239> you<00:04:12.199> can<00:04:12.350> see<00:04:12.590> it's<00:04:12.769> barely<00:04:13.070> crack<00:04:13.459> there

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
so you can see it's barely crack there

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.140 
so you can see it's barely crack there
and<00:04:15.440> on<00:04:15.709> the<00:04:15.829> bottom<00:04:16.220> here<00:04:16.250> we're<00:04:16.639> gonna<00:04:16.759> crack

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
and on the bottom here we're gonna crack

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.740 
and on the bottom here we're gonna crack
it<00:04:17.180> down<00:04:17.479> to<00:04:17.750> just<00:04:17.959> a<00:04:18.169> couple<00:04:18.199> millimeters

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
it down to just a couple millimeters

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:26.400 
it down to just a couple millimeters
I'll<00:04:20.750> do<00:04:20.959> just<00:04:21.400> about<00:04:22.400> like<00:04:22.790> that<00:04:23.030> for<00:04:23.300> now

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.129 

that's<00:04:27.410> a<00:04:27.530> nice<00:04:27.680> smoke<00:04:28.040> coming<00:04:28.370> out<00:04:28.990> I'm<00:04:29.990> going

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
that's a nice smoke coming out I'm going

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.749 
that's a nice smoke coming out I'm going
to<00:04:30.199> let<00:04:30.380> that<00:04:30.560> run<00:04:30.770> about<00:04:31.040> ten<00:04:31.310> minutes<00:04:31.460> and

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
to let that run about ten minutes and

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:36.129 
to let that run about ten minutes and
we'll<00:04:31.850> see<00:04:32.030> what<00:04:32.150> the<00:04:32.240> temperature<00:04:32.389> is<00:04:32.660> at<00:04:35.139> all

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
we'll see what the temperature is at all

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:38.530 
we'll see what the temperature is at all
right<00:04:36.380> the<00:04:37.280> temperature<00:04:37.759> is<00:04:37.910> stabilized

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
right the temperature is stabilized

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.499 
right the temperature is stabilized
around<00:04:38.900> 200<00:04:39.560> it's<00:04:39.800> been<00:04:39.949> going<00:04:40.160> about<00:04:40.509> 10

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:41.509 
around 200 it's been going about 10

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:45.040 
around 200 it's been going about 10
minutes<00:04:42.639> now<00:04:43.639> the<00:04:43.699> worst<00:04:44.330> thing<00:04:44.600> you<00:04:44.720> can<00:04:44.870> do

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
minutes now the worst thing you can do

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.110 
minutes now the worst thing you can do
on<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.350> big<00:04:45.560> green<00:04:45.770> egg<00:04:45.949> is<00:04:46.280> put<00:04:46.729> the<00:04:46.910> meat<00:04:47.090> on

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
on the big green egg is put the meat on

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.969 
on the big green egg is put the meat on
when<00:04:47.509> the<00:04:47.630> temperature<00:04:47.660> has<00:04:48.169> not<00:04:48.380> stabilized

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
when the temperature has not stabilized

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:50.469 
when the temperature has not stabilized
because<00:04:49.759> when<00:04:49.910> you<00:04:50.030> put<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.300> meat<00:04:50.419> on

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
because when you put the meat on

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.320 
because when you put the meat on
especially<00:04:51.320> let<00:04:52.280> me<00:04:52.370> know<00:04:52.490> this<00:04:52.759> is<00:04:52.910> a<00:04:52.940> 15
