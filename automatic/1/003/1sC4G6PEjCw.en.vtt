00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:11.370
 I said addicts from the old fields and opened 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.469
 here today I have one more dam of the day 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.719
 and this time it 's not giving you some 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.869
 tips on how to use the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.199
 defibrillator is from the doctor is obviously 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.830
 so I felt that for these tips of the day 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.230
 better map is for him it would be the subway, right? 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.349
 since it is one because it has enough and goes 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.759
 so although it is very annoying it is in the 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.950
 how is it that way? 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.700
 so first I'll give you here soon 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.160
 The main tip of the epilator is that you 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.739
 You have to hold your finger so much for 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.750
 Reliving how much to kill is an enemy. 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.500
 with the definition of pain then for example 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.600
 several times is the buga revai neither you 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.149
 stay there trying to relive several times 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.460
 clicking if you hold you 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.579
 you will probably have more chances of 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.980
 revive this guy and also if you 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.110
 hold the fibrillated pain in the enemy 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.970
 You'll surely kill 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.280
 What I see a lot of people doing is 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.810
 trying to apply several times both for 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.210
 relive how much to kill 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.310
 then this tip is very important even 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.009
 if you are to kill the risk of fibrillation 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.310
 pain only sure of filadoro face with 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.100
 sure he will die and also if you 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.140
 is revived a friend and you see that you are 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.020
 taking a little while you're just sure 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.250
 sure as well you're going to revive 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.030
 he is not 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.670
 and another tip is that you can 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.110
 revive several friends who have right there 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.540
 in a single place 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.490
 just holding and dragging that neither you 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.490
 Are you seeing there you can do this with 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.770
 basically it 's who a lot of people get 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.049
 they are all nearby it 's obvious 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.810
 so you get to go often 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.229
 five consecutive setbacks only holding and 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.540
 dragging on the subway is for sure and 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.570
 map that has the most then it is there 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.700
 tip is also more a little tip too 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.680
 is that for example you see that you have a 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.229
 dead enemy it has been for some time 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.200
 waiting for a rave and to avoid you 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.180
 lose rave is often what I 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.180
 I is for example reaching desired 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.849
 today fibril pain before and I am already clicking 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.310
 until I get close, right? 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.329
 Sometimes the guy is almost 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.310
 backup 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:26.650
 so you have to walk right behind you 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.569
 will end up losing relives and what I 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.150
 I do this, it just comes more 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.609
 near and when I see that already there 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.450
 a good distance I 'm already holding up 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:39.159
 Reviewing the guy many times I can is 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.579
 more than for example arrived in the face and 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:45.849
 after I try to revive so stay there 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:48.489
 The tip tries to try to revive there is like this 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:51.280
 What do you think is good distance? 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.349
 from revava mac pro where are you going 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.049
 not too far, not so far. 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.719
 close and also remembering that you do not 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.819
 It can be on top of the face to revive. 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.349
 many times you go get it will not 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.569
 thing that revives if you are 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.299
 directly on top of you you have to 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.849
 it's a little bit behind it's a 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:13.629
 little in front other side both 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:16.930
 and then you're gonna come from the rave on it with a 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:18.669
 A little more is there, right? 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.889
 A lot of people already know this, but also 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:22.690
 It's worth remembering, and remembering. 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:25.000
 also that it can not have anything on top of 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.889
 car you want to live can not 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.079
 have no vehicle no car 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:31.889
 basically I think that's it and also 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:35.109
 can not have a doctor's packet and can not 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:36.159
 devil can not have one to one pec 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.930
 Support 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.819
 I know a lot of people know this more 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.560
 also a lot of people do not know but it 's always 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.989
 good to remember, right? 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.229
 so this is these two top tips 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.540
 That's it and hold the button when you go. 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:52.689
 revived then kill and also when you 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.840
 to see several friends close to you 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:58.359
 hold the finger and the race you will be well 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.069
 efficient as on this map and the subway by 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:02.560
 example and that's it 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:05.139
 I know the tip was pretty basic though. 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.810
 It's hint of the day I'm trying there is 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:09.699
 more and more than the useful ones for you 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.159
 so I know a lot of people did not know 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:14.019
 a lot of things here to help 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:17.409
 disclosure I would like to ask you 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:20.259
