00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.939
 my mother and sister came to see me 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.829
 in the morning she was at school and in the 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.990
 afternoon the make-up 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:10.759
 I must say that I did some beautiful tricks 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.390
 I'm really happy a girl too 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:16.429

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.319
 I'm happy I spent a beautiful time 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:20.780
 day apart from the shitty time 

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:23.149
 because it was raining I don't tell you the cold 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.380
 I had my sweatshirt suit or ears 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.899
 when they saw me coming more you 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.670
 I told her I have ears 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.639
 so it was really a day 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.829

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:35.539

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.369

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.549

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.859

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.829
 photographic became of Thursday seems to me 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.959
 went very well 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.689
 Thursday I remember it went a lot 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:05.779
 well they are consequence there was a lot of 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:08.780
 little tricks and I had made a promise 

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:11.480
 but I didn't keep it because I spent it 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.930
 5 euros to the company brevity because I have 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.130
 spent 5 and I took these shearers 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.910
 I'll show you them 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.370
 I took the most skin fox news indeed 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.010
 make up that I have and the concealer 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.870
 in the monkey I feel good about it is 03 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.970
 that a little darker would also seem 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.739
 covering enough I didn't want to 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.560
 spend more because I promised 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.150
 and this month I bought it I have nothing 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.180
 made to keep the promise 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.780
 as you see enough covering for 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.390
 in short, being a cream is a bit dark 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.610
 bones afraid it is a little dark but the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.810
 second was too light 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:59.019
 and then I took a lip pencil there 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.200
 pliner la 07 cut pink I have to say that 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:06.250
 a very pretty rose is placed with me 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:09.160
 lipstick is really really beautiful 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.280
 then the other night I was the gardenia 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.569
 and took or not the card is neither mine where 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.030
 I went I don't remember you are there 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:21.700
 gardenia or another store in Siena 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:26.140
 now I have no recollection, however, taken 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:29.500
 this lives the maybelline and of the 170 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.200
 now it's a shimmer but I swear to you 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.079
 too too too good because 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.549
 being so bright despite being one 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:42.910
 shimmer I put it with the king's mat 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:47.560
 the wild and it's fabulous to watch how it is 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.690
 nice saw rose bright beautiful ok 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.750
 and then they gave me something 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.150
 this as the gardenia says only figure 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:59.170
 he gave me some cartier samples 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:01.480
 I'm trying and there are these two 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:05.680
 none one for the skin one for the 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.209
 both of the lancom's circles are in my eye 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.010
 trying and I have to say that I'm finding myself 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:13.600
 really well they unfortunately have prices 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:15.250
 exaggerated gave me the bottom looks 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.320
 it was very sweet but I told him 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.720
 I always spend a lot of money by 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.110
 some decent samples gave me 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.420
 the 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.990
 foundation of the run with this is the ma 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:30.420
 here ultra natural matt the 0 3 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.880
 it's 30 ml of product so I have to say 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.180
 there are several less I am tried 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:40.130
 the other night not overly opaque 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.840
 the orange is very good 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.210
 enlighten you yellow sold to several 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.130
 people and I have to say how exceptional it is 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.640
 you see it's not very over the top 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:53.970
 covering however is a gift tutor then 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:57.660
