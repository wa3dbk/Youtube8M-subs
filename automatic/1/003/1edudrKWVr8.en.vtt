00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.120
 hello friends we meet at the famous 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:11.870
 lake the jump with the professional team 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.140
 of okuma fishing to show you each 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.170
 one of the characteristics that they have 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:22.160
 your teams here on the lake the jump is 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:25.250
 famous for good catches and for 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.210
 that you need a good team 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.660
 I personally have here 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.730
 20 years working on it one of the 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.610
 teams that I liked the most is the 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.610
 I know because he has many 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.280
 characteristics that we will explain 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.309
 of how to use them well let's start 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.250
 tell them a little about people so 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:51.550
 general who starts fishing has to use 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.129
 these teams because because they see a 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:58.540
 little complicated and when making a 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:01.420
 a day of fishing have complications 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.370
 because they do not know what this is, what is this 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.390
 what is this and this 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.600
 because that is normally used 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:14.440
 They used to make a kind of reel 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.780
 this okuma has this equipment that is 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.220
 the lightest is one of the most powerful 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:24.670
 gives you distance , which is still a 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:29.759
 advantage over the fisherman helps you 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:33.490
 do any kind of casting you put on 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.250
 trolleys that are heavy or light 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.039
 then in here each one of the 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.920
 reels have control how are we going to 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:45.460
 make each one of the 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.220
 good reels usually no no we 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.070
 we read the manual of each of 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.150
 the reels and the okuma has one of the 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.710
 simpler systems that there may be 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:00.600
 and it gives you a huge advantage then 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.970
 each of the reels has a 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.940
 special mechanism here as you can see 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.460
 is in zeros when casting with 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.030
 that style if you do not know it anymore they 're going to 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:16.650
 see if the bad habit is to use the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:20.040
 brake instead of using the track if this 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.430
 what you mean they have numbers of 0 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.480
 al 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.170
 9 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.600
 what you are going to do is manipulate the 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.060
 knob that has here 1 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:40.370
 two 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:43.490
 45 and you strip the first without moving any 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.010
 another mechanism you do the casting and already 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.040
 You can see which one is best for you 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.280
 accommodates fishing conditions as 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.710
 we know they vary from the now then what 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.620
 we have to do is adjust no 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.480
 simply okuma mechanisms has 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.360
 that which is the simplest in what 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.390
 I like a lot, it 's light and 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.209
 can stretch all day with him not 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.670
 you feel the weight in your hand the reel 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:16.080
 completely this helps you 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:20.030
 to continue in the contest and that mechanism 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:23.489
 it's one of the easiest because here 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.670
 you control the shot 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:30.420
 This is the brake when you use a lot of weight 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:34.319
 with a bear and this is the drac that puts him 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.190
 according to him the most you want so 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.220
 other 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:43.050
 we have occupy has another other system 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:46.319
 which is a simpler than this and the 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.300
 control has it completely outside 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.540
 that you do not have to do any 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.120
 nothing movement this is the easiest and 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.299
 has some mechanisms has the same 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.540
 mechanism that the other this is like for 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.890
 if you use it forgiveness if you use it in water 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.049
 sweet or in salty water 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.930
 when you go to the estuaries because it's very 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.390
 common to all Mexicans we like to go 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.090
 to the estuaries for the clouds the bass and 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.640
 all of that you can normally go here in 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.310
 the jump we use monofilament floro 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.840
 coal a lot of people like to use the 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.419
 true 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.090
 if another salad as we say here in 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.919
 mexico that these any of these 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.710
 reels can work with any 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.810
 type of line what I recommend is 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.680
 monofilament because usually 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:37.070
 I handle what is what is the tacuary 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.740
 and the only carbon to be in 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.289
 depth we keep talking about what 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.589
 What are the 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:47.680
 the by casting with closed reels that 

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:51.120
 they usually say here by casting 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.460
 system that is very important for 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.090
 when you come to the side like the jump 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:00.360
 you will be fishing from 10 to 14 hours 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:03.960
 all day then at the end of the day 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:07.410
 your hands you have the hand of the tiger beats 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.560
 and okuma has this reel that is 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:14.070
 you cover it very easily you do not have 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:18.449
 to be caught or something this is very 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:23.669
 very compact simple you can move it to 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:27.660
 craving if the lever is helps you so much 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:30.510
 because it's very big and you're going to help 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:34.260
 much the speed that the reel has 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:37.590
 it's very much the fast is very important 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:40.760
 in seconds it puts you in position and the 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:43.220
 second is ready for the next the 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.790
 when you do more than 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:49.250
 thousand shots a day here in the jump and 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:51.850
 remember that you have the opportunity to 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:55.970
 have different sizes of fishing 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:58.540
 then here what helps you much 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:01.280
 size and this one has a peculiarity 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:04.220
 It has a fiber brake system 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:08.360
 carbon that stops any kind 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:10.640
 of press and also helps you play a lot 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.450
 with what is the fun of fishing 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:17.870
 has is the fish as you keep it in is 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:22.370
 and this one will have to have you play what 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:25.070
 you can move for 170 g and as I say 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:28.280
 Do not be afraid to use if you normally 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:31.100
 you used spinning I recommend you 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.620
 use the bike casting because it's going 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:37.310
 to help a lot will take away the tired 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:39.530
 with these you can use all day and not 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.520
 you can and you do not get tired the same is the same 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:45.240
 that with a spin 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:48.060
 Well, I invite you to come here 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:52.949
 the jump bring okos brains in the 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:56.250
 illicit staircase storm the serrano one 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:07:01.169
 a variety of equipment can see them 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:03.870
 in okuma fishing dotcom you can not 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:06.950
 communicate with him or it will not be the jump 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:12.670
 dotcom and then 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:18.160
