action<00:00:59.870> spectacle<00:01:00.440> stuff<00:01:00.649> with<00:01:00.920> the

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
action spectacle stuff with the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.040 
action spectacle stuff with the
characters<00:01:02.059> and<00:01:02.239> just<00:01:02.359> making<00:01:02.600> sure<00:01:02.719> that<00:01:02.870> you

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
characters and just making sure that you

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.070 
characters and just making sure that you
cared<00:01:03.769> about<00:01:03.859> laughed<00:01:04.580> with<00:01:04.879> felt<00:01:05.570> for<00:01:05.840> the

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
cared about laughed with felt for the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.870 
cared about laughed with felt for the
characters<00:01:06.650> because<00:01:06.890> that<00:01:07.040> was<00:01:07.460> everything

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
characters because that was everything

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.469 
characters because that was everything
and<00:01:08.840> so<00:01:09.259> I<00:01:09.670> think<00:01:10.670> that<00:01:10.759> was<00:01:10.909> a<00:01:10.970> hardest<00:01:11.270> part

of<00:01:11.540> it<00:01:11.659> was<00:01:11.750> just<00:01:11.930> making<00:01:12.170> sure<00:01:12.200> that<00:01:12.470> you<00:01:12.979> know
