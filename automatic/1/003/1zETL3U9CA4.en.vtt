00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.130 
going to do a 250 thousand dollar
tournament<00:03:29.209> 250<00:03:30.209> a<00:03:30.239> quarter<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.930> million

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
tournament 250 a quarter of a million

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.320 
tournament 250 a quarter of a million
dollars<00:03:31.620> so<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.220> first<00:03:32.519> place<00:03:32.880> if<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.150> think

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
dollars so the first place if you think

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.370 
dollars so the first place if you think
about<00:03:33.390> it<00:03:33.540> four<00:03:33.750> hundred<00:03:34.019> thousand<00:03:34.350> dollars

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
about it four hundred thousand dollars

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.720 
about it four hundred thousand dollars
which<00:03:34.709> is<00:03:34.739> about<00:03:35.010> forty<00:03:35.310> percent<00:03:35.519> of<00:03:35.670> the

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
which is about forty percent of the

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.670 
which is about forty percent of the
prize<00:03:35.910> pool<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:36.750> if<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:36.930> take<00:03:37.110> that<00:03:37.140> same

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
prize pool so if you take that same

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.490 
prize pool so if you take that same
formula<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.640> look<00:03:38.970> at<00:03:39.060> this<00:03:39.180> 250<00:03:40.080> thousand

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
formula and look at this 250 thousand

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.539 
formula and look at this 250 thousand
dollars<00:03:40.799> you're<00:03:41.250> looking<00:03:41.549> at<00:03:42.500> potentially<00:03:43.549> I

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
dollars you're looking at potentially I

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.479 
dollars you're looking at potentially I
think<00:03:45.269> as<00:03:45.390> a<00:03:45.420> player<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:45.750> would<00:03:46.110> make

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
think as a player you would make

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.340 
think as a player you would make
potentially<00:03:47.489> like<00:03:47.989> $25,000<00:03:48.989> something<00:03:49.260> like

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
potentially like $25,000 something like

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.740 
potentially like $25,000 something like
that<00:03:49.560> that's<00:03:50.250> you<00:03:50.549> like<00:03:51.120> that's<00:03:51.360> that's

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
that that's you like that's that's

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.800 
that that's you like that's that's
livable<00:03:52.709> wage<00:03:52.920> like<00:03:53.280> when<00:03:53.430> parasite<00:03:53.910> said<00:03:54.660> on

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
livable wage like when parasite said on

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.720 
livable wage like when parasite said on
the<00:03:54.900> sticks<00:03:55.170> like<00:03:55.680> it's<00:03:55.920> not<00:03:56.070> really<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.370> career

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
the sticks like it's not really a career

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.500 
the sticks like it's not really a career
because<00:03:56.880> there's<00:03:57.150> not<00:03:57.269> enough<00:03:57.330> money

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
because there's not enough money

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.840 
because there's not enough money
available<00:03:57.930> that's<00:03:58.769> good<00:03:59.130> money<00:03:59.340> that<00:03:59.670> means

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
available that's good money that means

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.150 
available that's good money that means
you<00:04:00.480> know<00:04:00.600> the<00:04:00.870> money<00:04:01.110> from<00:04:01.380> cod<00:04:01.560> champs<00:04:02.040> I

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
you know the money from cod champs I

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.800 
you know the money from cod champs I
mean<00:04:02.459> cod<00:04:02.640> champs<00:04:02.970> eighth<00:04:03.120> place<00:04:03.540> an

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
mean cod champs eighth place an

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.380 
mean cod champs eighth place an
individual<00:04:04.560> player<00:04:04.830> gets<00:04:05.400> like<00:04:05.610> I<00:04:05.850> think<00:04:06.239> cod

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
individual player gets like I think cod

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.759 
individual player gets like I think cod
champs<00:04:06.690> eighth<00:04:06.810> place<00:04:07.110> is<00:04:07.290> still<00:04:07.470> thirty

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
champs eighth place is still thirty

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.199 
champs eighth place is still thirty
thousand<00:04:08.190> dollar<00:04:08.310> payout<00:04:08.640> or<00:04:08.820> thirty<00:04:09.030> two

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
thousand dollar payout or thirty two

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.910 
thousand dollar payout or thirty two
thousand<00:04:09.660> so<00:04:10.019> each<00:04:10.200> player<00:04:10.440> on<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.620> team<00:04:10.680> gets

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
thousand so each player on the team gets

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.170 
thousand so each player on the team gets
like<00:04:11.040> eight<00:04:11.190> thousand<00:04:11.610> I<00:04:11.670> mean<00:04:11.790> that's<00:04:11.910> huge

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
like eight thousand I mean that's huge

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.060 
like eight thousand I mean that's huge
like<00:04:12.540> that's<00:04:12.750> big<00:04:13.049> money<00:04:13.079> and<00:04:13.530> so<00:04:13.829> you<00:04:13.920> think

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
like that's big money and so you think

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.130 
like that's big money and so you think
about<00:04:14.239> $250,000<00:04:15.239> tournament<00:04:15.690> you<00:04:15.959> could

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
about $250,000 tournament you could

do for $250,000 tournaments or one large
one<00:04:38.460> and<00:04:38.880> maybe<00:04:39.630> cod<00:04:39.960> champs<00:04:40.289> isn't<00:04:40.500> gonna

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590

boy Tommy eSports from the sticks EU he

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.430 
boy Tommy eSports from the sticks EU he
put<00:04:45.330> up<00:04:45.419> a<00:04:45.479> video<00:04:45.630> about<00:04:45.810> this<00:04:46.110> and<00:04:46.350> was

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
put up a video about this and was

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.320 
put up a video about this and was
talking<00:04:46.710> about<00:04:46.919> the<00:04:47.370> speculation<00:04:48.090> that<00:04:48.210> there

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
talking about the speculation that there

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.270 
talking about the speculation that there
was<00:04:48.449> only<00:04:48.539> a<00:04:48.660> three<00:04:48.930> year<00:04:49.229> contract<00:04:49.770> with

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
was only a three year contract with

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.010 
was only a three year contract with
activision<00:04:50.970> for<00:04:51.120> cod<00:04:51.270> champs<00:04:51.600> and<00:04:51.690> maybe<00:04:51.870> they

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
activision for cod champs and maybe they

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.629 
activision for cod champs and maybe they
won't<00:04:52.169> do<00:04:52.380> it<00:04:52.530> and<00:04:52.680> that's<00:04:53.009> why<00:04:53.130> MLG<00:04:53.580> is

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
won't do it and that's why MLG is

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:54.890 
won't do it and that's why MLG is
getting<00:04:53.910> ahead<00:04:54.090> of<00:04:54.150> the<00:04:54.330> bucket<00:04:54.660> and<00:04:54.690> they're

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
getting ahead of the bucket and they're

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.840 
getting ahead of the bucket and they're
starting<00:04:55.080> out<00:04:55.320> with<00:04:55.410> a<00:04:55.470> $250,000<00:04:56.430> tournament

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
starting out with a $250,000 tournament

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.490 
starting out with a $250,000 tournament
going<00:04:57.300> into<00:04:57.720> whatever<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:58.110> next<00:04:58.229> Call<00:04:58.470> of

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
going into whatever the next Call of

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.200 
going into whatever the next Call of
Duty<00:04:58.830> is<00:04:58.949> and<00:04:59.220> then<00:04:59.639> maybe<00:04:59.849> they'll<00:05:00.120> have

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
Duty is and then maybe they'll have

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.510 
Duty is and then maybe they'll have
