 with the best possible 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:12.499
 some games arrived without much fanfare and go unnoticed amid the noise 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:13.269

 the salton continued to getty aileen brito series that was born in the 90s to 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.780
 friend and was very successful in Europe 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.559
 just like the previous episode 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.920
 the classic mechanical gamer and shooting games fine 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.370
 viewed from above 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.450
 and adds cutting-edge sounds and graphics turbocharged by the bike when

 guiness deliveries the same as that to ford 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.590
 players control the soldiers in an intercepted spacecraft and 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.890
 aliens and need to fight to survive save active ammunition

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.730

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.950
 to win it is necessary to move cautiously and explore the corridors and alleys 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:18.650
 of the ship 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.540
 in search of extra ammunition the medical kits to recover the energy 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.970
 is higher and the hero is driven with the two analogue levers one for 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:30.539
 walk 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.760
 another to point the gun 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.920
 there are several types of projectiles to shoot items to assist the player in 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.000
 your journey 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.230
 but a limited amount and even though the game stores seeing ammunition 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.439
 money was not easy and it is always better to buy upgrades for armor 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.439
 and for the arsenal of more bullets to disperse 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.899
 This is a game that demands cold blood and shooting precision. 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.389
 in steel the aliens are the same as the first game 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.969
 with its appearance as a space cockroach 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:15.679
 dignity plus the ransom 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:19.949
 in the south the ones emitted by the creatures are disturbing and already in the first match 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:23.549
 players to paranoid with any noise and vibrations in the 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.359
 control 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:28.999
 it is possible to prepare for combats both by the sound of creatures if 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:29.819
 approaching 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.849
 how much for the marks kill us in the corner of the screen 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.059
 unfortunately 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:35.680
 psalm for service 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.469
 the enemies did not present 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.469
 lots of variety 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:57.199
 the camera remains at the top of the screen during a portion 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:01.730
 occasionally low to show a platform 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.810
 or stand behind the heroes 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.810
 crossing a narrow aisle increasing the tension 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:08.909
 It's been five days. 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:13.319
 but which gives a welcome freshness to the classic style of arenopolis assault 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.079
 the game gets more fun when played with a friend 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.269
 and offers many challenges for the most dedicated players 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:22.980
 still in the sun 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.840
 takes the space saga of the end of 71 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.579
 a step forward 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.510
 the new camera angles 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.890
 we hit on the right time to widen the attention of certain training passages 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:35.899
 finish quickly 

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:39.839
 and lacked a greater diversity of enemies but for the game and 

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:42.159
 exclusively downloaded 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:44.060
 the level of assault finish 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.060
 would go easy for 20 days 

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:50.509
 It was good
