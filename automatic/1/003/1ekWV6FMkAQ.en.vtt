00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
modulus flip clip upgrade pack here's

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.610 
modulus flip clip upgrade pack here's
the<00:00:05.069> front<00:00:05.279> of<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.430> box<00:00:09.200> here's<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.320> back<00:00:10.469> of

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
the front of the box here's the back of

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:18.859 
the front of the box here's the back of
the<00:00:10.710> box<00:00:11.840> let's<00:00:12.840> open<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:16.820> first<00:00:17.820> we<00:00:18.180> have<00:00:18.390> the

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
the box let's open it first we have the

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.870 
the box let's open it first we have the
instructions<00:00:24.230> the<00:00:25.230> flip<00:00:25.500> clip<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:26.010> basically

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
instructions the flip clip is basically

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.929 
instructions the flip clip is basically
shoe<00:00:27.779> clips<00:00:28.140> put<00:00:28.949> together<00:00:29.130> with<00:00:29.490> this<00:00:29.640> little

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
shoe clips put together with this little

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.569 
shoe clips put together with this little
piece<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:31.439> one<00:00:31.619> comes<00:00:31.830> with<00:00:31.980> two<00:00:32.279> twelve

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
piece and this one comes with two twelve

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.330 
piece and this one comes with two twelve
dart<00:00:32.850> clips<00:00:33.530> so<00:00:34.530> when<00:00:34.680> you're<00:00:34.800> out<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.040> ammo

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
dart clips so when you're out of ammo

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.920 
dart clips so when you're out of ammo
you<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.700> easily<00:00:35.880> switch<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.510> clips<00:00:36.750> like

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
you can easily switch the clips like

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.560 
you can easily switch the clips like
this<00:00:40.370> this<00:00:41.370> one<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.610> called<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.910> flip<00:00:42.149> clip<00:00:42.420> like

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
this this one is called a flip clip like

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.010 
this this one is called a flip clip like
this<00:00:44.840> you<00:00:45.840> take<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.230> out<00:00:46.379> flip<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.750> put<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.870> in

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
this you take it out flip it put it in

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.310 
this you take it out flip it put it in
it<00:00:49.829> also<00:00:50.010> comes<00:00:50.430> with<00:00:50.550> 24<00:00:51.149> darts<00:00:51.690> since

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
it also comes with 24 darts since

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.139 
it also comes with 24 darts since
there's<00:00:52.590> two<00:00:52.649> clips<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.520> can<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:53.969> take

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
there's two clips and you can just take

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.260 
there's two clips and you can just take
it<00:00:54.180> apart<00:00:54.449> like<00:00:54.600> this

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:11.880

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.460 

so<00:01:12.890> that's<00:01:13.070> all<00:01:13.220> 24<00:01:13.670> tarts<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:14.350> then<00:01:15.350> you

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
so that's all 24 tarts and then you

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.219 
so that's all 24 tarts and then you
simply<00:01:15.830> just<00:01:16.040> put<00:01:16.400> it<00:01:16.490> in<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:16.730> modulus<00:01:20.229> you

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
simply just put it in the modulus you

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:41.920 
simply just put it in the modulus you
can<00:01:21.440> shoot<00:01:21.620> it<00:01:27.280> then<00:01:28.280> you<00:01:28.520> just<00:01:38.440> so<00:01:40.540> if<00:01:41.540> you<00:01:41.750> do

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
can shoot it then you just so if you do

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.080 
can shoot it then you just so if you do
not<00:01:42.140> want<00:01:42.350> to<00:01:42.470> use<00:01:42.590> to<00:01:42.710> flip<00:01:42.860> flip<00:01:43.100> part<00:01:43.369> you

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
not want to use to flip flip part you

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.580 
not want to use to flip flip part you
can<00:01:44.300> just<00:01:44.450> use<00:01:44.570> them<00:01:44.690> separately<00:01:45.140> like<00:01:45.170> this

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
can just use them separately like this

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.359 
can just use them separately like this
they<00:01:46.550> come<00:01:46.729> apart<00:01:47.890> here's<00:01:48.890> what<00:01:49.070> it<00:01:49.190> looks

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
they come apart here's what it looks

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:50.910 
they come apart here's what it looks
like<00:01:49.550> with<00:01:49.820> one<00:01:50.119> clip<00:01:50.450> in<00:01:50.630> it

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
like with one clip in it

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:59.980 
like with one clip in it

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.820 

I<00:02:01.479> think<00:02:02.479> this<00:02:02.600> is<00:02:02.720> a<00:02:02.750> really<00:02:03.049> cool<00:02:03.229> pack<00:02:03.500> and

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
I think this is a really cool pack and

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.770 
I think this is a really cool pack and
it<00:02:04.280> would<00:02:04.400> be<00:02:04.549> good<00:02:04.700> for<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:04.940> striking<00:02:05.450> defend

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
it would be good for a striking defend

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.440 
it would be good for a striking defend
water<00:02:06.049> cuz<00:02:06.400> striking<00:02:07.400> defend<00:02:07.729> is<00:02:07.880> like<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.090> big

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
water cuz striking defend is like a big

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.500 
water cuz striking defend is like a big
ground<00:02:08.899> war<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:10.220> there's<00:02:10.399> lots<00:02:10.700> of<00:02:10.850> treating

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
ground war and there's lots of treating

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.900 
ground war and there's lots of treating
and<00:02:11.720> reloading<00:02:12.319> units<00:02:12.590> so<00:02:12.890> that's<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.730> end<00:02:13.850> of

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
and reloading units so that's the end of

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.430 
and reloading units so that's the end of
the<00:02:14.000> video<00:02:14.270> bye<00:02:14.600> youtube<00:02:14.959> thanks<00:02:15.319> for
