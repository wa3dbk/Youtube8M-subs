the blood into the pulmonary artery the
pulmonary<00:01:44.020> artery<00:01:44.649> takes<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.579> blood<00:01:45.849> to<00:01:46.450> the

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
pulmonary artery takes the blood to the

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.490 
pulmonary artery takes the blood to the
lungs<00:01:47.130> where<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.729> blood<00:01:48.969> gets<00:01:49.329> purified<00:01:50.200> and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
lungs where the blood gets purified and

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.350 
lungs where the blood gets purified and
the<00:01:51.280> blood<00:01:51.520> gets<00:01:51.909> the<00:01:52.090> oxygen<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:53.530> become

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
the blood gets the oxygen to become

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.600 
the blood gets the oxygen to become
oxygenated<00:01:55.360> blood<00:01:58.229> after<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.860> exchange<00:02:00.399> of

gases takes place in the lungs the

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.569 
gases takes place in the lungs the
oxygenated<00:02:04.509> blood<00:02:04.899> is<00:02:05.110> then<00:02:05.560> carried<00:02:05.979> by<00:02:06.520> the

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
oxygenated blood is then carried by the

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.990 
oxygenated blood is then carried by the
pulmonary<00:02:07.420> vein<00:02:07.929> and<00:02:08.229> it<00:02:09.160> returns<00:02:09.579> to<00:02:09.819> the

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
pulmonary vein and it returns to the

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.900 
pulmonary vein and it returns to the
heart<00:02:10.269> so<00:02:10.959> that<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.769> heart<00:02:12.069> can<00:02:12.370> send<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.879> to

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
heart so that the heart can send it to

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.750 
heart so that the heart can send it to
different<00:02:13.540> parts<00:02:13.870> of<00:02:14.019> the<00:02:14.079> body<00:02:14.760> the

pulmonary<00:03:11.410> artery<00:03:12.130> in<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.090> lungs<00:03:13.540> the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
pulmonary artery in the lungs the

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.119 
pulmonary artery in the lungs the
exchange<00:03:14.500> of<00:03:14.709> gases<00:03:14.919> takes<00:03:15.459> place<00:03:15.790> then<00:03:16.750> the

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
exchange of gases takes place then the

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.190 
exchange of gases takes place then the
oxygenated<00:03:18.129> blood<00:03:18.489> comes<00:03:19.180> back<00:03:19.569> to<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.959> heart

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
oxygenated blood comes back to the heart

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.250 
oxygenated blood comes back to the heart
from<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.859> lungs<00:03:21.099> at<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:22.090> left<00:03:22.810> auricle

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
from the lungs at the left auricle

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.719 
from the lungs at the left auricle
through<00:03:24.069> the<00:03:24.310> pulmonary<00:03:24.669> vein<00:03:25.590> this

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:26.729 
through the pulmonary vein this

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:29.670 
through the pulmonary vein this
oxygenated<00:03:27.729> blood<00:03:28.000> then<00:03:28.419> enters<00:03:28.570> the<00:03:29.079> left

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
oxygenated blood then enters the left

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.390 
oxygenated blood then enters the left
ventricle<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:31.660> left<00:03:31.690> ventricle<00:03:32.650> pumps<00:03:32.979> it

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
ventricle the left ventricle pumps it

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.020 
ventricle the left ventricle pumps it
into<00:03:33.670> an<00:03:33.790> artery<00:03:34.299> called<00:03:34.840> iota<00:03:35.590> which<00:03:36.489> carries

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
into an artery called iota which carries

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.069 
into an artery called iota which carries
it<00:03:37.239> to<00:03:37.510> all<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:38.140> parts<00:03:38.500> of<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.860> body<00:03:39.780> so<00:03:40.780> that

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
it to all the parts of the body so that

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.260 
it to all the parts of the body so that
was<00:03:41.379> the<00:03:41.680> circulation<00:03:42.400> of<00:03:42.579> blood<00:03:42.610> and<00:03:43.260> shot
