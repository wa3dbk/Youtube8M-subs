00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.100 
that street let's go to see how it is
today<00:02:12.190> I'll<00:02:12.700> say<00:02:13.000> that<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.480> line<00:02:13.660> today<00:02:13.900> is

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
today I'll say that the line today is

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.479 
today I'll say that the line today is
going<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.290> be<00:02:14.410> fairly<00:02:14.650> representative<00:02:15.220> what

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
going to be fairly representative what

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.790 
going to be fairly representative what
you<00:02:15.610> might<00:02:15.760> expect<00:02:16.319> throughout<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.500> rest<00:02:17.680> of

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
you might expect throughout the rest of

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.729 
you might expect throughout the rest of
the<00:02:17.890> season<00:02:18.099> going<00:02:18.970> into<00:02:19.420> you<00:02:20.290> know<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.500> fall

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
the season going into you know the fall

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.030 
the season going into you know the fall

slow season is over so this is where
we're<00:02:26.650> at<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:26.920> it's<00:02:27.099> going<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.280> probably<00:02:27.400> get

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
we're at and it's going to probably get

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.949 
we're at and it's going to probably get
worse<00:02:27.790> than<00:02:28.030> this<00:02:28.120> actually<00:02:28.510> another<00:02:28.660> think

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
worse than this actually another think

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.290 
worse than this actually another think
about<00:02:29.170> it<00:02:29.290> but<00:02:29.920> today<00:02:30.069> it's<00:02:30.610> not<00:02:30.819> bad<00:02:31.090> it's

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
about it but today it's not bad it's

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.320 
about it but today it's not bad it's

street all the way down there to the
aladdin<00:02:40.870> theater<00:02:40.900> so<00:02:41.860> that's<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.819> break<00:02:43.030> I<00:02:43.299> just

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
aladdin theater so that's a break I just

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.289 
aladdin theater so that's a break I just
noticed<00:02:44.049> there's<00:02:44.140> no<00:02:44.319> rope<00:02:44.500> drop<00:02:44.739> for<00:02:45.150> for<00:02:46.150> the

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
noticed there's no rope drop for for the

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.789 
noticed there's no rope drop for for the
Hollywood<00:02:46.450> Boulevard<00:02:47.019> there's<00:02:47.530> usually<00:02:47.620> a

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
Hollywood Boulevard there's usually a

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.250 
Hollywood Boulevard there's usually a
rope<00:02:47.950> drop<00:02:48.130> right<00:02:48.340> about<00:02:48.519> where<00:02:48.700> I'm<00:02:48.790> standing

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
rope drop right about where I'm standing

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.450 
rope drop right about where I'm standing
which<00:02:50.260> is<00:02:50.380> odd

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
which is odd

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.110 
which is odd
anyway<00:02:52.240> so<00:02:52.300> this<00:02:52.720> line<00:02:52.990> is<00:02:53.200> probably<00:02:54.120> these

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
anyway so this line is probably these

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.570
