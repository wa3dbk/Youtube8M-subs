00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
I don't need different whole lot I

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.070 
I don't need different whole lot I
thought<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.370> was<00:02:35.489> you<00:02:36.390> know<00:02:36.480> I<00:02:36.510> thought<00:02:36.750> sunday

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
thought it was you know I thought sunday

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.320 
thought it was you know I thought sunday
maybe<00:02:37.680> we<00:02:37.920> had<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.070> little<00:02:38.340> more<00:02:38.550> jump<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.209> they

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
maybe we had a little more jump and they

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.449 
maybe we had a little more jump and they
did<00:02:39.570> Friday<00:02:40.350> they<00:02:40.530> had<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.680> little<00:02:40.950> more<00:02:41.130> jump

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
did Friday they had a little more jump

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.770 
did Friday they had a little more jump
than<00:02:41.610> we<00:02:41.730> did<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:42.000> thought<00:02:42.180> tonight<00:02:42.300> our<00:02:42.540> jump

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
than we did I thought tonight our jump

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.470 
than we did I thought tonight our jump
was<00:02:42.959> fairly<00:02:43.260> even<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:43.920> was<00:02:44.100> even<00:02:45.090> game<00:02:45.360> the

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
was fairly even and it was even game the

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.690 
was fairly even and it was even game the
whole<00:02:45.600> way<00:02:45.780> but<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:46.080> didn't<00:02:46.350> differ<00:02:46.530> much<00:02:46.800> it's

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
whole way but it didn't differ much it's

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.550 
whole way but it didn't differ much it's
it's<00:02:48.000> hard<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.480> get<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:48.720> each<00:02:48.840> other's<00:02:49.140> net<00:02:49.320> for

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
it's hard to get to each other's net for

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.830 
it's hard to get to each other's net for
sure<00:02:49.739> and<00:02:50.120> both<00:02:51.120> teams<00:02:51.330> are<00:02:51.480> real<00:02:51.660> good

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
sure and both teams are real good

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.320 
sure and both teams are real good
defensively
