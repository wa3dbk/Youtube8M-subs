 It is a guy called Ultra Dash Motor 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.710
 I think that it is a motor using that mini feed, but it seems like this 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:26.689
 This Plaleruw 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.829

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.309
 It is fixed 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:34.690
 So you dissolve the hunter's body like this 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:37.719

 It is Germany completion with 2 tips 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:24.710
 It is a translation to say that it is not good 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.320
 Urutaruga 4 little or actually was instead placed on the motor has become how fast

 This time by saying yes to put the ultra-dash motor to Thomas of the plastic is 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.350
 Mimashi was

00:05:07.799 --> 00:05:10.219
 I want to 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.970

 I am using a soldering iron to do it in a little ne ocean 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:26.910
 Because there is a danger 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:30.410
 When I went now, I was close to my child but I was treated when there were not hundreds of children near me 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.410
 I think that is because there is good 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.820
 that's all 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.390
