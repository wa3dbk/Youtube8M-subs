00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.650 

okay<00:00:09.500> so<00:00:09.559> first<00:00:10.190> I<00:00:10.520> find<00:00:11.090> the<00:00:11.240> valve<00:00:11.450> on<00:00:11.600> the

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
okay so first I find the valve on the

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.510 
okay so first I find the valve on the
ball<00:00:11.870> I<00:00:13.539> place<00:00:14.539> it<00:00:14.780> to<00:00:15.559> where<00:00:15.740> I'm<00:00:15.860> aiming<00:00:16.039> I'm

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
ball I place it to where I'm aiming I'm

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.519 
ball I place it to where I'm aiming I'm
gonna<00:00:16.880> basically<00:00:17.660> hit<00:00:17.900> the<00:00:17.990> ball<00:00:18.170> right<00:00:18.380> on

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
gonna basically hit the ball right on

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.359 
gonna basically hit the ball right on
the<00:00:18.619> valve<00:00:19.029> then<00:00:20.029> you<00:00:20.630> obviously<00:00:20.750> pick<00:00:21.369> the

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
the valve then you obviously pick the

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:23.710 
the valve then you obviously pick the
side<00:00:22.580> of<00:00:22.759> the<00:00:22.820> goal<00:00:23.000> or<00:00:23.179> if<00:00:23.300> you<00:00:23.420> want<00:00:23.570> to<00:00:23.630> go

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
side of the goal or if you want to go

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.179 
side of the goal or if you want to go
right<00:00:23.900> at<00:00:24.019> the<00:00:24.109> keeper<00:00:24.410> or<00:00:24.529> wherever<00:00:24.830> you

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
right at the keeper or wherever you

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:26.890 
right at the keeper or wherever you
position<00:00:25.640> the<00:00:25.820> border<00:00:26.210> to<00:00:26.449> where<00:00:26.630> you<00:00:26.689> want<00:00:26.839> to

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
position the border to where you want to

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.349 
position the border to where you want to
strike<00:00:27.140> it<00:00:27.349> then<00:00:27.740> usually<00:00:28.070> I<00:00:28.130> take<00:00:28.339> four<00:00:29.060> steps

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
strike it then usually I take four steps

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.080 
strike it then usually I take four steps
back<00:00:29.630> and<00:00:30.160> then<00:00:31.160> usually<00:00:31.369> slightly<00:00:31.820> to<00:00:32.060> the

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
back and then usually slightly to the

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.270 
back and then usually slightly to the
right<00:00:32.470> then<00:00:33.470> you<00:00:33.620> kind<00:00:33.829> of<00:00:33.890> see<00:00:34.070> where<00:00:34.220> the

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
right then you kind of see where the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.840 
right then you kind of see where the
keeper<00:00:34.610> is<00:00:34.730> and<00:00:35.060> pretty<00:00:35.840> much<00:00:35.930> focus<00:00:36.350> here

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
keeper is and pretty much focus here

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.799 
keeper is and pretty much focus here
where<00:00:37.850> you<00:00:37.940> kind<00:00:38.120> of<00:00:38.149> want<00:00:38.300> to<00:00:38.360> put<00:00:38.510> the<00:00:38.600> ball

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
and obviously when you're running a keep

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:42.369 
and obviously when you're running a keep
focused<00:00:41.300> on<00:00:41.420> on<00:00:41.660> the<00:00:41.750> point<00:00:41.960> that<00:00:42.020> you<00:00:42.140> want<00:00:42.230> to

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
I do pick my spot and run up to the ball

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.000 
I do pick my spot and run up to the ball
is<00:00:46.489> I<00:00:46.640> hit<00:00:46.879> the<00:00:46.940> ball<00:00:47.180> pretty<00:00:47.480> much<00:00:48.469> as<00:00:48.649> flat<00:00:48.890> as

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
is I hit the ball pretty much as flat as

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.310 
is I hit the ball pretty much as flat as
possible<00:00:49.070> with<00:00:49.579> no<00:00:49.609> spin<00:00:50.030> open<00:00:50.989> your<00:00:51.140> foot

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
possible with no spin open your foot

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.590 
possible with no spin open your foot
writer<00:00:51.590> the<00:00:52.070> main<00:00:52.250> thing<00:00:52.550> is<00:00:52.699> you<00:00:53.449> hit<00:00:53.539> the

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
writer the main thing is you hit the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.150 
writer the main thing is you hit the
ball<00:00:53.870> exactly<00:00:54.109> where<00:00:54.530> you<00:00:54.590> want<00:00:54.739> it<00:00:54.829> to<00:00:54.949> right

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
ball exactly where you want it to right

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.549 
ball exactly where you want it to right
in<00:00:55.280> the<00:00:55.370> middle<00:00:55.550> you<00:00:56.030> try<00:00:56.239> and<00:00:56.329> hit<00:00:56.449> it<00:00:56.559> so

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
in the middle you try and hit it so

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.439 
in the middle you try and hit it so
you're<00:00:57.829> not<00:00:57.920> curling<00:00:58.340> the<00:00:58.429> ball<00:00:58.609> or<00:00:58.820> hitting

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
you're not curling the ball or hitting

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.180 
you're not curling the ball or hitting
it<00:00:59.690> like<00:00:59.929> a<00:00:59.989> kind<00:01:00.440> of<00:01:00.500> they<00:01:00.710> say<00:01:00.890> now<00:01:01.039> as<00:01:01.100> a

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
it like a kind of they say now as a

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.329 
it like a kind of they say now as a
knuckleball<00:01:01.399> you<00:01:02.769> want<00:01:03.769> to<00:01:03.859> get<00:01:03.980> the<00:01:04.070> flight

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
knuckleball you want to get the flight

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.640 
knuckleball you want to get the flight
as<00:01:04.489> where<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:05.660> ball<00:01:05.870> is<00:01:06.020> moving<00:01:06.230> over<00:01:06.440> and

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
as where the ball is moving over and

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.930 
as where the ball is moving over and
make<00:01:06.740> it<00:01:06.860> difficult<00:01:07.070> for<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:07.370> keeper<00:01:07.640> I<00:01:07.700> think

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
make it difficult for the keeper I think

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.970 
make it difficult for the keeper I think
with<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.720> follow-through<00:01:09.020> you<00:01:09.560> want<00:01:09.740> to<00:01:09.830> kind

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
with the follow-through you want to kind

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.430 
with the follow-through you want to kind
of<00:01:10.190> keep<00:01:10.850> your<00:01:10.970> body<00:01:11.180> kind<00:01:11.540> of<00:01:11.690> up<00:01:11.870> tall<00:01:12.140> and

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
of keep your body kind of up tall and

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.350 
of keep your body kind of up tall and
not<00:01:13.370> let<00:01:13.550> it<00:01:13.580> slide<00:01:13.850> because<00:01:13.970> your<00:01:14.210> foot

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
not let it slide because your foot

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.270 
not let it slide because your foot
usually<00:01:14.780> makes<00:01:15.440> the<00:01:15.590> ball<00:01:15.740> spin<00:01:15.980> so<00:01:16.100> if<00:01:16.160> you're

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
usually makes the ball spin so if you're

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.520 
usually makes the ball spin so if you're
keeping<00:01:16.520> your<00:01:16.580> whole<00:01:16.760> body<00:01:16.970> in<00:01:17.150> line<00:01:17.380> then<00:01:18.380> you

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
keeping your whole body in line then you

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.840 
keeping your whole body in line then you
get<00:01:18.710> that<00:01:18.860> straight<00:01:19.190> follow-through<00:01:19.670> which

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
get that straight follow-through which

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.790 
get that straight follow-through which
will<00:01:20.180> put<00:01:20.330> no<00:01:20.480> spin<00:01:20.750> on<00:01:20.870> the<00:01:20.960> ball<00:01:21.140> hopefully

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
will put no spin on the ball hopefully

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.350 
will put no spin on the ball hopefully
then<00:01:21.980> the<00:01:22.400> ball<00:01:22.580> will<00:01:22.700> go<00:01:22.790> exactly<00:01:22.940> where<00:01:23.240> you

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
then the ball will go exactly where you

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.510 
then the ball will go exactly where you
want<00:01:23.540> it<00:01:23.630> to<00:01:23.780> it<00:01:23.930> can<00:01:24.080> go<00:01:24.830> left<00:01:25.040> right<00:01:25.340> it

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
want it to it can go left right it

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.540 
want it to it can go left right it
depends<00:01:26.060> where<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.360> wind<00:01:26.570> and<00:01:26.870> and<00:01:27.520> with<00:01:28.520> the

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
depends where the wind and and with the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.890 
depends where the wind and and with the
air<00:01:28.760> moves<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.180> ball<00:01:29.330> because<00:01:29.630> it's<00:01:29.780> not

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
air moves the ball because it's not

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.480 
air moves the ball because it's not
spinning<00:01:30.140> and<00:01:30.440> hopefully<00:01:31.070> it<00:01:31.160> goes<00:01:31.310> in

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
spinning and hopefully it goes in

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.370 
spinning and hopefully it goes in
exactly<00:01:31.730> where<00:01:32.090> you<00:01:32.180> want<00:01:32.330> it<00:01:32.390> to<00:01:32.510> the<00:01:33.020> problem

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
exactly where you want it to the problem

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.540 
exactly where you want it to the problem
where<00:01:33.470> it<00:01:33.560> goes<00:01:33.620> wrong<00:01:33.830> you<00:01:33.980> need<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:34.250> hit<00:01:34.520> it

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
where it goes wrong you need to hit it

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.330 
where it goes wrong you need to hit it
in<00:01:34.730> such<00:01:34.970> a<00:01:35.000> precise<00:01:35.390> point<00:01:35.660> where<00:01:36.070> you<00:01:37.070> hit<00:01:37.220> to

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
in such a precise point where you hit to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.710 
in such a precise point where you hit to
right<00:01:37.580> dead<00:01:37.850> in<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.090> center<00:01:38.300> with<00:01:38.480> a<00:01:38.540> ball

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
right dead in the center with a ball

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.870 
right dead in the center with a ball
doesn't<00:01:39.140> move<00:01:39.800> with<00:01:40.040> you<00:01:40.190> it<00:01:40.310> is<00:01:40.400> slightly<00:01:40.670> to

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
doesn't move with you it is slightly to

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.040 
doesn't move with you it is slightly to
the<00:01:40.910> left<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.240> ball's<00:01:41.450> going<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:41.720> start

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
the left the ball's going to start

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.080 
the left the ball's going to start
curling<00:01:42.230> so<00:01:42.620> it<00:01:42.740> doesn't<00:01:43.040> work<00:01:43.190> I<00:01:43.430> think<00:01:43.850> for

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
curling so it doesn't work I think for

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.670 
curling so it doesn't work I think for
me<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.390> most<00:01:44.420> important<00:01:44.990> thing<00:01:45.110> is<00:01:45.230> is<00:01:45.470> when

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
me the most important thing is is when

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.290 
me the most important thing is is when
you<00:01:45.800> stood<00:01:45.980> over<00:01:46.130> a<00:01:46.280> free-kick<00:01:46.460> whether<00:01:47.000> it<00:01:47.180> be

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
you stood over a free-kick whether it be

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.840 
you stood over a free-kick whether it be
the<00:01:47.510> first<00:01:47.750> or<00:01:47.960> the<00:01:48.020> last<00:01:48.050> minute<00:01:48.530> is<00:01:48.650> you<00:01:49.460> you

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
the first or the last minute is you you

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.640 
the first or the last minute is you you
100%<00:01:50.270> commit<00:01:50.750> to<00:01:50.870> what<00:01:51.020> you're<00:01:51.140> doing<00:01:51.410> I<00:01:51.590> think

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
100% commit to what you're doing I think

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.580 
100% commit to what you're doing I think
if<00:01:52.520> you<00:01:52.670> don't<00:01:52.850> commit<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:53.240> it<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:53.510> and<00:01:54.440> you

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
if you don't commit to it and and you

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.680 
if you don't commit to it and and you
don't<00:01:54.800> fully<00:01:55.100> go<00:01:55.370> for<00:01:55.550> it<00:01:55.640> then<00:01:55.760> then<00:01:56.510> you're

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
don't fully go for it then then you're

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.300 
don't fully go for it then then you're
not<00:01:56.780> doing<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:57.560> technique<00:01:57.920> that<00:01:57.950> you've<00:01:58.190> been

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
not doing the technique that you've been

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.460 
not doing the technique that you've been
practicing<00:01:58.850> in<00:01:59.060> training<00:01:59.570> and<00:01:59.690> spent<00:02:00.200> hours

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
practicing in training and spent hours

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.680 
practicing in training and spent hours
doing<00:02:00.620> on<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:00.950> training<00:02:01.250> field<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:01.760> yeah

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
doing on the training field and yeah

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.120 
doing on the training field and yeah
when<00:02:02.900> you<00:02:03.020> go<00:02:03.140> through<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.410> routine<00:02:03.560> exactly

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
when you go through the routine exactly

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.290 
when you go through the routine exactly
what<00:02:04.280> you've<00:02:04.430> what<00:02:04.790> you've<00:02:04.820> been<00:02:05.090> taught

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
what you've what you've been taught

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.240 
what you've what you've been taught
yourself<00:02:05.420> and<00:02:05.870> commit<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.380> it<00:02:06.620> then<00:02:06.770> usually

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
yourself and commit to it then usually

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.880 
yourself and commit to it then usually
you<00:02:08.239> trust<00:02:08.509> in<00:02:08.599> your<00:02:08.629> ability<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:09.289> eight

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
you trust in your ability and eight

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.380 
you trust in your ability and eight
times<00:02:10.129> out<00:02:10.280> of<00:02:10.340> ten<00:02:10.520> you<00:02:10.849> kind<00:02:11.090> of<00:02:11.150> get<00:02:11.300> the

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
times out of ten you kind of get the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.349 
times out of ten you kind of get the
ball<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.660> where<00:02:11.780> you<00:02:11.900> want<00:02:12.050> it<00:02:12.140> to<00:02:12.230> go
