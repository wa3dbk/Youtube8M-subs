next 15 years in this project we've

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.340 
next 15 years in this project we've

over the long term we can reduce carbon

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.600 
over the long term we can reduce carbon
and<00:03:01.170> we<00:03:01.260> can<00:03:01.440> increase<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:02.070> value<00:03:02.100> and

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
and we can increase the value and

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.760 
and we can increase the value and
competitiveness<00:03:03.450> of<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.690> buildings<00:03:04.170> those

are<00:03:04.920> three<00:03:05.160> things<00:03:05.370> that<00:03:05.610> every<00:03:05.880> owner<00:03:06.450> of

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
are three things that every owner of

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.949 
are three things that every owner of

real estate wants to do there's more and
more<00:03:10.110> evidence<00:03:10.470> now<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:10.940> buildings<00:03:11.940> that

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
more evidence now that buildings that

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.940 
that if we can put a model out there
that<00:03:18.090> works<00:03:18.330> others<00:03:18.959> will<00:03:19.230> embrace<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.590> that
