00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.519
 It is the question of signaling that it is 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.070
 important because someone did that 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.139
 and this has to be communicated to the 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.910
 people who do not know how the system 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.189
 you have a bad horizontal signage 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.470
 which is a pedestrian strip if you have 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.269
 a vertical signaling with a plate 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.740
 indicating pedestrian crossing 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.990
 if you have a light and indicated the 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.630
 place and the correct time to cross that 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.550
 have a green for the pedestrian 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.410
 that is protecting pradesh some 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.090
 for example think that the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.210
 driver when he is coming with the 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.610
 brt from him he knows he has one 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.500
 green light he can follow and from 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.170
 suddenly came right up front and if someone 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.420
 did not comply with the traffic light 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.190
 then fled system fled the rule with 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.340
 big problem of the person going through outside 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.170
 of the track nowadays with the corridor brt 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.670
 she simply thinks that there the course 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.949
 whether it is a central bed is no longer 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.629
 that there is not a place you can 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.670
 wait for the staff to cross the road 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.470
 in addition there was a risk of traffic 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.280
 from passing through the vehicles to 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.979
 pass through 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.869
 She is waiting inside the brt's house. 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.970
 the conventional bus and has six 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.369
 tons the articulated bus is more the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.869
 double around 37 tonnes 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.119
 So it's the same as those years . 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.920
 they said that he stopped the more than the good 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.689
 had to brake it will still give a 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.979
 time to be able to stop the 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.110
 All accidents that are happening 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.340
 are very much a function of behavior 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.930
 inadequate 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.000
 both drivers and has already had a 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.860
 accident with the wrong versions that the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.990
 earthquake people in wanting simply 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.479
 make the turn to convert to 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.220
 left and can not and can not 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.119
 for the same reason the bus will not 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.860
 get stop 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.180
 are you the visibility version you 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.890
 also failed to make money 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.720
 You do not know why he was in the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.369
 buses in the direction and can do another 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.720
 on the other then what the vehicle 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.310
 In particular, it has become clear that 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.909
 conversions are no longer on the 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.560
 central 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.060
 they have to go to the side lane to wait 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.680
 the lights and make do 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.119
 crossing to ask what you want because 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.860
 we often see the person 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.899
 traversing in the range but 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.450
 track and always attention is coming 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.250
 very 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.409
 the vehicle does not do all your 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.240
 part and become aware that this 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.090
 there is no longer the common bus system 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.129
 is the brt system that it has a weight 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.950
 differentiated to differentiate 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:16.900
 has specific braking issues that 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.620
 the person will not have how to make 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.540
 he stops 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.730
 so if everyone does their part to 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.140
 people can certainly reduce their 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.140
 trampling rate
