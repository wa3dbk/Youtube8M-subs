 In the meantime, we will introduce you once 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.540
 our potatoes or sweet potatoes 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.840
 more accurate and prepare here 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.600

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:35.670
 small pieces so that the same good in 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:43.399
 The broth garden can be quick once 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:47.720
 the ends and then we lose the 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:51.659
 medium like and then small with him 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:55.890
 sliced pieces down here with the 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:02:01.020
 Do not go without garlic and leave 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.120
 all over again a two minutes on the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.670

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.950
 we'll take vegetable stock because that's it 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:30.250
 a vegan fixes it all about 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.510
 Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes until the 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.760
 potatoes are soft 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.350
 As you can see, I started it now

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:19.540
 he may admitted the humiliation that is 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:21.250

 I might have it before 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:43.750
