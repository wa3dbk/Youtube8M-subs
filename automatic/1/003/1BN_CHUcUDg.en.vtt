we're<00:01:37.810> actually<00:01:37.930> using<00:01:38.110> our<00:01:38.590> floating<00:01:38.920> guy

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
we're actually using our floating guy

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.460 
we're actually using our floating guy
laying<00:01:39.430> system<00:01:39.820> this<00:01:40.420> is<00:01:40.570> where<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:41.080> guy<00:01:41.230> Lang

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
laying system this is where the guy Lang

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.380 
laying system this is where the guy Lang
is<00:01:41.650> in<00:01:42.040> two<00:01:42.250> separate<00:01:42.670> parts<00:01:42.880> so<00:01:43.090> we<00:01:43.180> have<00:01:43.300> the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
is in two separate parts so we have the

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.970 
is in two separate parts so we have the

thing you'll notice on the side of the
trout<00:02:42.500> lake<00:02:42.650> 6<00:02:43.010> here<00:02:43.220> is<00:02:43.430> that<00:02:43.580> we<00:02:43.700> have<00:02:43.880> this

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
trout lake 6 here is that we have this

what<00:02:48.650> we<00:02:48.769> can<00:02:48.920> do<00:02:49.040> is<00:02:49.190> we<00:02:49.310> can<00:02:49.340> use<00:02:49.580> this<00:02:49.730> saved

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
what we can do is we can use this saved

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.059 
what we can do is we can use this saved
or<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.420> that<00:02:50.510> creates<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.019> shelter<00:02:51.590> over<00:02:51.950> the

lots and lots of windows all the way
around<00:02:58.819> here<00:02:59.120> we<00:02:59.269> have<00:02:59.390> this<00:02:59.510> panorama<00:03:00.049> front

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
around here we have this panorama front

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.050 
around here we have this panorama front
so<00:03:00.769> it's<00:03:00.890> curved<00:03:01.190> around<00:03:01.310> here<00:03:01.670> and<00:03:01.730> every

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
so it's curved around here and every

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.050 
so it's curved around here and every
single<00:03:02.239> panel<00:03:02.720> has<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:02.900> window<00:03:03.160> 11<00:03:04.160> great<00:03:04.790> views

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
single panel has a window 11 great views

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.539 
single panel has a window 11 great views
from<00:03:05.420> out<00:03:05.630> within<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.530> tent<00:03:06.830> and<00:03:07.250> what<00:03:07.430> you'll

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
from out within the tent and what you'll

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:08.740 
from out within the tent and what you'll
find<00:03:07.670> is<00:03:07.880> every<00:03:08.180> single<00:03:08.480> one<00:03:08.600> of<00:03:08.630> these

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
find is every single one of these

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.050 
find is every single one of these
windows<00:03:09.110> has<00:03:09.260> been<00:03:09.440> tinted<00:03:09.860> so<00:03:10.069> it<00:03:10.190> serves<00:03:10.549> two

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
windows has been tinted so it serves two

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.479 
windows has been tinted so it serves two
key<00:03:11.569> functions<00:03:12.080> one<00:03:12.319> is<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:13.069> reduce<00:03:13.220> the

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
key functions one is to reduce the

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.220 
key functions one is to reduce the
amount<00:03:13.640> of<00:03:13.819> glare<00:03:14.120> from<00:03:14.299> the<00:03:14.360> Sun<00:03:14.660> inside<00:03:15.110> the

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
amount of glare from the Sun inside the

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.870 
amount of glare from the Sun inside the
tent<00:03:15.440> and<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:16.069> second<00:03:16.400> is<00:03:16.519> to<00:03:16.640> give<00:03:16.790> you

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
tent and the second is to give you

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.809 
tent and the second is to give you
maximum<00:03:17.269> amount<00:03:17.900> of<00:03:18.049> privacy<00:03:18.580> so<00:03:19.580> when<00:03:19.700> we

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
maximum amount of privacy so when we

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.670 
maximum amount of privacy so when we
actually<00:03:20.180> step<00:03:20.540> into<00:03:20.959> the<00:03:21.079> tent<00:03:21.290> itself

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
actually step into the tent itself

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.130 
actually step into the tent itself
you'll<00:03:22.459> see<00:03:22.640> that<00:03:22.910> we<00:03:23.060> have<00:03:23.090> a<00:03:23.480> real<00:03:23.660> good<00:03:23.870> size

hydrostatic head of at least ten

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.280 
hydrostatic head of at least ten
thousand<00:03:47.090> millimeters<00:03:47.329> and<00:03:47.780> what<00:03:47.959> your<00:03:48.079> fame

that<00:03:48.470> is<00:03:48.590> that<00:03:49.070> it<00:03:49.160> actually<00:03:49.310> zips<00:03:49.700> all<00:03:49.910> the

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
that is that it actually zips all the

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.520 
that is that it actually zips all the
way<00:03:50.239> around<00:03:50.359> here<00:03:50.720> so<00:03:50.930> hopefully<00:03:50.959> it's<00:03:51.380> going

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
way around here so hopefully it's going

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.380 
way around here so hopefully it's going
to<00:03:51.590> protect<00:03:51.709> you<00:03:51.950> from<00:03:52.609> the<00:03:52.850> elements<00:03:52.880> and

to protect you from the elements and
also<00:03:53.870> hopefully<00:03:54.470> keep<00:03:54.859> out<00:03:55.040> those<00:03:55.549> unwanted

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
also hopefully keep out those unwanted

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.569 
also hopefully keep out those unwanted
bugs<00:03:56.450> as<00:03:56.660> well<00:03:56.930> just<00:03:57.890> at<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.130> top<00:03:58.280> there<00:03:58.489> is<00:03:58.549> a

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
bugs as well just at the top there is a

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.520 
bugs as well just at the top there is a
lantern<00:03:59.000> hanging<00:03:59.329> point<00:03:59.569> and<00:03:59.750> then<00:04:00.170> coming

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
lantern hanging point and then coming

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.520 
lantern hanging point and then coming
away<00:04:00.769> from<00:04:00.799> that<00:04:01.160> we<00:04:01.370> actually<00:04:01.730> have<00:04:01.910> some

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
away from that we actually have some

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.440 
away from that we actually have some
cable<00:04:03.530> Teddy's<00:04:03.859> but<00:04:04.489> it's<00:04:04.609> just<00:04:04.790> run<00:04:05.000> down<00:04:05.209> to

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
cable Teddy's but it's just run down to

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.630 
cable Teddy's but it's just run down to
where<00:04:05.959> the<00:04:06.079> groundsheet<00:04:06.380> zips<00:04:06.950> into<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.400> tent

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
where the groundsheet zips into the tent

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.759 
where the groundsheet zips into the tent
itself<00:04:08.030> what<00:04:08.720> that<00:04:08.840> allows<00:04:08.959> is<00:04:09.380> for<00:04:09.410> you<00:04:09.650> to

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
itself what that allows is for you to

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.460 
itself what that allows is for you to
bring<00:04:09.950> in<00:04:10.100> any<00:04:10.370> cables<00:04:10.850> or<00:04:11.480> electricity<00:04:11.930> into

the tent without actually having to run
any<00:04:14.239> through<00:04:14.600> the<00:04:14.720> doors<00:04:14.950> now<00:04:15.950> I<00:04:15.980> mentioned

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
say run all the way around the tent what

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.240 
say run all the way around the tent what
we<00:04:20.479> have<00:04:20.690> is<00:04:20.900> for<00:04:21.380> every<00:04:21.650> single<00:04:21.979> one<00:04:22.070> of<00:04:22.100> the

we have is for every single one of the
windows<00:04:22.430> we<00:04:22.910> have<00:04:23.030> a<00:04:23.060> curtain<00:04:23.479> on<00:04:23.600> each<00:04:24.200> one<00:04:24.620> so

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
windows we have a curtain on each one so

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.170 
windows we have a curtain on each one so
we<00:04:25.159> can<00:04:25.190> either<00:04:25.430> bring<00:04:26.000> these<00:04:26.800> halfway<00:04:27.800> up<00:04:27.950> or

we can either bring these halfway up or
we<00:04:29.180> can<00:04:29.330> close<00:04:29.539> them

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
we can close them

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.300 
we can close them
completely<00:04:30.170> for<00:04:31.070> full<00:04:31.730> privacy<00:04:32.090> I<00:04:33.310> mentioned

is three different bedrooms but what we

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.070 
is three different bedrooms but what we
can<00:05:45.890> do<00:05:46.070> is<00:05:46.460> quite<00:05:46.640> simply<00:05:47.000> unzip<00:05:47.390> the<00:05:48.050> panels

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
can do is quite simply unzip the panels

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.290 
can do is quite simply unzip the panels
that<00:05:48.710> are<00:05:48.770> in<00:05:48.950> between<00:05:49.100> each<00:05:49.460> bedroom<00:05:50.030> to

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
that are in between each bedroom to

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.920 
that are in between each bedroom to
create<00:05:50.570> one<00:05:51.080> large<00:05:51.320> bedroom<00:05:51.830> and<00:05:52.010> or<00:05:52.970> we<00:05:53.780> can

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
create one large bedroom and or we can

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.570 
create one large bedroom and or we can
actually<00:05:54.200> drop<00:05:54.380> down<00:05:54.650> one<00:05:55.070> of<00:05:55.190> the<00:05:55.280> sides<00:05:55.490> of

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580
