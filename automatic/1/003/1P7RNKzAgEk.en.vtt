00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.690 
warfare 3 released it was actually a
spec<00:01:23.939> ops<00:01:24.119> mission<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.509> think<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:26.490> was

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
spec ops mission I think and it was

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.060 
spec ops mission I think and it was
basically<00:01:27.030> set<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.479> on<00:01:27.810> rooftops<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.650> some

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
basically set on on rooftops of some

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.120 
basically set on on rooftops of some
building<00:01:29.430> dubai<00:01:30.030> i<00:01:30.060> think<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.509> was<00:01:30.979> so<00:01:31.979> it

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
building dubai i think it was so it

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.679 
building dubai i think it was so it
could<00:01:32.340> be<00:01:32.369> set<00:01:32.729> somewhere<00:01:33.060> similar<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.570> that

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
could be set somewhere similar to that

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.020 
could be set somewhere similar to that
book<00:01:33.990> equally<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.770> could<00:01:34.950> just<00:01:35.159> be<00:01:35.430> totally

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
book equally it could just be totally

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.999
