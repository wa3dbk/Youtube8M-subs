that<00:01:15.990> he<00:01:16.259> probably<00:01:17.299> doesn't<00:01:18.299> get<00:01:18.420> out<00:01:18.479> much

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
that he probably doesn't get out much

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.859 
that he probably doesn't get out much
so<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.670> was<00:01:20.820> imagining<00:01:21.030> him<00:01:21.390> being<00:01:21.630> very

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869

tiny<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.770> very<00:01:23.280> weird<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.060> was<00:01:24.299> imagining

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
tiny and very weird so I was imagining

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.719 
tiny and very weird so I was imagining
his<00:01:24.869> voice<00:01:25.110> being<00:01:25.350> kind<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.710> like<00:01:25.890> strained

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729
