00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
this is why you know we're approaching

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.970 
this is why you know we're approaching
2012<00:02:14.560> and<00:02:14.770> 2012<00:02:15.340> is<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.640> is<00:02:16.060> a<00:02:16.480> peak<00:02:17.470> period<00:02:17.830> of<00:02:17.920> a

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
2012 and 2012 is a is a peak period of a

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.630 
2012 and 2012 is a is a peak period of a
26,000<00:02:18.970> years<00:02:19.000> cycle<00:02:19.569> and<00:02:19.800> in<00:02:20.800> that<00:02:20.950> cycle<00:02:21.430> we

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
26,000 years cycle and in that cycle we

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.759 
26,000 years cycle and in that cycle we
have<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.849> best<00:02:22.030> chance<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:23.409> raise<00:02:23.620> our

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
have the best chance to to raise our

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:24.840 
have the best chance to to raise our
consciousness<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:24.549> 20

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
consciousness so 20

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.570 
consciousness so 20
12<00:02:25.090> is<00:02:25.240> a<00:02:25.270> consciousness<00:02:25.900> marker<00:02:26.350> however<00:02:27.310> if

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
12 is a consciousness marker however if

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.210 
12 is a consciousness marker however if
you<00:02:27.730> do<00:02:27.910> it<00:02:28.060> too<00:02:28.210> slowly<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:29.260> ego<00:02:29.680> will<00:02:29.860> adjust

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
you do it too slowly the ego will adjust

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.060 
you do it too slowly the ego will adjust
so<00:02:31.090> sometimes<00:02:31.570> events<00:02:32.410> have<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.680> hit<00:02:32.860> one

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
so sometimes events have to hit one

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.680 
so sometimes events have to hit one
after<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.460> other<00:02:33.490> to<00:02:33.760> really<00:02:34.240> shake<00:02:34.540> the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
after the other to really shake the

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
sugar tree so to speak and and

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.530 
sugar tree so to speak and and
humanities<00:02:37.870> being<00:02:38.350> shaken<00:02:38.950> up<00:02:39.280> for<00:02:39.880> positive

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
humanities being shaken up for positive

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.650 
humanities being shaken up for positive
reason<00:02:40.930> we<00:02:41.560> are<00:02:41.620> awakening<00:02:42.280> our<00:02:42.400> hearts<00:02:42.910> we're

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
have an earth is lettin go of density

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.850 
have an earth is lettin go of density
tell<00:03:12.760> us<00:03:12.940> how<00:03:13.210> one<00:03:13.780> how<00:03:14.230> we<00:03:14.290> might<00:03:14.530> be<00:03:14.650> able<00:03:14.740> to

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
tell us how one how we might be able to

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.640 
tell us how one how we might be able to
do<00:03:15.040> this<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.310> little<00:03:15.520> a<00:03:15.670> little<00:03:15.850> easier<00:03:16.650> you

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
do this a little a little easier you

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.230 
do this a little a little easier you
know<00:03:17.770> then<00:03:17.920> getting<00:03:18.190> hit<00:03:18.340> by<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.490> two<00:03:18.760> two<00:03:19.060> by

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
know then getting hit by the two two by

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.510 
know then getting hit by the two two by
four<00:03:19.510> if<00:03:19.690> we<00:03:19.720> all<00:03:19.990> start<00:03:20.530> consciously

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
four if we all start consciously

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.700 
four if we all start consciously
becoming<00:03:21.970> aware<00:03:22.090> of<00:03:22.270> the<00:03:22.810> removal<00:03:23.230> of<00:03:23.260> our<00:03:23.410> ego

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
becoming aware of the removal of our ego

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.310 
becoming aware of the removal of our ego
what<00:03:23.890> does<00:03:23.980> that<00:03:24.100> look<00:03:24.220> like<00:03:24.990> well<00:03:25.990> people

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
what does that look like well people

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.530 
what does that look like well people
have<00:03:26.410> to<00:03:26.590> realize<00:03:26.620> that<00:03:26.980> that<00:03:27.820> the<00:03:27.940> ego<00:03:28.330> is<00:03:28.360> a

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
have to realize that that the ego is a

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.200 
have to realize that that the ego is a
thought<00:03:29.260> system<00:03:29.680> that<00:03:29.890> that<00:03:30.430> we<00:03:30.730> all<00:03:30.910> plugged

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
thought system that that we all plugged

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.150 
thought system that that we all plugged
into<00:03:31.390> to<00:03:31.930> play<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.470> human<00:03:32.830> game<00:03:33.010> of

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
into to play the human game of

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.280 
into to play the human game of
separation<00:03:33.820> and<00:03:33.940> death<00:03:34.150> and<00:03:34.390> dizzy<00:03:34.720> and<00:03:34.960> I'm

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
separation and death and dizzy and I'm

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.920 
separation and death and dizzy and I'm
not<00:03:35.470> true<00:03:35.710> so<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.760> way<00:03:36.910> we<00:03:37.090> do<00:03:37.240> that<00:03:37.390> is<00:03:37.450> we<00:03:37.600> put

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
not true so the way we do that is we put

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.640 
not true so the way we do that is we put
on<00:03:38.050> masks<00:03:38.650> we<00:03:39.010> each<00:03:39.910> mask<00:03:40.360> defines<00:03:40.990> ourselves

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
on masks we each mask defines ourselves

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.860 
on masks we each mask defines ourselves
so<00:03:41.830> we<00:03:42.100> put<00:03:42.790> on<00:03:42.910> when<00:03:43.090> we<00:03:43.180> get<00:03:43.360> born<00:03:43.570> we<00:03:43.720> could

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
so we put on when we get born we could

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.800 
so we put on when we get born we could
put<00:03:44.020> on<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.440> mask<00:03:44.950> that<00:03:45.250> I'm<00:03:45.430> an<00:03:45.580> American<00:03:45.820> we

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
put on the mask that I'm an American we

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.470 
put on the mask that I'm an American we
put<00:03:46.990> on<00:03:47.110> the<00:03:47.260> mask<00:03:47.470> that<00:03:47.770> Catholic<00:03:48.760> we<00:03:49.180> put<00:03:49.360> on

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
put on the mask that Catholic we put on

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.330 
put on the mask that Catholic we put on
the<00:03:49.510> mask<00:03:49.810> that<00:03:50.080> even<00:03:50.410> I'm<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.650> male<00:03:51.130> of<00:03:51.310> female

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
the mask that even I'm a male of female

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.600 
the mask that even I'm a male of female
and<00:03:51.970> so<00:03:52.540> we<00:03:52.690> put<00:03:52.900> on<00:03:53.020> these<00:03:53.170> masks<00:03:53.770> we<00:03:54.250> define

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
and so we put on these masks we define

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.670 
and so we put on these masks we define
ourselves<00:03:54.640> we<00:03:55.270> separate<00:03:55.690> ourselves<00:03:55.840> and<00:03:56.290> then

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
ourselves we separate ourselves and then

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.310 
ourselves we separate ourselves and then
we<00:03:56.710> justify<00:03:57.400> our<00:03:57.430> differences<00:03:58.390> and<00:03:58.660> that's

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
we justify our differences and that's

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.710 
we justify our differences and that's
led<00:03:59.620> to<00:03:59.770> all<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.340> wars<00:04:00.640> that<00:04:01.120> is<00:04:01.420> all<00:04:01.570> the

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
led to all the wars that is all the
