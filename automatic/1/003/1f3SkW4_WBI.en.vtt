 American we wanted to do all the 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.580
 two already since we do not see very 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.890
 often and it allows you to spend time 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.199
 time together and then it's always 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.260

 let go two years it's mostly a 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.600
 good time to share 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.600
 at least that fitting 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.369
 compared to your hair actually 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.820
 we see a side that is slightly 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.799
 sparse a fairly large length 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.909
 we will value all by bringing 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.920
 the volume effect 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.409
 I will advise you this is this cup and 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.659
 seven banquet lengths for me to score 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.690
 this contrast years so why not dream 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.850
 on a slightly dive effect that is going 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.369
 report this volume effect and 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.500
 energize your hairstyle and its effects 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.690
 long hours of car responding by 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.690
 compared to your cut brought a touch 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.509
 a touch a little bit of sunlight 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.950
 who will come to value the cut so by 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.080
 compared to your hair 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.520
 so we have a length you 're kept 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.380
 this length the wii so face that in 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.569
 terms of balanced at the cutting level 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.220
 we will rebalance against your 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:57.819
 tip I advise you to cut when 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.950
 even 3 to 4 cm to restore strength 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.460
 to your hair side side side 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.170
 technical 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.539
 I advise you to bring back 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.350
 shine in relation to your material ok 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:10.269
 on slightly coppery golden tones and 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.829
 who will actually put especially tintin 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.829
 and his eyes worth 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.030
 he 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.170
 it's a summer make-up you do not have to 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.209
 to leave is something too much 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.580
 too much too much makeup 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.110
 foundation so at eye level I 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.670
 want it's still pretty simple I 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.560
 will you do something very 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.750
 Lightweight such an eyeliner here 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.180
 to refresh a little bit the 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.560
 face give a complexion a pure fresh and 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.920
 I am more accentuated at the level of 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.360
 lips 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.799
 that is to say that level of there I 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.390
 could you put yourself a little pink 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.519
 more lively or an orange a little more live 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.140
 according to your outfit to be able to balance 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.370
 in fact when we put a lot on them 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.810
 eyes we will allow a lot on the 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.910
 mouth and conversely fashion in this 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.110
 moment it's very very colorful here 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.459
 full of colors we will try 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.590
 to accentuate more on the mouth 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.810
 since you 're going to wear clothes in 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.669
 the green tones of the coup I will try to 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.320
 take it out a little bit at the level of 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.669
 eyes so do you something very 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.860
 luminous levels the eyes and make a 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.990
 outline a little bit in green tones 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.270
 persimmon for this is very fresh very summer 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.550
 very bright and at student level 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.080
 on the contrary I will stay very simple 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.310
 because as I explained before when 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.750
 we do a lot in the eyes 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.970
 it would be very simple at the level of 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.520
 lips at the level of thyme make a background 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.500
 very light complexion of blush a small 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.539
 little orange this time to do more 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.430
 sunny as we go in something 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.530
 more intense in the eyes and 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.510
 then if not stay very close to 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.510
 world in time and and that's it 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.570
 today did not listen I did you 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.860

 printed slightly pamiers is enough 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.320
 logical all that is fruity 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.240
 colors we will really give a side 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.430
 fun to his silhouette 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.110
 I mainly select those 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.660
 which I liked the most for you the side 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.430

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:21.830
 let's try it then for you and 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.240
 manuela I had seen different things 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.800

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.480

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.610
 remember the beach side rather the side 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:41.180
 always fun by actually associating the 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:43.160
 fluid silk and wrinkled the things a 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.780

 little touch beach that will accentuate 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.270

 do what it is a privilege 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.820
 we would not dare necessarily wear this 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.170
 held but actually when we see the 

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.240
