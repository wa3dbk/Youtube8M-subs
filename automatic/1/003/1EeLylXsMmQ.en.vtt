really<00:01:45.110> easy<00:01:45.500> to<00:01:45.680> do<00:01:45.830> all<00:01:46.010> what<00:01:46.340> it<00:01:46.490> does<00:01:46.700> to

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
really easy to do all what it does to

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.520 
really easy to do all what it does to
the<00:01:47.120> tall<00:01:47.480> grass<00:01:47.690> it<00:01:47.870> makes<00:01:48.020> it<00:01:48.110> double<00:01:48.350> tall

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
the tall grass it makes it double tall

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.830 
the tall grass it makes it double tall
grass<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:48.980> it<00:01:49.730> for<00:01:50.030> whatever<00:01:50.210> reason<00:01:50.659> it

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
grass and it for whatever reason it

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.630 
grass and it for whatever reason it
glitches<00:01:51.290> and<00:01:51.560> it<00:01:51.710> takes<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.130> place<00:01:52.370> of<00:01:52.550> the

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
glitches and it takes the place of the

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.910 
glitches and it takes the place of the
block<00:01:52.850> above<00:01:53.150> it<00:01:53.300> and<00:01:53.600> it's<00:01:54.560> really<00:01:54.860> that

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
block above it and it's really that

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.910 
block above it and it's really that
simple<00:01:55.130> now<00:01:55.730> you<00:01:55.760> can<00:01:56.000> just<00:01:56.150> easily<00:01:56.450> break<00:01:57.170> the

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
simple now you can just easily break the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.370 
simple now you can just easily break the
tall<00:01:58.130> grass<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:58.880> you<00:01:59.510> will<00:01:59.630> have<00:01:59.810> floating

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
tall grass and you will have floating

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.260 
tall grass and you will have floating
rails<00:02:00.590> and<00:02:00.920> this<00:02:01.370> is<00:02:01.490> really<00:02:01.729> useful<00:02:01.880> as<00:02:02.150> you

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
rails and this is really useful as you

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.080 
rails and this is really useful as you
can<00:02:02.390> see<00:02:02.510> I<00:02:02.540> probably<00:02:03.229> accidentally<00:02:03.650> hit<00:02:03.770> dumb

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
can see I probably accidentally hit dumb

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.520 
can see I probably accidentally hit dumb
rails<00:02:05.090> up<00:02:05.300> there<00:02:05.479> but<00:02:05.960> you<00:02:06.110> know<00:02:06.200> it<00:02:06.320> does

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
rails up there but you know it does

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.169 
rails up there but you know it does
indeed<00:02:06.950> work<00:02:07.220> you<00:02:07.430> just<00:02:07.490> have<00:02:07.700> to<00:02:07.790> be<00:02:07.909> a<00:02:07.940> little

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179
