00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.360
 the origin of all well-complied seripa technicians give interesting tips 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.779
 about 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:13.189
 of public procurement 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:16.269
 but we are experiencing here and other tips with the relationship 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:21.089
 to alshop the second place after helping the art course 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:25.909
 is important 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:27.769
 and determination 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.099
 a good request up with the concertation 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.810
 he is d he understands emotional gÃ­cia be 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.810
 so you end up losing what you are going through 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.990
 the course is want to know more 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.190
 I'm very much like him too 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.370
 impasse fukushima here and know more beijing on the day of the test the council should 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.610
 seek more knowledge that is not the same thing 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.050
 suddenly be much more than you but despite that the tram 10 hours I 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.500
 do not try it all, it does not mean you have four proofs 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.280
 It's just that in those four hours I got it and it shows more 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.430
 knowledge, then sometimes there are people who are very slow when it comes to 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.790
 content is too late it says eli lilly you make a question that at 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.430
 Sometimes we do not have this time. 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.220
 to remember to put into practice then 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.360
 I want 3 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.410
 a person who is well focused technical team that is focused that 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.780
 person passing through a stream is the killer 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.720
 a study the application 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.050
 she has much more chance 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.790
 that means 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.620
 not qualitative 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.450
 quality 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.030
 instead of study we suddenly study 10 hours 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.930
 and those people do not pay 5 hours of another candidate 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.760
 so sometimes studying the right things 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.170
 it is fundamental 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.440
 ask your teachers for these materials from each 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:57.950
 subject 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.990
 the incidence fell that matter and the commitment that I know fuel 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.580
 what cost 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.299
 who has to see who studies from a gossip of the mercantile gazeta cup 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.189
 is that person who 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:15.709
 he picked the best information he arrived all right well everything right 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:16.619
 set red
