00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.270 

rarely<00:00:58.899> have<00:00:59.140> to<00:00:59.320> change<00:00:59.590> it<00:00:59.800> but<00:00:59.920> I<00:01:00.010> always

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
rarely have to change it but I always

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.770 
rarely have to change it but I always
check<00:01:00.489> my<00:01:00.520> tracking<00:01:00.969> before<00:01:01.390> I<00:01:01.420> go<00:01:01.629> much

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
check my tracking before I go much

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.619 
check my tracking before I go much
further<00:01:02.020> this<00:01:02.860> quick<00:01:03.129> change<00:01:03.399> tool<00:01:03.670> rest<00:01:03.910> I'm

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
further this quick change tool rest I'm

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.540 
further this quick change tool rest I'm
going<00:01:04.780> to<00:01:04.839> swap<00:01:05.050> out<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:06.760> a<00:01:06.790> simple<00:01:07.330> flat<00:01:07.510> flat

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
going to swap out to a simple flat flat

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:29.550 
going to swap out to a simple flat flat
grinding<00:01:09.550> tool<00:01:09.790> rest

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:02:16.630 

the<00:01:30.560> loser

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.240 

one<00:02:17.090> little<00:02:17.270> fire<00:02:17.570> with<00:02:17.750> my<00:02:17.900> hologram<00:02:18.470> it's

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
one little fire with my hologram it's

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.080 
one little fire with my hologram it's
alright

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.570 

later<00:02:23.390> decide

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:38.690 

cracking

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.640 

the<00:02:39.090> fracking<00:02:39.540> mechanism<00:02:40.050> is<00:02:40.170> actually<00:02:40.530> the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
the fracking mechanism is actually the

00:02:40.650 --> 00:03:11.050 
the fracking mechanism is actually the
pivoting<00:02:41.040> motor<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:41.580> drive<00:02:41.610> wheel

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.790 

now<00:03:11.600> I'm<00:03:11.720> going<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:11.900> do<00:03:12.050> something<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.590> most

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
now I'm going to do something the most

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:22.050 
now I'm going to do something the most
unite<00:03:13.190> makers<00:03:13.670> who<00:03:13.760> hate<00:03:13.970> to<00:03:14.150> have<00:03:14.270> happen

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.190 

so<00:03:23.130> just<00:03:24.130> to<00:03:24.220> show<00:03:24.400> off<00:03:24.580> the<00:03:24.790> tracking<00:03:25.200> pretty

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
so just to show off the tracking pretty

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.390 
so just to show off the tracking pretty
much<00:03:26.380> intentionally<00:03:27.010> ruined<00:03:27.310> a<00:03:27.400> knife<00:03:27.550> blade

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
much intentionally ruined a knife blade

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.199 
much intentionally ruined a knife blade
did<00:03:30.400> that<00:03:30.610> to<00:03:30.790> show<00:03:30.819> the<00:03:31.530> belt<00:03:32.530> tracking<00:03:33.040> and

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
did that to show the belt tracking and

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.940 
did that to show the belt tracking and
something<00:03:34.209> that<00:03:34.660> every<00:03:34.810> knife<00:03:35.380> maker<00:03:35.709> the

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
something that every knife maker the

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.130 
something that every knife maker the
flack<00:03:36.220> drives<00:03:36.580> well<00:03:36.850> or<00:03:37.030> hollow<00:03:37.240> grind<00:03:37.630> has<00:03:37.930> to

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
flack drives well or hollow grind has to

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.760 
flack drives well or hollow grind has to
do<00:03:38.350> is<00:03:39.280> touch<00:03:39.550> up<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.910> ricasso<00:03:40.180> line<00:03:40.630> I<00:03:40.989> don't

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
do is touch up the ricasso line I don't

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.309 
do is touch up the ricasso line I don't
even<00:03:41.860> know<00:03:42.100> how<00:03:42.459> old<00:03:42.520> this<00:03:43.060> belt<00:03:43.390> is<00:03:43.780> but<00:03:44.170> it's

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
even know how old this belt is but it's

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.130 
even know how old this belt is but it's
a<00:03:45.120> structured<00:03:46.120> belt<00:03:46.420> and<00:03:46.630> it's<00:03:46.720> a<00:03:46.780> flexible

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
a structured belt and it's a flexible

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.320 
a structured belt and it's a flexible
belt<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.910> I<00:03:48.970> use<00:03:49.209> it<00:03:49.239> for<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:49.569> corners<00:03:51.330> let's

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
belt and I use it for the corners let's

00:03:52.330 --> 00:04:06.030 
belt and I use it for the corners let's
turn<00:03:52.569> that<00:03:52.780> guy<00:03:53.020> up

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.190 

No

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.650 

now<00:04:11.740> you<00:04:11.800> see<00:04:12.160> where<00:04:13.030> I<00:04:13.090> gotta<00:04:13.270> bring<00:04:13.480> that

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
now you see where I gotta bring that

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.620 
now you see where I gotta bring that
grind<00:04:13.990> line<00:04:14.230> over<00:04:14.590> to

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.190 

so<00:04:18.110> I<00:04:18.140> can<00:04:18.500> practice<00:04:18.680> over

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
so I can practice over

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.110 
so I can practice over
pretty<00:04:20.380> much<00:04:20.470> reflection<00:04:20.860> I<00:04:21.040> want<00:04:21.280> come<00:04:22.000> in

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
pretty much reflection I want come in

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:33.290 
pretty much reflection I want come in
here<00:04:22.300> and<00:04:22.420> get<00:04:22.540> on<00:04:22.660> the<00:04:22.780> tracking<00:04:23.050> pill

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.000 

now<00:04:33.780> other<00:04:33.990> than<00:04:34.110> not<00:04:34.410> wanted<00:04:34.740> to<00:04:34.770> heat<00:04:34.980> up

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
now other than not wanted to heat up

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.700 
now other than not wanted to heat up
that<00:04:35.160> blade<00:04:35.640> or<00:04:35.850> run<00:04:36.000> my<00:04:36.180> grind<00:04:36.480> line<00:04:36.720> back<00:04:36.990> we

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
that blade or run my grind line back we

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.560 
that blade or run my grind line back we
see<00:04:37.920> how<00:04:38.010> stable<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.550> cracking<00:04:39.000> was<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.390> true

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
see how stable the cracking was to true

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.189 
see how stable the cracking was to true
up<00:04:39.600> the<00:04:39.810> corners<00:04:40.170> of<00:04:40.290> ricasso<00:04:40.620> life

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.439 

like<00:04:43.710> I<00:04:43.889> said<00:04:43.949> don't<00:04:44.520> judge<00:04:44.789> me<00:04:45.090> I'm<00:04:45.240> doing

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
like I said don't judge me I'm doing

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:52.540 
like I said don't judge me I'm doing
this<00:04:45.749> to<00:04:45.960> show<00:04:45.990> off<00:04:46.169> the<00:04:46.560> grinder

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.409 

you<00:04:53.060> see<00:04:53.270> all<00:04:53.450> right<00:04:53.480> sue

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:18.379 

run<00:04:58.050> that<00:04:58.229> belt<00:04:58.530> over<00:04:58.740> a<00:04:58.919> little<00:04:59.159> bit<00:04:59.310> more

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.809 

I<00:05:18.419> guess<00:05:19.169> I<00:05:19.349> get<00:05:19.409> slow<00:05:19.710> the<00:05:19.889> grinder<00:05:20.310> down<00:05:20.520> to

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:20.819 
I guess I get slow the grinder down to
