the globe to organic markets and things

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.110 
the globe to organic markets and things
because<00:06:00.260> it<00:06:00.620> was<00:06:00.800> oh<00:06:03.160> ok<00:06:04.160> today<00:06:04.490> I've<00:06:04.789> learned

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
because it was oh ok today I've learned

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.540 
because it was oh ok today I've learned
that<00:06:05.570> some<00:06:05.840> first<00:06:06.470> of<00:06:06.650> all<00:06:06.740> go<00:06:07.039> through<00:06:07.280> is

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
that some first of all go through is

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.279 
that some first of all go through is
actually<00:06:07.910> more<00:06:08.030> compatible<00:06:08.419> with<00:06:08.840> our<00:06:08.990> body

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.289 
actually more compatible with our body

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:11.560 
actually more compatible with our body
the<00:06:09.890> protein<00:06:10.340> it's<00:06:10.610> actually<00:06:10.940> better<00:06:11.060> for<00:06:11.210> us

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
the protein it's actually better for us

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.320 
the protein it's actually better for us
and<00:06:11.900> I<00:06:12.410> think<00:06:12.650> that<00:06:12.950> Josie<00:06:13.640> really<00:06:13.910> treats<00:06:14.180> it

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
and I think that Josie really treats it

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.510 
and I think that Josie really treats it
goes<00:06:14.510> well<00:06:14.840> and<00:06:15.770> that's<00:06:15.919> why<00:06:16.130> I<00:06:16.160> think<00:06:16.250> she

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
goes well and that's why I think she

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.770 
goes well and that's why I think she
creates<00:06:16.820> such<00:06:16.940> an<00:06:17.030> amazing<00:06:17.419> production

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 
creates such an amazing production

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.900 
creates such an amazing production
because<00:06:18.140> they're<00:06:18.260> in<00:06:18.350> such<00:06:18.530> a<00:06:18.610> safe<00:06:19.610> and

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:19.910 
because they're in such a safe and

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.520 
because they're in such a safe and
nurturing<00:06:20.110> environment<00:06:21.110> and<00:06:21.260> they're

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
nurturing environment and they're

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.020 
nurturing environment and they're
treated<00:06:21.890> really<00:06:22.039> well<00:06:22.160> they<00:06:22.520> get<00:06:22.669> to<00:06:22.789> go<00:06:22.910> out

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
treated really well they get to go out

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.279 
treated really well they get to go out
and<00:06:23.180> play<00:06:23.270> in<00:06:23.330> the<00:06:23.450> paddock<00:06:23.720> like<00:06:23.990> they<00:06:24.140> are

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:24.289 
and play in the paddock like they are

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:26.529

out<00:06:24.470> over<00:06:24.740> there<00:06:24.890> right<00:06:25.070> now<00:06:25.130> and<00:06:25.820> I've

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:26.539 
out over there right now and I've

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:27.760 
out over there right now and I've
learned<00:06:26.720> but<00:06:26.870> it's<00:06:27.020> actually<00:06:27.110> a<00:06:27.320> really<00:06:27.470> hard

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
learned but it's actually a really hard

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.010 
learned but it's actually a really hard
process<00:06:28.039> and<00:06:28.580> that<00:06:29.150> she's<00:06:29.720> not<00:06:29.840> really

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
process and that she's not really

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.060 
process and that she's not really
getting<00:06:30.260> the<00:06:30.350> support<00:06:30.740> from<00:06:30.950> the<00:06:31.039> government

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070 
getting the support from the government

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.540 
getting the support from the government
she<00:06:31.700> deserves<00:06:32.090> so<00:06:32.830> hopefully<00:06:33.830> people<00:06:34.370> can

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
she deserves so hopefully people can

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.000 
she deserves so hopefully people can
become<00:06:34.760> aware<00:06:35.120> of<00:06:35.180> her<00:06:35.479> company<00:06:35.720> as<00:06:36.200> bought
