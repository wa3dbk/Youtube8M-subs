00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
of the way and twisting it just gives it

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.119 
of the way and twisting it just gives it
a<00:00:46.379> bit<00:00:46.530> more<00:00:46.680> stability<00:00:48.440> and<00:00:49.440> then<00:00:49.770> I'm<00:00:49.950> going

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129
