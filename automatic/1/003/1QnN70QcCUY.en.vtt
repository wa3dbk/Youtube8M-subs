missing from this such as the Hunger
Games<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.460> Twilight<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.030> those<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.480> feel<00:00:40.050> like

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
Games and Twilight but those I feel like

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.500 
Games and Twilight but those I feel like
if<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.680> put<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:41.160> all<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.910> those<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.390> it

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
if I put like all of those in it it

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.690 
if I put like all of those in it it
would<00:00:42.629> just<00:00:42.780> be<00:00:42.899> kind<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.170> standard<00:00:43.710> series<00:00:44.489> so

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
would just be kind of standard series so

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.549 
would just be kind of standard series so
I<00:00:44.730> did<00:00:45.059> put<00:00:45.300> divergent<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:45.960> here<00:00:46.170> which<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.410> one

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
I did put divergent in here which is one

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.650 
I did put divergent in here which is one
of<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.739> biggest<00:00:47.070> ones<00:00:47.250> but<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:48.120> just<00:00:48.300> wanted<00:00:48.539> to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
of the biggest ones but I just wanted to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.850 
of the biggest ones but I just wanted to
show<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.870> guys<00:00:49.079> maybe<00:00:49.320> some<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.770> you've

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
show you guys maybe some that you've

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.380

never<00:00:50.039> heard<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.399> before<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.879> guess<00:00:51.059> I'll<00:00:51.239> start

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
never heard of before I guess I'll start

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.330 
never heard of before I guess I'll start
with<00:00:51.660> divergent<00:00:52.020> since<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.469> already<00:00:52.920> mentioned

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
with divergent since I already mentioned

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.920 
with divergent since I already mentioned
it<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.730> started<00:00:53.910> reading<00:00:54.180> divergent<00:00:54.780> about

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.690 
of has I got a soft spot in my heart
because<00:01:07.040> insurgent<00:01:08.040> was<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> book<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.580> was

because insurgent was the book I was

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.730 
because insurgent was the book I was
reading<00:01:08.880> if<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.150> guys<00:01:09.330> don't<00:01:09.720> remember<00:01:09.990> when

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
reading if you guys don't remember when

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.260 
reading if you guys don't remember when
my<00:01:10.920> Papa<00:01:11.159> was<00:01:11.430> really<00:01:11.670> sick<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
my Papa was really sick and in the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.690 
my Papa was really sick and in the
hospital<00:01:12.390> just<00:01:13.080> before<00:01:13.350> he<00:01:13.470> passed<00:01:13.500> away<00:01:13.890> we

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
hospital just before he passed away we

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.950 
hospital just before he passed away we
were<00:01:14.820> pretty<00:01:15.000> much<00:01:15.090> at<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.390> hospital<00:01:15.540> like

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
were pretty much at the hospital like

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.749 
were pretty much at the hospital like
almost<00:01:16.229> every<00:01:16.530> single<00:01:16.710> day<00:01:16.950> visiting<00:01:17.340> him<00:01:17.549> and

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
almost every single day visiting him and

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.670 
almost every single day visiting him and
so<00:01:17.970> I'm<00:01:18.299> somebody<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.869> don't<00:01:18.990> like<00:01:19.409> to

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
so I'm somebody that I don't like to

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.499 
so I'm somebody that I don't like to
deal<00:01:20.189> with<00:01:20.400> things<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.880> are<00:01:20.970> bothering<00:01:21.119> me

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
deal with things that are bothering me

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.789 
deal with things that are bothering me
so<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.689> sidetracked<00:01:22.320> myself

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
so I sidetracked myself

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.249 
so I sidetracked myself
so<00:01:23.340> insurgent<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.210> don't<00:01:24.390> think<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.630> ever<00:01:24.840> looked

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
so insurgent I don't think I ever looked

kind of wish I'd dragged it out of it

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.429 
kind of wish I'd dragged it out of it
more<00:02:17.969> because<00:02:18.269> it<00:02:18.420> was<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:18.750> bittersweet<00:02:19.049> to

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
more because it was so bittersweet to

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.380 
more because it was so bittersweet to

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
on reading then this is a series that I

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.950 
on reading then this is a series that I
highly<00:04:44.669> recommend<00:04:44.699> especially<00:04:45.539> seeing<00:04:45.779> as

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
highly recommend especially seeing as

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.689 
highly recommend especially seeing as
it's<00:04:46.289> now<00:04:46.680> leading<00:04:46.979> into<00:04:47.279> spring<00:04:47.520> and<00:04:47.639> summer

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
it's now leading into spring and summer

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.219 
it's now leading into spring and summer
it's<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:48.150> perfect<00:04:48.419> time<00:04:48.689> to<00:04:48.840> read<00:04:49.020> these

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 
books so I think they're kind of

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.159 
books so I think they're kind of
targeted<00:04:51.120> more<00:04:51.270> towards<00:04:51.330> thirteen<00:04:52.050> and

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
targeted more towards thirteen and

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:53.959 
targeted more towards thirteen and
fifteen<00:04:52.289> year<00:04:52.650> olds<00:04:52.830> but<00:04:53.219> I'm<00:04:53.400> someone<00:04:53.759> that's

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:55.640 
fifteen year olds but I'm someone that's

probably going to be reading young adult
novels<00:04:56.129> for<00:04:56.610> my<00:04:56.699> entire<00:04:56.969> life<00:04:57.029> just<00:04:57.419> because<00:04:57.629> I
