I<00:01:53.750> think<00:01:54.750> it's<00:01:54.929> probably<00:01:55.319> a<00:01:55.590> local<00:01:56.099> donkey<00:01:56.819> of

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.139 
I think it's probably a local donkey of
course<00:01:58.229> if<00:01:58.470> you<00:01:58.679> don't<00:01:58.890> want<00:01:59.190> the<00:01:59.340> donkey<00:01:59.789> you

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
course if you don't want the donkey you

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.120 
course if you don't want the donkey you
could<00:02:00.390> take<00:02:00.599> a<00:02:00.630> small<00:02:00.840> plane<00:02:01.349> it<00:02:01.830> goes

could take a small plane it goes

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.719

straight<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.849> hotel<00:02:03.209> I<00:02:04.340> think<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.459> should

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
straight to the hotel I think I should
