something like that and then let's see

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.610 
something like that and then let's see
let's<00:01:26.720> talk<00:01:26.930> about<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.560> intel<00:01:28.430> vs<00:01:29.210> AMD<00:01:29.620> debate

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
let's talk about the intel vs AMD debate

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.190 
let's talk about the intel vs AMD debate
okay<00:01:31.370> the<00:01:31.550> bulldozers<00:01:32.120> we<00:01:32.630> all<00:01:32.810> know<00:01:33.020> they

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
okay the bulldozers we all know they

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.860 
okay the bulldozers we all know they
came<00:01:33.410> out<00:01:33.620> and<00:01:33.820> they're<00:01:34.820> not<00:01:34.970> nearly<00:01:35.360> as<00:01:35.600> good

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
came out and they're not nearly as good

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.500 
came out and they're not nearly as good
as<00:01:36.050> they<00:01:36.260> were<00:01:37.130> like<00:01:37.370> as<00:01:37.580> everyone<00:01:38.000> was<00:01:38.120> hoping

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
as they were like as everyone was hoping

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.710 
as they were like as everyone was hoping
for<00:01:39.400> first<00:01:40.400> off<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:42.490> 8120<00:01:43.490> i<00:01:43.940> think<00:01:44.210> is<00:01:44.510> what

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
for first off the 8120 i think is what

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.680 
for first off the 8120 i think is what
it<00:01:44.840> is<00:01:44.870> on<00:01:45.440> the<00:01:45.740> three<00:01:46.430> point<00:01:46.700> three<00:01:46.760> gigahertz

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
it is on the three point three gigahertz

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.840 
it is on the three point three gigahertz
oh<00:01:48.050> no<00:01:48.200> it's<00:01:48.350> 3.1<00:01:48.770> this<00:01:50.020> 6100<00:01:51.020> is<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.410> 3.3<00:01:52.100> but

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
oh no it's 3.1 this 6100 is the 3.3 but

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.480 
oh no it's 3.1 this 6100 is the 3.3 but
their<00:01:53.450> performance<00:01:54.410> is<00:01:54.560> not<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:55.190> greatest

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
their performance is not the greatest

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.300 
their performance is not the greatest
but<00:01:55.970> i<00:01:56.930> guess<00:01:57.350> they're<00:01:57.680> still<00:01:57.980> priced

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
but i guess they're still priced

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.310 
but i guess they're still priced
privilege<00:01:58.880> which<00:01:59.030> is<00:01:59.180> pretty<00:01:59.390> good<00:01:59.510> frame<00:01:59.960> d

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
privilege which is pretty good frame d

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.500 
privilege which is pretty good frame d
like<00:02:00.770> AMD<00:02:01.130> has<00:02:01.340> always<00:02:01.670> been<00:02:01.820> about<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.120> price

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
like AMD has always been about the price

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.330 
like AMD has always been about the price
there's<00:02:03.140> still<00:02:03.380> priced<00:02:03.620> pretty<00:02:03.860> low<00:02:04.130> so

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
there's still priced pretty low so

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.020 
there's still priced pretty low so
that's<00:02:04.520> good<00:02:05.680> for<00:02:06.680> like<00:02:06.920> price<00:02:07.400> to

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
that's good for like price to

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.449 
that's good for like price to
performance<00:02:08.179> ratio<00:02:08.840> those<00:02:09.830> are<00:02:10.069> pretty<00:02:10.310> good

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
performance ratio those are pretty good

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.839 
performance ratio those are pretty good

threading like the 2600 k and that's

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.620 
threading like the 2600 k and that's
pretty<00:03:24.739> sad<00:03:25.130> that<00:03:25.430> it<00:03:25.550> just<00:03:25.790> it<00:03:26.030> just<00:03:26.090> barely

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
pretty sad that it just it just barely

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.509 
pretty sad that it just it just barely
pulls<00:03:27.019> away<00:03:27.230> from<00:03:27.380> it<00:03:27.800> in<00:03:27.920> that<00:03:28.070> and<00:03:28.100> that's<00:03:28.400> a

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
pulls away from it in that and that's a

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.810 
pulls away from it in that and that's a
difference<00:03:28.910> of<00:03:30.370> that's<00:03:31.370> a<00:03:31.459> difference<00:03:31.730> of

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
difference of that's a difference of

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.210 
difference of that's a difference of
four<00:03:32.060> cores<00:03:32.360> but<00:03:32.720> i<00:03:32.930> guess<00:03:33.530> if<00:03:33.680> you<00:03:33.769> look<00:03:33.980> at<00:03:34.190> it

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
four cores but i guess if you look at it

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.660 
four cores but i guess if you look at it
in<00:03:34.519> that<00:03:34.550> sort<00:03:35.450> of<00:03:35.540> sense<00:03:38.980> AMD<00:03:39.980> is<00:03:40.250> doing

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
in that sort of sense AMD is doing

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.120 
in that sort of sense AMD is doing
fairly<00:03:41.209> well<00:03:41.510> because<00:03:42.170> i<00:03:42.440> don't<00:03:42.890> know<00:03:42.920> if<00:03:43.070> you

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
fairly well because i don't know if you

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.420 
fairly well because i don't know if you
guys<00:03:43.280> know<00:03:43.580> how<00:03:43.760> it's<00:03:43.940> mapped<00:03:44.269> out<00:03:44.510> but<00:03:45.430> it's

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
guys know how it's mapped out but it's

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.270 
guys know how it's mapped out but it's
mapped<00:03:46.820> out<00:03:47.060> to<00:03:47.480> like<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.290> bulldozers<00:03:48.920> are

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
mapped out to like the bulldozers are

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.340 
mapped out to like the bulldozers are
mapped<00:03:49.580> out<00:03:49.790> to<00:03:50.090> modules<00:03:50.720> there's<00:03:51.049> four

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
mapped out to modules there's four

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.229 
mapped out to modules there's four
modules<00:03:51.590> there<00:03:52.130> in<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:52.310> four<00:03:52.519> corners<00:03:52.549> and<00:03:53.120> in

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
modules there in the four corners and in

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.650 
modules there in the four corners and in
each<00:03:53.360> module<00:03:53.660> there's<00:03:54.110> two<00:03:54.380> cores<00:03:54.850> which<00:03:55.850> it's

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
each module there's two cores which it's

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.140 
each module there's two cores which it's
basically<00:03:57.140> like<00:03:57.380> the<00:03:57.440> cores<00:03:57.860> like<00:03:58.610> they<00:03:58.940> can

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
basically like the cores like they can

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.150 
basically like the cores like they can
operate<00:03:59.360> at<00:03:59.780> different<00:03:59.810> speeds<00:04:00.500> which<00:04:00.830> is<00:04:00.980> why

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
operate at different speeds which is why

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.850 
operate at different speeds which is why
they<00:04:01.580> are<00:04:01.610> determined<00:04:02.390> as<00:04:02.540> like<00:04:03.230> coors<00:04:03.560> why

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
they are determined as like coors why

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.440 
they are determined as like coors why
people<00:04:04.220> say<00:04:04.400> they're<00:04:04.640> each<00:04:04.850> individual

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
people say they're each individual

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.289 
people say they're each individual
course<00:04:05.690> however<00:04:05.959> they<00:04:06.350> share<00:04:06.650> parts<00:04:07.130> so<00:04:07.910> I

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
course however they share parts so I

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.780 
course however they share parts so I
mean<00:04:08.930> it<00:04:09.080> I<00:04:09.200> don't<00:04:09.500> know<00:04:09.650> it's<00:04:09.980> just<00:04:10.310> not<00:04:10.610> as

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
mean it I don't know it's just not as

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.479
