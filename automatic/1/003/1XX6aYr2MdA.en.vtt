Klein's<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:00.729> key<00:02:00.970> here<00:02:01.210> he's<00:02:01.630> the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
Klein's the key here he's the

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.170 
Klein's the key here he's the
quarterback<00:02:02.049> he's<00:02:02.409> 65<00:02:02.830> about<00:02:03.100> 226<00:02:04.000> pounds
