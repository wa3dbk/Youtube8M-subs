00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.789
 eisel aut all welcome for the revue 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.140
 from episode number 349 then it's a 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:20.849
 off-the-shelf as well a special but 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.070
 it's a good special issue I found that 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.449
 it was a nice off-series so good 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.640
 as you know I repeat it often 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.500
 I like the specials that we 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.810
 reveals things and shows us 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.879
 things that we are not interested in 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.400
 out of series we see missions 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.230
 secondary between the team is touching 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.820
 who it does not interest me 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.710
 which interests me is to know a little 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.940
 little things we do not know and in 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.660
 this episode vianne to some in 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.880
 a few words that we did not know 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.920
 so I really enjoyed this out 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.100
 series I also saw on twitter that you 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.559
 are rather numerous to have appreciated 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.900
 of investigated so much better then in this 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.420
 episode so we saw of course that I 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.180
 hidden so currently from sarah turin 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.220
 so is apparently not going at all 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.070
 it's not going at all in his brain he 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.930
 inevitably this is his teammate imagine 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.460
 the roto that kills and sakura and that 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.259
 would not go for quite a while 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.030
 they are really guilty while 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.740
 finally good we'll see later but 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.229
 I'm not going to talk about it because 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.479
 will be spoil so they are really 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.340
 really not good we see that in time 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.479
 of war so we in war time 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.940
 that's the reason why 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.649
 has died the ring and there are in time of 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.640
 war so we see the chicago tsoup who 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.630
 was a little younger we see a 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.130
 little bit everyone that more 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.840
 young launches she sees that father 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.080
 of garat we see chicago and we see 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.729
 this in diamond eyes also we see them 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.240
 all younger so that's nice 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.759
 to have 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.100
 anyway so for those who 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.170
 are the most the evening we have them 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.360
 most accurate memories so had 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.429
 seen at the time in the kakashi gaiden 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.700
 whereas kÃ¤fig hayden is not saying 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:55.709
 nonsense it's the episode shippuden 5920 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.280
 which is a double episode kiev 1,260 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:58.020
 two episodes 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.729
 I think that's it anyway 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.069
 it was khakassie gaiden so with the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.800
 first appearance of oblique ocha and 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:07.440
 we see for a moment that minato is 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.130
 faced with a number 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.840
 lv of enemies on the young cmj bridge 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.400
 how much cannabis I believe 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.280
 that's it yeah I think that's it and we 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.030
 diols which sees ninjas therefore 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.060
 ninjas from the village of sushi kage la nisa 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.340
 derogate so we see them do not see 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.470
 the fight we just see minato and saw 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.690
 that he is alive after one suspects that he 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.030
 has gained the fill lapalu has already 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.830
 from the very beginning in to an information that 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.680
 comes from the mouth of below chic 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.370
 watchful he says they sent 1000 and 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.780
 half to defend and that only one he has 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.850
 so named who rust five colors 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.130
 and what is it used for, it means 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.380
 is that a youngster and you shit royce 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.780
 nkou got through it 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.870
 would like to say that at this episode without 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.000
 1920 sent minato fight these people 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.000
 and not see any of my fight there 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.200
 had a thousand and a half and mila early was successful 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.330
 to kill is lille 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.540
 nthe 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.130
 we honestly incredible I hope 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.510
 one day we will have good off series we 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.730
 will see the fight because frankly 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.530
 since the time I had seen steppic 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.570
 12 episodes and I had seen minato 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.650
 confronted with so many france in easter 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.750
 it's obvious but there is a lot 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.840
 I was told oh there I find loved 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.300
 see this fight anyway from this 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.400
 do are animated gives his resignation 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.140
 since there are a lot of losses and where 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.870
 he prefers to resign 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.370
 but still 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.200
 wants to name denis nato in 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.580
 instead of winning like that viksna 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.580
 everything is pretty close to sendai but 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.989
 finally it will be more a double cabin 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.940
 which will have since 100 m but remains in 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.159
 the shadow but in my opinion advice 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.830
 a lot minato minato agrees to 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:48.540
 reluctantly minato accept him yes by 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.370
 against against heart for two areas 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.049
 since d'enzo wanted to put in the place 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.879
 to the roadshows marc or so I you 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.920
 lets imagine a brown street hokage 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.170
 it's anything but good in everything 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.239
 case anyway in waters 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.860
 always in the shadows always with 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.390
 unhealthy ideas really i can not 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.340
 saquer style frankly I would like 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.319
 can not really bag and it is not 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.750
 happy other than either Monaco or 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.700
 be engaged brief he has nothing to say that 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.440
 anyway we also learn in those 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.480
 in these episodes the family name of rink 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.910
 we did not know we did not know 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.000
 so it's 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:23.669
 latta to three in total as sarine 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.690
 saw are there that disturbed me is me 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.460
 also so 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.520
 a coronation we say of minato 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.350
 so his passages as co kage 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.930
 it's pretty cool that suits him well 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.900
 small the little hat and in the end 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.550
 episode so we got fed up we got 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.520
 an explanation on the fact of kakashi 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.990
 and the tip is actually minato for a 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.670
 little by little if you change 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.200
 to exchange ideas knows a little I 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.900
 believe this is the project he has 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.570
 so referred to the language center or 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.040
 so we see for the first classic 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.930
 but his holding of the shade with the arbois 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.280
 showed very classy in the end the little 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.040
 image with mask and sharingan 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.180
 frankly super 15 so here at the heart 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.370
 this support is an out of series 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.080
 it happened stuff from the masses of 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.000
 ice inside but we learn things 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.830
 so I honestly admit I'm kiffe and 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.260
 I think it was a super port 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.140
 series I wanted to ask you a question 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.580
 on the other hand give you your opinion 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.830
 please since as I 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.140
 explained it on the back life and they 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.940
 right now on negotiations with the tv 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.550
 tokyo as regards the right of 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.070
 broadcast images of naruto shippuuden 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.640

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.740
