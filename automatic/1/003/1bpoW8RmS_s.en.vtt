00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.790 
it is it's uh it's only about a two-foot
thing<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:46.630> know<00:02:46.720> if<00:02:47.020> you're<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.709> know

standing back you know several feet
they're<00:02:51.580> invisible<00:02:51.850> so<00:02:52.500> but<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:53.620> is<00:02:53.650> an<00:02:53.890> honest

scuff<00:03:07.900> up<00:03:08.080> pretty<00:03:08.680> quickly<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.970> sill<00:03:10.239> plates

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
scuff up pretty quickly the sill plates

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.920 
scuff up pretty quickly the sill plates
are<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:10.810> little<00:03:10.959> bit<00:03:11.170> vulnerable<00:03:11.880> these

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
are a little bit vulnerable these

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.449 
are a little bit vulnerable these
plastic<00:03:13.930> pieces<00:03:13.959> can<00:03:14.560> be<00:03:14.680> a<00:03:14.709> bit<00:03:14.890> vulnerable

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
plastic pieces can be a bit vulnerable

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.640 
plastic pieces can be a bit vulnerable
especially<00:03:16.180> people<00:03:16.630> that<00:03:16.780> rings<00:03:17.110> and<00:03:17.350> so<00:03:17.500> on

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
especially people that rings and so on

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.350 
especially people that rings and so on
and<00:03:17.920> this<00:03:18.340> one<00:03:18.519> is<00:03:18.670> actually<00:03:18.820> really<00:03:19.209> nice

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
and this one is actually really nice

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.350 
and this one is actually really nice
this<00:03:19.690> so<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.290> aluminum<00:03:20.470> sill<00:03:20.920> plate<00:03:21.190> has<00:03:22.150> no

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
this so the aluminum sill plate has no

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.610 
this so the aluminum sill plate has no
major<00:03:22.870> scratches

major scratches

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.610

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
can wear on the bolsters and this one

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.559 
can wear on the bolsters and this one
this<00:03:32.530> one<00:03:32.739> isn't

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
this one isn't

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.789 
this one isn't
actually<00:03:34.840> looks<00:03:35.579> new<00:03:37.109> so<00:03:38.109> there's<00:03:38.290> no<00:03:38.439> marks

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
what I'd say is a perfect car

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.440 
what I'd say is a perfect car
so<00:03:57.609> the<00:03:58.560> c4s<00:03:59.560> bid<00:04:00.129> that<00:04:00.310> this<00:04:00.459> car<00:04:00.730> is<00:04:00.760> hoarsely

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
so the c4s bid that this car is hoarsely

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.970 
so the c4s bid that this car is hoarsely
four-wheel<00:04:02.169> drive<00:04:02.469> based<00:04:02.889> on<00:04:03.159> the<00:04:03.370> on<00:04:03.909> the

the<00:04:10.689> weight<00:04:10.900> of<00:04:10.930> the<00:04:11.079> car<00:04:11.459> and<00:04:12.459> can<00:04:12.879> shift

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
the weight of the car and can shift

suspension<00:04:58.419> brakes<00:04:59.639> contribute<00:05:00.639> almost<00:05:01.419> half

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
suspension brakes contribute almost half

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.790 
suspension brakes contribute almost half
of<00:05:01.930> a<00:05:02.020> lot<00:05:02.199> times<00:05:02.530> visa<00:05:03.190> be<00:05:03.430> the<00:05:03.759> turbo<00:05:04.240> so<00:05:04.900> but

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
of a lot times visa be the turbo so but

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.490 
of a lot times visa be the turbo so but
a<00:05:05.979> less<00:05:06.159> complicated<00:05:06.490> engine<00:05:07.090> less<00:05:07.659> costly<00:05:08.199> to

a less complicated engine less costly to
to<00:05:09.099> maintain<00:05:09.900> and<00:05:11.220> probably<00:05:12.220> a<00:05:12.430> little<00:05:12.940> bit

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
to maintain and probably a little bit

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.159 
to maintain and probably a little bit
better<00:05:13.659> at<00:05:14.530> low<00:05:14.710> speeds<00:05:15.159> and<00:05:15.840> in<00:05:16.840> city<00:05:17.110> driving

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
better at low speeds and in city driving

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.399 
better at low speeds and in city driving
so<00:05:17.770> here<00:05:18.130> you<00:05:18.219> go<00:05:18.400> it's<00:05:19.050> the<00:05:20.050> final
