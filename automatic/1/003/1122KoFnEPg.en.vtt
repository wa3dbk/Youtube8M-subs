00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.700
 That's right. Who's talking here is a 

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:07.560
 Greek attack and I do not know where 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.300
 start because I never wanted to bring 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.580
 This video here on the channel has been talking about 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.160
 this video is real and what is really 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.080
 happening to me to who likes mine 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.090
 channel for those who support me is always me 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.250
 wondering why I 'm delaying posting 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.380
 among other things and by this pressure the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.260
 What happens? I decided to speak what is 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.060
 really happening here watching 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.010
 My videos know that it took forever to 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.800
 bet about one month two months and 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.499
 half in this video comes to say that I'm going 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.120
 Give my channel a break, and I will. 

00:00:34.499 --> 00:00:38.550
 stop with my channel I have to 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.440
 to say that I will return soon with a 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.239
 structure and I hope you do not 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.379
 Leave me alone, will you ask me why? 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.819
 that I'm going to stop 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.219
 It's simple, I do not have a situation. 

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:49.530
 good financial position is in the first 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.019
 I did not imagine it would be so difficult 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.139
 just like today to start on the internet 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.639
 It has half mega very bad also the only 

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:58.469
 tool that I have to edit a 

00:00:56.639 --> 00:01:00.179
 notebook that I won from my mother some 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.609
 Years ago I 'm not complaining about him. 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:04.619
 with each other but for the things I do 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.659
 Too bad he said he had to suffer. 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.549
 heavy and getting worse and it just does not 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.729
 To believe him, my father ends up 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.740
 nervous because it crashes and this gives to 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.479
 listen to the audio and this is impossible not 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.850
 have a good financial situation that 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.920
 to buy a decent pc and here all 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.960
 know that for you to have a 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.159
 quality you need to invest is not 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.750
 This happens to me 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.299
 Last year I started working and 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.950
 I bought my capture card and finally 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.770
 I know that change I said now I'll be able to 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.409
 bring videos much more often 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.689
 one without pc does not glue with all these 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.280
 problems and if I decided to record a 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.979
 video with an idea out a good idea 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.259
 cool says a homemade tripod to put 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.240
 cell phone is simply the only means 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.439
 the time to record the cell phone has dropped 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.770
 camera broke 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.170
 This is what made me think. It made me sad. 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.939
 did take time school'm also 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.469
 in the second year of high school 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.170
 getting complicated 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:00.359
 there's my dad who's my best friend man 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.920
 that you should support me but you tell me that my 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:03.719
 videos of disgust for him that nobody 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.939
 like my videos that left me 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.380
 quite upset and make me a while 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.780
 made to stop to think 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.130
 I'm not leaving the channel, I'm not going. 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.280
 stop at the canal because the thing that most 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.740
 I like doing in life 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.480
 a video posted on youtube and hopefully 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.790
 you of heart do not always abandon me 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.240
 continue to support me and I have to 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.069
 To say that I 'm coming back soon is me. 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.640

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:30.630
