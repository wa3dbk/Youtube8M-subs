00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
all right people you tell me if y'all

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.500 
all right people you tell me if y'all
hear<00:00:56.730> any<00:00:56.940> similarities<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.929> that<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:59.910> jcm800

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.260 
attempting to copy the jcm800 of a pod
2.0<00:01:07.229> which<00:01:07.470> was<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.979> one<00:01:08.189> which<00:01:08.610> means<00:01:08.820> they

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
2.0 which was that one which means they

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.100 
2.0 which was that one which means they
were<00:01:09.390> modeling<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.619> pod<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.950> Plato<00:01:11.159> modeling

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
were modeling the pod to Plato modeling

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.840 
were modeling the pod to Plato modeling
22:04<00:01:13.110> model<00:01:13.440> from<00:01:13.590> 1990<00:01:14.220> which<00:01:14.399> is<00:01:14.580> kind<00:01:14.789> of

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
22:04 model from 1990 which is kind of

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.480 
22:04 model from 1990 which is kind of
the<00:01:14.970> jean<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.750> GNX<00:01:16.170> hyper-model<00:01:16.830> was

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
the jean with the GNX hyper-model was

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.920 
the jean with the GNX hyper-model was
kind<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.729> based<00:01:17.940> on<00:01:18.119> when<00:01:18.270> i<00:01:18.299> created<00:01:18.690> it<00:01:18.780> and

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
kind of based on when i created it and

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.980 
kind of based on when i created it and
the<00:01:19.289> thing<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.009> heart<00:01:20.190> b250<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:21.509> kind<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.869> a

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
the thing on the heart b250 is kind of a

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.380 
the thing on the heart b250 is kind of a
22:03<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.159> there<00:01:23.310> will<00:01:23.399> be<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.580> slight<00:01:23.789> variance

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
22:03 so there will be a slight variance

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.350 
22:03 so there will be a slight variance
in<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> sound<00:01:25.340> but<00:01:26.340> these<00:01:26.909> are<00:01:27.090> pretty

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
in the sound but these are pretty

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.340 
in the sound but these are pretty
accurate

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
accurate

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.580 
accurate
I've<00:01:29.190> had<00:01:29.460> some<00:01:29.670> witnesses<00:01:30.149> attest<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.840> my

I've had some witnesses attest to my

tones and they've told me that they're
pretty<00:01:32.940> close<00:01:33.210> but<00:01:33.899> you<00:01:34.020> tell<00:01:34.200> me<00:01:34.289> what<00:01:34.409> you

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
pretty close but you tell me what you

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.410 
pretty close but you tell me what you
think<00:01:34.740> tell<00:01:35.490> me<00:01:35.610> if<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.729> think<00:01:35.909> I'm<00:01:36.000> just<00:01:36.030> some

going to demo a modern game which is
their<00:01:53.789> version<00:01:53.819> of<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.390> jcm<00:01:54.899> 900<00:01:57.020> all<00:01:58.020> right

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
their version of the jcm 900 all right

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.070 
their version of the jcm 900 all right
now<00:01:58.470> this<00:01:58.739> is<00:01:58.800> the<00:01:59.099> jcm<00:01:59.580> 900<00:01:59.819> model<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.840> is

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
now this is the jcm 900 model that is

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.020 
now this is the jcm 900 model that is
actually<00:02:01.470> programmed<00:02:02.039> Aladin<00:02:02.429> x1<00:02:02.789> it's<00:02:02.910> not<00:02:03.000> a

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
hyper model that I created maybe I'll do

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.589 
hyper model that I created maybe I'll do
a<00:02:05.340> video<00:02:05.580> one<00:02:05.879> day<00:02:06.030> where<00:02:06.179> I<00:02:06.209> show<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.450> how<00:02:06.569> to

a video one day where I show you how to
make<00:02:06.840> hyper-models<00:02:07.440> that's<00:02:07.770> pretty<00:02:08.069> cool

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
make hyper-models that's pretty cool

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.880 
make hyper-models that's pretty cool
process<00:02:08.580> takes<00:02:09.300> hours<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.720> do<00:02:09.840> though<00:02:09.989> if<00:02:10.769> you

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
process takes hours to do though if you

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.619 
process takes hours to do though if you
want<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.160> get<00:02:11.250> them<00:02:11.400> remotely<00:02:11.819> close<00:02:11.970> here<00:02:12.540> we

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
want to get them remotely close here we

basically is the same thing with some
slightly<00:05:20.689> different<00:05:20.840> gain<00:05:21.409> stages<00:05:21.949> but<00:05:22.159> it's

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
slightly different gain stages but it's

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.689 
slightly different gain stages but it's
a<00:05:22.520> very<00:05:22.819> similar<00:05:23.180> tone<00:05:23.780> today<00:05:24.370> not<00:05:25.370> quite

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:25.699
