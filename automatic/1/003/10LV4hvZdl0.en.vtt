00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
first off I'm going to tighten up my

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.259 
first off I'm going to tighten up my
trucks<00:00:23.070> as<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.609> can<00:00:23.760> see<00:00:23.939> here<00:00:24.180> I'm

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
trucks as you can see here I'm

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.570 
trucks as you can see here I'm
tightening<00:00:24.689> both<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.140> them<00:00:25.260> up<00:00:25.439> pretty<00:00:26.400> tight

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
tightening both of them up pretty tight

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.820 
tightening both of them up pretty tight
just<00:00:27.210> about<00:00:27.420> as<00:00:27.570> tight<00:00:27.810> as<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:28.050> could<00:00:28.260> get<00:00:28.380> them

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
just about as tight as I could get them

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.179 
just about as tight as I could get them
well<00:00:29.519> not<00:00:29.939> quite<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.539> tight<00:00:30.840> but<00:00:31.009> you'll<00:00:32.009> get

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
well not quite that tight but you'll get

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.819 
well not quite that tight but you'll get
the<00:00:32.309> point<00:00:32.489> then<00:00:33.360> put<00:00:34.020> down<00:00:34.140> my<00:00:34.350> board<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.710> I

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
the point then put down my board and I

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.010 
the point then put down my board and I
start<00:00:35.100> rolling<00:00:35.309> now<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.210> first<00:00:36.540> thing<00:00:36.750> about

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
start rolling now the first thing about

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.160 
start rolling now the first thing about
tight<00:00:37.410> trucks<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:39.329> can't<00:00:39.570> just<00:00:39.840> lean

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
tight trucks is that you can't just lean

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.530 
tight trucks is that you can't just lean
on<00:00:40.469> them<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:40.950> order<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.790> turn<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.210> have<00:00:42.360> to

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
on them in order to turn you have to

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.150 
on them in order to turn you have to
lift<00:00:42.780> up<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.170> front<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.500> your<00:00:43.590> board<00:00:43.860> as<00:00:44.040> you

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
lift up the front of your board as you

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.069 
lift up the front of your board as you
can<00:00:44.309> see<00:00:44.640> I'm<00:00:44.789> kind<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:45.120> ticked<00:00:45.480> tacking<00:00:45.870> I'm

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
can see I'm kind of ticked tacking I'm

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.049 
can see I'm kind of ticked tacking I'm
lifting<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.010> front<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.399> order<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.820> turn

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
lifting up the front in order to turn

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.200 
lifting up the front in order to turn
it's<00:00:49.020> called<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.800> kick<00:00:50.129> turn<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:51.829> that's<00:00:52.829> fine<00:00:53.210> a

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
it's called a kick turn so that's fine a

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.389 
it's called a kick turn so that's fine a
lot<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.230> beginners<00:00:55.649> feel<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:56.039> they<00:00:56.160> need<00:00:56.340> to

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
lot of beginners feel like they need to

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.540 
lot of beginners feel like they need to
have<00:00:56.550> their<00:00:56.730> trucks<00:00:57.059> really<00:00:57.570> tight<00:00:57.840> because

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
have their trucks really tight because

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.430 
have their trucks really tight because
it<00:00:59.550> feels<00:00:59.879> more<00:01:00.149> stable<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.989> board<00:01:01.230> goes

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
it feels more stable and the board goes

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.490 
it feels more stable and the board goes
more<00:01:01.770> straight<00:01:02.340> rather<00:01:03.090> than<00:01:03.390> moving<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:04.350> it

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
more straight rather than moving in it

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.380 
more straight rather than moving in it
they<00:01:04.830> feel<00:01:05.100> like<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.460> helps<00:01:05.760> their<00:01:05.880> balance

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
they feel like it helps their balance

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.560 
they feel like it helps their balance
out<00:01:06.630> however<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:08.100> think<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:08.909> better<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.210> learn

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
out however I think it's better to learn

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.109 
out however I think it's better to learn
with<00:01:10.080> looser<00:01:10.799> trucks<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.430> loosen<00:01:11.760> your<00:01:11.850> trucks

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
with looser trucks to loosen your trucks

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.060 
with looser trucks to loosen your trucks
up<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.420> bit<00:01:12.600> because<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.110> gives<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.409> more<00:01:13.740> room

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
up a bit because it gives you more room

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.109 
up a bit because it gives you more room
to<00:01:14.760> move<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:16.200> actually<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.909> easier<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
to move it actually is easier on the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.700 
to move it actually is easier on the
bounce<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.720> see<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.900> almost<00:01:19.080> fell<00:01:19.380> over

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
bounce so you can see I almost fell over

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.190 
bounce so you can see I almost fell over
right<00:01:19.740> there<00:01:20.100> yeah<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:21.299> have<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> very<00:01:21.840> hard<00:01:22.080> time

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
right there yeah I have a very hard time

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.590 
right there yeah I have a very hard time
writing<00:01:22.860> tight<00:01:23.460> trucks<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.270> makes<00:01:24.450> it

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
writing tight trucks and it makes it

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.780 
writing tight trucks and it makes it
very<00:01:24.780> hard<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.380> makes<00:01:25.530> my<00:01:25.710> style<00:01:26.280> look<00:01:26.520> really

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
very hard and makes my style look really

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.160 
very hard and makes my style look really
bad<00:01:27.030> looks<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.570> don't<00:01:27.750> know<00:01:27.900> what<00:01:28.049> I'm

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570

much you weigh but I probably weigh a
lot<00:01:44.009> more<00:01:44.070> than<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.850> lot<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.360> guys<00:01:45.590> so<00:01:46.590> when

very<00:02:17.770> loose<00:02:18.040> trucks<00:02:18.480> especially<00:02:19.480> for<00:02:20.110> all

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
very loose trucks especially for all

very loose trucks especially for all
those<00:02:20.380> manual<00:02:20.830> tricks<00:02:21.070> because<00:02:21.250> when<00:02:21.910> you're

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
those manual tricks because when you're

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.580 
those manual tricks because when you're
on<00:02:22.090> two<00:02:22.450> wheels<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:22.930> you're<00:02:23.050> doing<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.350> manual

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
on two wheels and you're doing a manual

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.950 
on two wheels and you're doing a manual
and<00:02:23.890> you<00:02:24.010> need<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.340> adjust<00:02:24.460> your<00:02:25.060> trucks<00:02:25.690> need

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
and you need to adjust your trucks need

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.440 
and you need to adjust your trucks need
to<00:02:26.050> go<00:02:26.230> with<00:02:26.530> you<00:02:26.860> they<00:02:27.490> need<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:27.790> go<00:02:27.970> with<00:02:28.270> the

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
to go with you they need to go with the

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.030 
to go with you they need to go with the
way<00:02:28.600> that<00:02:28.840> your<00:02:28.960> body<00:02:29.110> is<00:02:29.380> moving<00:02:29.620> so<00:02:29.920> your

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
way that your body is moving so your

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.580 
way that your body is moving so your
board<00:02:30.310> will<00:02:30.550> turn<00:02:30.930> sometimes<00:02:31.930> I<00:02:32.080> get<00:02:32.260> comments

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
board will turn sometimes I get comments

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.650 
board will turn sometimes I get comments
on<00:02:32.830> my<00:02:32.980> videos<00:02:33.340> like<00:02:33.580> wow<00:02:33.820> your<00:02:34.090> trucks<00:02:34.480> must

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
on my videos like wow your trucks must

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.780 
on my videos like wow your trucks must
be<00:02:34.870> super<00:02:35.440> tight<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.920> do<00:02:36.040> all<00:02:36.160> those<00:02:36.340> manual

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
be super tight to do all those manual

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.580 
be super tight to do all those manual
tricks<00:02:37.030> but<00:02:37.630> it's<00:02:37.780> actually<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.200> opposite

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
tricks but it's actually the opposite

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.070 
tricks but it's actually the opposite
the<00:02:38.800> trucks<00:02:39.100> are<00:02:39.280> loose<00:02:39.490> because<00:02:40.300> it<00:02:40.750> allows

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
the trucks are loose because it allows

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.210 
the trucks are loose because it allows
me<00:02:41.350> more<00:02:41.850> freedom<00:02:42.850> to<00:02:43.270> move<00:02:43.480> side<00:02:43.990> to<00:02:44.020> side<00:02:44.230> and

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
me more freedom to move side to side and

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.770 
me more freedom to move side to side and
I'll<00:02:45.430> show<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.670> this<00:02:45.880> shot<00:02:46.090> here<00:02:46.330> so<00:02:46.510> I<00:02:46.540> can

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
I'll show you this shot here so I can

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.390 
I'll show you this shot here so I can
show<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.410> difference<00:02:47.740> in<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:47.920> turning

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
show you the difference in the turning

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.040 
show you the difference in the turning
and<00:02:48.520> how<00:02:48.700> quickly<00:02:49.030> I<00:02:49.180> can<00:02:49.270> turn<00:02:49.630> by<00:02:49.780> just

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
and how quickly I can turn by just

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.160 
and how quickly I can turn by just
leaning<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:51.010> one<00:02:51.040> side<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.510> other<00:02:52.660> shot<00:02:52.960> I

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
leaning to one side and the other shot I

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.320 
leaning to one side and the other shot I
had<00:02:53.320> to<00:02:53.410> do<00:02:53.590> a<00:02:53.920> kick<00:02:54.250> turn<00:02:54.520> by<00:02:54.760> lifting<00:02:55.180> up<00:02:55.300> my

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
had to do a kick turn by lifting up my

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.270 
had to do a kick turn by lifting up my
front<00:02:55.690> truck<00:02:55.960> and<00:02:56.170> I<00:02:56.230> literally<00:02:56.740> almost<00:02:56.860> fell

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
front truck and I literally almost fell

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.300 
front truck and I literally almost fell
over<00:02:57.310> so<00:02:57.880> there<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:58.810> go

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
over so there you go

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.380 
over so there you go
obviously<00:03:00.310> whether<00:03:00.580> you're<00:03:00.850> gonna<00:03:01.000> have<00:03:01.270> your

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
obviously whether you're gonna have your

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.210 
obviously whether you're gonna have your
trucks<00:03:01.690> tight<00:03:01.990> or<00:03:02.260> loose<00:03:02.290> as<00:03:02.770> it<00:03:02.980> is<00:03:03.160> a

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
trucks tight or loose as it is a

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.790 
trucks tight or loose as it is a
personal<00:03:04.000> preference<00:03:04.510> but<00:03:04.720> I<00:03:05.140> personally

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
personal preference but I personally

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.130 
personal preference but I personally
recommend<00:03:06.130> starting<00:03:07.030> with<00:03:07.270> your<00:03:07.840> trucks

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
recommend starting with your trucks

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.540 
recommend starting with your trucks
loose<00:03:08.410> enough<00:03:08.709> to<00:03:08.740> where<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.190> have<00:03:09.490> the

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
loose enough to where you have the

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.400 
loose enough to where you have the
freedom<00:03:10.120> to<00:03:10.150> be<00:03:10.360> able<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.600> move<00:03:10.780> side<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.230> side

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
freedom to be able to move side to side

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.400 
freedom to be able to move side to side
and<00:03:12.270> just<00:03:13.270> like<00:03:13.390> in<00:03:13.540> this<00:03:13.660> video<00:03:13.959> I'm<00:03:14.080> riding
