00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.210 
such a hurry I was just listening to my
satellite<00:00:50.460> radio<00:00:50.880> is<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.500> this<00:00:52.500> guy<00:00:52.740> decides

satellite radio is this this guy decides

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.950 
satellite radio is this this guy decides
he<00:00:53.460> has<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.030> be<00:00:54.150> in<00:00:54.240> front<00:00:54.450> of<00:00:54.540> me<00:00:54.600> now<00:00:54.720> look

what is he gonna do now if I was going

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.780 
what is he gonna do now if I was going
to<00:00:56.550> pull<00:00:56.760> over<00:00:56.940> turn

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
to pull over turn

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.350 
to pull over turn
we<00:00:59.060> gotta<00:00:59.240> go<00:00:59.450> round<00:00:59.690> this<00:00:59.870> guy<00:01:00.050> now<00:01:00.290> -<00:01:01.120> in<00:01:02.120> a<00:01:02.210> no

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
we gotta go round this guy now - in a no

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.000 
we gotta go round this guy now - in a no
passing<00:01:02.600> zone

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.480 

so<00:01:05.640> anyway<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.000> was<00:01:06.300> listening<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:07.490> my

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
so anyway I was listening to my

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.950 
so anyway I was listening to my
satellite<00:01:09.060> radio<00:01:09.480> and<00:01:09.630> they're<00:01:09.750> talking

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
satellite radio and they're talking

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.930 
satellite radio and they're talking
about<00:01:11.000> accident<00:01:12.000> rates<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.600> semi-trucks

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
about accident rates and semi-trucks

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.530 
about accident rates and semi-trucks
I<00:01:15.000> guess<00:01:15.720> they<00:01:15.900> did<00:01:16.080> like<00:01:16.230> a<00:01:16.260> five-year<00:01:16.950> study

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
I guess they did like a five-year study

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.350 
I guess they did like a five-year study
and<00:01:18.540> they're<00:01:18.690> trying<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.230> determine<00:01:20.360> if

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
and they're trying to determine if

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.330 
and they're trying to determine if
there's<00:01:21.660> any<00:01:21.900> link<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.830> amount<00:01:23.130> of

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
there's any link to the amount of

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.420 
there's any link to the amount of
training<00:01:23.870> or<00:01:24.870> the<00:01:25.170> amount<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.620> experience

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
training or the amount of experience

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.290 
training or the amount of experience
that<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.670> driver<00:01:26.940> has<00:01:27.590> as<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.850> likelihood

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
that a driver has as to the likelihood

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.180 
that a driver has as to the likelihood
of<00:01:30.510> him<00:01:30.750> having<00:01:31.110> an<00:01:31.230> accident<00:01:33.470> and<00:01:34.470> right<00:01:34.680> and

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
of him having an accident and right and

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.660 
of him having an accident and right and
immediately<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:36.090> would<00:01:36.420> have<00:01:36.540> thought<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:37.670> of

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
immediately I would have thought that of

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.900 
immediately I would have thought that of
course<00:01:39.000> whoever<00:01:39.900> had<00:01:40.350> gone<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.220> an<00:01:41.340> actual

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
course whoever had gone to an actual

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.790 
course whoever had gone to an actual
school<00:01:43.040> you<00:01:44.040> know<00:01:44.160> not<00:01:44.430> not<00:01:44.850> linked<00:01:45.330> to<00:01:45.630> a

school you know not not linked to a

school you know not not linked to a
trucking<00:01:46.800> company<00:01:46.980> and<00:01:50.390> has<00:01:51.390> been<00:01:51.600> out<00:01:51.750> here

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
trucking company and has been out here

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.870 
trucking company and has been out here
for<00:01:52.260> at<00:01:52.350> least<00:01:52.410> a<00:01:52.770> year<00:01:52.800> or<00:01:53.280> two

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.789 

you<00:01:56.360> know<00:01:56.450> they<00:01:56.630> were<00:01:56.689> likelihood<00:01:57.350> of<00:01:57.469> having

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
you know they were likelihood of having

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.029 
you know they were likelihood of having
an<00:01:58.100> accident<00:01:58.520> at<00:01:58.820> that<00:01:59.030> point<00:01:59.530> would<00:02:00.530> be<00:02:00.740> lower

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
an accident at that point would be lower

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.550 
an accident at that point would be lower
than<00:02:01.820> somebody<00:02:02.390> that<00:02:02.659> just<00:02:02.899> came<00:02:03.200> out<00:02:03.380> of

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
than somebody that just came out of

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.990 
than somebody that just came out of
school<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:03.950> is<00:02:04.039> only<00:02:04.189> been<00:02:04.430> out<00:02:04.549> here<00:02:04.579> for<00:02:04.970> a

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
school and is only been out here for a

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.870 
school and is only been out here for a
month<00:02:05.210> or<00:02:05.450> two<00:02:05.479> or<00:02:06.200> three

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.240 

but<00:02:10.480> in<00:02:10.600> actuality<00:02:10.960> what<00:02:11.500> they<00:02:11.650> found<00:02:11.890> was

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
but in actuality what they found was

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.280 
but in actuality what they found was
there<00:02:12.550> is<00:02:12.730> no<00:02:13.180> correlation<00:02:13.780> at<00:02:14.380> all

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
there is no correlation at all

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.339 
there is no correlation at all
to<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.159> amount<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.549> experience<00:02:18.209> you<00:02:18.360> have<00:02:18.599> in

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
to the amount of experience you have in

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.110 
to the amount of experience you have in

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.440 

they<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:25.400> guess<00:02:26.400> they<00:02:26.580> broke<00:02:26.849> it<00:02:27.030> down<00:02:27.180> into

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
they I guess they broke it down into

they I guess they broke it down into
like<00:02:27.720> six<00:02:28.080> or<00:02:28.319> seven<00:02:28.459> categories

I<00:03:13.319> find<00:03:14.099> that<00:03:14.280> kind<00:03:14.610> of<00:03:14.760> shocking<00:03:15.439> well<00:03:16.439> I

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
I find that kind of shocking well I

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.699 
I find that kind of shocking well I
guess<00:03:16.830> not<00:03:17.040> really<00:03:17.430> because<00:03:18.349> if<00:03:19.349> you<00:03:19.530> ever

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
guess not really because if you ever

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.309 
guess not really because if you ever
listen<00:03:20.129> to<00:03:20.159> the<00:03:20.340> CB<00:03:20.730> radio<00:03:20.760> which<00:03:21.299> I<00:03:21.480> cannot<00:03:22.019> do

at all right I just can't take the
stupidity<00:03:25.439> I<00:03:25.970> really<00:03:26.970> can

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
stupidity I really can

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.940
