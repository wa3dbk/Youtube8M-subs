 kiss that for all because if it is not very 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.320

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.429
 Anna made a comment on a topic that 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.039
 I had read in the diary of a case of 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.230
 a businessman in bariloche is this a 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.080
 more or very rich man who had 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.080
 made of a 12-year-old girl who 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.400
 This 12 year old girl had been 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.189
 delivered by his mother 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.160
 exactly the topic of today we are with 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.329
 moms of sexually abused boys is 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.090
 be with us 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.550
 maría antonieta maría antonietas eyes 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.149
 maría antonieta who has a 15-year-old son 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.149
 years and I was 15 years old when it was the abuse 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.510
 and now it does not have to be 20 has 20 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.780
 years maria del rosario rodrigo that has 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.030
 a little boy of three years 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.730
 that they belong to an entity that 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.270
 is to realize now are two entities 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.430
 different and there is the other one that is here and 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.220
 here pdi that is maría de los ángeles 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.570
 of the bear that has a four-year-old son 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.060
 and Teresa Hernandez, yes 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.000
 Place social and digit of three years 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.979
 to realize already the name must say it 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.540
 says it all practically you in a 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.960
 principle also belonged to give us 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.960
 account 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.310
 the desire of all these movements 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:26.649
 together a few years ago on a daily basis 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.000
 and counts between where they are called to give us 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.390
 accounts we were a group of mothers 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.420
 and then if each one 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.649
 by adif in the area s then the 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.689
 unpredictable 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.670
 and another that now they are going to tell us 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:43.439
 all of that we are going to a break and there 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.439
 we get into this topic so thanks 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.039
 but let's get straight to the point 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.610
 women who present these four 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.990
 mothers these 4 fighters and that in addition 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.810
 have formed these different 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:10.250
 associations have suffered their children from 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:13.190
 sexual abuse almost all of them -1 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.170
 in schools by teachers in schools 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.900
 we will not go into detail of each one 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.470
 because I think that what this serves as 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.620
 a service for you that out there for 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.980
 there he has a suspicion and he does not believe his 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.319
 son or does not know how to approach the subject 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.510
 can you ever explain where 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:35.060
 we begin to realize we are good 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:39.650
 symptoms and signs are physical or 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.030
 behavioral and good will also depend 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.579
 we are talking about children very 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.829
 small is not true that in general they are 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:48.140
 the easiest target for this type of 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.720
 aggressors because our boy coat does not 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.600
 I believe they do not know how to express 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.820
 and finally they end up threatened they keep 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.060
 secretly they have fears in general 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.300
 we see more this kind of life ages of 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.590
 this preschool age more than 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.330
 preadolescents I argue that you 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.330
 they would ask their children and they would say 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.660
 Well, it can not be that the mother who 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.970
 really done does not suspect what 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.430
 directly the guy talks and says so 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.190
 many ways he is first saying it 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.560
 with your body because there are things that 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:25.390
 pulls out maybe it exteriorizes 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:31.610
 with all kinds of diseases or 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:33.980
 nightmares about bed or telling you that 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.709
 does not want to go to such place as 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.030
 example to us we went to school 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.860
 my son said he did not want to go to school 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.140
 but better than better 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.430
 before i went before i normally do a 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.650
 day I said to the school I do not want to go 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.600
 more then one said because they do not want 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.910
 more how were the vacations of 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.100
 look at us just what to us in the 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.990
 case 12 a 12 august ago very 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.330
 little five years of abuse 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.500
 of my son's violation of my son my 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.670
 son found semen 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.230
 the doctors then he said no 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.660
 I wanted to go to school and I attribute it 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.870
 to that as we had been on vacation 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.450
 of winter that was very cold but 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.580
 never something so timely until one day 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.470
 he left the school and said what he 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.900
 had passed clear 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.810
 He clearly said it but said 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.400
 words are going to make clear I did not tell myself if 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.320
 he did not tell me to rape or is not a 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.700
 word much more than ryder that all the 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.169
 very common language in a house that does not 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.480
 he says bad words or anything for the 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.880
 style and that he said that we 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.680
 we are all frozen, I suppose 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.630
 who must have statistics or 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.060
 verified but in the majority they are 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.210
 men the abusers the mafia of the 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.250
 Most of the 90% are male and you are a 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.900
 10 percent are women are supposed to 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.310
 also the victims are the most serious 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:54.950
 girls but there is not a man 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.770
 The subject of the male is more covered more covered 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.630
 is more masked more massive what is the 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.139
 male if all parents yes for 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.789
 remains 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:05.240
 of power of those who were authorities of the 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:07.729
 school teachers and teachers if there was 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.099
 some students also students of 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.779
 school to know when you were 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:13.430
 with this topic 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:16.729
 or chose it says directly that there is no 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.199
 strong but what we can see in the 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.819
 most of the cases up to us 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:22.400
 promptly we have an experience 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:24.590
 lived but we know there is a kind 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.229
 of statistics of where good in general 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:31.029
 you do not think you try to cover everything as 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:31.029
 any sexual institution 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.409
 apart the aggressor is covered up inside 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:38.689
 of a charge that is apparently 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:40.669
 Harmless very close to the creatures 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:42.469
 who can be a priest can be a 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.870
 teacher as a teacher 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:48.949
 someone of great confidence of the same 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:50.360
 clear family then it is the same father 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:53.089
 to sing logically is in 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.710
 more deputies when you call the 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:58.029
 the public identity of the 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:00.439
 rapists since thousand 998 we are 

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:02.900
 taking it forward in 2000 it 

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:06.940
 presented back there is half sanction in 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:12.860
 senators but there it remained there we want 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:14.060
 yes yes yes but it costs a lot of people with 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.410
 great ease 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.449
 as long as you have a good 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.039
 family containment is obvious a good 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:21.380
 psychologist behind ethyl 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:23.030
 and also maría antonieta must be for 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.410
 the terrible mothers as well as 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:29.990
 a boy if I do not want to go back to school 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:31.580
 you do not have to go to school but after 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.320
 we know very well that we do not have 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.630
 blame for anything accurate of what there is that 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.490
 to know is that grace to know how to listen 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.660
 who has us the boys are 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.220
 attention when they are 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.780
 manifesting as I said some 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.870
 way something is happening exactly 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:47.990
 I want to say that the phones give us 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.970
 account and acambi are in production 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.620
 I suppose you will not be bothered 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:54.050
 that any mother who has a certain 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:59.270
 concern can be called even though 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:07:01.400
 look silly the question always be 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.940
 attentive towards a mother be an aunt who 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.730
 is suspecting a familiar attention 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:10.430
 it is always a help 

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:12.980
