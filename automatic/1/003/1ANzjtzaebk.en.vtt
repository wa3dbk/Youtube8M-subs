00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.780
 who was going to imagine that a series of the 70 would be the pillar of 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.130
 inspiration for different disciplines such as electronic engineering 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.910
 cybernetic robotics and the opposition and that is thanks to the advances 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.970
 technology is already difficult to know what elements of today 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.640
 we want in the movies 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.710
 will go from fiction to reality it is about the robotic prosthesis 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.429
 artificial elements endowed with a certain autonomy for intelligence capable of 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.350
 perform a function of a missing part of questioning them 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.320
 there are more important things that this is taking into account 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.640
 helping affected people 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.360
 with having a prosthesis 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.730
 almost equal 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.440
 the aesthetics and movements of the human hand today many people who 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.640
 have lost some of its members was instead of new technologies 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.489
 applied 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.559
 Enjoy your day to day without any setbacks specific cases 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.960
 are developed today in the VallÃ¨s country to projects such as prosthetics 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.489
 articulated electronics that seek the benefit of people who have lost 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.390
 one of its superior members was first thought to be in need of 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.390
 people 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.620
 because they were just really the people who come 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.920
 it was not so 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.409
 rejected by the same society and rejected at least 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.790
 then it is due to the needs 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.360
 From mercadona protest to the five heroes 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.670
 everything is 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.040
 good looking to the movements of the real hand 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.350
 as many movements as in aesthetics 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.320
 seeing the different types of actions that exist 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.830
 the challenge was to develop a specific prosthesis according to the case 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.930
 and today they have managed to develop two prototypes 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.700
 jumps protest house 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.700
 with which he worked the elbow that have the bending movements 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.530
 extension 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.900
 of the five heroes 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.000
 at the request of adoption of the thumb 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.020
 the opposition of the thumb towards leo medium 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.439
 lesson extension of wrist first of the hand the second hand in this 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.890
 bet the amputation of eta the doll 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.579
 is that the presidency regretted that fame does not 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:10.999
 with movements 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:12.789
 - the turn of the hand 

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:15.820
 then the alliances of multidisciplinary interaction 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.639
 that applied technology 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.469
 People who have lost one of their members can start to enjoy 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:23.879
 your life without any kind of limitation
