00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.009
 Only then are people today or to do 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.139
 circuit 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:19.860
 yesterday the first video of the channel is this 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:24.150
 here is a circuit of 10 of this team is you 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:26.460
 shows the power of the sound while I am the 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.580
 amount of ethics has risen 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.680
 higher sound power 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.640
 We used this circuit. 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.739
 integrated 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.859
 now I return to show in two types 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.559
 sources that can be used can be 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:44.280
 by usb cable 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:48.030
 your computer 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:53.059
 the connectors that are loose 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.059
 some are 12 volts and others that are 15 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:58.739
 let's start with psb the first thing 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.399
 to do in the car sb remove this cover 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.949
 black 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.769
 I already took it after we take the 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.560
 black tie has a copper mesh 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.860
 this highest record also must have 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.800
 an area of this material 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.180
 You will also have the people will 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.530
 find four children 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.640
 these two but the white and the green goes 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.450
 leave these two 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.180
 This is going to be our positive red one. 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.820
 and this is going to be our black negative 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:35.340
 now let's play here on the circuit and 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:38.190
 It's okay to receive it like I do without the sound. 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.330
 I'm just going to touch the hand on the wires. 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:48.210
 we will see the variation is possible 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:53.040
 see here 5 volts wants to leave the psb 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.270
 Now we're going to look for the exit of 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.580
 12 volts 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:03.810
 on this monitor, they get loose here 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:09.209
 I'm going to use the world cup the team is going 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.950
 need to find the votes and with 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.090
 that same cable, I'll put the diet 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.890
 in the court itself 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.760
 as I had spoken on the 5th 05 volts 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.209
 because output 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.510
 In this case I had and 5 volts now I go 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.680
 I picked it up and looked elsewhere for black. 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.810
 negative example 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.739
 the evaluation will be between yellow and 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.670
 red 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.670
 so I'll go this way 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:42.849
 Then I'll have two votes, now I'll take it. 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:46.590
 connector to tip give you work 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:49.900
 I'll put it straight on the green tip. 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.069
 I 'll train the same way I do. 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:57.370
 I tested the previous one that was the head and sees 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:03:00.910
 good to be careful not to take a course 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.950
 here between the two terminals because the 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.090
 computer will shut down but I did not arrive 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.410
 burn the source 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:13.150
 Thanks, guys, this is a fan and subscribe. 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:15.540
 in my my channel and a tan 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.540
 thanks
