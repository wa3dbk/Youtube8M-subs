just cleaned it all up so there's not a
whole<00:04:49.599> bunch<00:04:49.810> of<00:04:49.930> wires<00:04:50.169> hanging<00:04:50.530> all<00:04:50.770> over

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
whole bunch of wires hanging all over

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.529 
whole bunch of wires hanging all over
the<00:04:51.069> place<00:04:51.340> it's<00:04:52.090> not<00:04:52.150> a<00:04:52.210> hundred<00:04:52.419> percent

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539 
the place it's not a hundred percent

the place it's not a hundred percent
done<00:04:52.960> but<00:04:53.169> it's<00:04:53.319> getting<00:04:53.470> awfully<00:04:53.860> close<00:04:54.090> down

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090
