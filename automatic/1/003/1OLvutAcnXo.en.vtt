00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
today about the various string setups

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.760 
today about the various string setups
that<00:00:05.790> are<00:00:05.940> out<00:00:06.029> there<00:00:06.060> I<00:00:06.509> read<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:07.170> lot<00:00:07.259> of

article that says that polyester strings

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.560 
article that says that polyester strings
are<00:00:16.770> just<00:00:16.949> still<00:00:17.340> incredibly<00:00:17.970> popular<00:00:18.270> and

another article that says natural guts
making<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.880> comeback<00:00:24.119> read<00:00:24.990> another<00:00:25.289> article

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
making a comeback read another article

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.920 
making a comeback read another article
about<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.519> manufacturer<00:00:27.269> that's<00:00:27.510> putting<00:00:27.840> out

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
about a manufacturer that's putting out

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.169 
about a manufacturer that's putting out
a<00:00:27.960> brand<00:00:28.170> new<00:00:28.429> multifilament<00:00:29.429> synthetic

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
a brand new multifilament synthetic

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.910 
a brand new multifilament synthetic
guess<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:31.320> know<00:00:31.410> it's<00:00:31.529> kind<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.710> across

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
guess so you know it's kind of across

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.139 
guess so you know it's kind of across
the<00:00:32.009> board<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.579> while<00:00:32.730> they're<00:00:32.850> probably<00:00:33.030> a

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
the board and while they're probably a

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.720 
the board and while they're probably a
lot<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.480> truth<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:34.020> each<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.980> those<00:00:35.070> statements

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
lot of truth to each of those statements

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.850 
lot of truth to each of those statements
it<00:00:36.360> kind<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.600> just<00:00:36.750> made<00:00:36.870> me<00:00:36.989> wonder<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.590> was

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
it kind of just made me wonder and I was

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.310 
it kind of just made me wonder and I was
wondering<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.219> know<00:00:38.250> what<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.450> make<00:00:40.050> up

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
wondering you know what is the make up

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.930 
wondering you know what is the make up
or<00:00:40.559> what<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.980> mix<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.550> different

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
or what is the mix of the different

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.150 
or what is the mix of the different
string<00:00:42.210> bed<00:00:42.390> types<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.710> string<00:00:43.920> for<00:00:44.070> my

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
string bed types that I string for my

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.069 
string bed types that I string for my
customers<00:00:44.399> now<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.360> know<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.480> have<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> general

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
customers now you know I have a general

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.569 
customers now you know I have a general
sense<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.620> because<00:00:46.920> I'm<00:00:47.010> stringing<00:00:47.340> for

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
sense of that because I'm stringing for

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.580 
sense of that because I'm stringing for
them<00:00:47.700> all<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.969> time<00:00:48.180> but<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.170> know<00:00:49.289> never

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
them all the time but you know never

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.229 
them all the time but you know never
really<00:00:49.890> looked<00:00:50.070> at<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.309> hard<00:00:50.520> data<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.940> see

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
really looked at the hard data to see

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.420 
really looked at the hard data to see
what<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.539> says<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.379> that's<00:00:52.770> what<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:52.980> did<00:00:53.039> I

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
what it says and so that's what I did I

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.250 
what it says and so that's what I did I
did<00:00:53.670> an<00:00:53.760> analysis<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.510> see<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.870> know<00:00:54.989> what

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
did an analysis to see you know what

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.450 
did an analysis to see you know what
sort<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.860> mix<00:00:56.730> my<00:00:57.360> clients<00:00:57.840> are<00:00:57.930> using<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.469> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
sort of mix my clients are using and the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.310 
sort of mix my clients are using and the
it's<00:01:00.300> interesting<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.870> way<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.050> comes<00:01:01.170> out

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
it's interesting the way it comes out

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.889 
it's interesting the way it comes out
twenty<00:01:01.800> nine<00:01:01.949> percent<00:01:02.399> are<00:01:02.579> using<00:01:03.300> full<00:01:03.600> beds

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
string bed and then a synthetic get

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.130 
string bed and then a synthetic get
either<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.770> multi<00:01:23.310> filament<00:01:24.150> or<00:01:24.270> monofilament

as the other part of the hybrid and

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.080 
as the other part of the hybrid and
interesting<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.320> note<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.640> all<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.970> my

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
using a poly hybrid they're all you

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.980 
using a poly hybrid they're all you
except<00:01:35.460> for<00:01:35.490> one<00:01:35.820> guy<00:01:35.850> they're<00:01:36.479> all<00:01:36.689> using

except for one guy they're all using
poly<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.740> mains<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.280> then<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.850> synthetic

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
poly in the mains and then the synthetic

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.410 
poly in the mains and then the synthetic
gut<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.780> crosses<00:01:40.290> then<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.520> have<00:01:41.850> eighteen

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
gut in the crosses then I have eighteen

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.770 
gut in the crosses then I have eighteen
percent<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:43.259> clients<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.299> fall<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.630> this

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780
