00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.539 

figure<00:00:50.900> out<00:00:50.989> where<00:00:51.620> we<00:00:51.830> can<00:00:51.979> put<00:00:52.159> the<00:00:52.280> fuel

figure out where we can put the fuel

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:57.160 
figure out where we can put the fuel
cell<00:00:52.760> up<00:00:52.909> inside<00:00:53.830> try<00:00:54.830> to<00:00:54.909> figure<00:00:55.909> out<00:00:56.180> what's

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
cell up inside try to figure out what's

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.960 
cell up inside try to figure out what's
left<00:00:57.470> to<00:00:57.589> do<00:00:57.710> other<00:00:57.920> than<00:00:58.040> wiring<00:00:58.670> that's<00:00:58.850> a

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
left to do other than wiring that's a

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.180 
left to do other than wiring that's a
big<00:00:59.150> thing<00:00:59.390> and<00:00:59.570> putting<00:01:00.290> gas<00:01:00.530> into<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:00.920> motor

big thing and putting gas into the motor

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.840 
big thing and putting gas into the motor
