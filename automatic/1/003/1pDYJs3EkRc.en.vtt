I'm going to do little tiny beads and
little<00:00:27.810> sections<00:00:28.230> because<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.010> school<00:00:29.310> draw

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.970 
little sections because the school draw
is<00:00:29.609> kind<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.150> fast<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:31.260> want<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.710> kind<00:00:31.830> of

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
is kind of fast so you want to kind of

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.740 
is kind of fast so you want to kind of
just<00:00:32.160> do<00:00:32.279> sections<00:00:32.880> at<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.090> time<00:00:33.120> because<00:00:33.600> if

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
just do sections at a time because if

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.139 
just do sections at a time because if
you<00:00:33.989> do<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.770> glue<00:00:34.980> all<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.489> one<00:00:35.640> row<00:00:35.880> it's

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
you do the glue all in one row it's

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.700 
you do the glue all in one row it's
gonna<00:00:36.360> be<00:00:36.480> hard<00:00:36.690> by<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.960> time<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.260> get<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.440> the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
gonna be hard by the time you get to the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.280 
gonna be hard by the time you get to the
end<00:00:37.860> so<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.430> know<00:00:38.820> start<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.510> one<00:00:39.840> side<00:00:40.079> and

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
end so you know start on one side and

00:00:40.290 --> 00:01:00.130 
end so you know start on one side and
work<00:00:40.379> your<00:00:40.410> way<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.739> be<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.070> my<00:00:41.309> time<00:00:41.579> doing

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.720 

so<00:01:01.140> if<00:01:01.290> you're<00:01:01.470> not<00:01:01.590> sure<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.220> your<00:01:02.460> glue<00:01:02.700> is

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
so if you're not sure that your glue is

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.119 
so if you're not sure that your glue is
dry<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:03.270> kind<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.840> tug<00:01:04.080> at<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.559> middle<00:01:04.860> like

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
dry just kind of tug at the middle like

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.280 
dry just kind of tug at the middle like
a<00:01:05.250> central<00:01:05.640> point<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.120> if<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.750> sides<00:01:06.990> don't

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
a central point and if the sides don't

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.430 
a central point and if the sides don't
come<00:01:07.650> up<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:08.340> pretty<00:01:08.729> dry<00:01:09.170> so<00:01:10.170> we're<00:01:10.350> gonna

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
come up it's pretty dry so we're gonna

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.870 
come up it's pretty dry so we're gonna
continue<00:01:10.740> doing<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.250> same<00:01:11.460> exact<00:01:11.790> thing

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.100 
this honey so I'm used to doubling my
tracks<00:01:29.610> when<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:29.880> sew<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.690> course<00:01:30.900> we're

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
tracks when I sew and of course we're

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.230 
tracks when I sew and of course we're
not<00:01:31.140> sewing<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:31.830> this<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.460> how<00:01:32.610> I'm<00:01:32.700> going<00:01:32.940> to

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
not sewing so this is how I'm going to

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.570 
not sewing so this is how I'm going to
kind<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.660> get<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.960> same<00:01:34.320> full<00:01:34.619> effect<00:01:37.550> so<00:01:38.550> I

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
kind of get that same full effect so I

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.550 
kind of get that same full effect so I
wanted<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.970> give<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.119> guys<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> closer<00:01:39.810> look<00:01:40.140> at

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.690 

this<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.680> what<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.979> track<00:01:44.190> would<00:01:44.399> look<00:01:44.550> like

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
this is what the track would look like

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.609 
this is what the track would look like
dried<00:01:45.060> after<00:01:45.450> doing<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.899> bead<00:01:46.080> and<00:01:46.200> technique

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
dried after doing the bead and technique

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.529 
dried after doing the bead and technique
and<00:01:47.130> as<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.399> guys<00:01:47.550> can<00:01:47.729> see<00:01:47.789> I'm<00:01:48.030> kind<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.360> like

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
and as you guys can see I'm kind of like

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.109 
and as you guys can see I'm kind of like
placing<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.410> bead<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.800> dragging<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.729> googan

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
placing the bead and dragging the googan

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.320 
placing the bead and dragging the googan
this<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.020> better<00:01:52.320> than<00:01:52.740> just<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.729> straight<00:01:54.090> line

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
this is better than just a straight line

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.320 
this is better than just a straight line
because<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.990> doesn't<00:01:55.259> dry<00:01:55.440> assess<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.340> it'll

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
because it doesn't dry assess and it'll

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.840 
because it doesn't dry assess and it'll
give<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.750> really<00:01:58.679> really<00:01:58.979> good<00:01:59.130> coverage<00:01:59.550> and

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
give you really really good coverage and

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.969 
give you really really good coverage and
I<00:01:59.910> kind<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.210> just<00:02:00.360> lay<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.750> track<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.320> kind<00:02:01.890> of

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
I kind of just lay the track and kind of

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.910 
I kind of just lay the track and kind of
push<00:02:02.220> it<00:02:02.429> in<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.970> slide<00:02:03.690> it<00:02:03.840> up<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.710> blue

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
push it in and slide it up so the blue

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.580 
push it in and slide it up so the blue
kind<00:02:05.220> of<00:02:05.310> creates<00:02:05.580> the<00:02:05.790> shelf<00:02:06.180> innocence<00:02:06.780> it's

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
kind of creates the shelf innocence it's

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.169 
kind of creates the shelf innocence it's
like<00:02:07.740> extra<00:02:08.070> reinforcement<00:02:08.399> cuz<00:02:08.940> when<00:02:09.090> it

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
like extra reinforcement cuz when it

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:09.859 
like extra reinforcement cuz when it
dries

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
dries

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.930 
dries
not<00:02:10.140> only<00:02:10.290> will<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.619> adhere<00:02:11.040> to<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.489> track<00:02:11.700> but

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
not only will it adhere to the track but

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.270 
not only will it adhere to the track but
it<00:02:12.030> kind<00:02:12.239> of<00:02:12.330> like<00:02:12.510> dries<00:02:13.080> over<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.680> as<00:02:13.830> well<00:02:14.010> I

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
it kind of like dries over it as well I

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.890 
it kind of like dries over it as well I
don't<00:02:14.430> know<00:02:14.489> if<00:02:14.549> that<00:02:14.700> makes<00:02:14.880> sense<00:02:14.970> but<00:02:15.360> you

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
don't know if that makes sense but you

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.080 
don't know if that makes sense but you
guys<00:02:16.049> can<00:02:16.320> see<00:02:16.560> what<00:02:16.739> I'm<00:02:16.860> saying<00:02:17.130> now<00:02:17.579> so<00:02:18.000> I'm

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
guys can see what I'm saying now so I'm

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.460 
guys can see what I'm saying now so I'm
just<00:02:18.209> going<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.390> keep<00:02:18.600> doing<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.989> same<00:02:19.200> thing

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
just going to keep doing the same thing

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.039 
just going to keep doing the same thing
all<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.310> way<00:02:20.340> around<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.060> beading<00:02:21.390> is<00:02:21.510> really

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
all the way around the beading is really

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.470 
all the way around the beading is really
effective<00:02:22.500> so<00:02:22.739> I<00:02:23.010> would<00:02:23.549> suggest<00:02:23.700> this<00:02:24.060> method

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
effective so I would suggest this method

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.180 
effective so I would suggest this method
and<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:24.810> guys<00:02:24.989> can<00:02:25.230> see<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.590> glue<00:02:25.769> kind<00:02:26.070> of

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
and you guys can see the glue kind of

00:02:26.190 --> 00:03:05.970 
and you guys can see the glue kind of
folding<00:02:26.880> over<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.209> hair<00:02:27.510> as<00:02:27.630> well

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.039 

so<00:03:06.980> now<00:03:07.220> we're<00:03:07.489> getting<00:03:07.730> closer<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:08.299> the<00:03:08.540> crown

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
so now we're getting closer to the crown

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.690 
so now we're getting closer to the crown
and<00:03:09.530> what<00:03:09.680> we're<00:03:09.799> going<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:09.980> do<00:03:10.129> is<00:03:10.250> lay<00:03:10.430> two

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
and what we're going to do is lay two

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.789 
and what we're going to do is lay two
tracks<00:03:11.030> straight<00:03:11.299> across<00:03:11.599> instead<00:03:12.140> of<00:03:12.260> in<00:03:12.439> the

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
tracks straight across instead of in the

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.490 
tracks straight across instead of in the
U<00:03:13.010> pattern<00:03:13.629> after<00:03:14.629> we<00:03:14.720> lay<00:03:14.870> these<00:03:15.049> two<00:03:15.260> tracks

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
U pattern after we lay these two tracks

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.410 
U pattern after we lay these two tracks
we're<00:03:15.709> going<00:03:15.859> to<00:03:15.920> continue<00:03:16.250> in<00:03:16.640> our<00:03:16.790> regular<00:03:17.239> u

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
we're going to continue in our regular u

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.780 
we're going to continue in our regular u
pattern<00:03:17.810> until<00:03:18.049> we<00:03:18.170> get<00:03:18.319> closer<00:03:18.650> to<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.519> top

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
pattern until we get closer to the top

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
pattern until we get closer to the top
area<00:03:20.329> of<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:20.689> crown<00:03:25.150> so<00:03:26.150> now<00:03:26.359> that<00:03:26.420> we're

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
area of the crown so now that we're

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.979 
area of the crown so now that we're
almost<00:03:27.019> done<00:03:27.560> we<00:03:28.310> need<00:03:28.849> to<00:03:28.909> tighten<00:03:29.299> up<00:03:29.540> that<00:03:29.750> u

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
almost done we need to tighten up that u

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.479 
almost done we need to tighten up that u
area<00:03:30.409> at<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.650> top<00:03:30.859> and<00:03:31.099> we're<00:03:31.190> going<00:03:31.340> to<00:03:31.400> do

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
area at the top and we're going to do

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:32.830 
area at the top and we're going to do
the<00:03:31.609> same<00:03:31.760> thing<00:03:32.030> that<00:03:32.150> we<00:03:32.329> did<00:03:32.450> in<00:03:32.569> the<00:03:32.659> back

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
the same thing that we did in the back

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.680 
the same thing that we did in the back
add<00:03:33.680> two<00:03:34.010> tracks<00:03:34.370> you<00:03:34.609> know<00:03:34.730> going<00:03:35.150> that<00:03:35.480> way

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
add two tracks you know going that way

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.990 
add two tracks you know going that way
and<00:03:36.159> what<00:03:37.159> we're<00:03:37.280> going<00:03:37.400> to<00:03:37.430> do<00:03:37.579> on<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:37.790> side

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
and what we're going to do on the side

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.270 
and what we're going to do on the side
is<00:03:38.329> do<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.689> same<00:03:39.019> exact<00:03:39.560> thing<00:03:39.829> and<00:03:40.069> once

we're done laying both these tracks on
both<00:03:42.620> side<00:03:42.889> we're<00:03:43.159> going<00:03:43.280> to<00:03:43.340> do<00:03:43.459> one<00:03:43.700> final

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
both side we're going to do one final

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.449 
both side we're going to do one final
track<00:03:44.629> that<00:03:44.930> goes<00:03:45.049> all<00:03:45.379> the<00:03:45.409> way<00:03:45.590> around<00:03:45.920> to

it'll<00:04:06.739> all<00:04:06.859> come<00:04:06.889> off<00:04:07.129> I<00:04:07.310> promise

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
it'll all come off I promise

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.490 
it'll all come off I promise
I<00:04:11.180> bet<00:04:12.180> you<00:04:12.330> thought<00:04:12.569> we<00:04:12.720> were<00:04:12.870> dead<00:04:13.080> well

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
I bet you thought we were dead well

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.860 
I bet you thought we were dead well
we're<00:04:13.709> not<00:04:13.920> our<00:04:14.489> last<00:04:14.730> step<00:04:15.060> is<00:04:15.209> adding<00:04:15.450> clips

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
we're not our last step is adding clips

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.020 
we're not our last step is adding clips
for<00:04:16.139> security<00:04:16.709> this<00:04:17.160> is<00:04:17.340> like<00:04:17.489> an<00:04:17.639> old<00:04:17.790> school

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
for security this is like an old school

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.400 
for security this is like an old school
like<00:04:18.389> I<00:04:18.570> don't<00:04:18.630> even<00:04:18.810> know<00:04:18.930> what<00:04:19.109> it's<00:04:19.230> called

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
like I don't even know what it's called
