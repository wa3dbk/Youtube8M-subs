is<00:00:13.710> something<00:00:14.009> that<00:00:14.130> you<00:00:14.280> get<00:00:14.519> into<00:00:14.790> that<00:00:14.910> flow

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
is something that you get into that flow

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.700 
is something that you get into that flow
into<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.809> season<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.230> don't<00:00:16.260> think<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.560> can

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
into the season I don't think you can

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.590 
into the season I don't think you can
necessarily<00:00:16.859> find<00:00:17.609> your<00:00:17.910> best<00:00:18.180> transition

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
necessarily find your best transition

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.390 
necessarily find your best transition
defense<00:00:18.869> early<00:00:19.260> on<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.710> season<00:00:19.859> obviously

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
defense early on in the season obviously

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.519 
defense early on in the season obviously
a<00:00:20.760> part<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.240> effort<00:00:21.630> but<00:00:21.750> but<00:00:22.109> also<00:00:22.260> it's

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
a part of it is effort but but also it's

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.750 
a part of it is effort but but also it's
a<00:00:22.590> part<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.890> communication<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.640> guys

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
a part of a communication and guys

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.790 
a part of a communication and guys
knowing<00:00:24.090> where<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.390> be<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.900> when<00:00:25.470> you've<00:00:25.619> got

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
knowing where to be and when you've got

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.349 
knowing where to be and when you've got
so<00:00:26.099> many<00:00:26.220> new<00:00:26.400> bodies<00:00:26.699> on<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:26.939> team<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.180> think

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
so many new bodies on this team I think

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.089 
so many new bodies on this team I think
that's<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.990> biggest<00:00:28.410> thing<00:00:28.590> we're<00:00:28.830> seeing

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
that's the biggest thing we're seeing

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.220 
that's the biggest thing we're seeing
early<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.519> here<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:29.760> this<00:00:29.849> season<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.420> doc

early on here in this season is doc

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.749 
early on here in this season is doc
still<00:00:31.590> working<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.130> integrate<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.489> lot<00:00:32.669> of

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
still working to integrate a lot of

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.580 
still working to integrate a lot of
these<00:00:32.850> new<00:00:33.030> players<00:00:33.300> here<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.350> when<00:00:34.500> it

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
these new players here and so when it

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.170 
these new players here and so when it
comes<00:00:34.770> back<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.190> know<00:00:35.370> who's<00:00:35.579> got<00:00:35.820> who<00:00:36.030> on

comes back to you know who's got who on
a<00:00:36.210> fast<00:00:36.480> break<00:00:36.719> those<00:00:37.290> things<00:00:37.559> take<00:00:37.950> time<00:00:37.980> to

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
a fast break those things take time to

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.860 
a fast break those things take time to
work<00:00:38.430> out<00:00:38.579> another<00:00:39.390> thing<00:00:39.660> that's<00:00:39.809> very

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
work out another thing that's very

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.500 
work out another thing that's very
concerning<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.160> team's<00:00:41.520> inability<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.420> be

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
concerning is the team's inability to be

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.209 
concerning is the team's inability to be
effective<00:00:42.960> when<00:00:43.079> Kevin<00:00:43.350> Garnett<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.829> off<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
effective when Kevin Garnett is off the

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.380 
effective when Kevin Garnett is off the
floor<00:00:44.430> when<00:00:44.550> he's<00:00:44.730> sitting<00:00:45.000> on<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.120> bench

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
what solution if any do you see for this

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.549 
what solution if any do you see for this
if<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.270> had<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> solution<00:00:49.020> they'd<00:00:49.170> have<00:00:49.320> been<00:00:49.469> on

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
if I had a solution they'd have been on

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.380 
if I had a solution they'd have been on
the<00:00:49.680> bench<00:00:49.860> mallya<00:00:50.309> honestly<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.239> is

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
the bench mallya honestly this is

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.760 
the bench mallya honestly this is
something<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.750> doc<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.440> staff<00:00:52.620> has

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
something that doc and the staff has

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.439 
something that doc and the staff has
struggled<00:00:53.070> with<00:00:53.160> for<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.430> long<00:00:53.640> time<00:00:53.940> when

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
struggled with for a long time when

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.760 
struggled with for a long time when
Kevin<00:00:54.719> Garnett<00:00:55.020> comes<00:00:55.230> off<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.530> floor

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
Kevin Garnett comes off the floor

Kevin Garnett comes off the floor
notoriously<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.910> defense<00:00:57.300> struggle<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.809> how

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
notoriously the defense struggle is how

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.479 
notoriously the defense struggle is how
the<00:00:57.960> numbers<00:00:58.350> are<00:00:58.500> staggering<00:00:58.859> when<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.309> look

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
the numbers are staggering when you look

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.979 
the numbers are staggering when you look
them<00:00:59.640> up<00:00:59.789> but<00:01:00.359> doc<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.660> even<00:01:00.780> talked<00:01:00.930> about

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
them up but doc you even talked about

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.510 
them up but doc you even talked about
tonight<00:01:01.230> saying<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.590> know<00:01:01.680> it's<00:01:01.920> not<00:01:02.219> just

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
tonight saying you know it's not just

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.039 
tonight saying you know it's not just
the<00:01:02.609> defense<00:01:02.879> it's<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.090> offense<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
the defense it's the offense to and the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.420 
the defense it's the offense to and the
ball<00:01:04.260> doesn't<00:01:04.439> move<00:01:04.619> as<00:01:04.769> much<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
ball doesn't move as much the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.770 
ball doesn't move as much the
communication<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.180> both<00:01:06.390> ends<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.689> floor

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
communication on both ends of the floor

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.830 
communication on both ends of the floor
struggles<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.310> Doc's<00:01:08.760> gonna<00:01:08.909> have<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.270> go

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
struggles and so Doc's gonna have to go

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.030 
struggles and so Doc's gonna have to go
back<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.229> drawing<00:01:10.380> board<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.710> little<00:01:10.950> bit

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
back to the drawing board a little bit

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.960 
back to the drawing board a little bit
and<00:01:11.100> kind<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.310> figure<00:01:11.400> out<00:01:11.549> different<00:01:11.790> ways

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
and kind of figure out different ways

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.760 
and kind of figure out different ways
you<00:01:12.390> know<00:01:12.869> they're<00:01:13.020> not<00:01:13.140> going<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.290> revamp<00:01:13.619> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
you know they're not going to revamp the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.590 
you know they're not going to revamp the
entire<00:01:13.799> defensive<00:01:14.549> system<00:01:14.939> but<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.390> much<00:01:15.540> of

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
entire defensive system but so much of

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.820 
entire defensive system but so much of
that<00:01:15.750> system<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.170> based<00:01:16.409> around<00:01:16.530> Kevin

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
that system is based around Kevin

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.100 
that system is based around Kevin
Garnett<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:18.000> can<00:01:18.150> expect<00:01:18.450> kg<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.869> be<00:01:19.020> on

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
Garnett so you can expect kg to be on

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.960 
Garnett so you can expect kg to be on
the<00:01:19.200> floor<00:01:19.350> for<00:01:19.380> money<00:01:19.650> time<00:01:19.860> but<00:01:20.100> other<00:01:20.759> guys

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
the floor for money time but other guys

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.890

gonna have to step up for that role
another<00:01:34.470> thing<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.740> also<00:01:35.100> needs<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.400> be

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
another thing that also needs to be

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.640 
another thing that also needs to be
reevaluated<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:36.570> Jeff<00:01:36.840> Green's<00:01:37.110> role<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.500> this

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
reevaluated is Jeff Green's role on this

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.560 
reevaluated is Jeff Green's role on this
team<00:01:37.710> he<00:01:38.189> hasn't<00:01:38.430> really<00:01:38.610> found<00:01:38.850> his<00:01:39.119> role<00:01:39.360> yet

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
team he hasn't really found his role yet

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.080 
team he hasn't really found his role yet
so<00:01:39.860> what<00:01:40.860> do<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.280> think<00:01:41.579> they<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:41.880> do<00:01:41.970> to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
so what do you think they can do to

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.300 
so what do you think they can do to
utilize<00:01:42.540> him<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> little<00:01:43.079> better<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.470> think<00:01:44.070> Jeff

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
utilize him a little better I think Jeff

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.060 
utilize him a little better I think Jeff
Green<00:01:44.610> his<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.869> know<00:01:45.930> his<00:01:46.020> success<00:01:46.710> came<00:01:46.950> in

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
Green his you know his success came in

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.740 
Green his you know his success came in
Oklahoma<00:01:47.430> City<00:01:47.610> when<00:01:47.820> he<00:01:47.909> was<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.060> starter<00:01:48.450> and

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
Oklahoma City when he was a starter and

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.660 
Oklahoma City when he was a starter and
playing<00:01:49.380> big<00:01:49.649> minutes<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.340> know<00:01:50.460> tonight

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
I think you only play like 17 minutes

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.870 
I think you only play like 17 minutes
and<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:52.320> Jeff<00:01:52.500> Green<00:01:52.740> he<00:01:53.250> needs<00:01:53.430> minutes<00:01:53.759> and

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880

and for Jeff Green he needs minutes and
he's<00:01:53.970> consistent<00:01:54.540> minutes<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.869> that's<00:01:55.020> gonna

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
he's consistent minutes and that's gonna

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.179 
he's consistent minutes and that's gonna
be<00:01:55.229> hard<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.439> find<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.829> team<00:01:55.979> when<00:01:56.070> you're
