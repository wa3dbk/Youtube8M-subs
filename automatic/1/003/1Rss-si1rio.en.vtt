SSD enter the bracket and then here is

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.680 
SSD enter the bracket and then here is
as<00:00:55.610> Roxby<00:00:56.210> box<00:00:56.480> and<00:00:56.780> inside<00:00:57.380> it<00:00:57.890> has<00:00:58.070> n<00:00:58.640> 3000<00:00:59.450> -

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
as Roxby box and inside it has n 3000 -

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.800 
as Roxby box and inside it has n 3000 -
nook<00:01:00.050> motherboard<00:01:00.800> so<00:01:01.610> I'm<00:01:01.910> going<00:01:02.270> to<00:01:02.420> install

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:02.810 
nook motherboard so I'm going to install

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.090 
nook motherboard so I'm going to install
these<00:01:03.230> components<00:01:03.920> into<00:01:04.220> it<00:01:05.620> there<00:01:06.620> are<00:01:06.740> 2<00:01:06.920> n

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
these components into it there are 2 n

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.270 
these components into it there are 2 n
so<00:01:07.310> dibs<00:01:07.550> on<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:08.060> N<00:01:08.210> 3000<00:01:08.960> -<00:01:09.200> nuc<00:01:09.770> motherboard

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
so dibs on the N 3000 - nuc motherboard

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.300 
so dibs on the N 3000 - nuc motherboard
and<00:01:10.720> you<00:01:11.720> can<00:01:11.900> either<00:01:12.050> install<00:01:12.500> one<00:01:12.890> or<00:01:13.070> two

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
and you can either install one or two

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.840 
and you can either install one or two
it's<00:01:13.640> up<00:01:13.790> to<00:01:13.910> you<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:15.040> there<00:01:16.040> are<00:01:16.070> real<00:01:16.490> proof

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
it's up to you and there are real proof

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.300 
it's up to you and there are real proof
pins<00:01:17.180> on<00:01:17.510> the<00:01:17.900> socket<00:01:18.170> and<00:01:18.500> also<00:01:19.010> on<00:01:19.130> the

and it clicks and it's secured same for

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.850 
and it clicks and it's secured same for
the<00:01:30.590> other<00:01:30.680> one<00:01:31.180> slide<00:01:32.180> in<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:32.930> push<00:01:33.619> down

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
the other one slide in and push down

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.980 
the other one slide in and push down
push<00:01:34.130> down<00:01:34.160> and<00:01:34.610> click<00:01:37.360> next<00:01:38.360> I'm<00:01:38.570> going<00:01:38.810> to

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
push down and click next I'm going to

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.249 
push down and click next I'm going to
install<00:01:39.350> and<00:01:39.710> SATA<00:01:40.180> SSD<00:01:41.180> onto<00:01:41.630> this

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
install and SATA SSD onto this

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.340 
install and SATA SSD onto this
motherboard<00:01:42.650> and<00:01:43.100> so<00:01:43.910> this<00:01:44.300> is<00:01:44.509> EMSA<00:01:45.080> and

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
motherboard and so this is EMSA and

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.969 
motherboard and so this is EMSA and
stata<00:01:45.740> module<00:01:46.310> SSD<00:01:47.210> module<00:01:47.660> and<00:01:47.960> just<00:01:48.679> slide

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
stata module SSD module and just slide

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.820 
stata module SSD module and just slide
it<00:01:49.130> in<00:01:49.280> gently<00:01:49.580> and<00:01:50.920> it<00:01:51.920> flips<00:01:52.190> up<00:01:52.399> but<00:01:52.820> you<00:01:53.060> can

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
it in gently and it flips up but you can

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.059 
it in gently and it flips up but you can
use<00:01:54.830> a<00:01:54.860> tiny<00:01:55.610> screw<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.420> press<00:01:57.380> push<00:01:57.679> it<00:01:57.860> down

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
use a tiny screw to press push it down

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:04.330 
use a tiny screw to press push it down
to<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.610> board<00:02:01.869> okay

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
to the board okay

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.229 
to the board okay
to<00:02:04.969> install<00:02:05.299> a<00:02:05.359> 2.5<00:02:06.049> inch<00:02:06.079> HDD<00:02:06.829> or<00:02:06.979> SSD<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.609> FB
