00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:18.110
 enamel with access to the bulletin 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.640

 dinara but of the very basic ones e 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.540
 very simple we put a little bit of enamel 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:03.299
 white on a base and we take a spot 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:09.540
 for from the cicciotto tip and we have to 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:13.049
 draw a nice rod now let's put it 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.970

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.540
 and this time using a spot and rino 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.560
 from the thin tip we make the 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:57.419
 eyes of our nava collection 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:59.069

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:09.120
 we do the little mouth that will be enough to make 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:12.620
 practically a twig type bow 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.620
 which then on one side is divided into two 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:19.139
 and put some orange nail polish 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:25.680
 this time we take store and we do 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:28.620
 a rod that would be the nose and with 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.169

 beautiful celestial rhinestones 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:03.530
 as if they were snowflakes that 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:06.500
 they fall and I also remember that to see 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:10.129

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.599
 now we can seal with a 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.400
 abundant layer of quotas in such a way 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:29.539
 that all our strasse are fixed 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:36.169

 top coat loader or in every nail now 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.069
 let it dry in two minutes though 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.400
 also a second pass to seal
