00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hi this is natasha in touch android 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.720
 insider dot ru and today we will arrange 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.130
 a small comparison in my hands is new 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:20.850
 iphone 6 plus and 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:23.160
 lg g3 let's start looking at the outside 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.680
 type and dimensions well and materials of the case 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.900
 Of course the materials are glass iPhone 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.779
 against soft plastic in lg g3 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.940
 clear victory for the apple company they went to 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.920
 this many years and found the perfect 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.590
 smartphone manufacturing material 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.629
 But the dimensions of the guys from Cupertino slightly 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.579
 overlooked and at original 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.890
 screen diagonal lg g3 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.200
 noticeably smaller and very much in hand 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.840
 very bad to get used to truth you can 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.850
 but around here have apple explicit overrun 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.850
 the front panel to the needs of the screen and 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.600
 let's hand out iphone points one point 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.270
 for materials 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.980
 karey one point for battery size 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.770
 in these devices it is comparable and 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.049
 makes 2900 3000 milliampere hours 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.580
 which is very nice if not much 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.710
 load productive gadgets 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.080
 toys they are able to stretch 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.810
 half day saytik several phone 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.270
 calls wifi and lc all the places where they are 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.700
 There is all this by default to eat battery 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.070
 not so much but watching the video and 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.140
 easier multimedia chips on 1 burn 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.360
 battery what android what apple 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.430
 smartphone and nothing can be done about it 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.070
 give a gadget on the score 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.720
 it will be honest screen then what 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.790
 have to look at the user 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.820
 continuously exploiting your mobile 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.380
 computer at lg g3 and so you sit at 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.170
 iphone hd retina 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.759
 or full hd really for quality 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.369
 brightness and other parameters screens 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.380
 comparable and although g3 it seems to us 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.920
 somewhat juicier than American 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.280
 comrade 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.060
 Well, drawing text on qhd is noticeable 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.930
 more interesting so the ball will get from g3 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.939
 performance of both devices on 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.979
 quite decent level although there are a couple 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.070
 moments of each gadget that we 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.960
 Immediately we assign to the minuses first about g3 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.880
 not enough to ensure the display 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.610
 CPU and RAM resources 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.679
 while not enough with this application and 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.780
 games work well and no complaints 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.360
 cause their creator are engaged 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.300
 optimization of long and tedious carefully at 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.310
 iPhone with interface and responsiveness all 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.379
 good but here is gigabyte operational 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.170
 memory periodically causes 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.140
 application unload lock ifke 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.569
 starts again a couple of seconds but 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.060
 osadochek as they say remains fast 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.810
 all good we liked half a point 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.690
 to each 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.640
 and waiting for camera updates camera moment 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.250
 quite controversial in any comparisons and 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.959
 all the same laser focusing and 13 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.180
 megapixels are well-established 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.849
 matrices are a great software handler 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.250
 images against 8 megapixels with 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.290
 large grain optical stabilization 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.150
 we shot several shots in different 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.670
 conditions but quite problematic 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.600
 find out which of them is better in their own way 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.259
 are good 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.259
 [music] 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.090
 single autofocus system on 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.370
 Korean device wins all and 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.860
 all the speed of work and argue with that 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.410
 quite difficult let it be a ball g3 and 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.260
 half a point at iphone would like a few words 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.570
 say and about the sound in the headphones the sound is good 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.580
 but with specialized players to him 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.980
 Do not be in the metro volume reserve 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.170
 may not be enough but accurate selection 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.420
 headphone helps cope even with this 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.910
 iphone sound from the speaker and it seemed to us 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.770
 somewhat deaf but g3 cannot 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.840
 boast superior audio transmission 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.490
 volume tracks for personal 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.800
 watching the video in not very noisy 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.720
 setting or listening to audio 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.870
 the game maintenance is definitely enough 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.910
 give both of them by half a point and calm down well 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.040
 and let's see something about prices 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.410
 official russian so no gray 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.830
 market without tax sales and other 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.770
 16 gigabyte lg g3 discounts cost 25 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:04.640
 thousand rubles 6 plus in the same volume 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.830
 Memory 37000 oh yes memory android 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.620
 gadget can be expanded with a memory card 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.270
 c for not particularly large amount shorter than g3 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.540
 won count the points 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:17.090
 at lg g6 iphone three and a half however 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.549
 everything is subjective so forget these 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.440
 the numbers our impressions took shape as 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.419
 from all of the above and from 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.370
 banal personal experiences and they 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.630
 something like this 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.070
 good time comparable 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.650
 performance in games and applications 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.270
 although it affects salavat 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.550
 operating system from apple and 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.680
 lack of RAM plus 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.930
 dimensions and position of the gadget in hand 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.880
 elji ahead a noticeable margin 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.310
 This is taking into account the fact that we use 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.290
 the most diverse devices to us 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.780
 there is something to compare if 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.990
 disengage from the plant and other things 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.180
 Apple's smartphone came out excellent but 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.150
 while there are camp android devices and 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.340
 better it can not please us well 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.950
 and on this we all had Natasha with you
