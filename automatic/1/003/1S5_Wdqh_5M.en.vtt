00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
in climate where do some of these plants

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.700 
in climate where do some of these plants
go<00:00:41.130> to<00:00:41.280> they're<00:00:41.850> actually<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.410> brink

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
go to they're actually on the brink

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.389 
go to they're actually on the brink
unless<00:00:44.579> they're<00:00:44.850> able<00:00:44.970> to<00:00:45.180> evolve<00:00:45.600> quickly<00:00:46.530> so
