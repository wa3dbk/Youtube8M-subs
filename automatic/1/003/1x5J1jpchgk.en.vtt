00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
for the Cape whatsoever but still I'm

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.480 
for the Cape whatsoever but still I'm
not<00:01:51.990> really<00:01:52.109> missing<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.590> too<00:01:52.710> bad<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.250> I

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
not really missing it too bad on this I

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.310 
not really missing it too bad on this I
think<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:53.969> looks<00:01:54.180> very<00:01:54.270> nice<00:01:54.659> it's<00:01:55.140> just

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
think this looks very nice it's just

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.920 
think this looks very nice it's just
weird<00:01:55.740> dot<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.700> right<00:01:56.909> side<00:01:57.359> over<00:01:57.630> there

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
weird dot on the right side over there

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.830 
weird dot on the right side over there
it's<00:01:58.170> kind<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.409> weird<00:01:58.649> but<00:01:59.430> anyway<00:01:59.789> not<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.630> bad

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
it's kind of weird but anyway not a bad

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.929 
it's kind of weird but anyway not a bad
looking<00:02:00.960> head<00:02:01.229> sculpt<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.679> like<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.070> she's<00:02:02.640> kind

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
looking head sculpt I like it she's kind

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.730 
looking head sculpt I like it she's kind
of<00:02:02.969> looking<00:02:03.270> up<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:04.049> doesn't<00:02:04.320> look<00:02:04.439> like<00:02:04.469> it's

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
of looking up it doesn't look like it's

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.859 
of looking up it doesn't look like it's
so<00:02:04.950> much<00:02:05.189> here<00:02:05.670> but<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.119> can<00:02:06.240> see<00:02:06.450> there's<00:02:06.810> a

here<00:04:30.599> she<00:04:30.780> is<00:04:30.810> compared<00:04:31.349> to<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:32.340> Marvel

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
here she is compared to the Marvel

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.580 
here she is compared to the Marvel
Universe<00:04:32.699> Jean<00:04:33.419> Grae<00:04:33.720> so<00:04:34.139> you<00:04:34.199> could<00:04:34.409> see

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
Universe Jean Grae so you could see

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.110 
Universe Jean Grae so you could see
she's<00:04:34.770> a<00:04:34.800> bit<00:04:35.070> taller<00:04:35.400> than<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:35.699> Jean<00:04:35.909> Grae

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
she's a bit taller than the Jean Grae

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.209 
she's a bit taller than the Jean Grae
and<00:04:36.270> this<00:04:36.389> Jean<00:04:36.659> Grae<00:04:36.870> mold<00:04:37.169> has<00:04:37.320> been<00:04:37.800> used<00:04:38.070> a

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:38.219 
and this Jean Grae mold has been used a

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:40.250 
and this Jean Grae mold has been used a
lot<00:04:38.400> in<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:38.729> past<00:04:38.969> so<00:04:39.419> this<00:04:39.539> is<00:04:39.719> definitely<00:04:40.229> a

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
lot in the past so this is definitely a

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.620 
lot in the past so this is definitely a
great<00:04:40.529> upgrade<00:04:40.919> right<00:04:41.580> here<00:04:41.909> it

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
great upgrade right here it

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.720 
great upgrade right here it
as<00:04:42.720> the<00:04:42.960> swivel<00:04:43.620> at<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:43.890> upper<00:04:44.220> thigh<00:04:44.460> that

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
as the swivel at the upper thigh that

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.370 
as the swivel at the upper thigh that
this<00:04:44.940> one<00:04:45.150> does<00:04:45.300> not<00:04:45.420> have<00:04:45.510> has<00:04:45.960> an<00:04:46.110> ankle

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
this one does not have has an ankle

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.290 
this one does not have has an ankle
pivot<00:04:46.680> that<00:04:46.800> this<00:04:46.980> one<00:04:47.130> does<00:04:47.280> not<00:04:47.460> have<00:04:47.700> so

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
pivot that this one does not have so

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.240 
pivot that this one does not have so
other<00:04:48.990> than<00:04:49.230> that<00:04:49.440> it's<00:04:49.830> pretty<00:04:49.890> much<00:04:50.160> the

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
other than that it's pretty much the

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.000 
other than that it's pretty much the
same<00:04:50.400> oh<00:04:50.760> it<00:04:51.300> has<00:04:51.480> a<00:04:51.510> hinge<00:04:51.960> in<00:04:52.140> the<00:04:52.200> neck<00:04:52.620> so

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
same oh it has a hinge in the neck so

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.440 
same oh it has a hinge in the neck so
you<00:04:53.100> can<00:04:53.250> see<00:04:53.460> it's<00:04:53.580> a<00:04:53.730> little<00:04:53.850> bit<00:04:54.030> over<00:04:54.240> there

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
you can see it's a little bit over there

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.690 
you can see it's a little bit over there
these<00:04:54.990> don't<00:04:55.350> have<00:04:55.620> that<00:04:55.920> so<00:04:56.220> I<00:04:56.250> think<00:04:56.400> that's

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
these don't have that so I think that's

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.730 
these don't have that so I think that's
pretty<00:04:56.970> sweet<00:04:57.270> if<00:04:57.840> you<00:04:57.990> compare<00:04:58.350> her<00:04:58.470> to<00:04:58.620> the

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
pretty sweet if you compare her to the

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.140 
pretty sweet if you compare her to the
she<00:04:59.010> Hoch<00:04:59.220> that<00:04:59.430> was<00:04:59.550> just<00:04:59.730> recently<00:04:59.910> released

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
she Hoch that was just recently released

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.900 
she Hoch that was just recently released
she<00:05:01.140> is<00:05:01.260> kind<00:05:01.620> of<00:05:01.710> tall<00:05:01.980> compared<00:05:02.370> to<00:05:02.490> she-hulk

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
she is kind of tall compared to she-hulk

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.940 
she is kind of tall compared to she-hulk
or<00:05:03.180> she-hulk<00:05:03.690> is<00:05:03.900> kind<00:05:04.170> of<00:05:04.200> short<00:05:04.500> I<00:05:04.770> don't

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
or she-hulk is kind of short I don't

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.500 
or she-hulk is kind of short I don't
know<00:05:05.070> I<00:05:05.100> really<00:05:05.460> do<00:05:05.580> like<00:05:05.730> this<00:05:05.910> figure<00:05:06.180> by<00:05:06.450> the

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
know I really do like this figure by the

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.210 
know I really do like this figure by the
way<00:05:06.660> too<00:05:06.720> here<00:05:07.350> she<00:05:07.500> is<00:05:07.530> next<00:05:07.800> to<00:05:07.950> the<00:05:08.070> new

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
way too here she is next to the new

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.130 
way too here she is next to the new
Marvel<00:05:08.550> Universe<00:05:08.910> Punisher<00:05:09.450> so<00:05:09.690> yeah<00:05:09.900> she

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
Marvel Universe Punisher so yeah she

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.020 
Marvel Universe Punisher so yeah she
stands<00:05:10.440> just<00:05:10.590> a<00:05:10.680> little<00:05:11.190> bit<00:05:11.340> taller<00:05:11.580> than<00:05:11.760> him

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
stands just a little bit taller than him

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.660 
stands just a little bit taller than him
so<00:05:12.270> yeah<00:05:12.930> I<00:05:13.260> guess<00:05:13.560> she<00:05:13.740> is<00:05:13.770> pretty<00:05:14.190> tall<00:05:14.400> for<00:05:14.640> a

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
so yeah I guess she is pretty tall for a

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.100 
so yeah I guess she is pretty tall for a
female<00:05:14.940> figure<00:05:15.390> I<00:05:15.570> think<00:05:15.750> the<00:05:15.840> Jean<00:05:16.080> Grey

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
female figure I think the Jean Grey
