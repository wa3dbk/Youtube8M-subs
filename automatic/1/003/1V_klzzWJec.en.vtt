brass<00:01:03.930> first<00:01:04.930> thing<00:01:05.080> I'd<00:01:05.170> say<00:01:05.199> about<00:01:05.470> it<00:01:05.770> is

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
brass first thing I'd say about it is

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.000 
brass first thing I'd say about it is
that<00:01:05.860> it's<00:01:06.130> petite<00:01:06.520> it's<00:01:06.970> small<00:01:07.440> it<00:01:08.440> enables

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
that it's petite it's small it enables

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.880 
that it's petite it's small it enables
you<00:01:09.130> to<00:01:09.159> bend<00:01:09.700> your<00:01:09.790> finger<00:01:10.330> which<00:01:10.990> is<00:01:11.020> huge

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
you to bend your finger which is huge

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.060 
you to bend your finger which is huge
when<00:01:12.190> I<00:01:12.220> discovered<00:01:13.060> that<00:01:13.440> it<00:01:14.440> was<00:01:14.680> it<00:01:14.950> was

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
when I discovered that it was it was

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.290 
when I discovered that it was it was
just<00:01:15.340> really<00:01:15.460> something<00:01:15.850> that<00:01:15.940> helped<00:01:16.180> my

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
just really something that helped my

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.710 
just really something that helped my
technique<00:01:16.750> its<00:01:17.440> ergonomic<00:01:18.150> it's<00:01:19.150> got<00:01:19.480> many

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
technique its ergonomic it's got many

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.120 
technique its ergonomic it's got many
advantages<00:01:19.990> to<00:01:20.170> be<00:01:20.290> able<00:01:20.350> to<00:01:20.440> bend<00:01:20.680> your<00:01:20.830> pinky

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
advantages to be able to bend your pinky

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:45.150 
advantages to be able to bend your pinky
and<00:01:21.280> stand<00:01:21.729> and<00:01:22.090> be<00:01:22.240> able<00:01:22.330> to<00:01:22.420> play

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.790 

the<00:01:46.160> fact<00:01:46.400> that<00:01:46.460> it's<00:01:46.670> domed<00:01:47.320> allows<00:01:48.320> you<00:01:48.590> to

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
the fact that it's domed allows you to

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.520 
the fact that it's domed allows you to
articulate<00:01:49.400> single<00:01:49.910> notes<00:01:50.090> much<00:01:50.990> easier<00:01:51.350> than

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
articulate single notes much easier than

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.030 
articulate single notes much easier than
you<00:01:52.280> would<00:01:52.310> with<00:01:52.790> a<00:01:53.090> lip<00:01:53.660> like<00:01:54.110> on<00:01:54.350> all<00:01:54.830> other

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
you would with a lip like on all other

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.660 
you would with a lip like on all other
slides<00:01:55.340> this<00:01:56.180> is<00:01:56.240> sort<00:01:56.840> of<00:01:57.040> borrowing<00:01:58.040> from

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
slides this is sort of borrowing from

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.430 
slides this is sort of borrowing from
the<00:01:59.120> Hawaiian<00:01:59.510> steel<00:01:59.900> which<00:02:00.140> was<00:02:00.290> the

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
the Hawaiian steel which was the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.700 
the Hawaiian steel which was the
original<00:02:00.890> slide<00:02:01.160> tool<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:03.020> they<00:02:03.470> were<00:02:03.530> all

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
original slide tool and they were all

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.880 
original slide tool and they were all
done<00:02:03.920> and<00:02:04.190> played<00:02:04.430> like<00:02:04.610> this<00:02:05.620> you<00:02:06.620> can

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
done and played like this you can

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.130 
done and played like this you can
articulate<00:02:07.850> single<00:02:08.300> notes<00:02:08.540> down<00:02:08.780> here<00:02:08.990> in<00:02:09.080> the

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
articulate single notes down here in the

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.600 
articulate single notes down here in the
first<00:02:09.320> position<00:02:09.710> on<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:09.979> thicker<00:02:10.190> strings

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
first position on the thicker strings

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.330 
first position on the thicker strings
with<00:02:11.270> great<00:02:11.540> ease<00:02:11.690> it<00:02:12.590> allows<00:02:12.830> you<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.010> just

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
with great ease it allows you to just

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.310 
with great ease it allows you to just
really<00:02:13.730> have<00:02:13.850> clean<00:02:14.300> single<00:02:14.720> note<00:02:14.870> runs<00:02:15.140> which

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
really have clean single note runs which

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:24.460 
really have clean single note runs which
is<00:02:15.350> important<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.070> still<00:02:22.990> that's<00:02:23.990> one<00:02:24.290> thing

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
is important and still that's one thing

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:39.569 
is important and still that's one thing
that<00:02:24.650> is<00:02:24.800> really<00:02:24.980> good<00:02:25.250> about<00:02:25.520> it

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.209 

slide<00:02:40.579> land<00:02:40.849> mass<00:02:41.269> equals<00:02:41.810> tone<00:02:42.200> so<00:02:42.889> this<00:02:43.069> is

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:43.219 
slide land mass equals tone so this is

00:02:43.219 --> 00:03:14.370 
slide land mass equals tone so this is
petite<00:02:43.760> yet<00:02:44.060> very<00:02:44.329> massive

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.340 

the<00:03:15.380> unique<00:03:15.650> thing<00:03:15.680> about<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:16.190> dome<00:03:16.370> is<00:03:16.610> that

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
the unique thing about the dome is that

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.890 
the unique thing about the dome is that
the<00:03:18.350> point<00:03:18.620> of<00:03:18.680> contact<00:03:19.420> from<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.630> point<00:03:20.810> of
