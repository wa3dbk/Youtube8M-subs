00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:21.860
 hello everyone good we come to present 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.320
 a new glove a glove of the people of 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.950
 black diamond is called cayenne 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.829
 and it's not said is the posh glove for 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.989
 excellence is the glove that what 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:35.120
 incorporates in the way it is 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.890
 built gives us many guarantees 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.559
 of not having cold hands 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.420
 they get this they get it using 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.780
 different technologies the first 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.430
 technology is to apply a goretex in everything 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.630
 the glove we got at the time of 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.400
 apply a glove exempt the glove 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.400
 obviously impermeability and 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.880
 breathability another reason another thing 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:59.120
 that pose so very simple we're going 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.310
 to put a fill of primal of one that 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.280
 It is a bad pri of a lot of quality but 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:07.729
 the trick is not there the trick is here 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.900
 and what is this this is a battery is a 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.780
 battery that we are going to be able to 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.960
 charge at home in agreement and that is going to 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.840
 allow us to stay warm thanks to 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.900
 a silo to a circuit according to which 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.130
 through 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:27.490
 of this element less more plus less 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.009
 we will get more or less heat 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.380
 how many hours are you going to tell me between 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.509
 six and ten hours you will be able to have the 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.170
 hands at about 37 degrees which is to be 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:40.990
 frankly well not only does this have 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.180
 particularity is a glove made in a 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.009
 very important part of leather whistle 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.039
 way that gives us a lot of resistance to 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.170
 abrasion is a skin that what 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.899
 we can not catch water 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.149
 so that it is very hydro repellent and 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.979
 very resistant in cases of falls on 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.289
 ice and so forth let's go to 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.909
 get this glove is not us 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.159
 it spoils therefore it is a glove 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.229
 thought not for a season but for 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.119
 many seasons agree a 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:11.310
 glove that incorporates a new 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:14.650
 technology designed for all those 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.330
 mountain skiing practitioners who 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.690
 there's no way you have your hands 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:23.200
 hot with this subject solved of 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.600
 agreement heated gloves so that 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.330
 we understand, come see you and 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.970
 we keep presenting why they set 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.040
 how I remember falling before the 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.370
 people of black diamond see you up 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.370
 other
