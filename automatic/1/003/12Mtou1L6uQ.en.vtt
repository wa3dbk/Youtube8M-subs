samsung<00:00:35.579> we<00:00:35.850> were<00:00:35.910> talking<00:00:36.059> about<00:00:36.120> this

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
samsung we were talking about this

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.180 
samsung we were talking about this
earlier<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.930> seems<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.350> smart<00:00:37.739> things<00:00:37.980> has

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
earlier it seems that smart things has

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.950 
earlier it seems that smart things has
an<00:00:38.340> open<00:00:38.700> platform<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.390> buy<00:00:39.540> these<00:00:39.600> hubs

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
an open platform so you buy these hubs

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.869 
an open platform so you buy these hubs
and<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.290> communicates<00:00:40.739> with<00:00:40.860> other<00:00:41.010> Internet

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
and it communicates with other Internet

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.479 
and it communicates with other Internet
of<00:00:41.910> Things<00:00:42.000> devices<00:00:42.300> locks<00:00:43.290> etc<00:00:43.559> through

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
of Things devices locks etc through

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.670 
of Things devices locks etc through
these<00:00:45.270> protocols<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:45.960> are<00:00:46.050> shared<00:00:46.320> by<00:00:46.469> lots

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
these protocols that are shared by lots

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.020 
these protocols that are shared by lots
of<00:00:46.829> different<00:00:47.070> devices<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.610> can<00:00:47.850> see<00:00:48.000> that

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
of different devices so you can see that

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.450 
of different devices so you can see that
Samsung's<00:00:48.480> really<00:00:48.660> like<00:00:48.930> they're<00:00:49.460> investing

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
Samsung's really like they're investing

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.619 
Samsung's really like they're investing
heavily<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:50.940> because<00:00:51.090> no<00:00:51.300> one<00:00:51.449> knows

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
heavily in this because no one knows

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:52.880 
heavily in this because no one knows
what<00:00:51.809> Apple<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.110> going<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.350> do<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.860> think

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
what Apple is going to do and I think

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.260 
what Apple is going to do and I think
it's<00:00:53.129> smart<00:00:53.340> for<00:00:53.399> samsung<00:00:53.789> cuz<00:00:53.940> now<00:00:54.059> they're

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
smart they want them all to be connected

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.620 
smart they want them all to be connected
but<00:01:04.769> there's<00:01:05.250> no<00:01:05.369> platform<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.119> exists<00:01:06.510> yet

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
but there's no platform that exists yet

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.789 
but there's no platform that exists yet
so<00:01:06.840> they're<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.170> they<00:01:07.500> say<00:01:07.619> they're<00:01:07.740> gonna

so they're just they say they're gonna

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.050 
so they're just they say they're gonna
operate<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.280> as<00:01:08.369> its<00:01:08.729> own<00:01:08.790> independent

could run down your phone battery life a
little<00:02:22.210> bit<00:02:22.330> faster<00:02:22.540> but<00:02:23.350> it'll<00:02:24.070> be<00:02:24.130> really

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
little bit faster but it'll be really

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.170 
little bit faster but it'll be really
interesting<00:02:24.340> we<00:02:24.640> can't<00:02:24.790> wait<00:02:24.880> to<00:02:24.970> get<00:02:25.030> them

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
interesting we can't wait to get them

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.520 
interesting we can't wait to get them
into<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.360> lab<00:02:25.540> absolutely<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.200> test<00:02:26.410> them

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
into the lab absolutely and test them

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.570 
into the lab absolutely and test them
out<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.710> find<00:02:26.890> out<00:02:27.010> how<00:02:27.100> they<00:02:27.190> really<00:02:27.430> work

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
out and find out how they really work

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.640 
out and find out how they really work

games<00:03:54.340> I<00:03:54.660> don't<00:03:55.660> know<00:03:55.750> it<00:03:55.840> just<00:03:55.870> seems<00:03:56.110> like<00:03:56.170> a

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
games I don't know it just seems like a

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.260 
games I don't know it just seems like a
disaster<00:03:56.860> to<00:03:56.980> me<00:03:57.010> but<00:03:57.459> they<00:03:57.610> are<00:03:57.730> working<00:03:58.000> with

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
disaster to me but they are working with

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.120 
disaster to me but they are working with
Twitter<00:03:58.690> so<00:03:59.080> Twitter<00:03:59.350> is<00:03:59.500> involved<00:03:59.950> in<00:04:00.040> this

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
Twitter so Twitter is involved in this

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.500 
Twitter so Twitter is involved in this
whole<00:04:00.280> thing<00:04:00.340> I<00:04:00.820> think<00:04:01.030> that<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.270> real

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
whole thing I think that the real

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.150 
whole thing I think that the real
solution<00:04:01.720> this<00:04:02.020> problem<00:04:02.380> is<00:04:02.500> to<00:04:02.530> take<00:04:02.830> a<00:04:02.890> page

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
solution this problem is to take a page

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.460 
solution this problem is to take a page
from<00:04:03.190> basketball<00:04:03.930> institute<00:04:04.930> a<00:04:05.020> shot<00:04:05.230> clock

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
from basketball institute a shot clock

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.070 
from basketball institute a shot clock
so<00:04:06.130> you've<00:04:06.250> got<00:04:06.370> 45<00:04:06.730> seconds<00:04:07.300> to<00:04:07.540> score<00:04:07.810> a<00:04:07.870> goal

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
so you've got 45 seconds to score a goal

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.170 
so you've got 45 seconds to score a goal
or<00:04:08.350> the<00:04:08.530> ball<00:04:08.680> turns<00:04:08.950> over<00:04:09.310> that<00:04:09.820> i<00:04:10.090> think

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
or the ball turns over that i think

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.400 
or the ball turns over that i think
would<00:04:10.390> revolutionize<00:04:10.989> the<00:04:11.140> game<00:04:11.290> they

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
would revolutionize the game they

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.350 
would revolutionize the game they
wouldn't<00:04:11.590> have<00:04:11.680> this<00:04:11.739> problem<00:04:11.980> i<00:04:12.360> know

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
wouldn't have this problem i know

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.729

indefinitely you plug it in it infects
the<00:05:22.700> computer<00:05:23.000> and<00:05:23.090> then<00:05:23.150> it<00:05:23.300> infects<00:05:23.630> the

next USB device and it just goes on and

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.360 
next USB device and it just goes on and
there's<00:05:26.330> not<00:05:26.510> really<00:05:27.170> a<00:05:27.350> clear<00:05:28.010> solution

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
there's not really a clear solution

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.150 
there's not really a clear solution
that's<00:05:29.060> for<00:05:29.330> how<00:05:29.390> the<00:05:29.720> they<00:05:29.930> said<00:05:30.230> we<00:05:30.500> go

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
that's for how the they said we go

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.290 
that's for how the they said we go
to<00:05:31.430> black<00:05:31.610> hat<00:05:31.790> you<00:05:31.880> see<00:05:32.060> all<00:05:32.180> these

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
to black hat you see all these

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.150 
to black hat you see all these
vulnerabilities<00:05:32.750> and<00:05:33.170> then<00:05:33.590> presumably<00:05:33.890> you

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
vulnerabilities and then presumably you

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.290 
vulnerabilities and then presumably you
think<00:05:34.370> that<00:05:34.520> all<00:05:34.670> these<00:05:34.820> holes<00:05:35.030> will<00:05:35.210> be

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
think that all these holes will be

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.450 
think that all these holes will be

solution<00:05:47.300> for<00:05:47.390> that<00:05:47.450> is<00:05:47.630> just<00:05:47.780> a<00:05:47.840> randomized

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.230 
solution for that is just a randomized

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.260 
solution for that is just a randomized
keyboard<00:05:48.740> so<00:05:49.130> there<00:05:49.400> are<00:05:49.430> solutions<00:05:49.760> to<00:05:50.120> some

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
keyboard so there are solutions to some

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.210 
keyboard so there are solutions to some
of<00:05:50.330> these<00:05:50.450> but<00:05:50.750> some<00:05:51.230> of<00:05:51.320> them<00:05:51.380> it<00:05:51.590> seems<00:05:52.130> a

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
of these but some of them it seems a

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.710 
of these but some of them it seems a
little<00:05:52.370> bit<00:05:52.520> more<00:05:52.700> terrifying<00:05:53.270> we<00:05:53.570> have<00:05:53.690> a
