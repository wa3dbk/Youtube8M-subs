00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
that you reduce the amount of gas in it

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.560 
that you reduce the amount of gas in it
takes<00:01:37.800> a<00:01:37.950> very<00:01:38.220> very<00:01:38.520> tight<00:01:38.910> wrap<00:01:39.210> but<00:01:39.480> you

it's going on the molecules of gas are
so<00:02:12.750> small<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.440> they<00:02:13.620> pass<00:02:13.920> right<00:02:14.280> into<00:02:14.760> the

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
the front of this fan so that the fan

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.920 
the front of this fan so that the fan
can<00:02:29.220> disperse<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.970> gas<00:02:30.150> throughout<00:02:30.720> the

can disperse the gas throughout the

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.860 
can disperse the gas throughout the
house<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:32.010> fans<00:02:32.340> are<00:02:32.640> set<00:02:32.910> up<00:02:33.120> in<00:02:33.330> such<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.690> way

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
house the fans are set up in such a way

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.170 
house the fans are set up in such a way
that<00:02:34.350> it<00:02:34.800> continues<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.580> move<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.000> gas

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
that it continues to move the gas

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.570 
that it continues to move the gas
throughout<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.870> house<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.580> continues

throughout the house and continues

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.580 
throughout the house and continues
throughout<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.209> entire<00:02:39.570> fumigation<00:02:40.380> they're

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
throughout the entire fumigation they're

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.480 
throughout the entire fumigation they're
always<00:02:40.770> left<00:02:41.130> on

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.760 

this<00:02:44.090> is<00:02:44.270> how<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.480> warning<00:02:44.870> agent<00:02:45.440> is<00:02:45.530> put

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
this is how the warning agent is put

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.850 
this is how the warning agent is put
down<00:02:45.980> its<00:02:46.640> chloropicrin<00:02:47.300> and<00:02:47.960> obviously

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
down its chloropicrin and obviously

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.800 
down its chloropicrin and obviously
there's<00:02:49.130> none<00:02:49.310> in<00:02:49.340> it<00:02:49.580> right<00:02:49.730> now<00:02:49.790> because<00:02:50.510> if

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
there's none in it right now because if

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.360 
there's none in it right now because if
there<00:02:51.020> was<00:02:51.200> we<00:02:51.530> would<00:02:51.740> hurt<00:02:51.950> it<00:02:52.100> would<00:02:52.190> hurt

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
there was we would hurt it would hurt

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.220 
there was we would hurt it would hurt
our<00:02:52.520> eyes<00:02:52.700> so<00:02:53.000> badly<00:02:53.300> we'd<00:02:53.660> have<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:53.960> get<00:02:54.080> out

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
our eyes so badly we'd have to get out

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.470 
our eyes so badly we'd have to get out
of<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.440> house<00:02:54.620> this<00:02:55.280> is<00:02:55.340> placed<00:02:55.760> by<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.060> fans

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
of the house this is placed by the fans

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.150 
of the house this is placed by the fans
so<00:02:56.750> it<00:02:56.900> disperses<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.680> chloropicrin

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
so it disperses the chloropicrin

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.220 
so it disperses the chloropicrin
throughout<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:58.910> house<00:02:59.090> as<00:02:59.360> a<00:02:59.390> warning<00:02:59.690> agent

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
throughout the house as a warning agent

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.740 
throughout the house as a warning agent
because<00:03:00.710> the<00:03:01.070> gas<00:03:01.280> itself<00:03:01.940> is<00:03:02.330> odorless

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.050 

this<00:03:07.560> is<00:03:07.740> how<00:03:07.860> you<00:03:07.920> measure<00:03:08.250> how<00:03:08.460> many<00:03:08.760> pounds

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
this is how you measure how many pounds

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.000 
this is how you measure how many pounds
are<00:03:09.270> actually<00:03:09.720> pumped<00:03:10.080> out<00:03:10.200> of<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.440> tank<00:03:10.740> and

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
are actually pumped out of the tank and

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.940 
are actually pumped out of the tank and
actually<00:03:11.820> goes<00:03:12.000> into<00:03:12.240> the<00:03:12.420> house<00:03:12.600> so<00:03:12.990> that's

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
actually goes into the house so that's

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.430 
actually goes into the house so that's
how<00:03:14.130> you<00:03:14.190> do<00:03:14.490> a<00:03:14.520> perfect<00:03:14.850> fumigation<00:03:15.750> job<00:03:16.020> if

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
how you do a perfect fumigation job if

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.380 
how you do a perfect fumigation job if
you<00:03:16.680> have<00:03:16.860> any<00:03:17.040> problems<00:03:17.580> with<00:03:17.670> any<00:03:17.910> kind<00:03:18.240> of
