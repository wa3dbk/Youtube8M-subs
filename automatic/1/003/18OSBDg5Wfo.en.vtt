00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:03.770
 modernity let's not talk about some things to think about 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.169
 the catanduva prefecture 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:12.549
 I think tax policy lrf paulo 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.660
 I want to express what makes the study of all the events of 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.529
 relationships by himself 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.210
 I have two last Sundays was a research 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.650
 which gives us today to understand that the figure of the physical trainer robson little more 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.900
 expressive rotating that figure of which it all decided because it relates to the area 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.920
 physics that characterized him now a person 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.430
 I looked there will not be on January 12 today when you look at a commission 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.140
 I have a dental technician only 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.510
 the physiotherapist you have the merits with you have in the color question you have 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.880
 a nutritionist you have the physiologist 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.870
 and several other people who today have to have a better condition for you 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.019
 see the needs that need to be given to an athlete 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.920
 can perform properly during a football match. 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.520
 physiologist the one who slashed the sides 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.329
 it is the one who protests is the one who evaluates and passes all these results to the 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:13.579
 physical trainer takes these data 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:18.560
 the physical trainer I can from all of these there he will prescribe the 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.490
 training 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.899
 to change a schedule and in each period 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:28.030
 it can evolve over distances and then you can 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.550
 preserve the athlete and at the same time understand the coluni has a city that 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.740
 is added on the athlete 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.740
 is always warned directions and this has caused this until that dream come 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.740
 said if you give care to the athlete by sectors 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.990
 today works 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.119
 the goalkeeper's specific goalkeeping coach 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.010
 specific to the area the defenders 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.130
 the middle of the field the attackers and the sides and is even characterized today that 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.630
 thanks to the physiology that was introduced 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.390
 the separation of the athletes who have most vibrated 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.630
 undetermined 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.540
 physical characteristics as those that have more strength those who have more 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.510
 resistance those who have more speed 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:11.650
 giving then 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.380
 the beginning that we can say of the great physical performance is no use 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.290
 you want 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.360
 do what an athlete achieves maximum level 2 if he ever through his 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.940
 windows that it will reach but it has a little that desire 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:36.239
 they wanted to see a few athletes and a suit jacket for themselves. 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.280
 play soccer 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.940
 but it was seen that something else was missing and that something else was put through these 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.120
 people who had their jobs 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.420
 of maintenance 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.240
 from physical to military activities not specifically in Brazil 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:52.900
 one already in the 60's 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.120
 when Brazil had already won the world cup of 58 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:59.650
 started up then gives a specific figure 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.670
 was where the athletic fitness trainer was born then issued a figure one 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.580
 body best presented to be characterized as a teacher 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.709
 and there we had some specific figure that already from 58 to the years 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:13.609
 60 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.680
 of the prop forced the orchard to 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.950
 that I participate in these two cups up to 62 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.489
 the botafogo of rio de janeiro the saints soccer with professor maceió that 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.670
 was also a person who began to introduce already the village of schools of 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.529
 physical education plus percent 

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:34.649
 the high-performance training that is known today specifically for 

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:35.600
 soccer 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.779
 it was then that 9 169 

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:40.449
 He missed France. 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:42.130
 Lula would have to grow 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.530
 research from the datafolha institute are audited I want to be specifically 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.629
 Sunday the professed mericano that did these research with the nasa 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.270
 This great congress was then created 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.039
 That was a thousand in Brazil, Brazil sent 

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:58.510
 Cláudio Coutinho 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.590
 Lamartine and sent some other teachers specializing in this area 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.620
 that were of interest and was where a cooper test was born that was 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.040
 introduced in the selection of 1970 that besides the great is slow was 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.049
 considered the selection with higher performance and physical 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.049
 from those years then in the late 1980s 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.280
 already the skill in the 90's the são paulo soccer club that is one of the precursors 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.570
 dark made today and then began to massage the physical preparer 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.910
 already with another intellectual level with another level of knowledge 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.650
 introduced in stress physiology 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:37.890
 for the athlete 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.930
 and there began to analyze silver of several aspects the force aspect of 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.020
 speed without producing the physical tests 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.020
 he began his legacy in a totally different way 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.430
 arriving at the place the year 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.050
 given the cup of 2002 to g1 the intellectual part 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.860
 already started at all and with the 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.290
 fully technical tactic 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.259
 and especially all that part of computerization 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:11.800
 giving me a practical appearance from the 1950s to the 1990s of a 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.360
 evolution that we can see today. 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.360
 the time of athletes in me speed tests 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.300
 almost close to adding work in this modality specifically within 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.240
 of the pt itself and the athletic juice itself that has specific evidence of 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.650
 6 200 meters and we can even get athletes 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.979
 approaching the entities themselves 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.130
 we can say that football 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.680
 it only had some concrete evolution after presenting the address of the 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.150
 physical trainer the figure of the physical education teacher inside the soccer 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:46.150
 We can say 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.479
 that this figure 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.430
 set off for major sports revolutions worldwide 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.060
 and when one did not have the physical trainer was presented only in figure 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.200
 of a trainer a masseuse the doctor in a still superficial way 

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:07.339
 and the training was practically without an order without a planning and all the 

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:11.930
 Soccer teams in Brazil outside Brazil did not present 

00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:14.289
 strategies defined the athletes 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:19.100
 practiced the same physical part of recreation in a way that 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:19.970
 empirical 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.180
 there was no balance he has strength, speed and endurance 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.229
 things that give him or her a lot of priority today 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:30.120
 so that today we can say 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.360
 that the person of the physical trainer within the football 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.280
 is one of the main responsible for the evolution 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.280
 here we can see that there is not much 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:45.210
 I want 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.699
 you 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:49.309
 you 

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:51.989
 Hague
