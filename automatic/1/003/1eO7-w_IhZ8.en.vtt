and but it's an awesome idea if you do
it<00:02:22.769> plain<00:02:23.010> simple<00:02:23.579> but<00:02:23.760> there<00:02:23.939> are<00:02:24.060> always

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
it plain simple but there are always

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.229 
it plain simple but there are always
some<00:02:24.870> tricky<00:02:25.439> things<00:02:25.739> about<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:26.250> because<00:02:26.610> they

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
some tricky things about it because they

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.270 
some tricky things about it because they
could<00:02:27.420> fill<00:02:27.629> the<00:02:27.780> clan<00:02:28.049> castles<00:02:28.620> just<00:02:28.920> one

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
could fill the clan castles just one

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.920 
could fill the clan castles just one
minute<00:02:29.459> before<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:30.000> war<00:02:30.150> starts<00:02:30.599> they<00:02:30.750> could

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
minute before the war starts they could

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.229 
minute before the war starts they could
change<00:02:31.140> their<00:02:31.489> layouts<00:02:32.489> one<00:02:32.819> minute<00:02:33.120> before

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
the war starts so that could suck if you

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.839 
the war starts so that could suck if you
if<00:02:36.540> they<00:02:36.810> pull<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.260> trick<00:02:37.590> on<00:02:37.739> you<00:02:37.920> but<00:02:38.190> it's

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
if they pull that trick on you but it's

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.759 
if they pull that trick on you but it's
a<00:02:39.000> pretty<00:02:39.239> smart<00:02:39.540> trick<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:40.049> pull<00:02:40.290> on<00:02:40.440> another

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
a pretty smart trick to pull on another

stick<00:02:54.569> to<00:02:54.720> their<00:02:54.870> plan<00:02:54.920> because<00:02:55.920> they<00:02:56.069> can

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
stick to their plan because they can

screw you over anytime they want so that

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.680 
screw you over anytime they want so that
sucks<00:02:58.829> but<00:02:59.549> farmers<00:03:00.090> it's<00:03:00.359> a<00:03:00.420> pretty<00:03:00.599> awesome

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
sucks but farmers it's a pretty awesome

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.979 
sucks but farmers it's a pretty awesome
idea<00:03:01.260> so<00:03:02.190> we<00:03:02.489> did<00:03:02.700> we<00:03:02.970> gradually<00:03:03.420> attacked

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
idea so we did we gradually attacked

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.020 
idea so we did we gradually attacked
them<00:03:04.200> with<00:03:04.349> we<00:03:04.920> started<00:03:05.190> with<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.430> lowest<00:03:05.819> and

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
them with we started with the lowest and

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.599 
them with we started with the lowest and
then<00:03:06.150> we<00:03:06.930> could<00:03:07.109> see<00:03:07.349> if<00:03:07.500> they<00:03:07.709> would<00:03:07.950> screw<00:03:08.489> us

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
then we could see if they would screw us

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.910 
then we could see if they would screw us
over<00:03:08.819> and<00:03:09.299> attack<00:03:09.659> all<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:09.930> our<00:03:10.200> players<00:03:10.470> but

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
over and attack all of our players but

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.559 
over and attack all of our players but
they<00:03:11.430> didn't<00:03:11.700> do<00:03:11.819> that<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.209> we<00:03:12.299> still<00:03:12.480> have

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
they didn't do that and we still have

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.229 
they didn't do that and we still have
six<00:03:12.720> minutes<00:03:12.930> 50<00:03:13.500> minutes<00:03:13.739> six<00:03:14.639> hours<00:03:14.879> 15

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
six minutes 50 minutes six hours 15

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.089 
six minutes 50 minutes six hours 15
minutes<00:03:15.269> left<00:03:15.659> and<00:03:16.349> we<00:03:16.409> still<00:03:16.440> have<00:03:16.769> our<00:03:16.889> top

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
minutes left and we still have our top

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.729 
minutes left and we still have our top
ten<00:03:17.400> that<00:03:17.790> can<00:03:18.090> attack<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:18.930> get<00:03:19.019> stars<00:03:19.410> but

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
ten that can attack and get stars but

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.949 
ten that can attack and get stars but
they<00:03:19.889> already<00:03:20.069> use<00:03:20.430> 72<00:03:21.000> attacks<00:03:21.389> and<00:03:21.720> only

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
they already use 72 attacks and only

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.720 
they already use 72 attacks and only
have<00:03:22.079> two<00:03:22.260> stars<00:03:22.620> because<00:03:22.919> they<00:03:23.069> only

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
have two stars because they only

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.689 
have two stars because they only
attacked<00:03:24.120> our<00:03:24.299> top<00:03:24.540> two<00:03:24.810> for<00:03:25.349> the<00:03:25.500> loop<00:03:25.709> so

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:26.699 
attacked our top two for the loop so

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:29.210 
attacked our top two for the loop so
they<00:03:27.389> probably<00:03:27.629> are<00:03:28.169> still<00:03:28.590> going<00:03:28.949> to<00:03:29.040> stick

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
they probably are still going to stick

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.309 
they probably are still going to stick
