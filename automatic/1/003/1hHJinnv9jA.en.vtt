00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.770
 hello bonilla trees already sealed 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.020
 welcome to a new video 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.020
 we are in gta 5 as I said the last 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:15.039
 I was going to show you the car 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.720
 say it well and tuned the lg and here is 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:20.060
 look how bad is the truth that I 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.839
 he's pretty pretty handsome in the 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.839
 yellow basses 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:31.450
 in the wheels painted the spoiler so that 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.760
 I sing pretty 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.700
 and nothing that is a little bit so what 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.470
 I have here we go here 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.120
 for the door 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.120
 but why 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.250
 this is a gordillo case that flipas look 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.649
 boy has gone over without having 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.640
 reason but I'm not going to do it and here I go 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.710
 to look and everything after the green 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.710
 let's see 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.230
 Now that he runs a pass this car is 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.920
 one is as wonderful as it goes 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.900
 circulates quite 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.300
 pretty good 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.390
 live let's go to the port that I love you 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:16.200
 teach a little thing heather and pretty 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.770
 rather more 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.229
 so I put it in much better than 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.750
 last I said I do not want to touch metal I'm 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.820
 unfair I say it and the minute to both 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.360
 minutes it hit me but it shocked me 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.360
 I died all 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.270
 but good this car right now is the 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.270
 Magic 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.700
 perfect in the past 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.659
 good ground exit 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.560
 well 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.770
 I do that well because they open those 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.770
 doors 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.090
 with halo for what 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:10.259
 as I have I have this helicopter that is 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.680
 the tarata valley bus that is the normal the 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:18.390
 normal cost with firing missiles 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:21.630
 and machine guns then I have the coal 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.080
 cargabates confirm sometimes we have to 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.080
 turn around 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.080
 so that it goes today this bug goes 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.550
 flipa se is a marvel 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.550
 I do not know if I shoot, I have not tried it 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.620
 but come on it has to be a pass and 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.490
 then I have the normal value 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.490
 we all know to see 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.910
 if I can change it the flogger 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.770
 let's go there is 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.980
 ok let's take this one that I've never 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.790
 caught this one 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.790
 the coal 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.169
 [Music] 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:10.180
 today you are going to defeat the truth we stick 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.180
 come on guys 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.530
 you repeat so much pussy 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.540
 but it comes out 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.850
 does not have bullets this this only what 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.110
 that has what you see physically we're going 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.400
 to do some crazy to see if we see 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.940
 put a bridge to go under 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.590
 that's not because the highway is there and we 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.950
 can break a little bit what follows 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.120
 being 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.950
 [Music] 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.790
 the mouth are worth seeing 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:48.420
 the bridge we go there like running 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.920
 these are those military men who are 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.450
 our helicopters are worth those 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.860
 they have the two propellers they do not have to 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.750
 have two military elections but 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.420
 good in this case is part of carrying 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.450
 weight weapons and so on 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.069
 for that reason 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.629
 they have two limits to help so much 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:08.959
 weight and they are huge but in contrast not 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.959
 block 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.050
 there is a hundred below a golfa no 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.050
 I want to die 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.859
 yes 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.859
 but right away 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.590
 and this is the outer book is black me 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.320
 I bought it being with camouflage 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.350
 military I do not know if it can be changed or not and 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.730
 if all wrong the truth I will teach you 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.400
 the percentage that I have passed has 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.960
 game because it reaches a point where I already 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.430
 I'm stuck I do not know what I have 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.430
 what to do or what not 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.430
 stats 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.810
 in these hours it's sad that I have 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:54.170
 90% 62-69 missions and hobbies 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:57.420
 pastimes 39-42 that three photos 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:05:00.300
 points I do not know what they are or anything 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.360
 strange and crazy 2020 random events 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.840
 14 14 and several 9 17 I suppose that the 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.820
 several will be when the random ones that 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.180
 they were dating you are not leaving by 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.180
 example 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:17.400
 go defend the apartment 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.400
 go defend him 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.840
 the total cinema are thus events the best 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.199
 a little bit more random is that 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.330
 you can look for yourself but in that case 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:30.330
 for example the one that I have 39 42 that is 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:34.139
 hobbies and hobbies I do not understand by 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:36.300
 what is the reason I do not have anything to say 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.240
 that all the missions of 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.280
 of triathlon 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:44.070
 of base jump 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.860
 of game hunting I have the last level 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:49.470
 of nature photo photographer of the 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.710
 nature in this case level 5 that 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:55.850
 I have to take a picture of a coyote 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:06:00.450
 those and a boar has to come out 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:02.880
 A cougar and a wapiti kisses is amazing 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.669
 I do not have any fucking idea of ​​how I know how 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.190
 it will be done that already taught a challenge that 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:10.920
 I did in this case I did not upload to YouTube 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:14.100
 challenge number 4 that was 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:16.740
 and this and then a bit attacking like this already 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.630
 I did not do it because I was inside what now 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.790
 It's very easy, not before, but it's not 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.650
 so easy it covers itself again that I have 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.480
 to do the truth is that I'm a 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.670
 little scared because the same thing 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:30.120
 mere past I want to spend all the game 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:32.130
 since you have 90% 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.889
 I think few people get 90 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:39.620
 hundred of the game are bravest hours 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:42.310
 plays but good is what there is, I suppose 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.310
 hehehe 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:47.480
 now you are there throwing up because of me 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.460
 and let's make the next video 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:54.440
 because well, in this video we are going to 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.750
 go to the port I will go directly to 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.850
 there already although not big today 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.169
 obviously I will record it next day 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:03.090
 that goes up 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:05.879
 to teach the singles they have 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.860
 a nice cigar and that's nice that he has and 

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:11.960
 others if you want some killing with 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:14.759
 helicopters cars or any vehicle 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:18.360
 basically once more known and moto2 

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:22.650
 shoya equal and with despair with this 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:26.069
 but it's not a killing with that car with 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:28.319
 a shoulder with a motorcycle can be a 

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:29.849
 poquillo shit but good for 

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:32.990
 example here if you want to play matancilla 

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:35.819
 Well, all of this, some little jumps 

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.169
 quickly and such that I do not expect anything 

00:07:35.819 --> 00:07:40.669
 that you liked this video and we 

00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:40.669
 we see in the next video chao
