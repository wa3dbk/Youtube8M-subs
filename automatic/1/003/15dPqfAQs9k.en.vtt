 fiction

 strategic for ones I do not know 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.530
 no comic book store around 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.470
 to go a little too far too 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.780
 away but if you're walking around alone 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.510
 go here to the movies the ideal ones like me 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.630
 I do sometimes they are two, not because you are 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.150
 the zone the truth is that the situation 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.700

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.840
