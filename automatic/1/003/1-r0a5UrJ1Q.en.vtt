 Hello everyone in this video I want 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.070
 offer you interesting in my opinion 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.460
 manicure option 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:12.580
 its creation does not require a lot of time and 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:15.250
 it looks very impressive it is something 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.910
 average between french and moon 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.340
 manicure for the fact that his drawing is 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.820
 mirror image of classic 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:28.630
 moon manicure I call this design 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.090
 the back of the moon and so in the first 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.720
 turn i always moisturize my nails and skin 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.720
 around not 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:44.360
 then I do a light massage and file 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.399
 nails for this manicure perfect 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.399
 a slightly rounded shape will do 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.320
 a cotton swab dipped in liquid for 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:05.740
 nail polish remover I gently degrease 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.310
 nail plate without touching the skin around 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.310
 her 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:19.050
 then apply basic coating from sofin 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.050
 and wait for it to dry and not for long 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.930
 I apply the main color today 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.770
 chose the first varnishes three 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.770
 miles like a pro 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.240
 I put it in 2 layers 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.320
 Well 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.079
 when the lacquer grab you can start 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.740
 final design nails on 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.600
 the brush should not have many varnishes for 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.140
 I chose a mint shade of lacquer 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.649
 same series neat movements i 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.229
 I draw a semicircle with a wide rounded 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.829
 rimmel paintbrush can do it 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.019
 even without stencils in the winter for me 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.569
 all bright 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:17.360
 summer shades because they are so pleasing to the eye 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.360
 and look great on a snowy background 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.100
 you can also attach sparkles to one 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.510
 or a few marigolds and will remain 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.510
 just cover all the top 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.879
 the result is quite interesting 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.519
 manicure 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:02.040
 I hope you will like it as well as 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.690
