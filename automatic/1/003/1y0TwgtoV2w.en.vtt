jump into DJ sampler it brings you to

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.190 
jump into DJ sampler it brings you to
this<00:00:30.660> screen<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.439> can<00:00:31.560> just<00:00:31.679> jump<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:33.200> so

this screen you can just jump in so

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.049 
this screen you can just jump in so
you've<00:00:34.320> got<00:00:34.500> eight<00:00:34.829> boxes<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.730> then<00:00:35.910> you've

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
you've got eight boxes and then you've

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.750 
you've got eight boxes and then you've
got<00:00:36.270> like<00:00:36.390> four<00:00:36.660> different<00:00:36.840> presets<00:00:37.760> there

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
got like four different presets there

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.630 
got like four different presets there
are<00:00:39.480> four<00:00:39.660> different<00:00:39.750> pages<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.280> second

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
are four different pages so the second

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.130 
are four different pages so the second
page<00:00:41.820> for<00:00:42.090> some<00:00:42.239> reason<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.540> can<00:00:42.690> get<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.960> first

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
page for some reason I can get the first

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.709 
page for some reason I can get the first
page<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.649> let<00:00:43.800> me<00:00:43.890> load<00:00:44.070> sounds<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.670> but<00:00:45.629> the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
page to let me load sounds in it but the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.910 
page to let me load sounds in it but the
second<00:00:46.140> page<00:00:46.350> has<00:00:47.070> my<00:00:47.840> abcdefg<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.050> then<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
second page has my abcdefg and then the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.569 
second page has my abcdefg and then the
third<00:00:50.340> page<00:00:50.579> has<00:00:50.789> like<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.120> flat<00:00:51.510> B<00:00:51.750> flat<00:00:51.780> D<00:00:52.620> flat

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
third page has like a flat B flat D flat

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.740 
third page has like a flat B flat D flat
all<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.210> those<00:00:54.329> keys<00:00:55.010> so<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.039> can<00:00:56.520> trigger<00:00:56.910> pad

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
all of those keys so you can trigger pad

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.700 
all of those keys so you can trigger pad
to<00:00:57.930> start<00:00:58.879> there's<00:00:59.879> no<00:00:59.940> volume<00:01:00.239> control<00:01:00.710> you

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
to start there's no volume control you

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.179 
to start there's no volume control you
kill<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.129> here<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:03.059> can<00:01:03.120> set<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.600> loop<00:01:03.750> here

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
kill it here you can set it to loop here

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.070 
kill it here you can set it to loop here
so<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.939> volume<00:01:06.240> control<00:01:06.600> thing<00:01:06.750> kind<00:01:06.990> of

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
so the volume control thing kind of

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.670 
so the volume control thing kind of
sucks<00:01:07.320> because<00:01:09.020> some<00:01:10.020> pads<00:01:10.229> are<00:01:10.409> louder<00:01:10.590> than

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
sucks because some pads are louder than

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.260 
sucks because some pads are louder than
others<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.400> wish<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.700> could<00:01:11.729> like<00:01:12.000> set

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
others and I wish you could like set

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.580 
others and I wish you could like set
volumes<00:01:12.750> but<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.930> can't<00:01:13.140> do<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.500> this

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
volumes but you can't do that in this

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.260 
volumes but you can't do that in this
app<00:01:14.540> so<00:01:15.540> that's<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.840> app<00:01:16.400> DJ<00:01:17.400> sound<00:01:17.729> box<00:01:17.939> is

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
app so that's that app DJ sound box is

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.050 
app so that's that app DJ sound box is
pretty<00:01:19.140> cool<00:01:21.560> lots<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.770> issues<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.880> cool

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
pretty cool lots of issues but the cool

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.410 
pretty cool lots of issues but the cool
things<00:01:24.270> about<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:25.400> these<00:01:26.400> kind<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.060> LED

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
things about it is these kind of LED

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.450 
things about it is these kind of LED
looking<00:01:27.750> things<00:01:27.990> are<00:01:28.259> boy<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:29.009> can<00:01:29.189> it's

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
looking things are boy it can it's

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.850 
looking things are boy it can it's
volume<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.150> can<00:01:30.270> set<00:01:30.840> loops<00:01:31.320> at<00:01:31.530> different

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
volume so you can set loops at different

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.830 
volume so you can set loops at different
volumes<00:01:32.930> and<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.740> like<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.070> has<00:01:35.280> earth

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
volumes and that like this has earth

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.830 
volumes and that like this has earth
it's<00:01:37.110> kind<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.860> dumb<00:01:38.040> sound<00:01:38.250> right<00:01:38.460> now<00:01:38.840> but

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
it's kind of a dumb sound right now but

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
it's kind of a dumb sound right now but
I<00:01:39.870> can<00:01:40.140> come<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.850> to<00:01:41.850> set<00:01:42.120> up<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.680> can

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
I can come in to set up and you can

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.860 
I can come in to set up and you can
actually<00:01:45.380> eject<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.470> sound<00:01:47.510> by<00:01:48.510> just<00:01:48.720> hitting

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
actually eject the sound by just hitting

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.170 
actually eject the sound by just hitting
ejects<00:01:49.350> sound<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:50.160> you<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.460> change<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.940> to<00:01:51.000> a

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
ejects sound and you can change it to a

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.240 
ejects sound and you can change it to a
select<00:01:51.960> start/stop<00:01:52.560> whenever<00:01:52.830> you<00:01:52.950> hit<00:01:53.070> it

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
select start/stop whenever you hit it

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.650 
select start/stop whenever you hit it
and<00:01:53.310> then<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.520> can<00:01:53.670> hit<00:01:53.760> the<00:01:53.970> loop<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.510> can

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
and then you can hit the loop you can

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.219 
and then you can hit the loop you can
even<00:01:54.810> change<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.140> pitch<00:01:55.440> if<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.710> want<00:01:57.050> so<00:01:58.050> now

when<00:02:22.050> I<00:02:22.080> write<00:02:22.230> trigger<00:02:22.700> it'll<00:02:23.700> start<00:02:24.000> playing

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
when I write trigger it'll start playing

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.050 
when I write trigger it'll start playing
it<00:02:24.510> mm-hmm<00:02:25.320> if<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.100> want<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.430> stop<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:26.910> can

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
it mm-hmm if I want it to stop I can

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.240 
it mm-hmm if I want it to stop I can
stop<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.530> start<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:29.720> it'll<00:02:30.720> loop<00:02:31.190> because<00:02:32.190> I

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
stop it start it it'll loop because I

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.560 
stop it start it it'll loop because I
have<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.430> set<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.730> loop<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.180> then<00:02:33.330> if<00:02:33.480> I

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
have it set the loop and then if I

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.670 
have it set the loop and then if I
wanted<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.900> outer<00:02:34.260> softer

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.580 

I<00:02:37.739> can<00:02:38.459> just<00:02:38.579> do<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:38.879> there<00:02:39.269> that<00:02:39.719> way<00:02:39.900> if<00:02:40.049> my<00:02:40.079> B

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
I can just do it there that way if my B

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.640 
I can just do it there that way if my B
pad<00:02:40.859> is<00:02:41.099> quieter<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.909> can<00:02:42.510> boost<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:43.049> and<00:02:43.379> stuff

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
pad is quieter I can boost it and stuff

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.349 
pad is quieter I can boost it and stuff
like<00:02:43.769> that<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:44.129> it's<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.400> really<00:02:44.640> cool<00:02:44.760> app<00:02:44.939> but

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
like that so it's a really cool app but

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:49.099 
like that so it's a really cool app but
I<00:02:45.629> can't<00:02:46.200> get<00:02:46.409> the<00:02:46.590> banks<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:47.069> save<00:02:47.930> every<00:02:48.930> time

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
I can't get the banks to save every time

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.280 
I can't get the banks to save every time
I<00:02:49.140> start<00:02:49.439> up<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.709> kind<00:02:49.980> of<00:02:50.069> defaults<00:02:50.579> back<00:02:50.849> and

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
I start up it kind of defaults back and

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.589 
I start up it kind of defaults back and
it<00:02:52.310> crashes<00:02:53.310> even<00:02:53.609> when<00:02:53.760> it<00:02:53.909> runs<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.180> pad<00:02:54.359> like

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
it crashes even when it runs a pad like

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.839 
it crashes even when it runs a pad like
this<00:02:54.659> after<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.290> few<00:02:55.560> minutes<00:02:55.739> this<00:02:56.459> app<00:02:56.670> will

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
this after a few minutes this app will

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.520 
this after a few minutes this app will
crash<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.359> I<00:02:57.480> always<00:02:57.689> go<00:02:57.959> back<00:02:58.109> to<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.349> other

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
crash and I always go back to the other

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.020 
crash and I always go back to the other
one<00:02:58.739> it's<00:02:58.859> just<00:02:58.920> way<00:02:59.159> more<00:02:59.189> reliable<00:02:59.849> right

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
one it's just way more reliable right

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.020 
one it's just way more reliable right
now<00:03:00.439> but<00:03:01.439> this<00:03:01.590> one<00:03:01.829> could<00:03:02.010> be<00:03:02.040> pretty<00:03:02.370> cool<00:03:02.549> so

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
now but this one could be pretty cool so

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.660 
now but this one could be pretty cool so
those<00:03:03.450> are<00:03:03.569> the<00:03:03.659> two<00:03:03.870> I'll<00:03:04.829> try<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.129> put<00:03:05.250> links

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
those are the two I'll try and put links

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.640 
those are the two I'll try and put links
to<00:03:05.849> them<00:03:06.030> oh<00:03:06.329> that<00:03:06.930> was<00:03:07.019> another<00:03:07.230> thing<00:03:07.319> is

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
to them oh that was another thing is

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.500 
to them oh that was another thing is
this<00:03:08.129> app<00:03:08.400> runs<00:03:08.819> the<00:03:09.060> sound<00:03:09.239> in<00:03:09.420> the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
this app runs the sound in the

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.789 
this app runs the sound in the
background<00:03:10.549> so<00:03:11.549> you<00:03:11.609> can<00:03:11.819> switch<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.060> like

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
background so you can switch to like

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.520 
background so you can switch to like
GarageBand<00:03:13.799> or<00:03:14.780> something<00:03:15.780> else<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:16.079> guess<00:03:16.290> and

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
GarageBand or something else I guess and

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.720 
GarageBand or something else I guess and
pick<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.340> virtual<00:03:17.849> instrument<00:03:19.189> to<00:03:20.189> play<00:03:20.340> on<00:03:20.519> top

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
pick a virtual instrument to play on top

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:29.630 
pick a virtual instrument to play on top
of<00:03:20.879> it<00:03:23.239> so<00:03:24.260> let's<00:03:25.260> see<00:03:25.379> if<00:03:25.469> I<00:03:25.560> can<00:03:25.769> do<00:03:26.669> something

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.050 

I'm<00:03:30.270> sorry<00:03:30.480> this<00:03:30.600> is<00:03:30.660> kind<00:03:30.960> of<00:03:31.020> on<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.290> fly

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.420 

so<00:03:36.060> I<00:03:36.120> can<00:03:36.270> just<00:03:36.390> pick<00:03:36.660> one<00:03:36.810> of<00:03:36.930> these<00:03:37.080> I<00:03:37.800> can

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.920 

it's<00:03:51.099> a<00:03:51.310> minor<00:03:51.610> so<00:03:52.180> it<00:03:52.450> actually<00:03:52.750> kind<00:03:52.900> of

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
it's a minor so it actually kind of

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.320 
it's a minor so it actually kind of
worked<00:03:53.110> but<00:03:53.860> then<00:03:54.340> you<00:03:54.519> can<00:03:54.670> play<00:03:54.819> sounds<00:03:55.150> over

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.559 
of sounds you can actually play it over
it's<00:04:03.640> it's<00:04:04.090> really<00:04:04.720> neat<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:07.030> other<00:04:07.150> one<00:04:07.360> when

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
it's it's really neat the other one when

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.600 
it's it's really neat the other one when
you<00:04:07.720> close<00:04:08.379> out<00:04:08.560> of<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:08.709> app<00:04:08.860> it<00:04:09.099> just<00:04:09.310> closes

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
you close out of the app it just closes

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.780 
you close out of the app it just closes
out<00:04:10.000> of<00:04:10.150> that<00:04:12.060> so<00:04:13.060> anyway<00:04:13.769> that's<00:04:14.769> it

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
out of that so anyway that's it
