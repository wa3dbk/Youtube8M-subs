when I did BBS week on Rachel
battlestations<00:00:02.820> I<00:00:02.909> started<00:00:03.210> wondering<00:00:03.389> if

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
battlestations I started wondering if

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.210 
battlestations I started wondering if
there<00:00:03.840> was<00:00:03.899> a<00:00:03.959> way<00:00:04.140> to<00:00:04.200> use<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.560> modem<00:00:04.950> without<00:00:05.190> a

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
there was a way to use a modem without a

there was a way to use a modem without a
landline<00:00:05.670> doing<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.569> little<00:00:06.750> research<00:00:06.930> all<00:00:07.350> I

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379

found<00:00:07.589> was<00:00:07.890> that<00:00:07.919> everyone<00:00:08.400> on<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.580> internet

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
found was that everyone on the internet

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.490 
found was that everyone on the internet
claimed<00:00:09.120> there<00:00:09.360> was<00:00:09.450> no<00:00:09.510> way<00:00:09.990> you<00:00:10.019> could<00:00:10.230> do

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
claimed there was no way you could do

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.560 
claimed there was no way you could do
that<00:00:10.679> there's<00:00:11.309> no<00:00:11.550> way<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.730> hook<00:00:12.000> an<00:00:12.120> analog

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570

modem up to a digital phone line seems

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.750 
modem up to a digital phone line seems
ridiculous<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.260> me<00:00:16.500> since<00:00:16.800> modems<00:00:17.250> are<00:00:17.490> used

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
ridiculous to me since modems are used

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.230 
ridiculous to me since modems are used
all<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.270> time<00:00:18.449> with<00:00:18.720> t1<00:00:19.080> lines<00:00:19.939> what<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:20.970> did

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
the handset on the cradle so let's try

the handset on the cradle so let's try
that<00:01:09.000> out

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
check that out connect it at 31 231 K

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:10.050 
check that out connect it at 31 231 K
did

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:32.030 

and<00:03:10.420> it<00:03:10.900> works<00:03:12.480> caps-lock

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.979 

of<00:03:32.760> course<00:03:33.060> all<00:03:33.269> of<00:03:33.390> these<00:03:33.510> connections<00:03:33.659> have

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
of course all of these connections have

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.140 
of course all of these connections have
been<00:03:34.019> over<00:03:34.349> the<00:03:34.440> PBX<00:03:34.890> just<00:03:35.819> from<00:03:35.970> one

extension to another however I did set

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.559 
extension to another however I did set
up<00:03:38.849> the<00:03:38.970> PBX

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
up the PBX

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.330 
up the PBX

an off-site location that actually still

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.780 
an off-site location that actually still
has<00:03:46.110> a<00:03:46.140> modem<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:46.860> still<00:03:47.069> has<00:03:47.250> a<00:03:47.280> landline

has a modem and still has a landline
connected<00:03:48.269> to<00:03:48.420> it<00:03:48.569> so<00:03:49.230> let's<00:03:49.680> dial<00:03:50.430> in<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:50.910> see

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
connected to it so let's dial in and see

00:03:51.090 --> 00:04:30.350 
connected to it so let's dial in and see
if<00:03:51.569> it<00:03:51.750> works<00:03:51.989> with<00:03:52.440> a<00:03:52.470> real<00:03:52.890> phone<00:03:53.280> number

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.659 

and<00:04:30.930> it<00:04:31.139> connected<00:04:33.889> and<00:04:34.889> there<00:04:35.039> we<00:04:35.189> are<00:04:35.310> along

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
and it connected and there we are along

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:46.370 
and it connected and there we are along
din

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.160 

so<00:04:46.950> it<00:04:47.220> didn't<00:04:47.490> just<00:04:47.550> connect<00:04:48.090> at<00:04:48.480> a<00:04:48.540> very<00:04:48.810> slow

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
so it didn't just connect at a very slow

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.370 
so it didn't just connect at a very slow
rate<00:04:49.200> he<00:04:49.590> connected<00:04:50.040> also<00:04:50.490> at<00:04:50.640> 31<00:04:51.120> K<00:04:51.390> that<00:04:52.080> is

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
rate he connected also at 31 K that is

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.890 
rate he connected also at 31 K that is
way<00:04:52.830> better<00:04:53.160> than<00:04:53.430> 300<00:04:53.910> baud<00:04:54.030> and<00:04:54.450> that<00:04:54.750> is

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
way better than 300 baud and that is

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.870 
way better than 300 baud and that is
impressive<00:04:55.320> or<00:04:55.680> something<00:04:56.010> that<00:04:56.160> everyone<00:04:56.790> on

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
impressive or something that everyone on

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.040 
impressive or something that everyone on
the<00:04:56.910> internet<00:04:57.240> has<00:04:57.360> been<00:04:57.480> assisting<00:04:57.930> is

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
the internet has been assisting is

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.430 
the internet has been assisting is
impossible<00:04:58.890> I<00:04:59.510> really<00:05:00.510> only<00:05:00.660> wanted<00:05:01.080> to<00:05:01.230> get

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
impossible I really only wanted to get

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.980 
impossible I really only wanted to get
300<00:05:01.950> baud<00:05:02.070> working<00:05:02.550> but<00:05:03.150> if<00:05:03.360> I<00:05:03.480> can<00:05:03.660> do<00:05:03.750> a<00:05:03.780> lot

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
300 baud working but if I can do a lot

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.100 
300 baud working but if I can do a lot
faster<00:05:04.440> that's<00:05:04.620> sure<00:05:04.950> a<00:05:04.980> lot<00:05:05.310> better<00:05:05.580> and<00:05:06.110> as

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
faster that's sure a lot better and as

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.380 
faster that's sure a lot better and as
you<00:05:07.230> can<00:05:07.380> see<00:05:07.440> it's<00:05:07.860> not<00:05:08.130> impossible<00:05:08.520> to<00:05:09.210> use<00:05:09.360> a

you can see it's not impossible to use a

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.750 
you can see it's not impossible to use a
modem<00:05:09.780> without<00:05:10.140> a<00:05:10.350> landline<00:05:10.890> I'm<00:05:11.400> able<00:05:11.730> to
