00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.450
 when you go out to hunt birds you can 

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:07.290
 Easily manage them with only five 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.290
 or ten lures 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:18.260
 in this sport the most important thing is the 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:20.480
 Previous work and you can wear pink 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.029
 if you feel like doing the homework 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.200
 you will most likely come back with a 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.410
 good 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.410
 [Music] 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.620
 when he has been working for a while 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.140
 to this type of hunting and you do well 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.910
 things you should know with a day of 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.610
 advance and the quantity of pieces that 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.500
 you are going to hunt 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.160
 we are going to place the first decoy around 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.160
 15 meters 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.020
 we have the first 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.880
 and now 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:18.540
 let's go a little closer to the forest 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.540
 we may have more luck there 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.450
 [Music] 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.869
 ah 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.869
 i 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.970
 [Applause] 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.030
 ah 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.030
 i 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.560
 it's mine 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.560
 Y 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.560
 Y 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.660
 it has not escaped me 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.220
 [Music] 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.400
 sometimes you have to make a couple of shots 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.400
 you can not always win 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.860
 and transform a clean shot to a meter 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.860
 come fast 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.419
 [Applause] 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:57.390
 this is what we call a typical 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:59.400
 Norwegian pigeon this occasion of laughter in 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.260
 my lap 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.260
 better recharge just in case 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.440
 ah 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.180
 it is better to hunt two by two and 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.180
 saves are a long time 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.469
 to recharge 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.360
 perfect 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.320
 and another one too 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:56.850
 and here is the result of the first 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:58.500
 hunt of the year I am very satisfied not 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.180
 it's been just a good hunting with good 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.250
 results but also a nice and 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.250
 sunny day with a very nice breeze
