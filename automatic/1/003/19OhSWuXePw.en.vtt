changes that we made our a little bit
less<00:00:37.350> visible<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.950> like<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.190> go<00:00:38.340> through

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
less visible so I like to go through

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.100 
less visible so I like to go through
those<00:00:38.700> pretty<00:00:39.030> quickly<00:00:39.300> for<00:00:39.630> you<00:00:39.750> right<00:00:39.930> now

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
one as we go into a 60s profile neck

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.620 
one as we go into a 60s profile neck
with<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.739> slightly<00:00:44.280> asymmetrical<00:00:44.520> see<00:00:45.390> it's

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
really subtle you won't really notice it

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.720 
really subtle you won't really notice it
that<00:00:47.790> much<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:49.710> will<00:00:49.830> offer<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.430> just<00:00:50.640> a

that much but it will offer you just a
little<00:00:50.880> bit<00:00:51.000> extra<00:00:51.330> comfort<00:00:51.810> and<00:00:51.960> as<00:00:52.020> you're

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
little bit extra comfort and as you're

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.870 
little bit extra comfort and as you're
playing<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:53.130> other<00:00:53.220> thing<00:00:53.430> we've<00:00:53.580> done<00:00:53.610> at

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:53.880 
playing the other thing we've done at

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.730 
playing the other thing we've done at
the<00:00:53.940> neck<00:00:54.150> is<00:00:54.390> we've<00:00:54.870> actually<00:00:55.080> gone<00:00:55.350> from<00:00:55.620> a

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:55.740 
the neck is we've actually gone from a

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.780 
the neck is we've actually gone from a
10-inch<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.790> 16<00:00:57.390> inch<00:00:57.600> radius<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.610> offers

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
10-inch to a 16 inch radius so it offers

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.370

we've<00:01:25.650> done<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.800> little<00:01:25.920> bit<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.130> work<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.460> this

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
we've done a little bit of work on this

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.010 
we've done a little bit of work on this
we've<00:01:26.909> changed<00:01:27.120> the<00:01:27.240> circuit<00:01:27.600> around<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.870> bit

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
we've changed the circuit around a bit

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.350 
we've changed the circuit around a bit
to<00:01:28.050> get<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.260> nice<00:01:28.409> fat<00:01:28.800> single<00:01:29.250> coil<00:01:29.490> sound<00:01:29.850> as

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
to get a nice fat single coil sound as

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.760 
to get a nice fat single coil sound as
opposed<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.870> the<00:01:30.960> little<00:01:31.140> thinner<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:31.620> you

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770

models<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.320> past<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:35.100> we've<00:01:35.250> beefed<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.610> up

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
models in the past so we've beefed it up

models in the past so we've beefed it up
a<00:01:35.850> little<00:01:36.000> bit<00:01:36.120> and<00:01:36.900> based<00:01:37.260> on<00:01:37.409> how<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:37.620> proud

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
a little bit and based on how we proud

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.800 
a little bit and based on how we proud
of<00:01:38.010> the<00:01:38.070> circuit<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.490> offers<00:01:38.880> some<00:01:39.360> hum

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
of the circuit it offers some hum
