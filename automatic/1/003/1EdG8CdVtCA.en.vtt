bag sold in a matching remaining color

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.730 
bag sold in a matching remaining color
so<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:07.880> column<00:04:08.300> would<00:04:08.450> match<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:09.110> bag<00:04:09.320> and

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
so the column would match the bag and

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.430 
so the column would match the bag and
it's<00:04:09.950> in<00:04:10.130> one<00:04:10.340> color<00:04:10.670> I<00:04:11.030> actually<00:04:11.540> like<00:04:12.140> this
