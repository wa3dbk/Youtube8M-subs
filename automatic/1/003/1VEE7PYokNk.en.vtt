00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.150
 and this would be the revelation to our 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.779
 Ingenuity game if you did not watch the video 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.040
 passed in the description of the video and 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:10.660
 go and look no because it's very good 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.519
 because it's where we teach him to do 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.769
 we use things really very easy to 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.560
 get we use a plastic bottle 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.810
 a chisel and two fences and to give it a 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.880
 little more the termination we use 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.609
 integrators and now we're going to continue to 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.499
 solve it to be able to solve it like this the 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:27.880
 video is a little complex to be able 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:30.159
 understand so we will do is 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.839
 put the camera in front so you can 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:33.220
 catch up and can follow 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:36.520
 movements 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.230
 let's take it this way so that 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.150
 follow us, look how it is 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.250
 made in loop 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.160
 and what we are going to do is loosen a 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.840
 little the tie first 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.840
 here in this way 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.840
 and we are going to pass the nut that we want 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.840
 move to the other side 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.980
 for the space that was formed in the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.980
 tie in this way 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.220
 let's leave there 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.090
 now we are going to have to throw here 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.230
 notice that we were left with a side that 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.500
 he has the tie here they see it 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.270
 and here's the nut then what 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.480
 have to try to do is to pass this 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.170
 tie now pulling from here we throw 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.620
 these two 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.150
 let's throw you can see 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.960
 is the tie that is informed 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.370
 good 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.080
 we are going to use and we are going to make 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.080
 go through the hole here 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.820
 and there if it's not going to be 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.620
 now 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.980
 well where the cord goes 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.270
 we managed to bring it to the other side 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.590
 so what we have to do is 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.700
 try to open the space here 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.700
 where the cord comes 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.530
 and for that space now that we just 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.170
 open 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.680
 let's move the washer in this case 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.680
 the nut 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.760
 pastor to the other side 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.370
 once it has already passed to the other side 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.110
 we're going to have to invest all the 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.110
 process now we turn this back 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.300
 and go back through the hole 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.560
 and now the only thing left for us to do 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.010
 pass the nut again as we had 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.010
 made today 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.190
 in this case make people another hole 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.840
 now 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.840
 and back we accommodate all 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.159
 and there we have two nut left 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.159
 side 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.320
 to go back to what they have to do 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.200
 all that in reverse bring the 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.400
 peat towards here 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.470
 they pass 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.290
 now we have to bring the whole loop 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.829
 this tie inside 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.829
 I am not 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.230
 it's not going to form the hole here for 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:16.069
 form the current house 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.069
 one 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.000
 we go strike for the other 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.000
 many rivers 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.980
 we accommodate again 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.070
 the cord that comes back 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.070
 we go down 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:54.090
 and well I hope it was understood that 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.310
 have fun doing it 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.750
 manage to uncover your friends and remember 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.530
 that if you want to see more video how this 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.250
 can enter to one's page 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.250
 for all 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.799
 in front so that you can 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.970
 put it on par and also be able to follow 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.970
 the movements 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.430
 and this would be the solution to our 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.380
 Ingenuity challenge will surely be 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.990
 broken his head to try to do it 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.510
 Surely you've got is 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.550
 very good to go through the previous video and 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.020
 this would be the solution to the challenge of 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.910
 ingenuity that we did in a very 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.380
 very homemade practice for samir to oblivion 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.930
 because it 's very good we did it using 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.240
 a bottle using an insulating tape 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.780
 cord and two nuts and cut a little 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.780
 with scissors 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.490
 and this would be the solution to our 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:48.319
 Ingenuity challenge if you did not see it 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.090
 video go through the video I'll let you go 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:52.789
 down in the description because it's very 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.729
 well we did it with a bottle a 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.830
 cord and two nuts and to give it a 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:00.080
 little of 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.060
 and this would be the revelation to our 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.770
 Ingenuity game if you did not see it last 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.720
 look at it because there you will learn to 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.830
 to do is very easy to do is very 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.830
 good louis we did it
