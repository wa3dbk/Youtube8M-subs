00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
window but how did that guy spawn right

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.910 
window but how did that guy spawn right
next<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.890> me<00:02:08.009> this

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
next to me this

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.400 
next to me this
yeah<00:02:09.920> there's<00:02:10.310> something<00:02:10.460> weird<00:02:10.729> about<00:02:10.820> the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
yeah there's something weird about the

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.170 
yeah there's something weird about the
black<00:02:12.410> ops<00:02:12.710> spawn<00:02:13.220> system<00:02:13.460> I<00:02:13.880> think<00:02:14.060> they

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
black ops spawn system I think they

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.510 
black ops spawn system I think they
tweaked<00:02:14.450> its<00:02:14.690> I'm<00:02:14.900> tomorrow<00:02:15.230> no<00:02:15.410> affair<00:02:15.710> for

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
tweaked its I'm tomorrow no affair for

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.850 
tweaked its I'm tomorrow no affair for
example<00:02:16.970> like<00:02:17.090> in<00:02:17.240> domination<00:02:17.690> I<00:02:18.260> can't<00:02:18.590> spawn

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
example like in domination I can't spawn

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.400 
example like in domination I can't spawn
trap<00:02:19.160> B<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:19.490> C<00:02:19.670> anymore<00:02:20.060> or<00:02:20.210> a<00:02:20.240> and<00:02:20.390> B<00:02:20.720> it's

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
trap B and C anymore or a and B it's

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.590 
trap B and C anymore or a and B it's
really<00:02:21.680> tough<00:02:21.980> I<00:02:22.280> remember<00:02:22.940> model<00:02:23.240> for<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.510> use

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
really tough I remember model for to use

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.060 
really tough I remember model for to use
to<00:02:23.690> be<00:02:23.780> easy<00:02:24.020> not<00:02:24.530> anymore<00:02:24.740> and<00:02:26.470> yeah<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:27.770> I<00:02:27.800> get

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
to be easy not anymore and yeah so I get

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.790 
to be easy not anymore and yeah so I get
a<00:02:28.100> couple<00:02:28.220> of<00:02:28.430> nice<00:02:28.520> clips<00:02:28.760> in<00:02:28.880> this<00:02:29.000> game

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
a couple of nice clips in this game

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.230 
a couple of nice clips in this game
analysis<00:02:30.800> as<00:02:30.950> I<00:02:31.250> was<00:02:31.340> saying<00:02:31.520> before<00:02:31.580> new<00:02:32.030> town

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
analysis as I was saying before new town

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.660 
analysis as I was saying before new town
is<00:02:32.390> such<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.570> small<00:02:32.870> map<00:02:33.110> that<00:02:33.410> if<00:02:34.070> you're

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
is such a small map that if you're

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.280 
is such a small map that if you're
running<00:02:34.760> airstrikes<00:02:35.420> you're<00:02:36.050> pretty<00:02:36.230> much

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
running airstrikes you're pretty much

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.770 
running airstrikes you're pretty much
bound<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:36.830> get<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:36.980> multi<00:02:37.340> kill<00:02:37.550> it<00:02:38.450> doesn't

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
bound to get a multi kill it doesn't

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.000 
bound to get a multi kill it doesn't
have<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:38.990> be<00:02:39.020> like<00:02:39.230> a<00:02:39.350> quad<00:02:39.590> but<00:02:39.890> you're

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
have to be like a quad but you're

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.410 
have to be like a quad but you're
probably<00:02:40.190> not<00:02:40.340> always<00:02:40.910> going<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.060> get<00:02:41.209> at

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
probably not always going to get at

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.640 
probably not always going to get at
least<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:41.750> double<00:02:41.900> kill<00:02:42.170> or<00:02:42.290> something<00:02:42.560> of<00:02:42.620> that

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
least a double kill or something of that

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.640 
least a double kill or something of that
