the<00:02:54.650> moment<00:02:54.980> they're<00:02:55.550> thinking<00:02:56.000> now<00:02:56.420> what's

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
the moment they're thinking now what's

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.390 
the moment they're thinking now what's
coming<00:02:57.050> next<00:02:57.230> what's<00:02:57.650> coming<00:02:57.980> next<00:02:58.130> because

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
they don't want to go wrong when and I

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.830 
they don't want to go wrong when and I
realized<00:03:01.460> it's<00:03:01.670> a<00:03:01.730> difficult<00:03:01.940> call<00:03:02.510> for<00:03:02.570> the

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
realized it's a difficult call for the

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.900 
realized it's a difficult call for the
celebrities<00:03:03.530> but<00:03:03.710> you've<00:03:03.890> got<00:03:04.160> to<00:03:04.190> try<00:03:04.580> and

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
celebrities but you've got to try and

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.820 
celebrities but you've got to try and
think<00:03:05.210> about<00:03:05.570> what<00:03:05.900> you're<00:03:06.200> doing<00:03:06.230> at<00:03:06.770> that

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
think about what you're doing at that

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.310 
think about what you're doing at that
moment<00:03:07.240> because<00:03:08.240> all<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.930> time<00:03:09.140> you're

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
moment because all the time you're

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.320 
moment because all the time you're
thinking<00:03:09.650> about<00:03:09.740> what's<00:03:10.160> coming<00:03:10.220> next<00:03:10.640> you're

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
thinking about what's coming next you're

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.360 
thinking about what's coming next you're
not<00:03:11.570> concentrating<00:03:12.050> on<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:12.890> step<00:03:13.160> you're

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
not concentrating on the step you're

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.060 
not concentrating on the step you're
doing<00:03:13.730> at<00:03:13.970> that<00:03:14.000> time<00:03:14.600> so<00:03:15.350> that<00:03:15.890> was<00:03:16.040> basically

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
doing at that time so that was basically

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.640 
doing at that time so that was basically
what<00:03:16.700> i<00:03:16.730> meant<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.270> talkative<00:03:17.900> Matt<00:03:18.230> I've<00:03:18.470> got
