00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
going to do is look at mineralogy so

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.330 
going to do is look at mineralogy so
when<00:00:41.000> you<00:00:41.150> find<00:00:41.630> this<00:00:41.870> underground<00:00:42.500> it<00:00:42.890> gives

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
when you find this underground it gives

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.819 
when you find this underground it gives
you<00:00:44.920> this<00:00:45.920> thing<00:00:46.220> called<00:00:46.640> carbon<00:00:47.300> and<00:00:47.690> I<00:00:48.649> don't

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
you this thing called carbon and I don't

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.200 
you this thing called carbon and I don't
really<00:00:48.920> figured<00:00:49.250> out<00:00:49.340> anything<00:00:49.550> for<00:00:50.059> that

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
really figured out anything for that

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.900 
really figured out anything for that
when<00:00:50.930> you<00:00:51.079> dig<00:00:51.290> this<00:00:51.559> I<00:00:51.950> forgot<00:00:52.550> to<00:00:52.670> put<00:00:52.790> that

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
when you dig this I forgot to put that

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.540 
when you dig this I forgot to put that
in<00:00:53.030> there<00:00:53.239> actually<00:00:53.750> hold<00:00:54.440> on<00:00:57.040> when<00:00:58.040> you<00:00:58.190> dig

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
in there actually hold on when you dig

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.150 
in there actually hold on when you dig
this<00:00:58.760> actually<00:00:59.420> gives<00:00:59.510> you<00:00:59.690> the<00:00:59.840> or<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:00.980> we're

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899 
dig this this gives you silicon I

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.980 
dig this this gives you silicon I
believe<00:01:06.680> it's<00:01:06.830> called<00:01:06.890> silicone<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:07.820> when
