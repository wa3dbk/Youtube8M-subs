things on the desktop so and eventually

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:26.009 
things on the desktop so and eventually

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:26.019 
had to go back to the genius bar so i'm

00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:28.109 
had to go back to the genius bar so i'm

going to call BS on the whole OS x thing

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:30.329

being far superior to Windows or other
operating<00:05:30.849> systems<00:05:30.909> is<00:05:31.419> it<00:05:31.629> better<00:05:31.899> perhaps

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:32.739 
operating systems is it better perhaps

00:05:32.739 --> 00:05:35.609 
operating systems is it better perhaps
yes<00:05:33.509> but<00:05:34.509> so<00:05:34.839> much<00:05:34.989> of<00:05:35.049> its<00:05:35.229> going<00:05:35.379> to<00:05:35.439> come

00:05:35.609 --> 00:05:35.619 
yes but so much of its going to come

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:38.039 
yes but so much of its going to come
down<00:05:35.799> to<00:05:35.829> a<00:05:36.009> matter<00:05:36.339> of<00:05:36.459> preference<00:05:36.879> so<00:05:37.479> it's

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:38.049 
down to a matter of preference so it's

00:05:38.049 --> 00:05:40.469 
down to a matter of preference so it's
really<00:05:38.349> a<00:05:38.469> moot<00:05:38.769> point<00:05:38.799> when<00:05:39.789> it<00:05:39.879> comes<00:05:40.089> to<00:05:40.269> my

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
really a moot point when it comes to my

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:41.909 
really a moot point when it comes to my
parents<00:05:40.869> buying<00:05:41.049> computers<00:05:41.409> i<00:05:41.649> always

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
parents buying computers i always

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.350 
parents buying computers i always
recommend<00:05:42.039> that<00:05:42.339> they<00:05:42.429> buy<00:05:42.549> apple<00:05:42.999> why

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
recommend that they buy apple why

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.719 
recommend that they buy apple why
because<00:05:43.779> it's<00:05:43.929> simply<00:05:44.289> more<00:05:44.860> intuitive<00:05:45.399> it<00:05:45.579> is

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
because it's simply more intuitive it is

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.959 
because it's simply more intuitive it is
more<00:05:45.999> stable<00:05:46.329> to<00:05:47.019> some<00:05:47.229> extent<00:05:47.799> and<00:05:48.009> that<00:05:48.579> plus

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:48.969 
more stable to some extent and that plus

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:50.699 
more stable to some extent and that plus
the<00:05:48.999> genius<00:05:49.569> bar<00:05:49.749> means<00:05:49.989> that<00:05:50.169> i<00:05:50.199> don't<00:05:50.439> get

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:50.709 
the genius bar means that i don't get

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:52.799 
the genius bar means that i don't get
phone<00:05:51.249> calls<00:05:51.309> for<00:05:51.939> my<00:05:52.029> parents<00:05:52.389> at<00:05:52.479> 12am

asking me for help troubleshooting their
computers<00:05:55.269> but<00:05:55.719> regarding<00:05:56.110> the<00:05:56.259> operating

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:56.739 
computers but regarding the operating

00:05:56.739 --> 00:05:58.289 
computers but regarding the operating
system<00:05:57.009> itself<00:05:57.129> it's<00:05:57.549> really<00:05:57.819> one<00:05:58.029> area<00:05:58.269> that

00:05:58.289 --> 00:05:58.299 
system itself it's really one area that

00:05:58.299 --> 00:06:00.509 
system itself it's really one area that
i<00:05:58.419> can<00:05:58.569> objectively<00:05:59.110> say<00:05:59.499> that<00:06:00.099> everyone

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:00.519 
i can objectively say that everyone

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:01.499 
i can objectively say that everyone
needs<00:06:00.639> to<00:06:00.849> decide<00:06:00.999> for<00:06:01.209> themselves

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:01.509 
needs to decide for themselves

needs to decide for themselves
personally<00:06:02.379> i<00:06:02.409> grew<00:06:02.799> up<00:06:02.829> using<00:06:03.009> windows<00:06:03.489> and

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
personally i grew up using windows and

it's what's familiar to me I love OSX
for<00:06:05.859> casual<00:06:06.219> use<00:06:06.279> but<00:06:06.609> trying<00:06:06.909> to<00:06:07.029> use<00:06:07.119> it<00:06:07.269> for

for casual use but trying to use it for

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:08.699 
for casual use but trying to use it for
work<00:06:07.629> at<00:06:07.839> the<00:06:07.959> rate<00:06:08.139> of<00:06:08.169> speed<00:06:08.469> that<00:06:08.499> I<00:06:08.619> do

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:08.709 
work at the rate of speed that I do

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:11.129 
work at the rate of speed that I do
within<00:06:08.949> Windows<00:06:09.429> is<00:06:09.639> rather<00:06:10.299> frustrating<00:06:11.049> and

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:11.139 
within Windows is rather frustrating and

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:12.749 
within Windows is rather frustrating and
in<00:06:11.229> fact<00:06:11.379> I<00:06:11.529> find<00:06:11.709> myself<00:06:11.859> wanting<00:06:12.189> to<00:06:12.339> bash<00:06:12.519> my

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:12.759 
in fact I find myself wanting to bash my

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:14.009 
in fact I find myself wanting to bash my
head<00:06:12.789> against<00:06:13.089> the<00:06:13.179> wallet<00:06:13.449> sometimes<00:06:13.779> when<00:06:13.989> I

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:14.019 
head against the wallet sometimes when I

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:16.499 
head against the wallet sometimes when I
have<00:06:14.379> to<00:06:14.529> manually<00:06:14.919> resize<00:06:15.369> windows<00:06:15.639> to<00:06:16.359> get

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:16.509 
have to manually resize windows to get

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:18.209 
have to manually resize windows to get
them<00:06:16.629> to<00:06:16.719> organize<00:06:17.109> and<00:06:17.139> cascade<00:06:17.709> how<00:06:17.859> I<00:06:17.889> want

00:06:18.209 --> 00:06:18.219 
them to organize and cascade how I want

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:20.099 
them to organize and cascade how I want
but<00:06:18.819> I<00:06:18.879> know<00:06:18.969> people<00:06:19.089> that<00:06:19.419> work<00:06:19.569> extremely

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:20.109 
but I know people that work extremely

00:06:20.109 --> 00:06:22.379 
but I know people that work extremely
efficiently<00:06:20.769> in<00:06:20.979> OS<00:06:21.279> X<00:06:21.459> as<00:06:21.579> well<00:06:21.789> so<00:06:22.179> I'm<00:06:22.269> going

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:22.389 
efficiently in OS X as well so I'm going

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:23.669 
efficiently in OS X as well so I'm going
to<00:06:22.419> say<00:06:22.569> that<00:06:22.749> it's<00:06:22.869> really<00:06:23.139> a<00:06:23.289> matter<00:06:23.529> of

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:23.679 
to say that it's really a matter of

00:06:23.679 --> 00:06:24.929 
to say that it's really a matter of
preference<00:06:24.099> when<00:06:24.489> it<00:06:24.579> comes<00:06:24.759> down<00:06:24.879> to

00:06:24.929 --> 00:06:24.939 
preference when it comes down to

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:26.969 
preference when it comes down to
operating<00:06:25.389> system<00:06:25.719> except<00:06:26.349> for<00:06:26.499> the<00:06:26.619> case<00:06:26.799> of

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:28.569 
development tools in that case you'll

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:30.029 
development tools in that case you'll
need<00:06:28.719> to<00:06:28.809> develop<00:06:29.019> on<00:06:29.259> the<00:06:29.349> system<00:06:29.709> that<00:06:29.739> has

computers<00:06:32.019> come<00:06:32.199> at<00:06:32.319> a<00:06:32.379> steep<00:06:32.439> price<00:06:32.709> but<00:06:33.189> it

00:06:33.269 --> 00:06:33.279 
computers come at a steep price but it

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:34.769 
computers come at a steep price but it
isn't<00:06:33.519> so<00:06:33.639> much<00:06:33.699> the<00:06:33.789> price<00:06:34.179> that<00:06:34.209> often

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:34.779 
isn't so much the price that often

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:36.359 
isn't so much the price that often
bothers<00:06:35.109> me<00:06:35.229> I<00:06:35.349> don't<00:06:35.559> mind<00:06:35.709> paying<00:06:35.919> a<00:06:36.099> premium

00:06:36.359 --> 00:06:36.369 
bothers me I don't mind paying a premium
