00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
taking a look at the zero tolerance zero

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.419 
taking a look at the zero tolerance zero
350<00:00:08.429> you<00:00:09.300> may<00:00:09.450> recall<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:10.170> previously<00:00:11.010> did<00:00:11.400> a

350 you may recall I previously did a

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.240 
350 you may recall I previously did a
review<00:00:11.849> on<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.420> zero<00:00:12.690> tolerance<00:00:12.929> zero<00:00:13.440> 300<00:00:14.099> as

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
review on the zero tolerance zero 300 as

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.080 
review on the zero tolerance zero 300 as
well<00:00:15.059> as<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.870> comparison<00:00:16.529> video<00:00:17.000> looking<00:00:18.000> at

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
well as a comparison video looking at

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.900 
well as a comparison video looking at
the<00:00:18.210> differences<00:00:18.660> between<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.619> zero<00:00:19.890> 350<00:00:20.699> and

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
the differences between the zero 350 and

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.080 
the differences between the zero 350 and
the<00:00:21.240> zero<00:00:21.480> 300<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.769> will<00:00:23.760> probably<00:00:24.000> be

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
the zero 300 so I will probably be

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.290 
the zero 300 so I will probably be
making<00:00:24.269> reference<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.140> zero<00:00:26.070> 300<00:00:26.609> at<00:00:26.880> some

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
making reference to the zero 300 at some

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.029 
making reference to the zero 300 at some
point<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.750> this<00:00:27.869> video<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:28.769> if<00:00:28.830> you're<00:00:28.949> not

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
overall length of 7 and 5/8 inches it's

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.880 
overall length of 7 and 5/8 inches it's
got<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:47.070> three<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.809> 1/4<00:00:48.809> inch<00:00:48.989> long<00:00:49.260> blade<00:00:49.620> and

is essentially a shrunk down version of

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.930 
is essentially a shrunk down version of
the<00:00:55.770> zero<00:00:55.980> 300<00:00:56.610> without<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> frame<00:00:57.750> lock<00:00:57.989> and

the zero 300 without a frame lock and

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.610 
the zero 300 without a frame lock and
I'll<00:00:59.940> tell<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.510> still<00:01:00.780> every<00:01:01.410> bit<00:01:01.590> the

when he went about with his 0 300 you
can<00:01:08.100> see<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.610> just<00:01:09.450> shares<00:01:09.689> very<00:01:10.020> similar

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
take a look at the blade which is a

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.039 
take a look at the blade which is a
modified<00:01:22.470> drop<00:01:22.770> point<00:01:23.100> it's<00:01:23.880> got<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.240> high<00:01:24.720> flat

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
modified drop point it's got a high flat

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.620 
modified drop point it's got a high flat
grind<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:26.280> got<00:01:26.549> something<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.240> swedge

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
grind and it's got something of a swedge

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.649 
grind and it's got something of a swedge
along<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.200> top<00:01:28.409> more<00:01:29.280> for<00:01:29.579> decoration<00:01:29.820> than

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
along the top more for decoration than

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.410 
along the top more for decoration than
anything<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.200> think<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:32.670> tip<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.180> knife

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
anything I think the tip on this knife

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.670 
anything I think the tip on this knife
is<00:01:33.979> very<00:01:34.979> stout<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:36.140> you<00:01:37.140> should<00:01:37.350> be<00:01:37.470> able<00:01:37.530> to

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
is very stout and you should be able to

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.200 
is very stout and you should be able to
get<00:01:38.100> some<00:01:38.280> good<00:01:38.460> work<00:01:38.670> done<00:01:38.909> with<00:01:39.090> this

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
get some good work done with this

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.149 
get some good work done with this
especially<00:01:39.780> with<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.020> strong<00:01:40.380> tip<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
especially with that strong tip and the

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.100 
especially with that strong tip and the
generous<00:01:41.579> amount<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.939> belly<00:01:42.180> there's<00:01:43.020> a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
generous amount of belly there's a

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.230 
generous amount of belly there's a
slight<00:01:43.500> recurve<00:01:43.950> here<00:01:44.250> too<00:01:44.490> which<00:01:44.759> should<00:01:44.970> aid

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
slight recurve here too which should aid

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.200 
slight recurve here too which should aid
in<00:01:45.540> some<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.170> your<00:01:46.290> cutting<00:01:46.590> tasks<00:01:47.070> all<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.090> all

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
it's a very functional blade shape and

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.600 
it's a very functional blade shape and
kind<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.820> unique<00:01:51.210> one<00:01:51.509> too<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.579> happen<00:01:53.579> to

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.300 
about s
I<00:02:14.210> think<00:02:14.480> most<00:02:15.050> people<00:02:15.410> will<00:02:15.530> agree<00:02:15.590> that<00:02:15.950> it's

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
I think most people will agree that it's

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.400 
I think most people will agree that it's
one<00:02:16.520> of<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.700> best<00:02:16.880> deals<00:02:17.150> on<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.630> market

production<00:02:20.209> folding<00:02:20.870> knives<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:21.500> I<00:02:22.459> think<00:02:22.760> in

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
production folding knives and I think in

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.430 
production folding knives and I think in
this<00:02:23.000> case<00:02:23.240> this<00:02:23.569> deal<00:02:23.870> has<00:02:23.990> certainly<00:02:24.230> lived

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
this case this deal has certainly lived

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.550 
this case this deal has certainly lived
up<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.650> its<00:02:24.920> reputation<00:02:26.050> this<00:02:27.050> knife<00:02:27.260> has<00:02:27.380> been

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
up to its reputation this knife has been

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.250 
up to its reputation this knife has been

given a black tungsten dlc coating

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.460 
given a black tungsten dlc coating
that's<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:31.310> diamond<00:02:31.940> like<00:02:32.120> carbon<00:02:32.660> coating<00:02:33.320> and

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
that's a diamond like carbon coating and

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.580 
that's a diamond like carbon coating and
it's<00:02:34.459> a<00:02:34.760> very<00:02:35.209> tough<00:02:35.480> coating<00:02:35.870> about<00:02:36.140> as<00:02:36.320> tough

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
it's a very tough coating about as tough

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.770 
it's a very tough coating about as tough
as<00:02:36.770> it<00:02:36.800> gets<00:02:36.950> as<00:02:37.610> far<00:02:37.670> as<00:02:37.940> blade<00:02:38.240> coatings<00:02:38.630> are

as it gets as far as blade coatings are

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.650 
as it gets as far as blade coatings are
considered<00:02:39.200> sure<00:02:40.100> it<00:02:40.400> will<00:02:40.520> still<00:02:40.910> show<00:02:40.940> where

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
considered sure it will still show where

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.680 
considered sure it will still show where
if<00:02:41.989> you<00:02:42.380> are<00:02:42.560> going<00:02:42.800> to<00:02:42.920> say<00:02:43.580> hard<00:02:43.940> use<00:02:44.360> this

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
if you are going to say hard use this

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.199 
if you are going to say hard use this
knife<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:46.370> know<00:02:46.430> all<00:02:46.640> coatings<00:02:47.060> show

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
knife and you know all coatings show

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.120 
knife and you know all coatings show
where<00:02:47.390> eventually<00:02:47.660> but<00:02:48.140> compared<00:02:48.770> to<00:02:48.890> more

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
where eventually but compared to more

where eventually but compared to more
conventional<00:02:49.400> coatings<00:02:50.180> say<00:02:50.450> something<00:02:50.930> like

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
conventional coatings say something like

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.190 
conventional coatings say something like
a<00:02:51.410> black<00:02:52.040> Teflon<00:02:52.700> coating<00:02:53.180> it's<00:02:53.810> gonna<00:02:53.989> hold

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
a black Teflon coating it's gonna hold

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.860 
a black Teflon coating it's gonna hold
up<00:02:54.380> a<00:02:54.500> lot<00:02:54.650> better<00:02:54.920> so<00:02:55.459> I<00:02:55.820> like<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.450> coating<00:02:56.780> a

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
up a lot better so I like the coating a

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.170 
up a lot better so I like the coating a
lot<00:02:57.080> I<00:02:57.290> like<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.830> blade<00:02:58.040> shape<00:02:58.310> I<00:02:58.580> like<00:02:58.970> the

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
lot I like the blade shape I like the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.660 
lot I like the blade shape I like the
steel<00:02:59.480> and<00:02:59.810> I<00:03:00.650> also<00:03:00.769> happen<00:03:01.310> to<00:03:01.340> like<00:03:01.519> the

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
steel and I also happen to like the

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.630 
steel and I also happen to like the
handle<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.570> handle<00:03:02.600> here<00:03:03.230> is<00:03:03.459> kind<00:03:04.459> of<00:03:04.519> a

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
handle the handle here is kind of a

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.090 
handle the handle here is kind of a
simple<00:03:05.090> construction<00:03:05.480> you've<00:03:05.840> got<00:03:06.050> g10<00:03:06.680> black

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
simple construction you've got g10 black

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
just like on the zero 300 everything has

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.160 
just like on the zero 300 everything has
been<00:03:13.519> very<00:03:13.850> well<00:03:14.060> done<00:03:14.269> here<00:03:14.540> you'll<00:03:15.019> just

been very well done here you'll just

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.440 
been very well done here you'll just
notice<00:03:15.530> how<00:03:15.560> flush<00:03:16.340> everything<00:03:16.820> is<00:03:17.180> how

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
notice how flush everything is how

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.680 
notice how flush everything is how
beautifully<00:03:18.140> everything<00:03:18.650> lines<00:03:19.010> up<00:03:19.690> really

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
beautifully everything lines up really

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.259 
beautifully everything lines up really
is<00:03:20.900> is<00:03:21.590> a<00:03:21.650> real<00:03:21.920> treat<00:03:22.250> to<00:03:22.670> handle<00:03:22.970> this<00:03:23.060> one

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
is is a real treat to handle this one

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.330 
is is a real treat to handle this one
it's<00:03:23.720> just<00:03:23.989> it's<00:03:24.230> wonderful<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.980> way<00:03:25.130> that

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
it's just it's wonderful the way that

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.210 
it's just it's wonderful the way that
they've<00:03:25.549> contoured<00:03:26.420> everything<00:03:26.870> and

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
they've contoured everything and

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.380 
they've contoured everything and
finished<00:03:28.220> everything<00:03:28.519> all<00:03:28.820> the<00:03:28.910> corners<00:03:29.299> have

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
finished everything all the corners have

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.170 
finished everything all the corners have
been<00:03:29.540> slightly<00:03:29.930> rounded<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:31.190> construction

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
been slightly rounded the construction

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.660 
been slightly rounded the construction
is<00:03:32.750> screw-type<00:03:33.560> so<00:03:33.950> you<00:03:34.010> can<00:03:34.190> take<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.519> knife

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
is screw-type so you can take the knife

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
is screw-type so you can take the knife
apart<00:03:35.079> you've<00:03:36.079> got<00:03:36.320> a<00:03:36.350> large<00:03:36.739> back<00:03:37.100> spacer

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
apart you've got a large back spacer

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.720 
apart you've got a large back spacer
which<00:03:38.690> you<00:03:39.079> know<00:03:39.170> as<00:03:39.440> further<00:03:39.920> to<00:03:40.220> rigidity

out there's a hole or two but I suspect
that<00:03:46.250> that's<00:03:46.489> mostly<00:03:47.000> for<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:48.760> speed<00:03:49.760> safe

a<00:04:52.970> nice<00:04:53.210> soil<00:04:53.660> region<00:04:54.199> so<00:04:54.470> you<00:04:55.160> really<00:04:55.370> don't

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
a nice soil region so you really don't

with<00:04:57.050> this<00:04:57.169> knife<00:04:57.350> the<00:04:57.740> the<00:04:58.430> ergonomics<00:04:58.970> are

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
with this knife the the ergonomics are

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.850 
with this knife the the ergonomics are
very<00:04:59.360> well-thought-out<00:04:59.780> and<00:05:00.229> I<00:05:00.530> like<00:05:00.710> the

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
very well-thought-out and I like the

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.560 
very well-thought-out and I like the
width<00:05:01.100> of<00:05:01.250> the<00:05:01.340> handle<00:05:01.699> it<00:05:01.880> does<00:05:02.090> fill<00:05:02.419> the

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
width of the handle it does fill the

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.700 
width of the handle it does fill the
hand<00:05:02.810> and<00:05:03.110> just<00:05:04.039> makes<00:05:04.250> it<00:05:04.370> a<00:05:04.550> pleasure<00:05:04.789> to<00:05:05.120> use

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
hand and just makes it a pleasure to use

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.460 
hand and just makes it a pleasure to use
the<00:05:06.710> pocket<00:05:07.130> clip<00:05:07.630> is<00:05:08.630> the<00:05:08.720> same<00:05:09.080> clip<00:05:09.320> that

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
the pocket clip is the same clip that

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.120 
the pocket clip is the same clip that
you'll<00:05:09.590> find<00:05:09.889> on<00:05:10.160> the<00:05:10.220> zt0<00:05:11.180> 300<00:05:12.080> it's<00:05:12.500> actually

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
you'll find on the zt0 300 it's actually

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.409 
you'll find on the zt0 300 it's actually
the<00:05:13.220> same<00:05:13.370> clip<00:05:13.639> that<00:05:13.789> you'll<00:05:13.940> find<00:05:14.150> on<00:05:14.300> the

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
the same clip that you'll find on the

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.320 
the same clip that you'll find on the
Kershaw<00:05:14.840> skyline<00:05:15.350> like<00:05:16.190> the<00:05:16.340> zero<00:05:16.550> 300<00:05:17.060> it's<00:05:17.240> a

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
Kershaw skyline like the zero 300 it's a

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.290 
Kershaw skyline like the zero 300 it's a
very<00:05:17.510> stiff<00:05:17.870> clip<00:05:18.160> but<00:05:19.160> for<00:05:19.699> a<00:05:19.729> heavier<00:05:20.120> knife

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
very stiff clip but for a heavier knife

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.240 
very stiff clip but for a heavier knife
like<00:05:20.510> this<00:05:20.750> I<00:05:20.960> think<00:05:21.560> that's<00:05:21.740> an<00:05:21.860> excellent

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
like this I think that's an excellent

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.580 
like this I think that's an excellent
choice<00:05:22.610> because<00:05:23.000> this<00:05:23.750> way<00:05:23.930> the<00:05:24.110> knife<00:05:24.289> will

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
choice because this way the knife will

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.650 
choice because this way the knife will
suspend<00:05:25.130> in<00:05:25.280> your<00:05:25.400> pocket<00:05:25.820> and<00:05:25.970> stay<00:05:26.240> wherever

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
suspend in your pocket and stay wherever

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.840 
suspend in your pocket and stay wherever
you<00:05:26.780> stick<00:05:27.110> it<00:05:27.289> on<00:05:27.530> the<00:05:27.889> you<00:05:28.520> on<00:05:28.610> the<00:05:28.699> edge<00:05:28.820> of

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
you stick it on the you on the edge of

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.670 
you stick it on the you on the edge of
your<00:05:29.000> pocket<00:05:29.419> there<00:05:29.600> so<00:05:29.900> that's<00:05:30.139> the<00:05:30.289> benefits

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
your pocket there so that's the benefits

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.909 
your pocket there so that's the benefits
of<00:05:30.800> having<00:05:30.889> a<00:05:31.099> nice<00:05:31.280> stiff<00:05:31.789> clip<00:05:32.060> like<00:05:32.240> this

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
of having a nice stiff clip like this

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.890 
of having a nice stiff clip like this
and<00:05:33.919> I<00:05:34.580> really<00:05:34.910> like<00:05:35.060> the<00:05:35.210> fact<00:05:35.389> that<00:05:35.599> this<00:05:35.720> one

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
and I really like the fact that this one

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.129 
and I really like the fact that this one
has<00:05:35.990> been<00:05:36.250> tapped<00:05:37.250> and<00:05:37.520> drilled<00:05:38.120> for<00:05:38.630> four

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
has been tapped and drilled for four

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.350 
has been tapped and drilled for four
corners<00:05:39.560> carry<00:05:39.919> so<00:05:40.220> you've<00:05:40.460> got<00:05:40.639> tip<00:05:41.060> up<00:05:41.210> or

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
corners carry so you've got tip up or

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.710 
corners carry so you've got tip up or
tip<00:05:41.539> down<00:05:41.780> right<00:05:42.530> or<00:05:42.740> left<00:05:43.070> side<00:05:43.370> this<00:05:43.880> is<00:05:43.940> a

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
tip down right or left side this is a

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.750 
tip down right or left side this is a
