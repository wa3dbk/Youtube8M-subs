like<00:03:18.720> hell<00:03:19.720> there<00:03:19.900> was<00:03:20.019> a<00:03:20.050> little<00:03:20.230> glue<00:03:20.470> and

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
like hell there was a little glue and

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.449 
like hell there was a little glue and
sorry<00:03:21.670> about<00:03:21.730> that<00:03:21.819> batteries<00:03:22.420> went<00:03:22.599> but<00:03:22.810> yeah

sorry about that batteries went but yeah
so<00:03:24.459> this<00:03:24.610> is<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:25.000> cycle<00:03:26.730> hit<00:03:27.730> this<00:03:27.819> little

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
so this is the cycle hit this little

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.420 
so this is the cycle hit this little
button<00:03:28.120> here<00:03:30.450> kind<00:03:31.450> of<00:03:31.510> lights<00:03:31.720> up<00:03:31.959> all<00:03:32.800> pretty

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
button here kind of lights up all pretty

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.089 
button here kind of lights up all pretty
disappointing<00:03:34.260> we<00:03:35.260> figure<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.680> cost<00:03:35.890> of<00:03:36.010> the

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
disappointing we figure the cost of the

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.509 
disappointing we figure the cost of the
game<00:03:36.250> is<00:03:36.400> $60<00:03:37.090> so<00:03:37.299> this<00:03:37.420> is<00:03:37.569> basically<00:03:37.959> a<00:03:38.519> $60

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
game is $60 so this is basically a $60

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.070 
game is $60 so this is basically a $60
