00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
on to it and tell the the code was

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.110 
on to it and tell the the code was
finalized<00:01:01.530> for<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.280> four<00:01:02.520> because<00:01:02.940> they

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
finalized for the the four because they

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.490 
finalized for the the four because they

were hoping that that the whole would
still<00:01:04.739> exist<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.519> they're<00:01:05.670> able<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.030> reuse<00:01:06.630> and

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
still exist so they're able to reuse and

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.270 
still exist so they're able to reuse and
take<00:01:06.960> advantage<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.470> yeah<00:01:07.680> I'm<00:01:07.799> not

say that I mean when new vice comes out

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.530 
say that I mean when new vice comes out
typically<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> jailbreak<00:01:14.909> can<00:01:15.060> be<00:01:15.119> very<00:01:15.299> quick

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
typically a jailbreak can be very quick

it's some major new firmwares can cause

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.270 
it's some major new firmwares can cause
issues<00:01:18.060> only<00:01:18.479> when<00:01:19.080> people<00:01:19.830> aren't<00:01:19.950> sitting

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280

the<00:02:19.330> iphone<00:02:19.360> 4<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:20.050> one<00:02:20.200> of<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.350> challenges<00:02:20.380> I

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
the iphone 4 so one of the challenges I

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.050 
the iphone 4 so one of the challenges I
think<00:02:20.860> a<00:02:21.070> lot<00:02:21.220> of<00:02:21.250> people<00:02:21.340> that<00:02:21.700> jailbreak

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
think a lot of people that jailbreak

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.600 
think a lot of people that jailbreak
their<00:02:22.210> phones<00:02:22.480> have<00:02:23.230> when<00:02:23.590> they<00:02:23.740> do<00:02:23.800> of<00:02:24.370> course

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
their phones have when they do of course

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.400 
their phones have when they do of course
release<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.000> new<00:02:25.390> version<00:02:25.750> of<00:02:25.990> software<00:02:26.140> and

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
release a new version of software and

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.590 
release a new version of software and
then<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.680> gets<00:02:26.860> jailbroken<00:02:27.370> is<00:02:27.640> that<00:02:28.270> some<00:02:28.510> of

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
then it gets jailbroken is that some of

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.060 
then it gets jailbroken is that some of
the<00:02:28.660> applications<00:02:28.780> don't<00:02:29.560> work<00:02:29.740> right<00:02:29.770> away

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
the applications don't work right away

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.340 
the applications don't work right away
when<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:30.580> first<00:02:30.820> jailbreak<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.750> so<00:02:31.960> I<00:02:32.170> would

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
when you first jailbreak it so I would

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.020 
when you first jailbreak it so I would
imagine<00:02:32.530> we<00:02:32.740> can<00:02:32.860> have<00:02:33.010> some<00:02:33.490> of<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.700> similar

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
imagine we can have some of the similar

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.430 
imagine we can have some of the similar
issues<00:02:34.330> that<00:02:34.540> we've<00:02:34.870> had<00:02:34.990> in<00:02:35.050> previous

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
issues that we've had in previous

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.470 
issues that we've had in previous
jailbreaks<00:02:35.830> where<00:02:36.280> some<00:02:36.730> software<00:02:37.150> may<00:02:37.300> not

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
jailbreaks where some software may not

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.090 
jailbreaks where some software may not
work<00:02:37.630> properly<00:02:37.780> right<00:02:38.410> at<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.650> gate<00:02:38.770> is<00:02:38.920> that

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
work properly right at the gate is that

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.520 
work properly right at the gate is that
true<00:02:39.250> that<00:02:39.700> is<00:02:39.820> correct<00:02:40.000> a<00:02:40.360> lot<00:02:41.320> of<00:02:41.350> the

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
true that is correct a lot of the

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.710 
true that is correct a lot of the
developers<00:02:41.920> are<00:02:42.400> getting<00:02:42.760> access<00:02:43.270> to<00:02:43.330> jail

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
developers are getting access to jail

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.270 
developers are getting access to jail
breaks<00:02:43.990> around<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.350> same<00:02:44.530> time<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.740> users<00:02:45.100> do

breaks around the same time the users do

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.550 
breaks around the same time the users do

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
jailbreak to a developer and not have it

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.850 
jailbreak to a developer and not have it

end up in the hands of a hundred

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.199 
end up in the hands of a hundred
thousand<00:02:51.160> users<00:02:51.280> just<00:02:51.640> a<00:02:51.700> couple<00:02:51.880> days<00:02:51.940> later

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
thousand users just a couple days later

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.479 
thousand users just a couple days later
so<00:02:53.020> there's<00:02:53.440> there's<00:02:53.950> definitely

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
so there's there's definitely

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:55.800 
so there's there's definitely
difficulties<00:02:55.000> with<00:02:55.239> getting<00:02:55.570> applications

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
difficulties with getting applications

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.199

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
ported to especially new devices but

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.790 
ported to especially new devices but
even<00:02:58.450> just<00:02:58.540> new<00:02:58.720> firmwares<00:02:59.170> when<00:02:59.680> they

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
even just new firmwares when they

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.220 
even just new firmwares when they
directly<00:03:00.280> when<00:03:00.430> they<00:03:00.520> come<00:03:00.670> out<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:01.600> said<00:03:01.959> a

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
directly when they come out that said a

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.500 
directly when they come out that said a
lot<00:03:02.800> of<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:03.160> core<00:03:03.520> functionality<00:03:04.300> that

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
lot of the core functionality that

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.060 
lot of the core functionality that
people<00:03:04.810> are<00:03:04.900> expect<00:03:05.350> a<00:03:05.500> lot<00:03:05.620> of<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:05.830> things

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
people are expect a lot of the things

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.610 
people are expect a lot of the things
from<00:03:06.400> either<00:03:06.790> sorg<00:03:07.270> IT<00:03:07.480> or<00:03:07.870> big<00:03:08.050> boss<00:03:08.230> are

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
from either sorg IT or big boss are

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.500 
from either sorg IT or big boss are
typically<00:03:09.040> available<00:03:09.280> very<00:03:09.580> quickly<00:03:09.790> but

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
typically available very quickly but

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.180 
typically available very quickly but
even<00:03:10.780> then<00:03:10.959> sometimes<00:03:11.320> a<00:03:11.709> few<00:03:11.890> little<00:03:12.160> things

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
even then sometimes a few little things

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.550 
even then sometimes a few little things
can<00:03:12.730> catch<00:03:12.940> up<00:03:13.180> something<00:03:13.600> for<00:03:13.870> exactly<00:03:14.230> for

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
can catch up something for exactly for

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.140 
can catch up something for exactly for
example<00:03:14.890> sitting<00:03:15.220> on<00:03:15.370> four<00:03:15.550> point<00:03:15.760> oh<00:03:15.850> which

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
example sitting on four point oh which

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
example sitting on four point oh which
is<00:03:16.270> currently<00:03:16.420> still<00:03:16.750> being<00:03:16.900> held<00:03:16.989> back

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
is currently still being held back

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.990 
is currently still being held back
alright<00:03:17.680> so<00:03:17.890> as<00:03:18.100> we<00:03:18.220> go<00:03:18.250> in<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.640> new<00:03:18.790> jailbreak

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
alright so as we go in the new jailbreak

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.670 
alright so as we go in the new jailbreak
comes<00:03:19.420> out<00:03:19.570> some<00:03:19.810> of<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:19.930> applications<00:03:20.050> don't

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
comes out some of the applications don't

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.530 
comes out some of the applications don't
work<00:03:20.860> properly<00:03:20.890> right<00:03:21.489> away<00:03:21.790> is<00:03:22.270> that<00:03:22.450> the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
work properly right away is that the

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.510 
work properly right away is that the
case<00:03:22.660> with<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.050> iphone<00:03:23.530> four<00:03:23.709> jailbreak<00:03:24.010> yes

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
case with the iphone four jailbreak yes
