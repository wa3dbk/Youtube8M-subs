00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
heads your own headset what I did was I

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.480

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
took out the microphone part I put it up

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.810 
took out the microphone part I put it up
here<00:00:26.760> if<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.449> can<00:00:27.630> see<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.170> video<00:00:28.820> here

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
here if you can see it in the video here

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:37.569 
here if you can see it in the video here
let<00:00:30.000> me<00:00:30.029> give<00:00:30.420> me<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.630> camera

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.959 

so<00:00:38.179> this<00:00:38.390> is<00:00:38.539> a<00:00:38.570> microphone<00:00:38.960> part<00:00:39.440> right<00:00:39.620> there

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:39.969 
so this is a microphone part right there

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:47.410 
so this is a microphone part right there
and<00:00:41.620> I<00:00:42.620> ran<00:00:43.250> it<00:00:43.429> along<00:00:44.000> the<00:00:44.859> back<00:00:45.859> of<00:00:46.420> the

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
and I ran it along the back of the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.419 
and I ran it along the back of the
windshield<00:00:47.899> all<00:00:48.170> the<00:00:48.320> way<00:00:48.409> down<00:00:48.710> the<00:00:49.010> steering

00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:49.429 
windshield all the way down the steering

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:53.399 
windshield all the way down the steering
column<00:00:49.609> and<00:00:50.379> then<00:00:51.379> down<00:00:51.679> under<00:00:52.549> the<00:00:52.670> dash<00:00:52.909> and

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409 
column and then down under the dash and

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:59.229 
column and then down under the dash and
it<00:00:54.409> comes<00:00:54.619> out<00:00:54.769> right<00:00:54.949> here<00:00:56.680> so<00:00:57.850> this<00:00:58.850> is<00:00:59.059> where

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
it comes out right here so this is where

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.490 
it comes out right here so this is where
the<00:00:59.570> auxiliary<00:01:00.409> plugs<00:01:00.739> in<00:01:01.989> plug<00:01:02.989> that<00:01:03.170> back<00:01:03.229> in

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
the auxiliary plugs in plug that back in

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.070 
the auxiliary plugs in plug that back in
and<00:01:06.759> the<00:01:07.759> other<00:01:07.909> end<00:01:08.090> of<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.360> audio<00:01:08.659> cables

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
and the other end of the audio cables

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.710 
and the other end of the audio cables
right<00:01:09.200> here<00:01:11.140> so<00:01:12.140> then<00:01:12.350> when<00:01:12.530> I<00:01:12.560> get<00:01:12.740> in<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:12.920> car

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
right here so then when I get in the car

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.820 
right here so then when I get in the car
just<00:01:14.720> snap<00:01:14.929> it<00:01:14.990> in<00:01:16.600> and<00:01:17.600> plug<00:01:18.409> it<00:01:18.530> in<00:01:18.619> just<00:01:18.799> like

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
just snap it in and plug it in just like

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.030 
just snap it in and plug it in just like
that<00:01:20.470> then<00:01:21.470> I<00:01:21.560> can<00:01:21.740> play<00:01:21.890> music

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.130 

and<00:01:25.550> get<00:01:25.730> to<00:01:25.910> a<00:01:25.940> music<00:01:26.420> page<00:01:27.160> ipod

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.980
