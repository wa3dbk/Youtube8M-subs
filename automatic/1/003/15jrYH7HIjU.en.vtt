00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:06.680
 autoclaved aerated concrete today 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.490
 the day is considered the most 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.830
 energy efficient structural 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.809
 building material in particular that 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.509
 material is four times warmer than brick 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.699
 and it is also environmentally friendly, not flammable, durable and 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.320
 durable as art created 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.480
 human building material get 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.480
 such characteristics will try to find out 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:35.820
 to make barty autoclave 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.940
 aerated concrete required day process 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.590
 compare with the preparation of yeast dough 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.809
 mix natural ingredients finely 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.570
 ground sand lime cement water 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.210
 add gas yeast former in 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.460
 In this case, an aluminum suspension of this 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.379
 weight half fill the desired form 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.000
 arima do not enter the dream reaction 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.360
 gas evolves swelling occurs 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.399
 dough rises and hardens in this 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.890
 moment gas concrete resembles plasticine 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.830
 so put him in the autoclave for 16 hours 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.780
 one name is autoclaved aerated concrete and 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.210
 autoclave this vessel working under 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.970
 pressure means there is very high 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.680
 temperature is about 170 108 degrees and 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.840
 very high pressure from 8 to 10 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.640
 atmospheres and at this pressure at this 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.549
 temperature is just the reaction and 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.890
 which lime binds to sand 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.479
 the tank is hammered and a new one is formed 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.610
 material who is called gas force 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.290
 concept here he just has a high 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.890
 strength characteristics which 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.659
 allow 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.450
 from it to make such walls gorgeous 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.009
 vapor permeability tests are and low 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.810
 thermal conductivity coefficient in it and 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.369
 frost resistance autoclaved aerated concrete 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.409
 very similar to penza 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.509
 it also has many pores and capillaries that 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.240
 provides vapor permeability of aerated concrete 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.640
 breathes like a tree just like that 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.680
 situations when a person is living in 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.450
 some room he is experiencing some 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.280
 comfortable or uncomfortable and conditions yes 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.049
 so here is the vapor permeability it in some 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.469
 degree allows designs to breathe 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.010
 the presence of this vapor permeability allows 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:02.770
 migrate moisture from the room 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.630
 in out and clear outside in the room here 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.830
 if you ever lived and all 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.020
 were in a wooden house 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.930
 probably pay attention to the fact that in winter 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.730
 there is warm enough and in the summer there so 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.440
 cool enough to still have a good 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.450
 comfortable aerated concrete it is very close to 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.060
 tree open porous structure 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.610
 aerated concrete increases its frost resistance 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.990
 water expanding when freezing 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.880
 distributed to someone's capillaries there and 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.040
 material when collapsing 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.250
 temperatures is definitely important in 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.990
 harsh in houses of such panels is not 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.950
 need additional insulation in 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:39.010
 Exterior walls outside goes clean 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.470
 priming and painting the building interior 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.960
 hand it is plastering sticking 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.170
 oboy therefore enough to 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.210
 the house was warm true wall panels 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.500
 but the main aerated concrete will be in full 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.850
 least justify their quality 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.650
 characteristics in construction 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.340
 multi-storey houses with one important 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.410
 provided 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.630
 the seams between them should be very 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.850
 carefully insulated this vulnerabilities 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.010
 which we fill with special 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.680
 material called vilaterm 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.640
 he gives minimal heat loss this in 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.390
 that wind does not penetrate 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.030
 the building itself 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.310
 another important characteristic of aerated concrete 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.650
 has a high level of noise insulation 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.250
 average 10 times higher than brick 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.250
 masonry
