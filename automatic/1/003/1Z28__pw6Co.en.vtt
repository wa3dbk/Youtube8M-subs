 hucker 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.310
 for those who do not yet understand, they explain the eleven-meter prix briefly 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.039
 the jury gives 8 students the opportunity to pitch their business plan 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.449
 a maximum of three candidates are forwarded to the following round 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.190
 rest can go home immediately 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.610
 from the finalists the jury chooses a winner that white prize package 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.219
 consisting of office space 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.659
 an online marketing campaign but flat business advice

 business cards and points business bank accounts 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.550
 everything the modern entrepreneur needs 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.550
 to become their success 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.060
 it is still early when the students report to the current ens at the airbase 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.660
 slotervaart 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.660
 shortly thereafter mundane these Christmas days yes the leader 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.380
 do you have the best plan 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.820
 or the best plans and 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.140
 I have a good plan whether I am quite exciting to the jury today 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.430
 towards the customers 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.020
 partially 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.560
 I will hear you but yes it sounds 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.750
 two arrests were made in that year 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.730
 do you suffer from nerves 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.260
 great such an adrenaline feeling conciliar in the body what in March 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.640
 is there now an SMS 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.640
 the first sentences it's the question 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.530
 duped 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.430
 corner must be the first sentence 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.260
 my name is from seller 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.499
 the striker is bitten off by sander 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:47.979
 he himself has developed software that allows personnel matters to see who is on 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.880
 course must i have a the system 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.010
 which lets you use the internet in a good way 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.300
 it's a great one 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.850
 the system for 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.960
 monitoring employee development within organizations 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.510
 it's a bit like having employees at work after it 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.930
 square is if you can further develop yourself and then also a good one 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.230
 Organization from the employer means very difficult for a number 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.479
 one hundred employees 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.889
 good to nag 6 and here comes our system 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:17.719
 seeing a system on the jury believes that the world is waiting for that 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:21.629
 but then with the couple out 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.030
 and I have been active with my company kate immens for more than half a year 

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:29.509
 everyone wants appearance and recognition, albeit from family 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:31.909
 Are your pets your employer? 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:35.930
 Now at work is an important form of recognition is the space to advance you 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.179
 to develop and grow in an organization 

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:43.339
 you will then often stay with your employer for a longer period of time 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:46.549
 has the advantage that operating costs are reduced and development leads to 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.139
 a higher service level katy ms delivers a beast a plan is platform 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:54.109
 for the staff could drawing within organizations 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.049
 whereby attention for and insight into this development process remains 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.430
 it is an online platform and can therefore be offered worldwide if 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.329
 has the advantage that you have such a news product for a decent 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.039
 can offer a price 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:09.679
 aegon work exactly 

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:13.029
 very often there is no one who actually gives or gets those courses 

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:17.389
 Worked there with external trainers and will offer those feeds the film a manager 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:21.849
 in collaboration with the department head a look where the need is and you have 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.389
 about the first customer or yes, multiple sites within forty 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:29.609
 companies just a little something about financing to go yes 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:30.590
 it is a 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.870
 more return payment model rest is a subscription which is also 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.959
 lowering the threshold is that you do not make a mega investment in one go 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.419
 lost every year we want to use this or not 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:44.599
 what depends on the number of employees is now often on the edge of the three and 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.760
 four men the stream district 10,000 euros per year for example you have to yourself 

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:50.779
 developed and conceived 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:53.260
 yes that really started in 2000 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.360
 About six in a hotel really tested and used while noting that it was OK 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.600
 but I am all kinds of scientific 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.059
 to date it appears 9 

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:07.150
 the jury assesses the candidates on plans and presentation 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.160
 the best plan does not necessarily have to win since you can have a bad idea 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:14.090
 compensating with a good presentation alone is not good enough goes with the 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.679
 lift to the next round 

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:17.959
 substantively strong 3 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.249
 which I also like so much 

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:23.349
 I have developed you myself I hope have good customers I really think so 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:25.510
 to the buyer also has 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.890
 The charms also have that people without being paid or that there is 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.400
 the roadside and came to the plan 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.580
 and get it done 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.979
 where i also very impressed for amounts that counts worldwide from the 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.819
 venture 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:44.229
 much before you have earned was recaptured that is what it is for 2 euros per month 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.309
 to conclude in conclusion for five euros for hema tumult ja jaar 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.639
 also a sidetrack 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.349
 that sets the tone 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:58.169
 sander has a no nonsense product and does business with more than forty customers 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.449
 jury was impressed heemskerk 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:04.460
 leave their home 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.069
 yes than expected 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:07.419
 media player 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.419
 The black was that I already think it's storm 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.819
 when I have a hard time throwing the ring 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:14.169
 what do you think 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.169
 apparently have 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.270
 suddenly yet again to seduce Pier Guidi Chili with a transparent Yasmine 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.900
 adjust your own taste 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.039
 that seems simple but make no mistake 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:28.119
 it's not just a jacket
