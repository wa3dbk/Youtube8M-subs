turbo and as you can see it has an

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.800 
turbo and as you can see it has an
interesting<00:01:52.829> design<00:01:52.979> it's<00:01:53.820> kind<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.540> same

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
interesting design it's kind of the same

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.660 
interesting design it's kind of the same
design<00:01:55.320> we've<00:01:55.560> expected<00:01:56.100> from<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.399> Droid

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
design we've expected from the Droid

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.700 
design we've expected from the Droid
lineup<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.299> has<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> little<00:01:57.689> uh<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.560> has<00:01:58.680> a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
lineup but it has a little uh it has a

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.139 
lineup but it has a little uh it has a
few<00:01:58.979> tweaks<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.549> make<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.850> little<00:01:59.969> bit

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
few tweaks that make it a little bit

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.060 
few tweaks that make it a little bit
different<00:02:00.479> from<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.630> other<00:02:00.899> designs<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.649> the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
different from the other designs in the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.999 
different from the other designs in the
past<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:03.270> as<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:03.780> see<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.229> has<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> 5.2<00:02:04.979> inch

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
past so as you can see it has a 5.2 inch

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.920 
past so as you can see it has a 5.2 inch
display<00:02:05.460> on<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.700> front<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.240> on<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.420> back<00:02:06.540> I

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
display on the front and on the back I

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.499 
display on the front and on the back I
got<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.350> 64<00:02:07.920> gigabyte<00:02:08.340> nylon<00:02:08.940> ballistic

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
got the 64 gigabyte nylon ballistic

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.900 
got the 64 gigabyte nylon ballistic
nylon<00:02:09.750> version<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.950> has<00:02:11.069> sort<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.520> cloth

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
nylon version and it has sort of a cloth

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.729 
nylon version and it has sort of a cloth
rough<00:02:12.390> pattern<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:13.110> actually<00:02:13.260> feels<00:02:13.560> kind

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
rough pattern and it actually feels kind

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.170 
rough pattern and it actually feels kind
of<00:02:13.860> nice<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.280> seems<00:02:14.580> like<00:02:14.760> it's<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:14.970> very

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
of nice it seems like it's a very

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.940 
of nice it seems like it's a very
durable<00:02:15.420> material<00:02:15.680> something<00:02:16.680> surprising

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
durable material something surprising

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.770 
durable material something surprising
here<00:02:17.520> is<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.819> actually<00:02:17.970> doesn't<00:02:18.569> have

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
here is that it actually doesn't have

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.780 
here is that it actually doesn't have
any<00:02:19.020> sort<00:02:19.770> of<00:02:19.890> indication<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.520> it's<00:02:20.700> a

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
any sort of indication that it's a

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.300 
any sort of indication that it's a
verizon<00:02:21.239> phone<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.599> has<00:02:21.720> no<00:02:22.020> verizon<00:02:22.950> branding

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
the back and as you can see it's not a

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.920 
the back and as you can see it's not a
very<00:02:40.170> thin<00:02:41.040> phone<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:41.640> has<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.790> 3900<00:02:42.540> milliamp
