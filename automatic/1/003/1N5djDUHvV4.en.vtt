effects were it's important so create

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.100 
effects were it's important so create
the<00:01:18.720> shrapnel<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.520> then<00:01:20.810> once<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.930> do<00:01:22.080> that

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
the shrapnel and then once you do that

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:34.830 
the shrapnel and then once you do that
exit<00:01:22.920> out<00:01:23.509> so<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.630> registers<00:01:26.479> then<00:01:27.479> go<00:01:27.689> back<00:01:27.869> in

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.340 

and<00:01:35.140> create<00:01:35.710> another<00:01:36.040> bomb<00:01:36.600> with<00:01:37.600> the<00:01:38.020> next

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
and create another bomb with the next

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.020 
and create another bomb with the next
effect<00:01:39.030> now<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.420> key<00:01:41.040> problem<00:01:42.040> is<00:01:42.490> that<00:01:42.700> some

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
effect now the key problem is that some

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.960 
effect now the key problem is that some
people<00:01:43.330> just<00:01:43.920> craft<00:01:44.920> one<00:01:45.220> bomb<00:01:45.430> and<00:01:45.700> they're

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
people just craft one bomb and they're

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.240 
people just craft one bomb and they're
like<00:01:46.090> um<00:01:46.360> yeah<00:01:47.229> that<00:01:47.440> should<00:01:47.770> be<00:01:47.860> good<00:01:48.009> so

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
like um yeah that should be good so

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.640 
like um yeah that should be good so
let's<00:01:49.060> see<00:01:49.299> what<00:01:50.049> the<00:01:50.170> challenge<00:01:50.500> actually

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
entails it might be um a little bit

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.070 
entails it might be um a little bit
differently<00:01:53.560> worded<00:01:53.830> then<00:01:54.430> a<00:01:54.759> lot<00:01:55.720> of<00:01:55.840> people
