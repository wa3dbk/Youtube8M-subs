I<00:00:16.710> use<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:18.050> curl<00:00:19.050> maker<00:00:19.320> gel<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:19.949> it's<00:00:20.279> made

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
I use the curl maker gel and it's made

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.450 
I use the curl maker gel and it's made
with<00:00:20.910> marshmallow<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:21.990> agave<00:00:22.350> leaf<00:00:22.740> extract

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
with marshmallow and agave leaf extract

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.630 
with marshmallow and agave leaf extract
it<00:00:24.150> looks<00:00:24.570> like<00:00:24.750> Liz<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.170> gel<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:26.310> can<00:00:26.369> see

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
it looks like Liz the gel you can see

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.849 
it looks like Liz the gel you can see
how<00:00:26.730> much<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:27.060> use<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:27.930> one<00:00:28.439> bottle<00:00:28.769> will

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
how much I use so one bottle will

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.140 
how much I use so one bottle will
probably<00:00:29.160> last<00:00:29.340> me<00:00:29.580> for<00:00:29.760> like<00:00:29.880> two

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
probably last me for like two

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.319 
probably last me for like two
applications<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:31.470> it's<00:00:31.590> uh<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.920> looks<00:00:32.329> like

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
applications and it's uh it looks like

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.610 
applications and it's uh it looks like
this<00:00:33.420> reddish<00:00:33.840> color<00:00:34.079> color<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.500> that's

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
this reddish color color and that's

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.799 
this reddish color color and that's
probably<00:00:34.860> because<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.489> agave<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.270> but

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
probably because of the agave in it but

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.540 
probably because of the agave in it but
when<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.020> put<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.500> your<00:00:37.590> hands<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.100> mix<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.460> up

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
when you put in your hands and mix it up

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.850 
when you put in your hands and mix it up
it's<00:00:38.850> pretty<00:00:39.210> much<00:00:39.390> earlier<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.590> dries

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
it's pretty much earlier and it dries

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.760 
it's pretty much earlier and it dries
clear<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.760> like<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.510> fact<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.110> gel<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.559> in

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
clear I like the fact that the gel is in

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.700 
clear I like the fact that the gel is in
a<00:00:43.860> pump<00:00:44.160> bottle<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:45.390> easy<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.780> just<00:00:46.140> pop

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
a pump bottle so it's easy to just pop

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.560 
a pump bottle so it's easy to just pop
out<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.280> it's<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.149> gel<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.020> looks<00:00:49.230> like<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.649> I

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
out and it's a gel it looks like this I

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.790 
out and it's a gel it looks like this I
think<00:00:51.570> we<00:00:51.660> can<00:00:51.840> see<00:00:52.020> like<00:00:52.199> it's<00:00:52.379> very<00:00:52.500> very

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
think we can see like it's very very

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.200 
think we can see like it's very very
clear<00:00:53.370> as<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.660> nice<00:00:54.960> fresh<00:00:55.649> smell<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.399> it's<00:00:57.120> a

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
clear as a nice fresh smell and it's a

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.090 
clear as a nice fresh smell and it's a
little<00:00:57.480> bit<00:00:57.600> enough<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.800> little<00:00:59.010> bit

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
little bit enough like it's a little bit

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.250 
little bit enough like it's a little bit
greasy<00:00:59.340> like<00:00:59.699> you<00:01:00.120> feel<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.510> it's<00:01:00.629> gets<00:01:00.899> greasy

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
greasy like you feel it it's gets greasy

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.529 
greasy like you feel it it's gets greasy
where<00:01:02.010> kinky<00:01:02.340> curly<00:01:02.789> as<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.969> feel<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.390> more

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
where kinky curly as you feel it's more

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.320 
where kinky curly as you feel it's more
like<00:01:03.719> slimy<00:01:04.229> stock<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.790> paired<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.270> with

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
like slimy stock and I paired it with

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.399 
like slimy stock and I paired it with
their<00:01:06.780> role<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.619> moisture<00:01:08.369> milk<00:01:09.140> and<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.229> don't

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
their role of moisture milk and I don't

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.170 
their role of moisture milk and I don't
know<00:01:10.500> if<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.860> was<00:01:11.040> actually<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.580> best<00:01:11.939> thing

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
know if this was actually the best thing

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.899 
know if this was actually the best thing
this<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.229> more<00:01:13.439> like<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.650> guess<00:01:14.189> re<00:01:14.490> monster

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
this is more like I guess re monster

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.219 
this is more like I guess re monster
eyes<00:01:15.060> or<00:01:15.240> after<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.689> set<00:01:15.930> your<00:01:16.049> hair

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
eyes or after you have set your hair

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.530 
eyes or after you have set your hair
because<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.040> found<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.790> was<00:01:17.820> my<00:01:18.180> mix<00:01:18.420> it

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
because I found that it was my mix it

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.999 
because I found that it was my mix it
with<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> gel<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.140> water<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.439> kind<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.830> like

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
with a gel in the water I kind of like

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.630 
with a gel in the water I kind of like
beat<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.640> up<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.000> became<00:01:21.840> very<00:01:22.110> very<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.640> cakey

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
beat it up and became very very a cakey

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.149 
beat it up and became very very a cakey
life<00:01:23.820> but<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:25.080> want<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.439> say<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.830> if<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.009> had

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
life but I want to say that if I had

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.280 
life but I want to say that if I had
like<00:01:26.340> two<00:01:26.610> strand<00:01:26.970> twists<00:01:27.479> I'll<00:01:27.869> probably

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
like two strand twists I'll probably

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.109 
like two strand twists I'll probably
twist<00:01:28.799> with<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.520> then<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:29.729> moisture

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
twist with this and then be moisture

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.210 
twist with this and then be moisture
idle<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.810> probably<00:01:31.350> when<00:01:31.799> my<00:01:31.950> hair<00:01:32.189> is

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.790 
good thing so what I do for products
like<00:01:57.090> this<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.719> cut<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.350> container<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:59.040> half

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
like this I cut the container in half

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.620 
like this I cut the container in half
and<00:01:59.920> I<00:01:59.980> have<00:02:00.160> to<00:02:00.340> call<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.790> mystery

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
different container so that's easier for

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.310 
different container so that's easier for
me<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.350> use<00:02:05.620> been<00:02:06.070> like<00:02:06.310> this<00:02:07.270> it's<00:02:07.630> like<00:02:07.990> and

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
then just go in and scoop it up and

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.300 
then just go in and scoop it up and
apply<00:02:10.270> it<00:02:10.300> to<00:02:10.479> my<00:02:10.600> hair<00:02:10.869> because<00:02:11.740> this<00:02:12.100> is

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
apply it to my hair because this is

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.940 
apply it to my hair because this is
literally<00:02:12.670> it's<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.330> butter<00:02:13.660> in<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:14.290> bottle<00:02:14.680> I

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
literally it's a butter in a bottle I

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.300 
literally it's a butter in a bottle I
mean<00:02:15.880> you<00:02:16.000> can<00:02:16.180> see<00:02:16.420> it's<00:02:16.600> like<00:02:16.810> it's<00:02:17.050> like

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
mean you can see it's like it's like

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.550 
mean you can see it's like it's like
extra-extra<00:02:18.310> spic<00:02:19.050> so<00:02:20.050> I<00:02:20.080> don't<00:02:20.320> think<00:02:20.440> this

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
extra-extra spic so I don't think this

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.380 
extra-extra spic so I don't think this
is<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.740> good<00:02:20.920> idea<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.580> put<00:02:21.730> this<00:02:21.880> in<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.090> bottom

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
is a good idea to put this in the bottom

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.510 
is a good idea to put this in the bottom
but<00:02:22.600> it<00:02:22.870> definitely<00:02:23.140> is<00:02:23.410> very<00:02:23.620> smooth<00:02:24.010> I<00:02:24.340> do

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
but it definitely is very smooth I do

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.070 
but it definitely is very smooth I do
like<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:24.820> product<00:02:25.330> coming<00:02:25.480> so<00:02:25.720> this<00:02:25.870> is

actually Dave one of my washing go and
it<00:02:29.500> gave<00:02:29.740> really<00:02:30.370> really<00:02:30.640> great<00:02:30.850> definition

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430
