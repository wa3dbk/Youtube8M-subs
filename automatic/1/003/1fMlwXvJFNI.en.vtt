00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 Hi, I'm not crazy, I'm an ass. 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.970
 for the first time here in the 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:14.600
 way 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:17.160
 [Music] 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.230
 That's it guys I'm with the myth with 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.030
 the legend with the bank itself or in god 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.610
 We want to talk a little about the 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.840
 dubbing the movie the renaissance df 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.090
 thank you very much to sell for receiving the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.100
 here in the unit is primarily the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.840
 you think of the movie I liked I 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.640
 I liked much more than the battle of 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.320
 Gods is not because I found more 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.620
 dynamic 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.879
 the battle is more intense and everything else is 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:46.890
 has surprises are more 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:01:02.600
 interesting new characters and bring 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:01:02.600
 back the little one is recording in the 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:25.340
 view of the Japanese character to see 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.210
 who can fit you think and 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.399
 original in Japanese 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.990
 and then you will agree a little with the 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.899
 voice and a lot with the profile of the character 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.390
 with the figure of the character because at 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.630
 sometimes for example the voice of the 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.490
 Japanese freezer is quite different in 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.399
 Brazil, so often we too 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.289
 not only by the voice and profile of the 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.200
 character that suddenly that voice 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.119
 works for Japanese culture to 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.820
 brazilian culture 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:59.159
 the woman then we go after the voice 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.600
 but also through the profile of the 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:07.350
 character what are the characteristics 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:09.660
 de roseli 99 was not 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.400
 changed a lot changed the voice you 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.960
 knowing the personality of the 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.380
 bank, you can already give a face more 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.600
 What do I do, I know more about you. 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.910
 character but the responsibility is 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.319
 bigger than before I started there and 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.749
 such 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.719
 so it 's a job like any other 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:29.299
 today I know of the legion of fans of 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:30.920
 people who accompany and like the 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.810
 that character that series 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.209
 marked the childhood and adolescence of 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.549
 a lot of people so I feel a little that 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:41.629
 weight of the shoulders when entering the 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:43.879
 studio to do but football gives 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.290
 attention to the world cup final 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.019
 everyone is tense and worried 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.239
 nervous anxious but after the ball 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.280
 roll there forget it's more or less this 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.219
 I did that anxiety a little with 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.079
 afraid to disappoint stage not so well 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:59.030
 something like this but now who enters 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.829
 in the studio starts recording not 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.560
 disappointed it was beautiful, it's too beautiful 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.730
 I like fucking hell, I think we 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.469
 in the case of the house in the field and other 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.629
 pages was campaigning to bring the 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:11.299
 film to dub until homage to you 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:13.489
 I think it's very important because 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:17.359
 times the net distributor any movie 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:19.459
 He does a horror movie of humor and 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:21.799
 science fiction and then they are people 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.989
 who are usually there in your living room and 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.509
 does not have a direct link with the fan of 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.359
 each segment so I think this is important. 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:31.370
 expression of the public in relation to a 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:34.310
 project is a work whatever it is 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.979
 because this will bring as a certainty 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.319
 quality and dubbing of that work 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:43.549
 so I think it's fundamental that there is 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:45.979
 kind of trot like that of the fans but with 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.949
 without this feedback 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:51.229
 The fan 's own 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:54.169
 were not so good nor why phases 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:56.629
 even the name is someone from the public and 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:59.299
 said that name so it's not the 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:01.669
 sabita then it is very important for me 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:04.040
 I always look good with form hands. 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:05.739
 especially because over the long term 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.879
 These years, I've always been very 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:11.150
 thus awarded the affection of 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:13.609
 Nice people, that's what I try. 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.590
 to reciprocate in the way that I may have 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:17.539
 best possible way and make 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.000
 example the dubbing of these films is 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:21.299
 it was certainly a way of repaying the 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.430
 ets 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.949
 This commitment I think is a 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.690
 which I have here to give 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.940
 to the public back everything that 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.800
 I always received it nice thank you 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.599
 guys who did not like the movie is going to 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.759
 watch good cinema and the renaissance 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:37.590
 and this is important because it is done 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:40.169
 a campaign also fills the bag 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.180
 of the customer does everything daddy 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.729
 but if the film does not make a financial return 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.889
 at the box office the next they do not 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.720
 since then it is very important that 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.310
 people complain covers that I want this 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.620
 that she knows I want, maybe I want 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.509
 I want this but I have to go there. 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.550
 watch has no use downloading on 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:05:00.030
 because then in the next 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.139
 commercially passes through a distributor 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.050
 to be a business that is not worth it 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:07.710
 then it is necessary that the public also 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.419
 go to the movies and do the work for 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.550
 that this can be financially 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.800
 viable and next of his new action 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.360
 again and that's not it folks with 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.800
 strengthen it was was not to 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.169
 dragon ball zo renaissance cinema 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.539

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:34.740
 sup and I hope I can participate 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.289
 that I can manage to accomplish this 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.110
 work in the unit because
