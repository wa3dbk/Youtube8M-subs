and<00:00:21.410> I<00:00:22.410> have<00:00:23.279> made<00:00:23.519> brush<00:00:24.060> piles<00:00:24.390> like<00:00:25.400> that

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
and I have made brush piles like that

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.700 
and I have made brush piles like that
big<00:00:26.699> pile<00:00:26.910> right<00:00:27.180> there<00:00:27.449> along<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.439> entire

length of the road about 2,200 feet of
piles<00:00:31.740> down<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.340> road<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.630> like<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
piles down the road that is like the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.560 
piles down the road that is like the
trees<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.590> are<00:00:34.710> limbed<00:00:35.010> all<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.239> most

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
trees that are limbed all the most

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.459 
trees that are limbed all the most
little<00:00:36.780> logs<00:00:36.899> have<00:00:37.050> been<00:00:37.079> cut<00:00:37.260> up<00:00:37.350> into

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
little logs have been cut up into

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.290 
little logs have been cut up into
firewood<00:00:37.680> size<00:00:38.129> logs<00:00:38.489> already<00:00:38.879> but<00:00:39.149> that's

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
firewood size logs already but that's

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.020 
firewood size logs already but that's
the<00:00:40.050> brush<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.500> remains<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.250> we<00:00:41.579> need<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.879> do

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
the brush that remains and we need to do

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.069 
the brush that remains and we need to do
something<00:00:42.360> with<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:42.600> we're<00:00:42.690> going<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.870> chip

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
something with it so we're going to chip

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.920

make<00:00:45.930> compost<00:00:46.410> out<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:47.100> them<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.610> line<00:00:47.850> some

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
make compost out of them and line some

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.369 
make compost out of them and line some
trails<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.289> woods<00:00:49.500> with<00:00:49.649> them<00:00:49.800> so

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
trails and the in the woods with them so

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.090 
trails and the in the woods with them so
I'm<00:00:52.379> going<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.559> show<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.739> guys<00:00:52.829> how<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
I'm going to show you guys how the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.760 
I'm going to show you guys how the
chipper<00:00:53.370> works

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
chipper works

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.790 
chipper works
this<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> Vermeer<00:00:56.610> BC<00:00:57.180> 1000<00:00:57.840> XL<00:00:58.199> don't<00:00:58.710> know

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
this is a Vermeer BC 1000 XL don't know

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.599 
this is a Vermeer BC 1000 XL don't know
what<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.039> means<00:00:59.280> but<00:00:59.520> it's<00:00:59.910> pretty<00:01:00.059> beefy<00:01:01.609> it

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
what that means but it's pretty beefy it

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.539 
what that means but it's pretty beefy it
runs<00:01:02.789> on<00:01:02.910> diesel<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.660> first<00:01:04.470> thing<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:05.129> first

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
runs on diesel so first thing it first

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.590 
runs on diesel so first thing it first
key<00:01:05.790> position<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:07.110> glow<00:01:07.830> plug<00:01:08.070> heat<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.479> they

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
key position is a glow plug heat so they

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.120 
key position is a glow plug heat so they
warm<00:01:10.110> right<00:01:10.260> now<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.590> don't<00:01:10.650> really<00:01:10.799> need<00:01:11.010> to

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
warm right now so I don't really need to

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.179 
warm right now so I don't really need to
do<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.610> then<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.479> start<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:13.010> once<00:01:14.010> we

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
do that and then you start it once we

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.580 
do that and then you start it once we
start<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.810> we're<00:01:15.810> gonna<00:01:15.900> come<00:01:16.140> over<00:01:16.170> here<00:01:16.380> to

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
start it we're gonna come over here to

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.230 
start it we're gonna come over here to
what<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.640> essentially<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.990> clutch<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:20.240> this

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
what is essentially the clutch and this

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.929 
what is essentially the clutch and this
guy<00:01:21.479> basically<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.830> move<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.250> from<00:01:23.820> this

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
guy basically you move it from this

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.359 
guy basically you move it from this
position<00:01:24.180> into<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.020> position<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.740> get<00:01:25.920> to

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
position into this position to get to

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.060 
position into this position to get to
get<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.549> high<00:01:26.790> idle<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.630> get<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.900> RPMs<00:01:28.290> up<00:01:28.530> then

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
get a high idle to get the RPMs up then

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.310 
get a high idle to get the RPMs up then
you<00:01:29.159> slowly<00:01:29.549> move<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.390> down<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.079> clutch

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
you slowly move this down so the clutch

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.980 
you slowly move this down so the clutch
catches<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.009> engages<00:01:32.850> here<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.240> hi<00:01:33.450> chipping

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
catches and engages here in hi chipping

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.149 
catches and engages here in hi chipping
mode<00:01:34.850> so<00:01:35.850> once<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.420> get<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.689> into<00:01:36.810> there<00:01:37.200> we<00:01:38.040> can

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
mode so once we get it into there we can

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.840 
mode so once we get it into there we can
come<00:01:38.369> back<00:01:38.549> over<00:01:38.759> here<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:40.400> this<00:01:41.400> bar<00:01:41.670> right

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
come back over here and this bar right

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.169 
come back over here and this bar right
here<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.270> rocks<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.840> rocks<00:01:43.049> back

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.590 

just<00:01:48.179> goes<00:01:48.359> back<00:01:49.109> and<00:01:49.380> fold<00:01:49.819> so<00:01:50.819> this<00:01:51.390> position

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
just goes back and fold so this position

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.169 
just goes back and fold so this position
right<00:01:51.929> here<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.679> folding<00:01:53.219> which<00:01:53.520> makes<00:01:53.999> the

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
right here is folding which makes the

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.660 
right here is folding which makes the
feed<00:01:54.390> go<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.350> then<00:01:55.859> if<00:01:56.039> we<00:01:56.189> get<00:01:56.310> something

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
feed go in and then if we get something

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.219 
feed go in and then if we get something
stuck<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.090> there<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.450> we<00:01:57.659> need<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.899> reverse<00:01:58.200> it

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
stuck in there and we need to reverse it

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.069 
stuck in there and we need to reverse it
we<00:01:58.590> can<00:01:58.740> put<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.219> way<00:01:59.459> and<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.569> will<00:02:00.750> spit

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
we can put it this way and it will spit

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.510 
we can put it this way and it will spit
it<00:02:01.170> back<00:02:01.319> out<00:02:01.560> again<00:02:03.140> we<00:02:04.140> do<00:02:04.289> anytime<00:02:04.679> to

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
it back out again we do anytime to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.210 
it back out again we do anytime to
change<00:02:05.789> this<00:02:06.500> the<00:02:07.500> light<00:02:07.679> will<00:02:07.829> be<00:02:07.859> blinking

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
change this the light will be blinking

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.249 
change this the light will be blinking
here<00:02:08.549> that<00:02:08.910> means<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.299> the<00:02:09.450> chipper<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:10.019> not

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
here that means that the chipper is not

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.619 
here that means that the chipper is not
