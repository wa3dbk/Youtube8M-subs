percent<00:00:14.160> chance<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:14.880> getting<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.240> drop<00:00:15.480> so<00:00:15.929> I

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
percent chance of getting the drop so I

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.580 
percent chance of getting the drop so I
just<00:00:17.010> Lee's<00:00:17.279> turn<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.640> on<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.000> then<00:00:18.470> best<00:00:19.470> of

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
just Lee's turn it on and then best of

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.980 
just Lee's turn it on and then best of
all<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:20.070> will<00:00:20.130> come<00:00:20.310> up<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:21.090> just<00:00:21.300> collect<00:00:21.779> the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
all it will come up and just collect the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.160 
all it will come up and just collect the
drops<00:00:22.260> up<00:00:22.500> there<00:00:22.880> like<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:26.779> okay<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.109> you

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
drops up there like that okay so you

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.439 
drops up there like that okay so you
will<00:00:28.439> need<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.980> solid<00:00:29.550> block<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.150> doesn't

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
will need a solid block that doesn't

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.229 
will need a solid block that doesn't
burn<00:00:30.660> like<00:00:31.019> cloth<00:00:31.349> or<00:00:31.590> ward<00:00:31.890> some<00:00:32.759> Pistons

thing you need to do is take a five by

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.709 
thing you need to do is take a five by
five<00:00:46.590> hole<00:00:46.950> that's<00:00:47.700> three<00:00:47.940> blocks<00:00:48.180> deep<00:00:48.450> and

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
five hole that's three blocks deep and

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.660 
five hole that's three blocks deep and
in<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.899> middle<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.739> need<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.190> dig<00:00:50.460> a

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
in the middle of that you need to dig a

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.260 
in the middle of that you need to dig a
three<00:00:51.059> by<00:00:51.270> three<00:00:51.300> hole<00:00:51.809> it's<00:00:52.379> one<00:00:52.649> block<00:00:52.829> deep

three by three hole it's one block deep

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.209 
three by three hole it's one block deep
then<00:00:54.270> here<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.690> need<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.960> dig<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> three<00:00:55.530> by<00:00:55.890> one

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
then here you need to dig a three by one

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.010 
then here you need to dig a three by one
hole<00:00:56.610> let's<00:00:57.059> three<00:00:57.329> blocks<00:00:57.660> deep<00:01:00.020> alright

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
hole let's three blocks deep alright

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.549 
hole let's three blocks deep alright
this<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.410> how<00:01:01.730> you<00:01:02.730> do<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.090> Pistons<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.989> you

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
this is how you do the Pistons and you

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.770 
this is how you do the Pistons and you
see<00:01:04.949> your<00:01:05.100> pervasion<00:01:05.519> around<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.540> pattern

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
see your pervasion around in a pattern

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.990 
see your pervasion around in a pattern
like<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.140> but<00:01:08.100> make<00:01:08.400> sure<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.700> fill<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
like that but make sure you fill the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.660 
like that but make sure you fill the
middle<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:10.350> then<00:01:10.619> all<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.280> have<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.520> do

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
middle in and then all you have to do

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.800 
middle in and then all you have to do
put<00:01:12.270> let's<00:01:13.229> ring<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.979> redstone<00:01:14.340> all<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.689> way

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
put let's ring of redstone all the way

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.260 
put let's ring of redstone all the way
around<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:17.100> then<00:01:17.130> you've<00:01:17.700> got<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.909> do<00:01:18.150> the

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
around and then you've got to do the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.410 
around and then you've got to do the
clock<00:01:18.630> which<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:20.430> put<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.939> block<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
clock which is that put a block in the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.160 
clock which is that put a block in the
middle<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.869> them<00:01:22.700> put<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.939> redstone<00:01:24.630> torch<00:01:24.930> on

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
middle of them put the redstone torch on

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.640 
middle of them put the redstone torch on
facing<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.400> Pistons<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.840> bets<00:01:28.020> down<00:01:28.200> dost

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
facing the Pistons the bets down dost

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.170 
facing the Pistons the bets down dost
there<00:01:29.990> put<00:01:30.990> them<00:01:31.200> put<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.470> blocks<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:32.130> top<00:01:32.759> of

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
there put them put the blocks on top of

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.920 
there put them put the blocks on top of
them<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.540> put<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> redstone<00:01:35.119> repeater<00:01:36.119> facing

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
them and put a redstone repeater facing

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.110 
them and put a redstone repeater facing
away<00:01:37.020> from<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.350> piston

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
away from the piston

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.390 
away from the piston
quickly<00:01:38.960> put<00:01:39.140> it<00:01:39.260> on<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.560> last<00:01:39.950> tick<00:01:42.220> we<00:01:43.220> shut

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
quickly put it on the last tick we shut

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.430 
quickly put it on the last tick we shut
it<00:01:43.550> off<00:01:43.700> all<00:01:44.030> you<00:01:44.180> have<00:01:44.300> to<00:01:44.420> do<00:01:44.570> is<00:01:44.810> put<00:01:45.110> a<00:01:45.140> lever

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
it off all you have to do is put a lever

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.190 
it off all you have to do is put a lever
there<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:46.100> just<00:01:46.390> enough<00:01:47.390> like<00:01:47.630> that<00:01:47.870> and<00:01:48.110> then

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
there and just enough like that and then

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.290 
there and just enough like that and then
you<00:01:48.320> can<00:01:48.500> cover<00:01:48.770> it<00:01:48.860> up<00:01:49.040> and<00:01:49.250> everything<00:01:49.340> so

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
you can cover it up and everything so

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.690 
you can cover it up and everything so
now<00:01:50.540> to<00:01:50.990> do<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.470> actual<00:01:51.860> calm<00:01:52.340> storage

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
now to do the actual calm storage

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.490 
now to do the actual calm storage

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
middle and then up then do that type of

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.950 
middle and then up then do that type of
thing<00:02:08.660> whether<00:02:09.140> it's<00:02:09.950> over<00:02:10.280> there<00:02:10.429> pistol

butt<00:02:11.960> and<00:02:12.380> water<00:02:13.310> in<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.640> middle<00:02:15.130> so<00:02:16.130> it

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
butt and water in the middle so it

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.940 
butt and water in the middle so it
should<00:02:17.420> flow<00:02:17.600> down<00:02:17.930> like<00:02:18.170> that<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:18.650> then

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
should flow down like that and then

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.460 
should flow down like that and then
somewhere<00:02:19.460> over<00:02:19.700> there<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.870> just<00:02:21.140> cover<00:02:21.380> it

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
somewhere over there and just cover it

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:33.700 
somewhere over there and just cover it
up<00:02:21.620> so<00:02:21.830> it<00:02:21.920> doesn't<00:02:22.160> make<00:02:22.250> obsidian<00:02:32.590> put<00:02:33.590> it

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
up so it doesn't make obsidian put it

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.800

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
you have to do the best believer and

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.640 
you have to do the best believer and
then<00:02:39.380> it<00:02:39.680> should<00:02:40.010> come<00:02:40.190> up<00:02:40.310> I<00:02:41.110> love<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.470> book

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
then it should come up I love the book

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.550 
then it should come up I love the book
any<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:44.000> one<00:02:44.180> you<00:02:44.330> choose<00:02:44.540> for<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:44.959> first<00:02:45.230> two

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
any the one you choose for the first two

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.610 
any the one you choose for the first two
then<00:02:45.850> cobblestone<00:02:46.850> will<00:02:47.000> stop<00:02:47.209> coming<00:02:47.239> up

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
then cobblestone will stop coming up

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.910 
then cobblestone will stop coming up
wait<00:02:48.620> till<00:02:48.800> it<00:02:48.890> gets<00:02:49.040> three<00:02:49.489> high<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:50.000> then

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
wait till it gets three high and then

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.510 
wait till it gets three high and then
you<00:02:51.920> can<00:02:52.600> stop<00:02:53.600> it<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.050> then<00:02:54.440> put<00:02:54.470> up<00:02:54.980> city<00:02:55.370> in

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
you can stop it and then put up city in

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.030 
you can stop it and then put up city in
the<00:02:55.670> middle<00:02:55.970> so<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.600> drops<00:02:57.050> don't<00:02:57.470> fall<00:02:57.800> down

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
the middle so the drops don't fall down

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.949 
the middle so the drops don't fall down
there<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:58.880> you<00:02:59.000> have<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.239> stop<00:02:59.450> it<00:02:59.480> and<00:02:59.720> dig<00:02:59.840> it

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
there and you have to stop it and dig it

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.000 
there and you have to stop it and dig it
all<00:03:00.080> out<00:03:00.580> so<00:03:01.580> then<00:03:01.850> the<00:03:02.540> cobblestone<00:03:03.440> won't<00:03:03.920> go

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
all out so then the cobblestone won't go

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.650 
all out so then the cobblestone won't go
any<00:03:04.160> higher<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:04.760> then<00:03:05.060> every<00:03:05.270> time<00:03:05.300> you<00:03:05.540> hit

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
any higher and then every time you hit

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.080 
any higher and then every time you hit
it<00:03:05.810> will<00:03:06.170> just<00:03:06.430> pair<00:03:07.430> itself<00:03:09.310> this<00:03:10.310> also<00:03:10.640> works

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
it will just pair itself this also works

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.400 
it will just pair itself this also works
with<00:03:11.739> furnaces<00:03:13.780> so<00:03:14.780> you<00:03:14.840> can<00:03:15.110> put<00:03:15.290> the

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
with furnaces so you can put the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:24.900 
with furnaces so you can put the
furnaces<00:03:16.300> there<00:03:17.300> like<00:03:17.900> that

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.200
