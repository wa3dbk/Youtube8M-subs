mistake I see here is that people do a
lot<00:01:58.130> more<00:01:58.310> talking<00:01:58.759> and<00:01:59.360> not<00:01:59.810> enough

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
lot more talking and not enough

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.240 
lot more talking and not enough
listening<00:02:00.890> so<00:02:01.729> sales<00:02:02.149> is<00:02:02.539> far<00:02:02.899> more<00:02:03.289> about

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
listening so sales is far more about

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.910 
listening so sales is far more about
listening<00:02:05.200> you<00:02:06.200> should<00:02:06.349> only<00:02:06.470> be<00:02:06.590> talking

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
listening you should only be talking

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.130 
listening you should only be talking
twenty<00:02:07.520> percent<00:02:07.849> of<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.000> time<00:02:08.209> and<00:02:08.569> that

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
twenty percent of the time and that

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.410 
twenty percent of the time and that
twenty<00:02:09.440> percent<00:02:09.560> of<00:02:09.829> the<00:02:09.920> time<00:02:10.180> should<00:02:11.180> be

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
twenty percent of the time should be

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.920 
twenty percent of the time should be
asking<00:02:11.989> the<00:02:12.410> strategic<00:02:13.099> questions<00:02:13.930> timing

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
asking the strategic questions timing

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
asking the strategic questions timing
your<00:02:15.049> questions<00:02:15.620> asked

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
your questions asked

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.729 
your questions asked
make<00:02:16.489> them<00:02:16.670> scream<00:02:16.849> preparation<00:02:17.540> all<00:02:18.410> of<00:02:18.590> that

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
make them scream preparation all of that

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.650 
make them scream preparation all of that
drives<00:02:19.099> questions<00:02:19.940> you're<00:02:20.030> going<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.209> ask

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
drives questions you're going to ask

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.309 
drives questions you're going to ask
so<00:02:21.260> talk<00:02:21.530> less<00:02:21.829> listen<00:02:22.190> more<00:02:22.880> and<00:02:23.569> one<00:02:24.170> of<00:02:24.260> the

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
so talk less listen more and one of the

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.990 
so talk less listen more and one of the
biggest<00:02:24.530> mistakes<00:02:24.920> I<00:02:25.040> see<00:02:25.069> people<00:02:25.220> make<00:02:25.519> is

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
biggest mistakes I see people make is

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.920 
biggest mistakes I see people make is
that<00:02:26.420> they<00:02:27.010> ask<00:02:28.010> a<00:02:28.310> question<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:29.209> they're<00:02:29.660> so

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
that they ask a question and they're so

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.990 
that they ask a question and they're so
busy<00:02:30.170> thinking<00:02:30.620> about<00:02:30.829> their<00:02:31.220> answer

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
busy thinking about their answer

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.540 
busy thinking about their answer
they're<00:02:32.630> not<00:02:32.840> listening<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:34.130> what<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.520> person

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
they're not listening to what the person

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.350 
they're not listening to what the person
is<00:02:34.910> saying<00:02:35.770> so<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:37.070> entire<00:02:37.400> conversation<00:02:37.940> is

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
is saying so the entire conversation is

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.960 
is saying so the entire conversation is
driven<00:02:38.540> exclusively<00:02:38.720> around<00:02:39.680> them<00:02:40.130> it's

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
driven exclusively around them it's

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.820 
driven exclusively around them it's
listening<00:02:41.240> not<00:02:41.690> telling<00:02:42.140> about<00:02:42.530> what's

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
listening not telling about what's

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.240 
listening not telling about what's
important<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.190> them<00:02:44.650> one<00:02:45.650> good<00:02:45.830> question

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
important to them one good question

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.610 
important to them one good question
to<00:02:46.400> wrap<00:02:46.610> up<00:02:46.820> there<00:02:47.030> with<00:02:47.210> them<00:02:47.530> when<00:02:48.530> you

YouTube<00:03:07.580> that's<00:03:07.700> when<00:03:07.910> people<00:03:08.090> do<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:08.990> ice

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
YouTube that's when people do the ice

YouTube that's when people do the ice
shifting<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:10.280> where<00:03:10.400> they<00:03:10.490> get<00:03:10.580> a<00:03:10.640> little

nervous and then they think well I

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.010 
nervous and then they think well I
probably<00:03:13.490> shouldn't<00:03:13.880> say<00:03:14.060> this<00:03:14.090> but<00:03:14.690> and

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
want some in charges they need to close

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.870 
want some in charges they need to close
more<00:04:04.590> business<00:04:04.650> I<00:04:05.100> need<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.340> close<00:04:05.580> more<00:04:05.820> sales

more business I need to close more sales
and<00:04:06.560> there's<00:04:07.560> no<00:04:07.680> big<00:04:07.860> secret<00:04:07.890> to<00:04:08.340> it<00:04:08.460> because

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
and there's no big secret to it because

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.180 
and there's no big secret to it because
closing<00:04:09.480> isn't<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.840> issue<00:04:09.990> if<00:04:10.920> you<00:04:11.100> were

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
closing isn't the issue if you were

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.010 
closing isn't the issue if you were
doing<00:04:11.310> all<00:04:11.640> of<00:04:11.670> these<00:04:11.880> other<00:04:12.120> things<00:04:12.240> right<00:04:12.810> in

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
doing all of these other things right in

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.540 
doing all of these other things right in
the<00:04:13.110> conversation<00:04:13.770> and<00:04:14.070> you<00:04:14.160> tweak<00:04:14.400> them

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
the conversation and you tweak them

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.870 
the conversation and you tweak them
effectively<00:04:15.000> the<00:04:15.900> closes<00:04:16.709> symbolism<00:04:17.489> it's

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
effectively the closes symbolism it's

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.900 
effectively the closes symbolism it's
just<00:04:18.209> an<00:04:18.750> ass<00:04:18.930> it's<00:04:19.799> just<00:04:20.040> a<00:04:20.130> follow<00:04:20.400> up<00:04:20.549> a

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
just an ass it's just a follow up a

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.350 
just an ass it's just a follow up a
close<00:04:21.510> is<00:04:21.780> nothing<00:04:22.610> and<00:04:23.610> so<00:04:23.760> once<00:04:23.940> you<00:04:24.030> close

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
close is nothing and so once you close

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.230 
close is nothing and so once you close
you're<00:04:24.720> simply<00:04:24.930> recapping<00:04:25.710> your<00:04:26.640> solution

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
you're simply recapping your solution

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.480 
you're simply recapping your solution
the<00:04:28.200> value<00:04:28.590> that<00:04:28.770> it<00:04:28.890> brings<00:04:28.920> to<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.310> table

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
the value that it brings to the table

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.880 
the value that it brings to the table
for<00:04:29.790> them<00:04:29.970> and<00:04:30.390> then<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:31.140> benefits<00:04:31.620> that

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
for them and then the benefits that

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.980 
for them and then the benefits that
they're<00:04:32.070> going<00:04:32.220> to<00:04:32.310> enjoy<00:04:32.670> by<00:04:33.360> working<00:04:33.690> with

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
they're going to enjoy by working with

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.510 
they're going to enjoy by working with

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
small steps to move forward so it should

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.690 
small steps to move forward so it should
be<00:04:52.290> specific

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
be specific

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.600

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
experience to test it and that would be

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.240 
experience to test it and that would be
an<00:05:11.940> objective<00:05:12.330> of<00:05:12.420> the<00:05:12.630> closer<00:05:12.930> I<00:05:13.380> might<00:05:13.680> get

them to close on a needs assessment
I<00:05:16.170> might<00:05:16.830> get<00:05:17.010> them<00:05:17.160> to<00:05:17.250> close<00:05:17.490> on<00:05:17.700> just<00:05:17.940> a

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
I might get them to close on just a

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.900 
I might get them to close on just a
meeting<00:05:18.750> for<00:05:19.050> lunch<00:05:19.580> any<00:05:20.580> of<00:05:20.640> those<00:05:20.730> things

really<00:05:21.060> moving<00:05:21.420> forward<00:05:22.430> and<00:05:23.430> you<00:05:23.580> should

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
really moving forward and you should

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.300 
really moving forward and you should
always<00:05:23.970> have<00:05:24.120> two<00:05:24.450> objectives<00:05:24.950> if<00:05:25.950> you<00:05:26.130> have

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
always have two objectives if you have

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.360 
always have two objectives if you have
one<00:05:26.580> and<00:05:27.180> it<00:05:27.450> gets<00:05:27.570> shot<00:05:27.810> down<00:05:27.840> immediately

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
one and it gets shot down immediately

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.830 
one and it gets shot down immediately
then<00:05:29.370> you're<00:05:29.550> dead<00:05:29.730> in<00:05:29.820> the<00:05:29.850> water<00:05:29.940> so<00:05:30.810> you

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
then you're dead in the water so you

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.600 
then you're dead in the water so you
want<00:05:31.050> to<00:05:31.110> always<00:05:31.140> have<00:05:31.560> a<00:05:31.620> backup<00:05:31.740> objective

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
want to always have a backup objective

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.030 
want to always have a backup objective
you<00:05:33.210> know<00:05:33.240> especially<00:05:33.810> if<00:05:33.870> it's<00:05:34.020> costing<00:05:34.350> 350

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
you know especially if it's costing 350

you know especially if it's costing 350
bucks<00:05:35.250> each<00:05:35.700> time<00:05:36.060> you<00:05:36.720> better<00:05:36.870> have<00:05:37.080> a

bucks each time you better have a

this<00:05:41.610> I<00:05:41.990> called<00:05:42.990> him<00:05:43.400> and<00:05:44.400> my<00:05:44.550> objective<00:05:44.670> was

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
this I called him and my objective was

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.970 
this I called him and my objective was
to<00:05:45.180> find<00:05:45.300> out<00:05:45.690> what<00:05:46.290> does<00:05:46.440> the<00:05:46.560> recruiting

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
to find out what does the recruiting

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.070 
to find out what does the recruiting
process<00:05:47.270> and<00:05:48.270> then<00:05:48.389> what<00:05:48.510> is<00:05:48.630> their<00:05:48.780> criteria

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
process and then what is their criteria

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.890 
process and then what is their criteria
and<00:05:49.860> then<00:05:50.490> to<00:05:50.669> close<00:05:50.880> on<00:05:51.270> whether<00:05:51.480> the<00:05:51.660> first

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
and then to close on whether the first
