00:00:19.793 --> 00:00:23.206
 I believed you would come, 

00:00:23.406 --> 00:00:26.989
 Now, 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:34.637
 You did not show up, no, no, no ... 

00:00:34.837 --> 00:00:40.951
 I'm sick now, 

00:00:41.151 --> 00:00:48.605
 Why are you hiding, 

00:00:48.805 --> 00:00:53.096
 Recognize me, You said, 

00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:56.830
 I'll be with you 

00:00:56.987 --> 00:00:59.945
 But even when my eyes do not see you, 

00:01:00.145 --> 00:01:05.834
 You're next to me 

00:01:06.034 --> 00:01:12.863
 When I call you and you do not respond 

00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:20.437
 And when I do not feel close to you 

00:01:20.637 --> 00:01:27.669
 I know and believe in Your Word 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:37.545
 You're there and I'm not alone 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.513
 And even if I do not see you 

00:01:58.713 --> 00:02:06.332
 And I do not understand why 

00:02:06.532 --> 00:02:20.634
 At my depth you put Peace 

00:02:22.553 --> 00:02:25.891
 We are inseparable 

00:02:26.091 --> 00:02:29.822
 You live in me 

00:02:31.337 --> 00:02:37.488
 And if I do not see you, I trust You 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:50.742
 When I call you and I do not get the answer, and when I do not feel close to you, 

00:02:50.942 --> 00:02:58.508
 I know and believe Your Word 

00:02:58.871 --> 00:03:10.074
 You're here, and I'm not alone 

00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:29.216
 We are indivisible, you live in me 

00:03:29.416 --> 00:03:36.985
 And if I do not see you, I believe in You 

00:03:40.898 --> 00:03:46.935
 When I call you and you do not respond 

00:03:47.135 --> 00:03:54.350
 And when I do not feel close to you 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:01.726
 I know and believe in Your Word, 

00:04:01.926 --> 00:04:28.661
 You're there and I'm not alone
