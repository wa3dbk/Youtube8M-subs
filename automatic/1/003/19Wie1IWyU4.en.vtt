Lisa like cooler effects so like the
flare<00:01:25.520> gives<00:01:25.729> a<00:01:25.820> great<00:01:26.270> flickering<00:01:26.810> that<00:01:27.050> kind

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
flare gives a great flickering that kind

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.219 
flare gives a great flickering that kind
of<00:01:27.590> really<00:01:27.950> hot<00:01:28.190> right<00:01:28.580> light<00:01:28.910> and<00:01:29.479> it<00:01:29.720> it

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
of really hot right light and it it

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.800 
of really hot right light and it it
pulsates<00:01:30.800> whereas<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.369> glow<00:01:32.360> of<00:01:32.390> a<00:01:32.630> glow

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
pulsates whereas the glow of a glow

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.190 
pulsates whereas the glow of a glow
stick<00:01:32.840> it's<00:01:33.259> a<00:01:33.530> very<00:01:33.770> light<00:01:34.119> lower-tier<00:01:35.200> like

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
stick it's a very light lower-tier like

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.230 
stick it's a very light lower-tier like
more<00:01:36.410> ambient<00:01:36.979> kind<00:01:37.190> of<00:01:37.250> a<00:01:37.310> glow<00:01:37.580> and<00:01:37.729> stuff<00:01:38.000> so

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
more ambient kind of a glow and stuff so

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.669 
more ambient kind of a glow and stuff so
it<00:01:38.479> does<00:01:38.600> allow<00:01:38.810> this<00:01:39.020> kind<00:01:39.200> of<00:01:39.289> switch<00:01:39.500> up<00:01:39.649> the

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
it does allow this kind of switch up the

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:41.740 
it does allow this kind of switch up the
lighting<00:01:39.920> we<00:01:40.130> keep<00:01:40.280> mechanic<00:01:40.700> in<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:40.850> game<00:01:41.060> so

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
lighting we keep mechanic in the game so

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.270 
lighting we keep mechanic in the game so

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
find in the actually that's pretty much

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.620 
find in the actually that's pretty much
it<00:01:45.800> we<00:01:46.039> actually<00:01:46.340> we're<00:01:46.580> pretty<00:01:46.819> similar<00:01:47.539> the

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
it we actually we're pretty similar the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.029 
it we actually we're pretty similar the
player<00:01:47.780> can<00:01:47.990> actually<00:01:48.259> do<00:01:48.409> in<00:01:48.590> terms<00:01:48.740> of<00:01:48.860> what

they have available to them because

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.760 
they have available to them because
we're<00:01:50.630> kind<00:01:50.780> of<00:01:50.810> more<00:01:51.020> want<00:01:51.350> to<00:01:51.440> make<00:01:51.530> it<00:01:51.649> it's

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
we're kind of more want to make it it's

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.850 
we're kind of more want to make it it's
very<00:01:51.950> much<00:01:52.100> exploration<00:01:52.700> we<00:01:53.659> want<00:01:53.899> them<00:01:54.289> to

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
very much exploration we want them to

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.830 
very much exploration we want them to

identify some level okay so it's like
it's<00:02:30.080> that's<00:02:30.440> interesting<00:02:30.830> because<00:02:30.890> it's

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
it's that's interesting because it's

like that it's interesting it's a little

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.050 
like that it's interesting it's a little
more<00:02:47.690> much<00:02:48.260> more<00:02:48.410> sedate<00:02:48.770> then<00:02:49.160> there's<00:02:49.910> other

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
more much more sedate then there's other

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
at one point there's you know your

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.820 
at one point there's you know your
doesn't<00:02:53.959> enemy<00:02:54.290> coming<00:02:54.530> and<00:02:54.620> you're<00:02:54.709> running

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
kind of like the idea of this sort of

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.759 
kind of like the idea of this sort of
being<00:02:58.910> a<00:02:59.030> more<00:02:59.209> atmospheric<00:02:59.720> laid<00:03:00.019> back<00:03:00.290> you

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
being a more atmospheric laid back you

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.100 
being a more atmospheric laid back you
know<00:03:01.120> explore<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.150> narrative<00:03:02.780> that's<00:03:02.840> real

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
know explore the narrative that's real

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.990 
know explore the narrative that's real
well<00:03:03.410> one<00:03:03.860> of<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.010> things<00:03:04.070> is<00:03:04.340> that<00:03:04.880> we

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
well one of the things is that we

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.940 
well one of the things is that we
figured<00:03:05.360> out<00:03:05.420> making<00:03:05.989> ends<00:03:06.140> over<00:03:06.290> over<00:03:06.739> time

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
figured out making ends over over time

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.100 
figured out making ends over over time
is<00:03:07.190> that<00:03:07.220> players<00:03:07.880> play<00:03:08.420> game<00:03:08.660> differently

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
is that players play game differently

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.470 
is that players play game differently
and<00:03:09.680> if<00:03:09.769> we<00:03:09.920> give<00:03:10.130> them<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.489> power<00:03:10.640> to<00:03:10.820> digest

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
and if we give them the power to digest

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.390 
and if we give them the power to digest
story<00:03:11.750> and<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.200> method<00:03:12.650> that<00:03:12.769> they<00:03:12.980> want<00:03:13.220> to

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
story and the method that they want to

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
are one so we're let the flexibility let

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
I actually I play a lot of adventure

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.810 
I actually I play a lot of adventure
games<00:03:33.200> like<00:03:33.350> old-school<00:03:33.620> adventure<00:03:34.100> games<00:03:34.310> so

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
games like old-school adventure games so

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.980 
games like old-school adventure games so
now<00:03:34.970> that<00:03:35.120> i'm<00:03:35.180> talking<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:35.480> this<00:03:35.570> feels<00:03:35.840> like

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
now that i'm talking to this feels like

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.490 
now that i'm talking to this feels like
a<00:03:36.370> dated<00:03:37.370> version<00:03:37.760> of<00:03:37.850> that<00:03:37.880> kind<00:03:38.120> yeah<00:03:38.330> I

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
a dated version of that kind yeah I

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.840 
a dated version of that kind yeah I
don't<00:03:39.500> say<00:03:39.740> point-and-click<00:03:40.130> but<00:03:40.460> it's<00:03:40.670> like

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
don't say point-and-click but it's like

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.060 
don't say point-and-click but it's like
that<00:03:41.120> there's<00:03:41.990> Gomery<00:03:42.500> there's<00:03:42.800> certain

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
that there's Gomery there's certain

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.700 
that there's Gomery there's certain
mechanics<00:03:43.490> is<00:03:43.880> very<00:03:44.210> it<00:03:44.870> has<00:03:45.020> some<00:03:45.200> sandbox

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:45.710 
mechanics is very it has some sandbox

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.710 
mechanics is very it has some sandbox
behaviors<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:46.400> intro<00:03:46.940> for<00:03:47.120> sure<00:03:47.270> so

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
behaviors and intro for sure so

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.260 
behaviors and intro for sure so
excellent<00:03:48.620> and<00:03:48.740> I<00:03:49.370> guess<00:03:49.700> what<00:03:49.910> wasn't<00:03:50.090> made

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
excellent and I guess what wasn't made

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.460 
excellent and I guess what wasn't made
inspiration<00:03:50.750> will<00:03:50.840> get<00:03:50.960> made<00:03:51.110> you<00:03:51.200> guys<00:03:51.320> want

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
inspiration will get made you guys want

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.200 
inspiration will get made you guys want
to<00:03:51.530> make<00:03:51.650> a<00:03:51.680> game<00:03:51.980> like<00:03:52.190> this<00:03:52.250> um<00:03:52.640> you<00:03:53.060> have

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.210 
to make a game like this um you have

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.449 
to make a game like this um you have
urban<00:03:53.510> spelunkers<00:03:53.930> amongst<00:03:54.350> your<00:03:54.470> crowd<00:03:54.710> it's

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
urban spelunkers amongst your crowd it's

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.090 
urban spelunkers amongst your crowd it's
it's<00:03:55.940> a<00:03:56.090> concept<00:03:56.510> that<00:03:56.630> was<00:03:56.930> brought<00:03:57.830> up<00:03:58.010> in

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
it's a concept that was brought up in

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.410 
it's a concept that was brought up in
there<00:03:58.250> pretty<00:03:58.310> much<00:03:58.459> like<00:03:58.820> the<00:03:58.940> prototyping

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
there pretty much like the prototyping

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.900 
there pretty much like the prototyping
phase<00:03:59.480> I'm<00:04:00.230> they<00:04:00.860> historically<00:04:01.580> I<00:04:01.670> mean

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
phase I'm they historically I mean

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.090 
phase I'm they historically I mean
zombies<00:04:02.810> we<00:04:03.140> have<00:04:03.290> employees<00:04:03.890> that<00:04:03.920> have

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
zombies we have employees that have

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.530 
zombies we have employees that have
worked<00:04:04.280> on<00:04:04.370> fear<00:04:04.670> we<00:04:04.880> have<00:04:05.000> employees<00:04:05.330> at<00:04:05.420> work

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
worked on fear we have employees at work

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.699 
worked on fear we have employees at work
Tonkin<00:04:05.840> down<00:04:06.070> we<00:04:07.070> did<00:04:07.250> two<00:04:07.940> saw<00:04:08.180> games<00:04:08.709> over

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
Tonkin down we did two saw games over

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.110 
Tonkin down we did two saw games over
the<00:04:09.800> last<00:04:09.830> couple<00:04:10.100> years<00:04:10.280> I<00:04:10.610> can<00:04:10.730> see<00:04:10.940> those

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
the last couple years I can see those

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.060 
the last couple years I can see those
influences<00:04:11.630> yeah<00:04:11.900> so<00:04:12.530> I<00:04:12.560> mean<00:04:12.680> we<00:04:12.950> have<00:04:13.040> a

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
influences yeah so I mean we have a

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.040 
influences yeah so I mean we have a
pretty<00:04:13.310> good<00:04:13.370> history<00:04:13.790> was<00:04:14.000> with<00:04:14.360> pretty<00:04:14.930> much

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
pretty good history was with pretty much

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.210 
pretty good history was with pretty much
for<00:04:15.290> our<00:04:15.380> games<00:04:15.590> so<00:04:16.540> we<00:04:17.709> we<00:04:18.709> wanted<00:04:19.040> to<00:04:19.070> make

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
for our games so we we wanted to make

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.280 
for our games so we we wanted to make
something<00:04:19.430> different<00:04:19.820> and<00:04:20.000> the<00:04:20.510> big<00:04:20.690> key<00:04:20.989> in

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
something different and the big key in

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.050 
something different and the big key in
daylight<00:04:21.799> is<00:04:21.890> the<00:04:21.980> fact<00:04:22.190> that<00:04:22.280> the<00:04:22.790> entire

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
daylight is the fact that the entire

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.540 
daylight is the fact that the entire
world<00:04:23.270> is<00:04:23.860> procedurally<00:04:24.860> generated<00:04:24.890> every

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
world is procedurally generated every

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.400 
world is procedurally generated every
time<00:04:25.850> you<00:04:25.940> play<00:04:26.060> or<00:04:26.300> is<00:04:26.419> it<00:04:26.540> really<00:04:26.720> yeah<00:04:26.990> okay

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
time you play or is it really yeah okay

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.530 
time you play or is it really yeah okay
so<00:04:27.440> when<00:04:27.860> you<00:04:27.950> play<00:04:28.100> it<00:04:28.160> again<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:29.300> entire

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
so when you play it again the entire

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.110 
so when you play it again the entire
layout<00:04:29.870> of<00:04:30.169> level<00:04:30.440> will<00:04:30.530> be<00:04:30.620> different<00:04:30.830> I<00:04:31.730> did

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
layout of level will be different I did

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.550 
layout of level will be different I did
see<00:04:32.300> I<00:04:32.330> didn't<00:04:32.690> see<00:04:32.780> when<00:04:32.990> we<00:04:33.140> load<00:04:33.260> up<00:04:33.320> as<00:04:33.500> a

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
see I didn't see when we load up as a

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.080 
see I didn't see when we load up as a
generating<00:04:34.010> level<00:04:34.250> and<00:04:34.520> in<00:04:34.790> the<00:04:34.850> back<00:04:34.970> of<00:04:35.060> my

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
generating level and in the back of my

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
generating level and in the back of my
head<00:04:35.240> I<00:04:35.270> thought<00:04:35.480> what<00:04:35.630> is<00:04:35.750> happening<00:04:35.960> that

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
head I thought what is happening that

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.170 
head I thought what is happening that
this<00:04:36.410> is<00:04:36.500> active<00:04:36.740> procedure<00:04:37.010> generator<00:04:37.490> you

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
this is active procedure generator you

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.340 
this is active procedure generator you
know<00:04:38.300> I<00:04:38.480> just<00:04:38.690> thought<00:04:38.750> that<00:04:38.930> might<00:04:39.080> be<00:04:39.169> too

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
know I just thought that might be too

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.690 
know I just thought that might be too
awesome<00:04:39.590> that<00:04:39.890> can't<00:04:40.100> be<00:04:40.190> that<00:04:40.370> just<00:04:40.460> means

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
awesome that can't be that just means

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.520 
awesome that can't be that just means
that<00:04:40.910> must<00:04:41.240> be<00:04:41.360> their<00:04:41.480> name<00:04:41.630> for<00:04:41.810> loading<00:04:42.140> you

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
that must be their name for loading you
