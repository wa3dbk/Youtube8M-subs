 then we have the eco program 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.130
 naturally the most economical 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.310
 often used that program 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.560
 these are those that are at 65 degrees and then 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.540
 have this that is for the heavy 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.330
 contaminated dishes

 washes at 70 degrees and that was also at 70 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.660
 degrees and x program 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.660
 turn it on 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.690
 the beauty of this dishwasher is that too 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.090
 you can put it free standing 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.780
 but you can also put it under your kitchen counter 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.590
 put 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.340
 he is 85 high and he is 60 deep and 60 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.780
 wide 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.480
 furthermore, this dishwasher has one 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.280
 Full water protection makes it safe for me 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.790
 in store but also in the bottom of the 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.030
 machine this dishwasher has two drawers 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.750
 one at the bottom and one at the 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.340
 topside 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.040
 the top is of course for the 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.590
 glasses and cups and saucers 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.599
 You can also skip this right by 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.459
 to make some extra space 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.989
 at the top right we can make large knives and 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.670
 drop ladles 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.799
 we can also postpone this so that 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.360
 we can still put blades in it 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.280
 you can of course just fold away 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.260
 and if you can have a lot of plates 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.849
 who also place at the top then they go 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.379
 here but if you ca n't use it 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.150
 you also just fold away you can 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.500
 top drawer also in height 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.019
 adjust fall with this 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.730
 clip off on both sides and 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.110
 we do that at the bottom 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.420
 we do here in the groove and then he sits 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.239
 so a lot higher so you get more at the bottom 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.910
 have room for becoming tall or pans 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.660
 then the bottom drawer is of course for the 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.700
 plates 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.290
 if you want pans underneath 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.299
 place the herd of cutlery baskets out 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.079
 and that way you get big 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.079
 spaces 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.319
 this dishwasher has two 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.239
 spray arms one sits in the front center 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.489
 the bottom and the top 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.359
 but the lower spray arm that is the 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.219
 orbital 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.319
 spray to you see it all that is 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:57.099
 namely with a little extra 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.840
 spray arm 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.390
 underneath is for that optimum 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.239
 cleaning yes this dishwasher has a 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.579
 stainless steel tub that is of course better off 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.650
 quality than a plastic tub 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.689
 Below is the filter that we run 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.790
 a little to the left then we can do that 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:13.180
 get out once in a while want 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.430
 the month 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.959
 clean well for a while because of that 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.060
 you often stay that way 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.310
 Optimal clean was you 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.570
 want to add softening salt than now 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.979
 turn left here 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.139
 of course you can also have one 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:29.080
 included pastry with which you can easily 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:32.050
 can will box for the 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.910
 dishwasher blocks that sits here 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.310
 if you didn't use that one 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.830
 including the rinse gloss then that can be on 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.199
 this side can be filled with spool here 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.639
 what we at washing machine.nl also recommend 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.610
 once every two months moment 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:48.130
 remove these spray arms and clean 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.330
 so that this boy optimally it 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.330
 water continues to spread
