precisely<00:00:07.460> this<00:00:08.460> kicker<00:00:08.849> is<00:00:09.090> pretty<00:00:09.330> good<00:00:09.630> for

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
precisely this kicker is pretty good for

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.990 
precisely this kicker is pretty good for
you<00:00:09.929> idiots<00:00:10.440> out<00:00:10.530> there<00:00:10.590> do<00:00:11.010> not<00:00:11.130> do<00:00:11.429> not<00:00:11.610> that

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
you idiots out there do not do not that

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.780 
you idiots out there do not do not that
note<00:00:12.300> that<00:00:12.599> do<00:00:12.870> not<00:00:12.990> know<00:00:13.049> how<00:00:13.500> dumb<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.219> so

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
note that do not know how dumb and so

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.129 
note that do not know how dumb and so
because<00:00:15.089> practically<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.630> don't<00:00:15.780> even<00:00:15.870> need

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
because practically I don't even need

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.450 
because practically I don't even need
this<00:00:16.379> I'm<00:00:16.590> just<00:00:16.740> reviewing<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.310> guys<00:00:17.400> are

all noobs especially like everyone knows

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.650 
all noobs especially like everyone knows
x<00:00:20.490> squared<00:00:20.820> plus<00:00:20.939> B<00:00:21.150> squared<00:00:21.180> equals<00:00:21.449> C

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
x squared plus B squared equals C

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.540 
x squared plus B squared equals C
squared<00:00:21.810> according<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.439> my<00:00:22.529> calculation<00:00:23.310> I

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
squared according to my calculation I

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.740 
squared according to my calculation I
don't<00:00:23.670> even<00:00:23.850> need<00:00:24.119> this<00:00:24.359> all<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:24.600> guys<00:00:24.689> are

the whole world and it's pretty easy so
let's<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.730> square<00:00:51.120> root<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.660> something

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
let's do the square root of something

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.260 
let's do the square root of something
all<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.980> need<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.160> do<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.370> press<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.059> button

you press that and it gives you the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.910 
you press that and it gives you the
square<00:01:11.130> root<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.430> something<00:01:11.580> precisely<00:01:12.150> and

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
square root of something precisely and

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.350 
square root of something precisely and
I'm<00:01:13.920> gonna<00:01:14.070> do<00:01:14.189> square<00:01:14.400> 25<00:01:14.880> which<00:01:15.060> everyone

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
I'm gonna do square 25 which everyone

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.550 
I'm gonna do square 25 which everyone
knows<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:15.689> fine<00:01:15.900> according<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.470> my

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
knows it's fine according to my

knows it's fine according to my
calculations<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.430> really<00:01:17.549> easy<00:01:17.909> i<00:01:18.119> don't

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
calculations this is really easy i don't

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.210 
calculations this is really easy i don't
even<00:01:18.360> always<00:01:18.720> use<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.960> stop<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.890> use<00:01:20.070> your

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
even always use a stop and use your

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.390 
even always use a stop and use your
brain<00:01:20.520> more<00:01:20.820> yeah<00:01:21.479> basically<00:01:22.220> it's<00:01:23.220> pretty

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
brain more yeah basically it's pretty

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.780 
brain more yeah basically it's pretty
