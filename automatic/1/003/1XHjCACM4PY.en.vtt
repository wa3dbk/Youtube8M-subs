00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 huhu people i am welcome to bottle 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.290
 my guild wars 2 jumping kassel geico 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.940
 ZwillmÃ¼hle high three all important 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.460
 As always you will find information in 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.320
 the video description the jumping 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.320
 Kassel is in the top 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.150
 left corner of the area maelstrom 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.570
 summit that on the world map 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.100
 pretty far in the south right here in the top 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.470
 the left corner at the way mark 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.410
 cormorant from where we will start 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.660
 here at my position 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.430
 have you reached my position that is 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.340
 as you do not look far from the road 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.280
 mark finds a small gap in here 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.559
 where you can go in and around in that 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.210
 area for the jumping kassel to come 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.140
 We have to prepare many for this 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.660
 jumping kassel not 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.219
 It can actually be done with every level 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.690
 make and with everything all skills as 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.510
 we do not have any special skills 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.250
 take along for this jumping kassel 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.460
 however, here is the property 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.410
 be very beneficial to your fall 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.780
 Damage by 50 percent reduces such a 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.420
 property has every class and that can 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.760
 here to be quite helpful 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.880
 so just follow my way up here 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.170
 this dice and wait here until the 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.640
 spines go away they are always 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.640
 relatively hard to see 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.439
 but if you look carefully you can see 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.380
 These spikes wait until they are gone 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.689
 and then jump over this dice here 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.060
 and then here on this branch and then 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.579
 here in this yes in this spark into it 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.799
 so we will each time a new job 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.409
 teleported and then have the 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.110
 Incidentally, the next spark will be in 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.520
 an incorrect spark purely runs will 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.840
 take her one step back 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.270
 teleport means that means you have to 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.070
 make this obstacle again here 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.539
 pay attention to these wooden posts here 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.130
 long swing comes waiting for this 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.200
 Woodpiles really stand completely 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.340
 stay and then run in through here 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.929
 in this sphere and now not here 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.220
 mistakes make one of these balls 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.630
 Run as I said then you will 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.710
 Teleported one step back 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.270
 but now it's over here again 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.149
 to take care of these things again 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.340
 you see you are waiting for spikes 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.100
 until they are gone and then you jump 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.179
 Here you have to be relative here 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.019
 be quick because the spikes come 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.090
 otherwise from behind 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.799
 Now it's over here on this point 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.870
 it is relatively difficult to get in 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:18.160
 because he does not accept that somehow 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.870
 if you go near them as you do 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.400
 Look who does not want you there 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.650
 jump around the corner a bit 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.540
 and then it does not seem like a problem 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.299
 you come in and will continue 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.700
 teleported from up here it goes one 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:32.470
 step down into this thing 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.400
 here that we sometimes not there 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.829
 you have to be around a bit 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.880
 run with it teleported and 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.109
 then you are here and then we have 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.359
 Almost done 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:42.820
 Here we go up that we have to 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:44.910
 now come over this block here 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.100
 so far as I know no spikes out 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:52.420
 just in here more 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.500
 and then we are already over fruit 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.330
 now I was strangely recovered 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.520
 teleported back no matter what 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.690
 Just again we have to go as far as I can 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.860
 know this thing was exactly in this 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.690
 thinks you do not think so 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.370
 in the 2000 as the first and then 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.130
 we also teleported in here and then 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.900
 you get your chest here as well as that 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.090
 archive with that now with trouble up three 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.530
 how have seen that can do 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.030
 somehow from time to stomach and that 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.530
 still teleport one again 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.060
 a piece back but no matter tries 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.290
 just do it again then it has also been 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.640
 I say goodbye 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.640
 construct these words
