subtle because it's the black on black

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.830 
subtle because it's the black on black

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.930 
I've never seen a son an SB before I
don't<00:03:08.650> think<00:03:08.769> it's<00:03:08.890> been<00:03:08.980> on<00:03:09.069> SP<00:03:09.340> before<00:03:09.610> this

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940

on<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.180> jordan<00:03:10.450> 11<00:03:10.750> take<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.290> quick<00:03:11.530> peek<00:03:11.709> on

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
on the jordan 11 take a quick peek on

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.840 
on the jordan 11 take a quick peek on
places<00:03:13.959> obviously<00:03:14.290> row<00:03:14.860> places<00:03:15.310> right<00:03:15.640> there

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
places obviously row places right there

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.789 
places obviously row places right there
and<00:03:16.030> that<00:03:16.060> that<00:03:16.840> just<00:03:17.049> takes<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.290> detail<00:03:17.620> to

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799

the<00:03:17.890> next<00:03:18.220> level<00:03:18.489> for<00:03:18.640> me<00:03:18.760> honestly<00:03:18.880> i<00:03:19.150> think

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.039 
that that's just really sick that they
match<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.760> real<00:03:22.000> places<00:03:22.209> with<00:03:22.420> that<00:03:22.570> they

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
match the real places with that they

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.360 
match the real places with that they
