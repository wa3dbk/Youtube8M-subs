generates in a in desert biomes like

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.330 
generates in a in desert biomes like
really<00:05:02.660> I<00:05:02.690> can<00:05:02.990> barely<00:05:03.200> call<00:05:03.530> this<00:05:03.680> a<00:05:03.830> desert<00:05:04.220> I

and you guys might want to too so
there's<00:05:29.450> the<00:05:29.600> seed<00:05:29.840> if<00:05:30.140> you're<00:05:30.440> interested

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:31.040 
there's the seed if you're interested

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.270 
there's the seed if you're interested
and<00:05:31.330> yep<00:05:32.330> so<00:05:32.900> I<00:05:33.200> don't<00:05:33.410> think<00:05:33.650> there's<00:05:33.860> a<00:05:33.920> well

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
and yep so I don't think there's a well

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.210 
and yep so I don't think there's a well
in<00:05:34.670> this<00:05:35.240> map<00:05:36.170> but<00:05:36.740> if<00:05:37.210> there<00:05:38.210> is<00:05:38.390> all<00:05:39.080> all<00:05:39.590> find

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
in this map but if there is all all find

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.520 
in this map but if there is all all find
it<00:05:40.430> and<00:05:40.790> there's<00:05:41.240> a<00:05:41.420> mob<00:05:41.690> spawner<00:05:41.870> right<00:05:42.290> there

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
it and there's a mob spawner right there

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.790 
it and there's a mob spawner right there
let's<00:05:43.460> go<00:05:43.610> check<00:05:43.910> that<00:05:44.150> out<00:05:44.210> but<00:05:45.050> uh<00:05:45.080> yep<00:05:45.470> so

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
let's go check that out but uh yep so

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.220 
let's go check that out but uh yep so
that's<00:05:46.160> it<00:05:46.400> for<00:05:46.430> this<00:05:46.760> video<00:05:47.240> what<00:05:47.720> oh<00:05:47.990> I

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.230 
that's it for this video what oh I

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.930 
that's it for this video what oh I
thought<00:05:48.530> that<00:05:48.590> was<00:05:48.740> two<00:05:49.010> per<00:05:49.250> second<00:05:49.610> on<00:05:49.700> oil

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
thought that was two per second on oil

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.830 
thought that was two per second on oil
what<00:05:50.360> no<00:05:50.960> way<00:05:50.990> oh<00:05:51.470> oh<00:05:52.430> I<00:05:52.550> almost<00:05:52.880> forgot<00:05:53.090> one<00:05:53.810> of

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
what no way oh oh I almost forgot one of

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.320 
what no way oh oh I almost forgot one of
the<00:05:54.080> most<00:05:54.680> important<00:05:55.310> things<00:05:55.580> and<00:05:55.910> that<00:05:56.120> is

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
the most important things and that is

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.390 
the most important things and that is
that<00:05:56.570> skeletons<00:05:57.490> are<00:05:58.490> a<00:05:58.550> lot<00:05:59.030> smarter<00:05:59.480> now<00:05:59.690> in

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
that skeletons are a lot smarter now in

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.290 
that skeletons are a lot smarter now in
that<00:06:01.400> they<00:06:02.150> will<00:06:02.360> not<00:06:02.510> uh<00:06:03.550> like<00:06:04.550> here<00:06:05.000> let<00:06:05.240> me

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
that they will not uh like here let me

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:17.850 
that they will not uh like here let me
do<00:06:05.750> a<00:06:05.780> little<00:06:05.870> example<00:06:06.350> so<00:06:07.280> we<00:06:07.460> got<00:06:15.010> to<00:06:16.720> 22

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
do a little example so we got to 22

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.750 
do a little example so we got to 22
alright<00:06:18.860> so<00:06:19.370> a<00:06:20.060> skeleton<00:06:20.780> right<00:06:21.140> here

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 
alright so a skeleton right here

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.240 
alright so a skeleton right here
oh<00:06:22.820> wait<00:06:23.450> I<00:06:23.510> have<00:06:23.690> to<00:06:23.840> put<00:06:24.020> it<00:06:24.110> on<00:06:24.230> there<00:06:25.100> we<00:06:25.160> go

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
oh wait I have to put it on there we go

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.390 
oh wait I have to put it on there we go
so<00:06:25.910> spawn<00:06:26.420> the<00:06:26.570> skeleton<00:06:27.080> that<00:06:27.530> he's<00:06:27.950> on<00:06:28.130> fire

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
so spawn the skeleton that he's on fire

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.830 
so spawn the skeleton that he's on fire
he<00:06:28.970> will<00:06:29.150> try<00:06:29.450> to<00:06:29.510> go<00:06:29.990> under<00:06:30.530> here<00:06:30.950> to<00:06:31.640> uh<00:06:31.840> to

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 
he will try to go under here to uh to

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.380 
he will try to go under here to uh to
get<00:06:33.080> out<00:06:33.290> of<00:06:33.440> the<00:06:33.560> fire<00:06:33.830> so<00:06:34.310> now<00:06:34.820> you<00:06:34.880> gotta

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:35.390 
get out of the fire so now you gotta

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.420 
get out of the fire so now you gotta
check<00:06:35.780> all<00:06:35.960> the<00:06:36.410> places<00:06:36.590> that<00:06:36.890> are<00:06:37.160> dark

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
check all the places that are dark

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.480 
check all the places that are dark
because<00:06:38.000> this<00:06:38.180> means<00:06:38.480> that<00:06:38.830> they'll<00:06:39.830> hide<00:06:40.190> in

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
because this means that they'll hide in

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.470 
because this means that they'll hide in
places<00:06:41.060> like<00:06:41.350> say<00:06:42.350> you<00:06:42.410> have<00:06:42.620> a<00:06:42.650> big<00:06:42.890> cavern

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:43.480 
places like say you have a big cavern

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.620 
places like say you have a big cavern
they'll<00:06:44.480> hide<00:06:44.930> under<00:06:45.440> it<00:06:45.470> and<00:06:46.060> yeah<00:06:47.060> there'll

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:47.630 
they'll hide under it and yeah there'll

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.170 
they'll hide under it and yeah there'll
be<00:06:47.660> lots<00:06:47.990> of<00:06:48.260> them<00:06:48.440> so<00:06:48.830> they'll<00:06:49.370> just<00:06:49.640> keep

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:50.180 
be lots of them so they'll just keep

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.510 
be lots of them so they'll just keep
doing<00:06:51.140> that<00:06:51.260> but<00:06:51.500> eventually<00:06:51.740> they<00:06:52.070> will<00:06:52.280> die

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 
doing that but eventually they will die

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.320 
doing that but eventually they will die
so<00:06:52.910> yeah<00:06:53.840> don't<00:06:54.290> worry<00:06:54.410> about<00:06:54.560> that<00:06:54.890> too<00:06:55.280> much

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.330 
so yeah don't worry about that too much

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.060 
so yeah don't worry about that too much
but<00:06:56.330> uh<00:06:56.360> yeah<00:06:56.870> keep<00:06:57.320> an<00:06:57.440> eye<00:06:57.530> out<00:06:57.560> for<00:06:57.950> those

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.070 
but uh yeah keep an eye out for those

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.730 
but uh yeah keep an eye out for those
and<00:06:58.870> doesn't<00:06:59.870> look<00:06:59.990> like<00:07:00.170> there's<00:07:00.380> a<00:07:00.440> well

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:00.740 
and doesn't look like there's a well

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:06.010
