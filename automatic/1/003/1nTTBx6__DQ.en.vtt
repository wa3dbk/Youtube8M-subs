00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.930
 they say that man's best friend is 

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:07.149
 the dog in teruel we have discovered that 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.700
 so is the horse these animals 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:12.129
 help intellectual disabled people 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.259
 overcome their fears we have seen how 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.120
 made in an equestrian center just 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:20.580
 open its doors 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.580
 incarnating a 2 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.730
 embodies already we are up how am I 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.310
 very well the first time you have 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.980
 commented that you ride a horse not in 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.690
 the first time he gets on the horse 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.320
 because he has never raised us to go more than 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.670
 now 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.820
 what impression do you have pressure that never 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.320
 has not raised a tie that will throw me a 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.780
 little bit of fear then not and a 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.449
 little bit of fear I have which embody the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.730
 prepared and the relaxed if it is 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.050
 important that it's relaxed, it was the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.210
 horse will notice you 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.780
 everything that you feel no one comes to you 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.940
 we go 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.340
 oscar we imagine that to carry 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.110
 out these kinds of therapies have to 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.140
 be very docile horses not like they are 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.659
 prepares if these headdresses are good 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.000
 prepare in schools worth for this type 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:13.570
 of activities we have to understand that 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.050
 there are horses for all kinds of people 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.770
 in this case in this case these horses 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:23.640
 are prepared to have a 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.200
 normal state without sudden movements 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.100
 you know neither alterations are changes anymore 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.450
 well old about 20 years worth today 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.490
 we are seeing that work is being done 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.460
 with a group of disabled people 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.649
 intellectuals so that they serve you that is 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.470
 what the horses transmit to them if 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.780
 these activities what transmits is 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.929
 a lot of muscular relaxation especially 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.710
 of hips back neck in general 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.690
 legs 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.840
 and have according to the person the 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.240
 having activates disablement 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.000
 muscles a little that are tense and 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.570
 motionless with time they noticed what 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.750
 it's an improvement the shoulders we stretch 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.140
 let's say the column is worth and the movement 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.250
 of the horse in the rest 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.490
 that is what we are seeing now 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.340
 look if now let's make a 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.530
 Exercise the muscle stretch to 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.410
 same time that she is stretching the 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.120
 The horse's movement helps him 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.790
 stretch a little bit better then 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.310
 we get the muscles to stretch by 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.700
 his part and for the part of the horse 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.500
 as well as it finds you well you do not have them 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.190
 fear is the first time also from his 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.130
 you've won a lot like the club and you like them 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.750
 the horses go and tim and carmen we are 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.920
 in a new equestrian center in the 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.870
 Province of Teruel that just opened 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.430
 its doors do very little time 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.170
 less than a month ago the truth that 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.000
 we are working but we are good 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.739
 with hope and starting more than 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.420
 focus exactly on therapy 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.780
 well, the center is a center 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.790
 equestrian classes are taught to the 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.680
 people to ride horses also 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.080
 They make routes and guided tours of the 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.390
 environment and also boarding for horses 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.890
 so this summer we do not have a 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.510
 alternative to spend the months 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.519
 summers because the truth is that if 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.280
 can be an interesting alternative and 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.680
 an alternative in a facilities of 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.569
 luxury the old flour mill of 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.580
 Valbona has become a great 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.730
 hotel complex in the middle of the 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.730
 nature
