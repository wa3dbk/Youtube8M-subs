00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.040
 things not about the shock of a sticker 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.680
 in the good leg the first one is about 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.320
 an interracial commercial which is 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.299
 causing controversy in the USA you know how 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.160
 they are good ways I am also from here 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.170

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:27.070

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.729
 talk about the good topic in the 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.309
 commercial in which I will put the link 

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:37.899
 in the description is a spot not of sony 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.929
 in which it shows the playstation vita 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:43.179
 tv in which it shows some characters 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:46.030
 good some people from other roots 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:48.519
 in it we see a man with white complexion 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.589
 I do not know good says this one or it can be 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.359

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:53.770
 fagot but to see great Britain 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.470
 American but 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:00.610
 what he presses here according to the idiots in 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.960
 the wife the wife is Asian if the 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.390
 which has no problem is normal 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.840
 we do not have interracial couples not that 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.000
 him and me she from us me but to the black 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.120
 mexican gringo mexican or asian and me 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.380
 I do not know or Peruvian with a Chilean and I do not know 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.360
 that is not integration of the problem 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.650
 black read what is black white better 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.860
 no no black black then we are interested 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.140
 good our society good the people of 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.150
 now it is very tolerant not compared to the 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.210
 to our parents the grandparents who were 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.520
 some fucking racists but it's very 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.250
 incredible to see the comments in this 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.440
 commercial that talk about how it is 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.840
 possible that the American is with the 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.640
 Asian and this the other does not what I 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.160
 It seems very dysfunctional and inclusive 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.840
 there is also a part of the spot where 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.450
 You can see the son of this couple 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.250
 obviously it is this one that is with its 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.440
 friends of white tees not that they are white 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.970
 boys who say white boys and 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.979
 puts nippon it is possible that this that the 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.540
 other than here and there good there 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.170
 it says what 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.600
 they are and well I do not know if it's not about giving 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.230
 to understand that they are neither being from Japan 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.420
 you want to expand more and not show 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.640
 a show in a friendly way tri 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.470
 with america because we know they are and is 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.240
 a global company is not only that 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.550
 in Japanese they read us but it's from Japan 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.020
 but we all know the area but although 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.420
 do not believe it the community has also 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.660
 been giving very racist comments 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.870
 with respect to the couple no or is it 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.430
 like the Chilean couple who put the 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.230
 typical agüera with black or yes is 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.390
 truth there is country by sea of ​​chile or where 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.150
 they put a black woman and a black woman 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.130
 white - skinned girl says nothing is 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.110
 they complain and now they put an Asian with 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.459
 a good American with a gringo and thong 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.800
 and the problems that the 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.690
 another good you can this 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.780
 with seeing the comments in the video that 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.770
 I'm going to put this there in the description 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.770
 but 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.319
 people even say that the husband of 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.860
 this Asian would be better Japanese than 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.590
 American 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.970
 well there are many many since 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.470
 many racist comments saying that 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.530
 It is possible that around here that there 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.600
 but silly fool very foolish lost 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.080
 it only happens in the USA and more than anything 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.480
 with this commercial of playstation vita 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.560
 but well said tv half for 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.080
 do or dawn that you who think 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.240
 about it good now we go with the 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.730
 seconds the second is that the buttonhole I wish 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.400
 I pulled it 4 that happens to catch it 4 good 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.670
 the developers of halo 4 people 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.620
 of 343 industries we already know more than 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.990
 sure he's working on halo 5 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.560
 Follow 5 is already confirmed 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:40.080
 there then leave it 5 on the page 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.700
 microsoft and is also working on 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:47.400
 hello tv if a hello tv show and good 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.410
 now it seems that the people of 343 also 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.170
 is working on another project that does not 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.910
 It has a name that is still unknown 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.030
 would try this project but be 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.130
 working on something I do not know again will be 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.959

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:07.450
 that could be I do not have the minimum 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.610
 but if you do not know more than 343 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.070
 could suddenly tell us to be a 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.730
 new game who knows it I do not know 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.260

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.360
 of the five so you know already I 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.740
 dismissal fluxà the dysphonia comments
