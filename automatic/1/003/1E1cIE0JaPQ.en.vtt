00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.810 
I think that looks dewy homely it's that
the<00:01:58.659> Guppies<00:01:58.990> do<00:01:59.140> too<00:01:59.380> now<00:01:59.860> we<00:01:59.890> just<00:02:00.310> don't<00:02:00.520> let

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
the Guppies do too now we just don't let

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.969 
the Guppies do too now we just don't let
them<00:02:01.060> go<00:02:01.299> you<00:02:01.630> actually<00:02:01.869> put<00:02:02.049> the<00:02:02.200> bag<00:02:02.530> into

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
them go you actually put the bag into

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.950 
them go you actually put the bag into
the<00:02:03.070> tank<00:02:03.340> so<00:02:03.549> the<00:02:03.729> water<00:02:04.000> inside<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.600> bag

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
the tank so the water inside the bag

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.020 
the tank so the water inside the bag
becomes<00:02:05.799> the<00:02:05.950> same<00:02:06.130> temperature<00:02:06.670> as<00:02:06.820> the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
becomes the same temperature as the

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.029 
becomes the same temperature as the
water<00:02:07.330> in<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:07.630> tank<00:02:07.990> that<00:02:08.319> way<00:02:08.740> the<00:02:08.890> fish

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
water in the tank that way the fish

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.360 
water in the tank that way the fish
don't<00:02:09.670> get<00:02:09.759> a<00:02:09.789> nasty<00:02:09.970> shock
