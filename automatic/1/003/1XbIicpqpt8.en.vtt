interestingly we're able to offer things

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.890 
interestingly we're able to offer things
that<00:02:12.920> all<00:02:13.010> most<00:02:13.310> places<00:02:13.610> can't<00:02:14.180> offer<00:02:14.480> and

Siteman has the experience and also you
got<00:03:17.480> a<00:03:17.510> teaching<00:03:17.810> University<00:03:18.010> behind<00:03:19.010> them

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
got a teaching University behind them

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.400 
got a teaching University behind them
which<00:03:19.670> is<00:03:19.850> one<00:03:20.090> branch<00:03:20.390> and<00:03:20.750> you<00:03:21.170> got

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
which is one branch and you got

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.590 
which is one branch and you got
barnes-jewish<00:03:22.370> hospital<00:03:22.489> which<00:03:23.329> is<00:03:23.480> the

barnes-jewish hospital which is the

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.569 
barnes-jewish hospital which is the
other<00:03:23.690> branch<00:03:24.049> so<00:03:24.200> they<00:03:24.350> may<00:03:24.739> coexist<00:03:25.160> with

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
other branch so they may coexist with

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.110 
other branch so they may coexist with
each<00:03:25.730> other<00:03:25.970> so<00:03:26.720> you've<00:03:26.900> got<00:03:27.440> to<00:03:27.590> pull<00:03:27.799> of<00:03:27.950> the

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
each other so you've got to pull of the

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.599 
each other so you've got to pull of the
educational<00:03:29.120> units<00:03:29.540> and<00:03:29.750> in<00:03:30.739> the<00:03:31.070> hospital

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
educational units and in the hospital

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.339 
educational units and in the hospital
it's<00:03:31.790> a<00:03:31.940> dynamite<00:03:32.810> situation

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
it's a dynamite situation

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.780 
it's a dynamite situation
and<00:03:34.739> I<00:03:35.370> highly<00:03:36.060> recommend<00:03:36.659> him
