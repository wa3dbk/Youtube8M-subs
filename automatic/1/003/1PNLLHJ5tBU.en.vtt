but<00:00:02.929> I'm<00:00:02.989> going<00:00:03.199> to<00:00:03.320> talk<00:00:03.500> about<00:00:03.679> importance

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:04.430 
but I'm going to talk about importance

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.730 
but I'm going to talk about importance
of<00:00:04.609> imprinted<00:00:05.060> gene<00:00:05.390> expression<00:00:05.899> dosage<00:00:06.410> in

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:06.740 
of imprinted gene expression dosage in

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.560 
of imprinted gene expression dosage in
brain<00:00:07.009> function<00:00:07.040> and<00:00:07.669> in<00:00:08.420> particular

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:08.570 
brain function and in particular

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.509 
brain function and in particular
focusing<00:00:09.379> on<00:00:09.469> neurodevelopmental<00:00:10.070> disease

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:10.519 
focusing on neurodevelopmental disease

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.030 
focusing on neurodevelopmental disease
so<00:00:11.030> first<00:00:11.840> of<00:00:11.929> all<00:00:12.019> what<00:00:12.170> our<00:00:12.320> imprinted<00:00:12.740> genes

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
so first of all what our imprinted genes

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.999 
so first of all what our imprinted genes
imprinted<00:00:13.880> genes<00:00:14.269> are<00:00:15.009> epigenetically

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:16.009 
imprinted genes are epigenetically

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.179 
imprinted genes are epigenetically
modified<00:00:16.610> so<00:00:17.500> expression<00:00:18.500> from<00:00:18.740> this<00:00:18.920> change

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
modified so expression from this change

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.130 
modified so expression from this change
is<00:00:19.430> only<00:00:19.640> from<00:00:19.939> one<00:00:20.000> parental<00:00:20.570> a<00:00:20.600> leo<00:00:20.779> so

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
is only from one parental a leo so

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.439 
is only from one parental a leo so
although<00:00:21.500> we<00:00:21.890> inherit<00:00:22.519> copies<00:00:22.910> of<00:00:22.939> imprinted

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
although we inherit copies of imprinted

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.330 
although we inherit copies of imprinted
genes<00:00:23.779> from<00:00:23.990> both<00:00:24.230> our<00:00:24.410> mum<00:00:24.529> and<00:00:24.680> dad<00:00:24.830> they<00:00:25.250> are

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
genes from both our mum and dad they are

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.250 
genes from both our mum and dad they are
modified<00:00:25.789> by<00:00:26.000> DNA<00:00:26.449> methylation<00:00:26.869> and<00:00:27.230> histone

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
modified by DNA methylation and histone

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.679 
modified by DNA methylation and histone
modifications<00:00:28.250> such<00:00:28.640> that<00:00:28.880> expression<00:00:29.210> for

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
modifications such that expression for

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.229 
modifications such that expression for
some<00:00:29.840> genes<00:00:30.080> is<00:00:30.260> only<00:00:30.410> from<00:00:30.679> maternal<00:00:31.460> copy<00:00:31.640> so

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
some genes is only from maternal copy so

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.060 
some genes is only from maternal copy so
jeans<00:00:32.540> like<00:00:32.720> nest<00:00:32.989> and<00:00:33.170> CD<00:00:33.410> can<00:00:33.650> want<00:00:33.890> to<00:00:33.949> see

jeans like nest and CD can want to see

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.700 
jeans like nest and CD can want to see
and<00:00:34.280> for<00:00:34.309> other<00:00:34.970> genes<00:00:35.269> the<00:00:36.170> expression<00:00:36.589> is

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
and for other genes the expression is

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.799 
and for other genes the expression is
only<00:00:36.860> from<00:00:37.159> the<00:00:37.400> paternal<00:00:38.120> copies<00:00:38.420> are<00:00:38.629> jeans

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
only from the paternal copies are jeans

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:40.899 
only from the paternal copies are jeans
like<00:00:39.019> necked<00:00:39.260> in<00:00:39.409> and<00:00:39.650> peg<00:00:39.949> three<00:00:40.190> and<00:00:40.400> this<00:00:40.699> is

this crimson 15 is far more likely to

this crimson 15 is far more likely to

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:04.360 
result in psychotic illness generally
