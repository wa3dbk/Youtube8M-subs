of the key things was improving the AI
we<00:00:37.170> made<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.440> loads<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.829> subtleties<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.370> make

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
we made it loads of subtleties to make

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.340 
we made it loads of subtleties to make
the<00:00:38.640> air<00:00:38.730> much<00:00:39.059> more<00:00:39.329> autonomous<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.170> when<00:00:40.290> you

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
the air much more autonomous so when you

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.690 
the air much more autonomous so when you
give<00:00:40.469> them<00:00:40.590> an<00:00:40.649> order<00:00:40.770> they<00:00:41.010> just<00:00:41.219> carry<00:00:41.460> out

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
give them an order they just carry out

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.729 
give them an order they just carry out
good<00:00:42.180> common<00:00:42.660> sense<00:00:42.690> rather<00:00:43.290> than<00:00:43.559> needing

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
good common sense rather than needing

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.950 
good common sense rather than needing
lots<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.250> micromanagement<00:00:44.910> they'll<00:00:45.629> do

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
lots of micromanagement they'll do

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.989 
lots of micromanagement they'll do
things<00:00:46.200> like<00:00:46.350> providing<00:00:46.530> bounding<00:00:47.280> fire<00:00:47.550> so

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:47.999 
things like providing bounding fire so

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:49.729 
things like providing bounding fire so
when<00:00:48.420> you're<00:00:48.539> moving<00:00:48.690> forward<00:00:49.260> L<00:00:49.469> for<00:00:49.620> them

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
when you're moving forward L for them

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.259 
when you're moving forward L for them
they'll<00:00:50.010> sit<00:00:50.219> back<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.730> open<00:00:50.969> up<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:51.179> the

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
they'll sit back and open up on the

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:52.639 
they'll sit back and open up on the
enemy<00:00:51.390> thing<00:00:51.690> over<00:00:51.899> there<00:00:52.109> to<00:00:52.379> give<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.620> a

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:55.109 
chance to get over an open space and if

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:57.049 
chance to get over an open space and if
you<00:00:55.230> throw<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.469> grenade<00:00:55.620> amongst<00:00:56.249> some<00:00:56.460> bad

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
to cook off one of those mermaids subtle

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.230 
to cook off one of those mermaids subtle
stuff<00:01:04.350> it's<00:01:04.589> not<00:01:04.650> big<00:01:04.949> headline<00:01:05.339> features<00:01:05.850> but

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
stuff it's not big headline features but

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.340 
stuff it's not big headline features but
it's<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> sort<00:01:06.690> of<00:01:06.750> stuff<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.140> will<00:01:07.200> make

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
it's the sort of stuff that will make

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.510 
it's the sort of stuff that will make
all<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.590> difference<00:01:07.800> when<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.190> play<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
all the difference when you play in the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.010 
all the difference when you play in the
game<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.909> then<00:01:09.210> we've<00:01:09.330> added<00:01:09.510> some<00:01:09.690> really

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
game and then we've added some really

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.840 
game and then we've added some really
cool<00:01:10.380> new<00:01:10.680> details<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.460> just<00:01:11.670> wouldn't

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
cool new details that you just wouldn't

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.520 
cool new details that you just wouldn't
have<00:01:11.970> seen<00:01:12.150> before<00:01:12.510> there's<00:01:13.140> been<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.290> lot<00:01:13.500> of

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
have seen before there's been a lot of

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.340 
have seen before there's been a lot of
time<00:01:13.770> focusing<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.550> convoy<00:01:15.090> based<00:01:15.390> AI<00:01:15.630> so

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
time focusing on the convoy based AI so

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.140 
time focusing on the convoy based AI so
our<00:01:16.470> guys<00:01:16.650> would<00:01:16.920> drive<00:01:17.190> in<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.550> convoy<00:01:17.970> though

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
our guys would drive in a convoy though

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.639 
our guys would drive in a convoy though
we<00:01:18.330> are<00:01:18.420> dynamically<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.320> one<00:01:19.469> of<00:01:19.590> the

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
we are dynamically to one of the

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.530 
we are dynamically to one of the
vehicles<00:01:20.040> getting<00:01:20.310> hit<00:01:20.579> they'll<00:01:20.969> pile<00:01:21.329> out

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
vehicles getting hit they'll pile out

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.630 
vehicles getting hit they'll pile out
but<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:21.869> pair<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.229> up<00:01:22.500> get<00:01:22.710> back<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.130> we've

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
but we pair it up get back in we've

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.370 
but we pair it up get back in we've
changed<00:01:23.850> away<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> vehicle<00:01:24.570> handles<00:01:24.990> with

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
changed away the vehicle handles with

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.889 
changed away the vehicle handles with
our<00:01:25.530> background<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.189> racing<00:01:26.610> titles<00:01:27.299> we've

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
our background of racing titles we've

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.170 
our background of racing titles we've
had<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.259> expertise<00:01:28.710> in-house<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.969> look<00:01:30.090> at

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
had the expertise in-house to look at

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.789 
had the expertise in-house to look at
the<00:01:30.240> way<00:01:30.390> they<00:01:30.570> move<00:01:30.810> in<00:01:31.020> terms<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.409> weight

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
the way they move in terms of weight

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.730 
the way they move in terms of weight
distribution<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:33.180> suspension<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.200> way

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
distribution of suspension and the way

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.499 
distribution of suspension and the way
they<00:01:34.890> drift<00:01:35.219> and<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.850> gives<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> much

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
they drift and that gives you a much

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.600 
they drift and that gives you a much
more<00:01:36.570> authentic<00:01:37.079> handling<00:01:38.009> experience<00:01:38.310> when

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
more authentic handling experience when

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.399 
more authentic handling experience when
you<00:01:38.700> drive<00:01:38.939> on<00:01:39.149> these<00:01:39.299> big<00:01:39.570> military<00:01:39.810> vehicles

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
you drive on these big military vehicles

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.350 
you drive on these big military vehicles
we<00:01:40.770> also<00:01:40.950> into<00:01:41.250> town<00:01:41.430> aesthetically<00:01:42.119> so

the way the technology works and we've
also<00:01:59.250> captured<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.939> whole<00:02:00.180> new<00:02:00.390> set<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.659> motion

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
also captured a whole new set of motion

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.719 
also captured a whole new set of motion
capture<00:02:01.440> data<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:02.009> make<00:02:02.220> sure<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:02.610> our

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
capture data to make sure that our

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.999 
capture data to make sure that our
soldiers<00:02:03.270> act<00:02:03.900> realistically<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.770> field

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
soldiers act realistically in the field

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.889 
soldiers act realistically in the field
so<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.580> time<00:02:05.759> around<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:06.240> see<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.420> guy<00:02:06.659> next

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
so this time around you see a guy next

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.180 
so this time around you see a guy next
to<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.170> he'll<00:02:07.409> actually<00:02:07.530> turn<00:02:07.860> around<00:02:08.100> and

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
to you he'll actually turn around and

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.100 
to you he'll actually turn around and
ice<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.369> shuffle<00:02:08.789> movies<00:02:09.090> legs<00:02:09.330> around<00:02:09.450> when

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
ice you shuffle movies legs around when

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.780 
ice you shuffle movies legs around when
they're<00:02:10.259> going<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.560> spring<00:02:10.950> Natalie<00:02:11.430> kind<00:02:11.730> of

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
they're going to spring Natalie kind of

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.699 
they're going to spring Natalie kind of
run<00:02:11.970> up<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.360> then<00:02:12.480> come<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.020> skidding<00:02:13.290> stop

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
run up and then come to a skidding stop

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.440 
run up and then come to a skidding stop
so<00:02:14.040> lots<00:02:14.489> of<00:02:14.610> little<00:02:14.760> touches<00:02:15.239> on<00:02:15.360> the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
so lots of little touches on the

so lots of little touches on the
animation<00:02:15.720> side<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.290> really<00:02:16.650> make<00:02:17.069> you<00:02:17.250> feel
