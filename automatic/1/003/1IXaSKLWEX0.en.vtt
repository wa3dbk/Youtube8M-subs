patch<00:03:11.360> stays<00:03:11.840> open<00:03:12.140> just<00:03:12.950> enough<00:03:13.280> so<00:03:13.459> I<00:03:13.489> can

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
patch stays open just enough so I can

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.680 
patch stays open just enough so I can
see<00:03:14.030> in<00:03:14.180> front<00:03:14.420> of<00:03:14.569> me<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:15.430> I<00:03:16.430> decided<00:03:17.330> that<00:03:17.480> I

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
see in front of me and I decided that I

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.210 
see in front of me and I decided that I
wouldn't<00:03:17.989> put<00:03:18.230> lights<00:03:18.470> in<00:03:18.680> that<00:03:18.709> one<00:03:19.010> because

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
wouldn't put lights in that one because

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.300 
wouldn't put lights in that one because
this<00:03:20.060> eyepatch<00:03:20.510> you<00:03:20.870> it<00:03:21.170> looks<00:03:21.500> like<00:03:21.800> it<00:03:21.980> shut

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
this eyepatch you it looks like it shut

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.010 
this eyepatch you it looks like it shut
but<00:03:22.520> I<00:03:22.550> can<00:03:22.790> actually<00:03:22.970> see<00:03:23.360> out<00:03:23.540> of<00:03:23.569> it<00:03:23.780> pretty

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
but I can actually see out of it pretty

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.210 
but I can actually see out of it pretty
well<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:25.209> I<00:03:26.209> decided<00:03:26.989> I<00:03:27.200> would<00:03:27.380> not<00:03:27.890> put

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220

well and I decided I would not put
lights<00:03:28.430> in<00:03:28.610> it<00:03:28.730> cuz<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.060> lights<00:03:29.269> there

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930
