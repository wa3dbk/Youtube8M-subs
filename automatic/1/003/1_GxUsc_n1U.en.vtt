00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.770 
bit and it also kind of bent the frame
just<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.250> hair<00:02:30.460> but<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.150> glass<00:02:31.420> actually

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
just a hair but the glass actually

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.450 
just a hair but the glass actually
appears<00:02:32.230> to<00:02:32.320> be<00:02:32.440> just<00:02:32.620> fine<00:02:32.770> so<00:02:33.040> i<00:02:33.070> guess<00:02:33.310> i

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
appears to be just fine so i guess i

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.130 
appears to be just fine so i guess i
would<00:02:33.520> consider<00:02:33.730> that<00:02:33.970> a<00:02:34.090> survival<00:02:34.630> because

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
would consider that a survival because

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.980 
would consider that a survival because
there's<00:02:35.440> no<00:02:35.590> permit<00:02:35.980> of<00:02:36.040> damage<00:02:36.480> yes<00:02:37.480> working

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
there's no permit of damage yes working

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.710 
there's no permit of damage yes working
just<00:02:38.080> fine<00:02:38.580> looks<00:02:39.580> like<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:40.330> corner

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
just fine looks like the corner

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.220 
just fine looks like the corner
definitely<00:02:40.960> took<00:02:41.380> a<00:02:41.530> bit<00:02:41.650> of<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.800> beating

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
definitely took a bit of a beating

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.170 
definitely took a bit of a beating
pretty<00:02:44.230> scratched<00:02:44.800> with<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.070> screen<00:02:45.460> screen

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
pretty scratched with the screen screen

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.590 
pretty scratched with the screen screen
looks<00:02:46.540> like<00:02:46.920> no<00:02:47.920> problems<00:02:48.370> whatsoever<00:02:48.600> it's

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
looks like no problems whatsoever it's

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.100 
looks like no problems whatsoever it's
completely<00:02:50.020> reactive<00:02:50.590> works<00:02:51.250> just<00:02:51.550> fine<00:02:52.110> no

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
completely reactive works just fine no

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.930 
completely reactive works just fine no
separation<00:02:53.500> of<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.740> case<00:02:53.950> so<00:02:54.370> I'd<00:02:54.550> say<00:02:54.790> that's

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
separation of the case so I'd say that's

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.720 
separation of the case so I'd say that's
definitely<00:02:55.650> definitely<00:02:56.650> a<00:02:57.010> solid<00:02:57.190> drop<00:02:57.550> right

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
definitely definitely a solid drop right

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.430 
definitely definitely a solid drop right
