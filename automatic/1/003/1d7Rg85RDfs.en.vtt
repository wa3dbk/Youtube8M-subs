bean plant that's still growing indoors

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.960 
bean plant that's still growing indoors
eventually<00:00:23.130> I'll<00:00:23.250> get<00:00:23.400> outdoors<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:23.939> show

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
now I'll just show you the system i'm

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.810 
now I'll just show you the system i'm
going<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.170> narrate<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.560> i<00:00:31.830> filmed<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.700> with<00:00:32.790> a

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
going to narrate it i filmed it with a

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.270 
going to narrate it i filmed it with a
camera<00:00:33.090> that's<00:00:33.270> got<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.510> lousy<00:00:34.280> recording

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
camera that's got a lousy recording

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.360 
camera that's got a lousy recording
device<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:36.469> having<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.620> come<00:00:37.829> back<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.190> do<00:00:38.250> it

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
device so having to come back and do it

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.880 
device so having to come back and do it
the<00:00:38.460> other<00:00:38.489> way<00:00:42.079> alright<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.320> my<00:00:43.590> drift

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
the other way alright this is my drift

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.850 
the other way alright this is my drift
system<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.300> drift<00:00:45.660> /<00:00:46.050> gravity<00:00:46.620> flow

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
system it's a drift / gravity flow

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.479 
system it's a drift / gravity flow
system<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.690> built<00:00:48.690> my<00:00:48.809> framework<00:00:49.079> at<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.500> two<00:00:50.340> by

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
system I built my framework at a two by

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.700 
system I built my framework at a two by
threes<00:00:50.940> they<00:00:51.750> were<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.960> cheapest<00:00:52.320> would<00:00:52.500> lows

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
threes they were the cheapest would lows

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.139 
threes they were the cheapest would lows
head<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.129> wanted<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.430> raise<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.789> up<00:00:53.850> off<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
head and I wanted to raise it up off the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.630 
head and I wanted to raise it up off the
ground<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.539> little<00:00:54.629> bit<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.960> keep<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.399> cool<00:00:56.399> of

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
ground a little bit to keep the cool of

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.810 
ground a little bit to keep the cool of
the<00:00:56.670> cement<00:00:57.149> from<00:00:57.329> affecting<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.960> plants

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
the cement from affecting the plants

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.490 
the cement from affecting the plants
it's<00:00:59.820> just<00:01:00.000> regular<00:01:00.210> four-inch<00:01:00.899> sewer<00:01:01.199> pipe

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
it's just regular four-inch sewer pipe

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.140 
it's just regular four-inch sewer pipe
there<00:01:02.070> five<00:01:02.370> feet<00:01:02.640> long<00:01:02.670> with<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> ends<00:01:03.510> cap

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.140 

down<00:01:08.780> here<00:01:09.050> on<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:09.230> end<00:01:09.760> just<00:01:10.760> get<00:01:10.970> a<00:01:11.000> better

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
down here on the end just get a better

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.150 
down here on the end just get a better
shot<00:01:11.270> of<00:01:11.480> the<00:01:11.600> cap<00:01:11.900> there<00:01:12.200> those<00:01:13.010> are

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
shot of the cap there those are

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.240 
shot of the cap there those are
submitted<00:01:13.550> into<00:01:13.700> place<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:14.300> then<00:01:14.540> I<00:01:14.630> used

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
submitted into place and then I used

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.530 
submitted into place and then I used
irrigation<00:01:16.250> elbows<00:01:16.610> three-quarter<00:01:17.330> inch

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540

entry the screw right in the silicone to

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.110 
entry the screw right in the silicone to
hold<00:01:20.660> them<00:01:20.780> in<00:01:20.870> place<00:01:21.280> that<00:01:22.280> was<00:01:22.430> my<00:01:22.580> first<00:01:22.820> one

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
hold them in place that was my first one

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.000 
hold them in place that was my first one
jacked<00:01:23.870> it<00:01:24.050> up<00:01:24.140> as<00:01:24.350> you<00:01:24.470> can<00:01:24.620> see<00:01:24.800> there<00:01:24.980> I

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
jacked it up as you can see there I

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.730 
jacked it up as you can see there I
actually<00:01:25.340> had<00:01:25.640> to<00:01:25.670> put<00:01:26.390> a<00:01:26.420> plug<00:01:26.750> in<00:01:26.780> silico<00:01:27.680> to

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
actually had to put a plug in silico to

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.910 
actually had to put a plug in silico to
silicon<00:01:28.400> again<00:01:28.690> it's<00:01:29.690> a<00:01:29.780> shot<00:01:29.990> of<00:01:30.110> cups<00:01:30.500> and

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
silicon again it's a shot of cups and

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.740 
silicon again it's a shot of cups and
there<00:01:31.220> I've<00:01:31.370> got<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:31.820> screws<00:01:32.180> that<00:01:32.360> hold<00:01:32.570> the

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
there I've got the screws that hold the
