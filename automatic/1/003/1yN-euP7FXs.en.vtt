00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.530 

recall<00:00:01.110> that<00:00:01.380> when<00:00:01.650> we<00:00:01.709> spoke<00:00:02.250> about

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:02.540 
recall that when we spoke about

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.720 
recall that when we spoke about
atmospheric<00:00:03.540> pressure<00:00:03.899> we<00:00:04.680> said<00:00:05.040> that<00:00:05.310> at<00:00:05.460> sea

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
atmospheric pressure we said that at sea

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.780 
atmospheric pressure we said that at sea
level<00:00:06.029> our<00:00:06.560> atmosphere<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:07.770> able<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.370> create<00:00:08.760> a

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
level our atmosphere is able to create a

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.970 
level our atmosphere is able to create a
pressure<00:00:09.150> that<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.139> equal<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.710> this<00:00:10.920> quantity

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
pressure that is equal to this quantity

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.150 
pressure that is equal to this quantity
so<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:12.150> molecules<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.019> atoms<00:00:13.230> have<00:00:13.679> composed

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
so the molecules and atoms have composed

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.630 
so the molecules and atoms have composed
our<00:00:14.519> atmosphere<00:00:15.360> create<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.170> pressure<00:00:16.640> equal

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
our atmosphere create a pressure equal

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.450 
our atmosphere create a pressure equal
to<00:00:17.880> one<00:00:18.270> point<00:00:18.600> zero<00:00:18.779> one<00:00:19.289> three<00:00:19.320> times<00:00:19.980> ten<00:00:20.369> to

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
to one point zero one three times ten to

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.599 
to one point zero one three times ten to
the<00:00:20.520> 5<00:00:20.789> Newtons<00:00:21.750> per<00:00:21.840> meter<00:00:22.020> squared<00:00:22.920> now

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
the 5 Newtons per meter squared now

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.490 
the 5 Newtons per meter squared now
let's<00:00:23.910> suppose<00:00:24.119> we<00:00:24.630> examine<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.289> following

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
let's suppose we examine the following

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.880 
let's suppose we examine the following
later<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.119> surface<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.050> lake<00:00:28.260> this<00:00:28.619> at

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
later so the surface of the lake this at

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.310 
later so the surface of the lake this at
sea<00:00:29.279> level<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.090> height<00:00:30.810> from<00:00:31.199> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
sea level and the height from the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.770 
sea level and the height from the
surface<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.579> lake<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.000> bottom<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.630> our

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
surface of the lake to the bottom of our

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.709 
surface of the lake to the bottom of our
lake<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.410> H<00:00:34.770> let's<00:00:35.700> suppose<00:00:36.090> we<00:00:36.420> want<00:00:36.630> to

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
lake is H let's suppose we want to

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.819 
lake is H let's suppose we want to
calculate<00:00:37.160> the<00:00:38.160> fluid<00:00:38.700> pressure<00:00:39.149> inside<00:00:39.870> our

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
calculate the fluid pressure inside our

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.280 
calculate the fluid pressure inside our
lake<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.550> we<00:00:41.579> want<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.030> calculate<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.930> fluid

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
lake so we want to calculate the fluid

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.430 
lake so we want to calculate the fluid
pressure<00:00:43.559> at<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.219> bottom<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.480> lake<00:00:45.719> so

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
pressure at the bottom of the lake so

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.610 
pressure at the bottom of the lake so
not<00:00:46.920> only<00:00:47.280> do<00:00:47.789> we<00:00:47.940> have<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.300> calculate<00:00:48.620> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
not only do we have to calculate the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.740 
not only do we have to calculate the
pressure<00:00:50.039> inside<00:00:50.700> our<00:00:51.210> lake

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
pressure inside our lake

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.229 
pressure inside our lake
due<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.199> volume<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.129> liquid<00:00:53.399> above<00:00:54.000> it

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
due to the volume of the liquid above it

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.779 
due to the volume of the liquid above it
but<00:00:54.780> we<00:00:54.930> also<00:00:55.230> have<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.800> incorporate<00:00:56.190> that

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
but we also have to incorporate that

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.660 
but we also have to incorporate that
fact<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.420> there's<00:00:57.960> not<00:00:58.320> only<00:00:58.559> liquid<00:00:59.430> above

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
fact that there's not only liquid above

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.510 
fact that there's not only liquid above
that<00:00:59.910> point<00:00:59.969> but<00:01:00.870> there's<00:01:01.109> also<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.949> entire

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
that point but there's also this entire

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.380 
that point but there's also this entire
sea<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.480> air<00:01:03.899> molecules<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.430> atmosphere

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
sea of air molecules so this atmosphere

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.920 
sea of air molecules so this atmosphere
creates<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.350> pressure<00:01:07.740> which<00:01:08.549> will<00:01:08.820> exert<00:01:09.630> a

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
creates a pressure which will exert a

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.920 
creates a pressure which will exert a
pressure<00:01:10.170> onto<00:01:11.159> our<00:01:11.430> liquid<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.659> will

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
pressure onto our liquid and this will

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.679 
pressure onto our liquid and this will
in<00:01:13.170> turn<00:01:13.470> create<00:01:13.740> an<00:01:14.400> additional<00:01:14.729> pressure<00:01:15.360> at

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
in turn create an additional pressure at

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.440 
in turn create an additional pressure at
this<00:01:15.990> point<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.640> actually<00:01:18.090> find

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
this point and so and to actually find

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.899 
this point and so and to actually find
the<00:01:18.869> pressure<00:01:19.740> at<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.130> bottom<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> lake

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
the pressure at the bottom of the lake

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.390 
the pressure at the bottom of the lake
we<00:01:21.509> have<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.930> sum<00:01:22.290> up<00:01:22.560> our<00:01:22.740> atmosphere

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
we have to sum up our atmosphere

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.020 
we have to sum up our atmosphere
pressure<00:01:24.299> as<00:01:24.780> well<00:01:25.409> as<00:01:25.710> our<00:01:26.070> pressure<00:01:26.520> due<00:01:27.000> to

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
pressure as well as our pressure due to

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.020 
pressure as well as our pressure due to
the<00:01:27.330> volume<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.990> liquid<00:01:28.189> found<00:01:29.189> above<00:01:29.640> that

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
the volume of liquid found above that

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.260 
the volume of liquid found above that
point<00:01:30.229> now<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.680> principle<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.700> known<00:01:33.000> as

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
point now this principle is known as

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.859 
point now this principle is known as
Pascal's<00:01:33.810> principle<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.880> scout's<00:01:36.210> principle

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
Pascal's principle the scout's principle

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.010 
Pascal's principle the scout's principle
states<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.439> if<00:01:38.189> an<00:01:38.400> external<00:01:39.210> pressure<00:01:39.479> in

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
states that if an external pressure in

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.530 
states that if an external pressure in
this<00:01:40.259> case<00:01:40.590> our<00:01:40.829> atmospheric<00:01:41.790> pressure<00:01:42.150> is

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
this case our atmospheric pressure is

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.620 
this case our atmospheric pressure is
applied<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.710> our<00:01:43.740> confined<00:01:44.460> fluid<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.329> this

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
applied to our confined fluid in this

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.740 
applied to our confined fluid in this
case<00:01:45.990> our<00:01:46.259> lake<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.430> pressure<00:01:47.850> at<00:01:48.270> every

case our lake the pressure at every
point<00:01:49.020> within<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.979> fluid<00:01:50.579> within<00:01:51.149> our<00:01:51.540> lake

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
point within that fluid within our lake

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.660 
point within that fluid within our lake
increases<00:01:53.220> by<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:54.060> external<00:01:54.840> amount<00:01:55.710> now<00:01:56.640> a

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
increases by that external amount now a

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.959 
increases by that external amount now a
very<00:01:57.270> common<00:01:57.899> device<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.920> utilizes<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
very common device that utilizes the

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.200 
very common device that utilizes the
scout's<00:02:00.270> principle<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:02.219> hydraulic<00:02:02.969> lift

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
scout's principle is the hydraulic lift

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.590 
scout's principle is the hydraulic lift
so<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.810> hydraulic<00:02:04.350> length

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
so the hydraulic length

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.639 
so the hydraulic length
the<00:02:05.960> Wisconsin<00:02:06.530> suppose<00:02:07.100> by<00:02:07.610> turning<00:02:08.360> a<00:02:08.539> small

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
the Wisconsin suppose by turning a small

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.910 
the Wisconsin suppose by turning a small
input<00:02:09.649> force<00:02:10.009> into<00:02:10.610> a<00:02:10.640> large<00:02:10.970> output<00:02:11.420> force<00:02:12.110> by

increase<00:02:13.610> in<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.090> area<00:02:14.300> so<00:02:15.260> this<00:02:15.740> is<00:02:15.950> one

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
increase in the area so this is one

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.900 
increase in the area so this is one
example<00:02:16.430> of<00:02:17.030> a<00:02:17.390> hydraulic<00:02:17.900> lift<00:02:18.350> so<00:02:19.160> this<00:02:19.700> is

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
example of a hydraulic lift so this is

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
our input this is our output so we apply

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.290 
our input this is our output so we apply
a<00:02:24.110> pressure<00:02:24.530> p1<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:26.060> this<00:02:26.360> area<00:02:26.750> anyone<00:02:27.709> and

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
a pressure p1 to this area anyone and

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.199 
a pressure p1 to this area anyone and
because<00:02:29.300> this<00:02:29.810> inside<00:02:30.500> section<00:02:30.950> is<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.430> fluid

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
because this inside section is a fluid

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.500 
because this inside section is a fluid
the<00:02:32.750> pressure<00:02:33.160> will<00:02:34.160> remain<00:02:34.640> undiminished

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
the pressure will remain undiminished

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.770 
the pressure will remain undiminished
and<00:02:36.080> go<00:02:36.380> through<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:36.860> entire<00:02:37.220> fluid<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.180> so

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
and go through the entire fluid and so

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.530 
and go through the entire fluid and so
the<00:02:38.989> pressure<00:02:39.320> that<00:02:39.739> this<00:02:40.100> area<00:02:40.670> feels<00:02:41.000> is<00:02:41.420> the

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
the pressure that this area feels is the

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.920 
the pressure that this area feels is the
same<00:02:41.780> pressure<00:02:42.140> that<00:02:42.530> this<00:02:42.770> area<00:02:43.220> feels<00:02:43.489> so<00:02:44.239> p1

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
same pressure that this area feels so p1

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.890 
same pressure that this area feels so p1
the<00:02:45.200> pressure<00:02:45.500> here<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.310> equal<00:02:46.940> to<00:02:47.120> p2<00:02:47.390> the

the pressure here is equal to p2 the

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.830 
forces if we increase the area of this

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
piston that means we also have to

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.530 
piston that means we also have to
increase<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.530> force<00:03:21.950> that<00:03:22.700> this<00:03:23.000> piston

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
increase the force that this piston

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.380 
increase the force that this piston
feels<00:03:23.870> by<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.680> same<00:03:25.280> proportional<00:03:26.150> mouth

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
feels by the same proportional mouth

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.009 
feels by the same proportional mouth
because<00:03:27.010> p1<00:03:28.010> is<00:03:28.160> equal<00:03:28.190> to<00:03:28.519> p2<00:03:28.910> and<00:03:29.450> that<00:03:29.660> means

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
because p1 is equal to p2 and that means

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.100 
because p1 is equal to p2 and that means
the<00:03:30.620> ratio<00:03:30.860> of<00:03:31.220> force<00:03:31.640> want<00:03:32.090> to<00:03:32.269> area<00:03:32.690> 1<00:03:32.750> is

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
the ratio of force want to area 1 is

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.680 
the ratio of force want to area 1 is
equal<00:03:33.410> to<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.650> ratio<00:03:33.829> of<00:03:34.160> force<00:03:34.579> 2<00:03:34.880> divided<00:03:35.660> by

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
equal to the ratio of force 2 divided by

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.250 
equal to the ratio of force 2 divided by
area<00:03:35.989> 2<00:03:36.440> so<00:03:37.100> as<00:03:37.340> long<00:03:37.579> as<00:03:37.850> these<00:03:38.090> two<00:03:38.150> quantum<00:03:39.140> a

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
area 2 so as long as these two quantum a

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.039 
area 2 so as long as these two quantum a
constant<00:03:40.010> and<00:03:40.160> we<00:03:40.670> increase<00:03:41.090> a<00:03:41.329> 1

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
constant and we increase a 1

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.220 
constant and we increase a 1
well<00:03:42.410> then<00:03:42.650> f2<00:03:43.010> has<00:03:43.940> to<00:03:44.269> increase<00:03:44.660> find<00:03:45.079> that

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
well then f2 has to increase find that

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.710 
well then f2 has to increase find that
same<00:03:45.500> amount<00:03:45.829> so<00:03:46.130> if<00:03:46.280> we<00:03:46.430> increase<00:03:46.549> a<00:03:46.880> 2<00:03:47.030> f2

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
same amount so if we increase a 2 f2

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.830 
same amount so if we increase a 2 f2
also<00:03:48.620> has<00:03:48.799> to<00:03:49.010> increase<00:03:49.250> by<00:03:49.850> that<00:03:50.120> same<00:03:50.510> amount

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
also has to increase by that same amount

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.979 
also has to increase by that same amount
now<00:03:51.530> we<00:03:51.590> can<00:03:52.010> rearrange<00:03:52.310> this<00:03:52.820> equation<00:03:53.329> and

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
now we can rearrange this equation and

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.860 
now we can rearrange this equation and
we<00:03:54.290> get<00:03:54.530> the<00:03:54.680> following<00:03:54.890> result<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:56.209> output

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
we get the following result the output

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.860 
we get the following result the output

is<00:04:33.600> 0.1<00:04:34.600> meter<00:04:34.960> squared<00:04:35.440> so<00:04:35.740> we<00:04:36.400> essentially

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
is 0.1 meter squared so we essentially

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.330

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
output force so we bring f1 to the right

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.480 
output force so we bring f1 to the right
side<00:04:46.300> and<00:04:46.630> we<00:04:46.810> have<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:47.500> input<00:04:48.130> force

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
side and we have the input force

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.240 
side and we have the input force
multiplied<00:04:49.479> them<00:04:49.750> by<00:04:49.960> the<00:04:50.229> ratio<00:04:50.650> of<00:04:51.070> the

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
multiplied them by the ratio of the

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.469 
multiplied them by the ratio of the
areas<00:04:51.970> so<00:04:52.660> we<00:04:52.810> plug<00:04:53.080> in<00:04:53.289> our<00:04:53.410> quantities<00:04:54.479> 20

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
areas so we plug in our quantities 20

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:56.159 
areas so we plug in our quantities 20
Newtons

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
Newtons

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.279 
Newtons
this<00:04:56.530> becomes<00:04:57.010> 0.1<00:04:57.940> and<00:04:58.210> this<00:04:58.630> becomes<00:04:59.080> your

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
this becomes 0.1 and this becomes your

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.219 
this becomes 0.1 and this becomes your
point<00:04:59.650> zero<00:05:00.039> one<00:05:00.250> so<00:05:00.760> this<00:05:01.030> ratio<00:05:01.330> becomes<00:05:01.810> a

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
point zero one so this ratio becomes a

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.480 
point zero one so this ratio becomes a
10<00:05:02.500> 10<00:05:03.130> times<00:05:03.370> 20<00:05:03.880> gives<00:05:04.120> us<00:05:04.570> 200<00:05:05.320> Newtons<00:05:05.800> so

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
10 10 times 20 gives us 200 Newtons so

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.900 
10 10 times 20 gives us 200 Newtons so
we<00:05:06.639> see<00:05:06.970> that<00:05:07.360> because<00:05:08.260> the<00:05:08.919> area<00:05:09.520> of<00:05:09.729> the

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
we see that because the area of the

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.779 
we see that because the area of the
output<00:05:10.120> piston<00:05:11.050> increased<00:05:11.590> by<00:05:11.860> a<00:05:11.889> quantity<00:05:12.669> of

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
output piston increased by a quantity of

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.080 
output piston increased by a quantity of
10<00:05:13.090> by<00:05:13.780> a<00:05:13.810> proportion<00:05:14.470> of<00:05:14.590> 10<00:05:14.889> that<00:05:15.580> means<00:05:15.610> the

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
10 by a proportion of 10 that means the

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.960 
10 by a proportion of 10 that means the
output<00:05:16.120> force<00:05:16.930> also<00:05:17.289> has<00:05:17.620> to<00:05:18.010> increase<00:05:18.280> by

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
output force also has to increase by

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.240 
output force also has to increase by
that<00:05:19.330> same<00:05:19.660> proportional<00:05:20.470> amounts<00:05:20.889> or<00:05:21.039> goes

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
that same proportional amounts or goes

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.990 
that same proportional amounts or goes
from<00:05:21.580> 20<00:05:22.150> to<00:05:22.389> 200
