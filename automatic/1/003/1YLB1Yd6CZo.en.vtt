their rules better some of the stuff is
hard<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.610> control<00:01:11.909> which<00:01:12.360> actually<00:01:13.020> helps

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
hard to control which actually helps

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.920 
hard to control which actually helps

right<00:01:47.880> my<00:01:48.240> only<00:01:48.360> issue<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.869> outside<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.409> a

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
right my only issue is that outside of a

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.899 
right my only issue is that outside of a
headshot<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.979> takes<00:01:50.189> two<00:01:50.369> shots<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.729> get<00:01:50.880> a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
headshot it takes two shots to get a

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.990 
headshot it takes two shots to get a
feel<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.329> could<00:01:51.479> be<00:01:51.509> pretty<00:01:51.689> difficult

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
feel and that could be pretty difficult

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.340 
feel and that could be pretty difficult
talking<00:01:54.000> about<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.450> first<00:01:54.659> few<00:01:54.810> bolt-action

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
talking about the first few bolt-action

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.350 
talking about the first few bolt-action
sniper<00:01:55.770> rifles<00:01:56.460> though<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.850> haven't<00:01:57.090> unlocked

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
sniper rifles though I haven't unlocked

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.480 
sniper rifles though I haven't unlocked
everything<00:01:57.689> yet<00:01:58.200> obviously<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:59.009> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
everything yet obviously and the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.280 
everything yet obviously and the
semi-auto<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.270> tried<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.600> wouldn't<00:02:01.020> expect

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
semi-auto that I tried I wouldn't expect

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.790 
semi-auto that I tried I wouldn't expect
to<00:02:01.409> be<00:02:01.560> a

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
to be a

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.680 
to be a
shot<00:02:02.010> but<00:02:02.550> the<00:02:02.670> bolt<00:02:02.850> action<00:02:03.090> sniper<00:02:03.180> rifles

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
shot but the bolt action sniper rifles

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.560 
shot but the bolt action sniper rifles
are<00:02:03.870> quite<00:02:04.560> effective<00:02:05.010> enough<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.970> automatic

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
are quite effective enough the automatic

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.570 
are quite effective enough the automatic
secondary<00:02:07.200> pistol<00:02:07.620> is<00:02:07.770> great<00:02:08.010> the<00:02:08.250> proximity

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
secondary pistol is great the proximity

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.000 
secondary pistol is great the proximity
mines<00:02:08.910> are<00:02:09.119> cool<00:02:09.270> but<00:02:09.630> I<00:02:09.810> just<00:02:10.080> feel<00:02:10.260> like<00:02:10.350> the

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
mines are cool but I just feel like the

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.530 
mines are cool but I just feel like the
sniper<00:02:11.310> rifles<00:02:11.730> themselves<00:02:12.120> aren't<00:02:12.300> quite

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
sniper rifles themselves aren't quite

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.050 
sniper rifles themselves aren't quite
powerful<00:02:12.960> enough<00:02:13.190> each<00:02:14.190> class<00:02:14.460> is<00:02:14.490> a<00:02:14.700> special

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
powerful enough each class is a special

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.090 
powerful enough each class is a special
ability<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.600> some<00:02:15.840> kind<00:02:16.020> that's<00:02:16.590> also<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:16.950> nice

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
ability of some kind that's also a nice

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.620 
ability of some kind that's also a nice
touch<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.550> helps<00:02:17.730> define<00:02:17.970> their<00:02:18.180> role<00:02:18.330> as<00:02:18.480> well

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
touch it helps define their role as well

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.540 
touch it helps define their role as well
the<00:02:19.290> signal<00:02:19.680> scan<00:02:19.920> allows<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.430> see

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
the signal scan allows you to see

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.590 
the signal scan allows you to see
enemies<00:02:20.730> through<00:02:21.030> walls<00:02:21.210> and<00:02:21.420> that's

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
enemies through walls and that's

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.780 
enemies through walls and that's
surprisingly<00:02:22.080> not<00:02:22.350> overpowered<00:02:22.890> it's<00:02:23.490> quite

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
surprisingly not overpowered it's quite

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.340 
surprisingly not overpowered it's quite
loud<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.150> can<00:02:24.270> hear<00:02:24.420> 01<00:02:24.780> it's<00:02:24.930> all<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.260> way

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
loud you can hear 01 it's all the way

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.510 
loud you can hear 01 it's all the way
across<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.830> have<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.040> know<00:02:26.160> if<00:02:26.220> somebody's

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
across and have you know if somebody's

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.250 
across and have you know if somebody's
using<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:27.000> how<00:02:27.450> should<00:02:27.630> be<00:02:27.780> aware<00:02:27.990> of<00:02:28.050> them

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
using it how should be aware of them

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.620 
using it how should be aware of them
coming<00:02:28.590> whereas<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.370> ballistic<00:02:29.730> armor<00:02:29.940> feels

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
coming whereas the ballistic armor feels

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.970 
coming whereas the ballistic armor feels
like<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.930> absorbs<00:02:31.260> just<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.530> little<00:02:31.770> bit<00:02:31.860> too

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
like it absorbs just a little bit too

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.530 
like it absorbs just a little bit too
much<00:02:32.070> damage<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.640> explosives<00:02:33.300> are<00:02:33.390> really

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
much damage and explosives are really

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.000 
much damage and explosives are really
powerful<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.350> grenade<00:02:34.560> launcher<00:02:34.920> that

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
powerful so the grenade launcher that

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.370 
powerful so the grenade launcher that
the<00:02:35.130> assaulter<00:02:35.490> gets<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.270> little<00:02:37.140> bit<00:02:37.290> too

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
the assaulter gets is a little bit too

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.470 
the assaulter gets is a little bit too
powerful<00:02:37.830> as<00:02:37.920> well<00:02:38.100> but<00:02:38.700> like<00:02:38.850> I<00:02:38.940> said<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.270> also

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
powerful as well but like I said it also

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.120 
powerful as well but like I said it also
helps<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.720> find<00:02:39.990> your<00:02:40.140> class<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.560> can<00:02:40.920> pretty

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
helps to find your class so I can pretty

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.850 
helps to find your class so I can pretty
much<00:02:41.250> look<00:02:41.520> past<00:02:41.760> all<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.410> all<00:02:43.410> in<00:02:43.620> all<00:02:43.740> it's

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
much look past all of it all in all it's

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.860 
much look past all of it all in all it's
a<00:02:43.920> really<00:02:44.100> fun<00:02:44.160> game<00:02:44.340> it<00:02:45.120> isn't<00:02:45.420> perfect<00:02:45.570> and

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
a really fun game it isn't perfect and

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.840 
a really fun game it isn't perfect and
