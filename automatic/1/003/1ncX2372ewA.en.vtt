00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.100
 and continuing with the look of the braids 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.890
 today we are going to learn to make some 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.660
 super mexican braids but very fashion 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.890
 very original for now for the 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.780
 Mexican parties to be 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.670
 different and so good for that is 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.330
 Adalicia to explain us to do it 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.470
 very well we have already started with remember 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.660
 the tradition that we learned to do 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.750
 before 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.730
 the same nothing but down we're going 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.040
 to think down we're going to help 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.350
 and we have it ready if it does not reach 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.690
 complicate do not worry then nothing 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.770
 more we put the hair together and pull it 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.050
 what because this is going to help us 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.010
 finish what we are going to do afterwards 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.840
 worry do not have to do 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.340
 necessarily a braid this side but 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.550
 it's simpler because that's how we hit once 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.340
 initiated to the hair after what 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.280
 we have to do 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.210
 and divide in half 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.809
 the hair what would be forward and 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.809
 backwards 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.220
 average head back 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.820
 do 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.350
 we take this part what would be 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.910
 crazy and we will not work with 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.150
 all this pavilion just to see 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.830
 how are we going to go driving and we are going to 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.650
 do exactly the same braid that 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.380
 we did last time but we're going to 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.780
 hang on the shore then instead of 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.960
 twist sideways we check towards the 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.960
 front 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.350
 we divide enlarge our breast 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.010
 initial we 're always going to grab a 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.010
 initial lock 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.650
 we divide 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.020
 3 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:51.270
 and we trace 1 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.810
 we can all think two laps there 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.610
 is 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:01.299
 and from here we are going to take the 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.340
 end that is outside this side 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:06.460
 pegadito 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.990
 and we grab a little hair 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:15.130
 we braided 12 as we did the time 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:18.270
 last and we grabbed a little hair 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.270
 what down 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.190
 everyone 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:27.580
 and just grabbed a little more 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.580
 hair 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.580
 this will obviously help us to 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.910
 I'm hanging the braid orita I'm going to 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.470
 teach for what 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.470
 raising this crazy 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:47.910
 it's very easy is nothing else to go this 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:50.420
 increasing the thickness of the lock always 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.420
 outside 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.460
 we are increasing it and it is very father 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.319
 because it gives you the illusion that the 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:02.599
 hair finish in braid 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.599
 and it does not end up loose and at the same time 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.140
 and so he wants to go out partying which is 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.370
 to go bouncing 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.640
 20 thousand things 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.780
 they realize 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.150
 how is it going 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.130
 more or less since we have a height 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.130
 from the chin our braided hair 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.720
 so 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.670
 we finished making a 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.220
 last transits without grasping the 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.230
 hair 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.230
 precisely so that it does not come out 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.519
 since we have this 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.519
 let's take advantage 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.260
 and we're going to grab it 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.450
 just with the parasite that we had 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.430
 previous 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.430
 we pass it below the neck 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.610
 / 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.360
 we have the queue here 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.020
 of the other 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.540
 and we grabbed another list I'm a big fan of 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.290
 the visits as the lists we can with 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.959
 a few droplets we can comb the 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.730
 and do amazing things without the 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.730
 experience without need t 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.460
 have as kilos spray 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.480
 and ready 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.790
 how are you super fashion and fast 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.040
 very original this cross is the word 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.400
 very original action because also for 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.400
 these dates 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.070
 so they look different very different 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:46.969
 mexican
