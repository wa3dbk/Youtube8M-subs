00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
now on this bass amplifier there were

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.149 
now on this bass amplifier there were
two<00:01:39.360> inputs<00:01:39.829> active<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.150> passive<00:01:42.920> you<00:01:43.920> can

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
two inputs active and passive you can

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.090 
two inputs active and passive you can
use<00:01:44.340> either<00:01:44.549> one<00:01:44.939> but<00:01:45.750> myself<00:01:45.990> I've<00:01:46.799> always

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
use either one but myself I've always

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.429 
use either one but myself I've always
used<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.729> passive<00:01:48.180> one<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.570> haven't<00:01:49.049> had<00:01:49.200> any

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
used the passive one and haven't had any

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.380 
used the passive one and haven't had any
trouble<00:01:51.680> this<00:01:52.680> will<00:01:52.920> take<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.310> signal<00:01:53.759> from

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
trouble this will take the signal from

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.889 
trouble this will take the signal from
the<00:01:54.600> DI<00:01:54.810> box<00:01:55.280> into<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.310> bass<00:01:56.610> amplifier<00:01:57.329> so

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
the DI box into the bass amplifier so

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.590 
the DI box into the bass amplifier so
that<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.200> bass<00:01:58.380> player<00:01:58.710> can<00:01:58.979> hear<00:01:59.280> himself

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
that the bass player can hear himself

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.429 
that the bass player can hear himself
the<00:02:00.600> last<00:02:00.840> thing<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.320> do<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:02.430> take<00:02:03.439> the

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
the last thing you do is you take the

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.160 
the last thing you do is you take the
female<00:02:04.950> end<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.490> your<00:02:05.909> microphone<00:02:06.509> cable<00:02:06.990> and

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
female end of your microphone cable and

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.000 
female end of your microphone cable and
you<00:02:07.950> connect<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.610> your<00:02:09.599> di<00:02:09.959> box

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
you connect it to your di box

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.429 
you connect it to your di box
then<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.159> take<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.579> male<00:02:13.849> end<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:14.510> plug<00:02:15.290> it

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:15.439 
then you take the male end and plug it

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.130 
then you take the male end and plug it
into<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.739> mic<00:02:16.040> point<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.579> now<00:02:17.329> your<00:02:17.900> bass

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
into a mic point and now your bass

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.760 
into a mic point and now your bass
guitar<00:02:18.620> is<00:02:18.860> connected
