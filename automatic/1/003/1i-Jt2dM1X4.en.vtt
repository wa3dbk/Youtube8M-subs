00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
actually two Phillips head screws you

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.390 
actually two Phillips head screws you
can<00:00:23.839> see<00:00:24.170> where<00:00:24.380> they<00:00:24.500> mount<00:00:24.740> to<00:00:24.949> right<00:00:25.189> here

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
can see where they mount to right here

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.179 
can see where they mount to right here
in<00:00:25.519> this<00:00:25.669> with<00:00:26.359> the<00:00:26.449> cover<00:00:26.630> off<00:00:26.980> take<00:00:27.980> them

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
in this with the cover off take them

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.529 
in this with the cover off take them
loose<00:00:28.429> you<00:00:28.699> have<00:00:28.789> to<00:00:28.880> pull<00:00:29.060> the<00:00:29.150> cover<00:00:29.300> out<00:00:29.390> a

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
loose you have to pull the cover out a

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.170 
loose you have to pull the cover out a
little<00:00:29.720> bit<00:00:30.099> so<00:00:31.099> you<00:00:31.189> can<00:00:31.310> clear<00:00:31.579> this<00:00:31.910> clip

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
little bit so you can clear this clip

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.310 
little bit so you can clear this clip
and<00:00:32.750> you<00:00:33.290> just<00:00:33.410> tap<00:00:33.650> up<00:00:33.860> on<00:00:34.040> it<00:00:34.220> with<00:00:35.320> rubber

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
and you just tap up on it with rubber

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.860 
and you just tap up on it with rubber
mallet<00:00:36.860> until<00:00:37.160> it<00:00:37.310> pops<00:00:37.580> off<00:00:37.850> and<00:00:38.180> you<00:00:38.600> can<00:00:38.720> do

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
mallet until it pops off and you can do

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.390 
mallet until it pops off and you can do
it<00:00:38.960> with<00:00:39.050> the<00:00:39.140> door<00:00:39.350> closed<00:00:39.710> that's<00:00:40.070> the<00:00:40.190> best

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
it with the door closed that's the best

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.580 
it with the door closed that's the best
way<00:00:40.610> then<00:00:40.970> it'll<00:00:41.420> clear<00:00:41.690> everything<00:00:42.290> and<00:00:42.440> come

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
way then it'll clear everything and come

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.970 
way then it'll clear everything and come
right<00:00:42.770> off

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
right off

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.190 
right off
okay<00:00:43.850> once<00:00:44.060> you<00:00:44.120> get<00:00:44.240> that<00:00:44.360> popped<00:00:44.630> off<00:00:44.870> and

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
okay once you get that popped off and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.490 
okay once you get that popped off and
look<00:00:45.950> at<00:00:46.040> your<00:00:46.220> mechanism<00:00:46.870> you<00:00:47.870> can<00:00:48.050> see<00:00:48.260> these

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
look at your mechanism you can see these

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.960 
look at your mechanism you can see these
this<00:00:48.770> one<00:00:48.920> hasn't<00:00:49.190> been<00:00:49.370> messed<00:00:49.610> with<00:00:49.700> in<00:00:49.880> a

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
this one hasn't been messed with in a

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:50.470 
this one hasn't been messed with in a
while

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
while

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.010 
while
this<00:00:50.930> is<00:00:51.110> one<00:00:51.380> of<00:00:51.470> the<00:00:51.560> tracks<00:00:51.830> that<00:00:52.840> this<00:00:53.840> one

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
this is one of the tracks that this one

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.800 
this is one of the tracks that this one
roller<00:00:54.320> rides<00:00:54.740> on<00:00:55.040> and<00:00:55.340> this<00:00:55.790> roller<00:00:56.060> fails<00:00:56.540> a

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
roller rides on and this roller fails a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.330 
roller rides on and this roller fails a
lot<00:00:56.960> of<00:00:57.020> time<00:00:57.140> because<00:00:57.320> this<00:00:57.620> track<00:00:57.920> is<00:00:58.100> so

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
lot of time because this track is so

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.410 
lot of time because this track is so
rusty<00:00:58.640> um<00:00:59.600> that<00:01:00.530> and<00:01:01.250> non-lubricated<00:01:01.820> it'll

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
rusty um that and non-lubricated it'll

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.520 
rusty um that and non-lubricated it'll
just<00:01:02.570> cut<00:01:02.810> the<00:01:03.020> roller<00:01:03.770> in<00:01:03.980> half<00:01:04.159> over<00:01:04.549> time<00:01:04.790> so

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
just cut the roller in half over time so

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.370 
just cut the roller in half over time so
you<00:01:06.530> want<00:01:06.800> to<00:01:07.990> basically<00:01:08.990> we're<00:01:09.080> going<00:01:09.200> to<00:01:09.260> do

track all the rust off of it then we're

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.350 
track all the rust off of it then we're
going<00:01:15.140> to<00:01:15.200> Lube<00:01:15.410> it<00:01:15.560> down<00:01:15.820> with<00:01:16.820> some<00:01:17.090> white

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
quiet as I would like it but the reason

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.890 
quiet as I would like it but the reason
is<00:03:55.870> because<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:57.250> bearings<00:03:57.730> have<00:03:58.090> got<00:03:58.690> some

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
is because the bearings have got some

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.170 
is because the bearings have got some
wear<00:03:59.109> tone<00:03:59.700> but

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
wear tone but

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.070 
wear tone but
it's<00:04:03.180> definitely<00:04:03.390> quieter<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:04.769> way<00:04:04.980> smoother

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
it's definitely quieter the way smoother

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.750 
it's definitely quieter the way smoother
we<00:04:07.080> also<00:04:07.409> cleaned<00:04:07.680> up<00:04:07.830> down<00:04:08.010> here<00:04:08.459> and

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
we also cleaned up down here and

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.729 
we also cleaned up down here and
lubricated<00:04:09.659> this<00:04:09.810> old<00:04:09.989> tracks<00:04:10.260> you<00:04:10.500> can<00:04:10.530> see

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
that's nice and clean now and we

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.550 
that's nice and clean now and we
lubricated<00:04:14.069> the<00:04:15.109> bushings<00:04:16.109> out<00:04:16.260> here<00:04:16.440> at<00:04:16.500> the

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
lubricated the bushings out here at the

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.550 
lubricated the bushings out here at the
bottom<00:04:16.889> I<00:04:17.479> mean<00:04:18.479> it<00:04:18.690> doesn't<00:04:18.870> take<00:04:19.019> pretty

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
bottom I mean it doesn't take pretty

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:26.180 
bottom I mean it doesn't take pretty
much<00:04:19.790> any<00:04:20.790> effort<00:04:21.299> to<00:04:21.660> slide<00:04:22.199> it<00:04:22.350> open<00:04:25.190> or

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
much any effort to slide it open or

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.450 
much any effort to slide it open or
closed<00:04:27.380> definitely<00:04:28.380> working<00:04:28.620> nicer<00:04:28.949> now<00:04:29.160> and

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
closed definitely working nicer now and
