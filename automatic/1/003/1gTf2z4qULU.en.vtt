00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
I spaced it off for the back because I

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.770 
I spaced it off for the back because I
realized<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.890> there's<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.129> lot<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.489> hair<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.750> I

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
realized that there's a lot of hair so I

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.530
