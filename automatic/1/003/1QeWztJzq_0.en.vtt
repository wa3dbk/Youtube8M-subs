but I've never all my channel had every

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.810 
but I've never all my channel had every
position<00:04:21.750> so<00:04:22.590> who<00:04:22.710> knows<00:04:22.949> I<00:04:23.159> might<00:04:23.310> make<00:04:23.490> a<00:04:23.520> big

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
position so who knows I might make a big

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.670 
position so who knows I might make a big
man<00:04:24.030> you<00:04:24.300> know<00:04:25.169> what<00:04:25.349> would<00:04:25.440> you<00:04:25.470> guys<00:04:25.620> think

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.269 
man you know what would you guys think
about<00:04:25.919> that

00:04:26.269 --> 00:04:26.279 
about that

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:28.589 
about that
I<00:04:26.490> made<00:04:26.669> a<00:04:26.700> center<00:04:27.120> or<00:04:27.150> power<00:04:27.479> forward

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599 
I made a center or power forward

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:30.029 
I made a center or power forward
like<00:04:28.960> how<00:04:29.110> would<00:04:29.259> you<00:04:29.319> guys<00:04:29.409> personally<00:04:29.830> feel

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
like how would you guys personally feel

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:32.519 
like how would you guys personally feel
about<00:04:30.279> that<00:04:30.899> because<00:04:31.899> I<00:04:31.990> think<00:04:32.050> it<00:04:32.349> would<00:04:32.439> be

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:32.529 
about that because I think it would be

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:34.230 
about that because I think it would be
interesting<00:04:32.770> it'll<00:04:33.129> be<00:04:33.219> a<00:04:33.249> real<00:04:33.699> change<00:04:34.029> of

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
interesting it'll be a real change of

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.629 
interesting it'll be a real change of
pace<00:04:34.649> also<00:04:35.649> I<00:04:35.679> like<00:04:35.889> being<00:04:36.159> point<00:04:36.399> guard

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
pace also I like being point guard

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.279 
pace also I like being point guard
because<00:04:36.819> I<00:04:36.969> like<00:04:37.179> controlling<00:04:37.599> the<00:04:37.809> floor<00:04:38.080> and

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
because I like controlling the floor and

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:43.290 
because I like controlling the floor and
look<00:04:38.409> at<00:04:38.529> that<00:04:38.619> 360<00:04:39.219> and<00:04:41.069> so<00:04:42.069> I'm<00:04:42.219> not<00:04:42.369> sure<00:04:42.429> you

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
look at that 360 and so I'm not sure you

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.359 
look at that 360 and so I'm not sure you
know<00:04:43.419> what<00:04:43.599> would<00:04:43.719> you<00:04:43.749> guys<00:04:43.929> like<00:04:43.990> to<00:04:44.319> see

00:04:44.359 --> 00:04:44.369 
know what would you guys like to see

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:47.309 
know what would you guys like to see
would<00:04:45.369> you<00:04:45.399> guys<00:04:45.610> be<00:04:46.419> less<00:04:46.689> likely<00:04:46.929> to<00:04:47.050> watch

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:47.319 
would you guys be less likely to watch

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:50.040 
would you guys be less likely to watch
if<00:04:47.619> I<00:04:47.770> had<00:04:47.919> a<00:04:47.949> sinner<00:04:48.629> would<00:04:49.629> you<00:04:49.719> be<00:04:49.839> more

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
if I had a sinner would you be more

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.850 
if I had a sinner would you be more
inclined<00:04:50.379> to<00:04:50.740> watch<00:04:51.099> as<00:04:51.279> a<00:04:51.309> point<00:04:51.669> guard

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
inclined to watch as a point guard

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.959 
inclined to watch as a point guard
pretty<00:04:53.860> sure<00:04:54.009> I'm<00:04:54.129> not<00:04:54.279> gonna<00:04:54.429> do<00:04:54.610> scoring

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:54.969 
pretty sure I'm not gonna do scoring

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:57.889 
pretty sure I'm not gonna do scoring
again<00:04:55.300> I<00:04:55.509> didn't<00:04:55.719> like<00:04:55.839> scoring<00:04:56.259> that<00:04:56.740> much

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:57.899 
again I didn't like scoring that much

00:04:57.899 --> 00:05:00.149 
again I didn't like scoring that much
because<00:04:58.899> with<00:04:59.080> the<00:04:59.169> scoring<00:04:59.469> position<00:04:59.919> your

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:00.159 
because with the scoring position your

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:02.189 
because with the scoring position your
past<00:05:00.399> is<00:05:00.580> only<00:05:00.729> 75<00:05:01.300> and<00:05:01.599> I<00:05:01.689> didn't<00:05:01.869> really<00:05:02.050> like

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:02.199 
past is only 75 and I didn't really like

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.799 
past is only 75 and I didn't really like
that<00:05:02.229> it<00:05:02.499> caused<00:05:02.649> me<00:05:02.800> a<00:05:02.860> lot<00:05:03.069> of<00:05:03.099> turnovers<00:05:03.809> as

00:05:04.799 --> 00:05:04.809 
that it caused me a lot of turnovers as

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:06.889 
that it caused me a lot of turnovers as
you<00:05:04.959> can<00:05:05.110> see<00:05:05.229> that<00:05:05.559> 7<00:05:05.979> to<00:05:06.069> 12<00:05:06.430> right<00:05:06.639> now

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:06.899
