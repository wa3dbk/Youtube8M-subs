00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.370 
complaint on this whole setup aside from
the<00:03:28.030> boot<00:03:28.180> disc<00:03:28.420> which<00:03:28.600> is<00:03:28.750> you<00:03:28.930> know<00:03:29.020> no<00:03:29.230> way

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
the boot disc which is you know no way

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.280 
the boot disc which is you know no way
around<00:03:29.500> it<00:03:29.830> but<00:03:30.040> kind<00:03:30.790> of<00:03:30.910> sucks<00:03:31.210> because<00:03:32.080> it

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
around it but kind of sucks because it

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.190 
around it but kind of sucks because it
makes<00:03:32.470> finding<00:03:33.310> it<00:03:35.370> but<00:03:36.370> difficult<00:03:36.930> is<00:03:37.930> the

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
makes finding it but difficult is the

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.070 
makes finding it but difficult is the
fact<00:03:38.440> that<00:03:38.560> you<00:03:38.740> have<00:03:38.920> to<00:03:39.690> play<00:03:40.690> on<00:03:40.930> one<00:03:41.050> of

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
fact that you have to play on one of

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.860 
fact that you have to play on one of
these<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.910> GameCube<00:03:43.330> controller

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
these the GameCube controller

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.370 
these the GameCube controller
well<00:03:44.770> not<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.400> worst<00:03:45.580> controller<00:03:45.970> out<00:03:46.150> there

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
well not the worst controller out there

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.550 
well not the worst controller out there
certainly<00:03:47.380> is<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.770> my<00:03:47.890> favorite<00:03:48.160> and<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:50.290> play

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
certainly is it my favorite and to play

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.140 
certainly is it my favorite and to play
gameboy<00:03:51.250> games<00:03:51.550> you're<00:03:51.760> going<00:03:51.790> to<00:03:51.940> be<00:03:52.000> using

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
gameboy games you're going to be using

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.240 
gameboy games you're going to be using
the<00:03:52.420> d-pad<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:52.930> can<00:03:53.140> use<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:54.040> left

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
the d-pad you can use the left

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.530 
the d-pad you can use the left
thumbstick<00:03:54.520> but<00:03:54.970> I<00:03:55.000> find<00:03:55.270> it<00:03:55.360> a<00:03:55.390> little

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
thumbstick but I find it a little

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.280 
thumbstick but I find it a little
awkward<00:03:56.070> and<00:03:57.070> so<00:03:57.850> you<00:03:57.970> use<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.270> d-pad<00:03:58.600> to<00:03:58.930> a

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
awkward and so you use the d-pad to a

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.100 
awkward and so you use the d-pad to a
and<00:03:59.440> B<00:03:59.500> and<00:04:01.650> yeah<00:04:02.680> it's<00:04:03.130> just<00:04:03.280> a<00:04:03.370> very

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
and B and yeah it's just a very

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.680 
and B and yeah it's just a very
uncomfortable<00:04:05.110> unfamiliar<00:04:05.740> setup<00:04:06.480> I'm<00:04:07.480> sure

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
uncomfortable unfamiliar setup I'm sure

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.070 
uncomfortable unfamiliar setup I'm sure
over<00:04:07.840> time<00:04:07.960> you<00:04:08.350> get<00:04:08.470> used<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:08.770> it<00:04:09.240> but

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
over time you get used to it but

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.440 
over time you get used to it but
but<00:04:11.860> for<00:04:12.010> me<00:04:12.100> it's<00:04:12.280> a<00:04:12.340> little<00:04:12.430> awkward

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.680 

and<00:04:15.690> there<00:04:16.260> you<00:04:16.380> have<00:04:16.410> it<00:04:16.590> a<00:04:17.389> really<00:04:18.389> cool

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
and there you have it a really cool

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.740 
and there you have it a really cool
