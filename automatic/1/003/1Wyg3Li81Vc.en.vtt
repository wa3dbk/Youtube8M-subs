00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.510
 hello everyone now let's make a 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.910
 demonstration of how the 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.039
 multitasking on the samsung galaxy notebook 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.720
 today we have just received the 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.119
 update to the latest version of the 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.200
 firmware of this this terminal this 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.669
 immense finished like 20 5.5 inches 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.829
 It's been a week since we've had it 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.750
 for android fax and we are reviewing 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:34.160
 and doing a thorough analysis but still 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.250
 now we want to show you how it works 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.860
 exclusively multitasking as you see 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.290
 the terminal is great because it has the 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.789
 samsung touch interface and own suite 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.489
 apart from sansom has now incorporated the 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.649
 multitasking which is accessed by pressing and 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.710
 keeping the back button like 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.239
 You see a little eyelash appears on the part of 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.339
 the left with all the applications 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.570
 that samsung allows you to use the 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.570
 multitasking currently 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:06.390
 as is for example facebook email the 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.360
 twitter gallery and others and we can 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.280
 hide the tab or take it out again and 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.160
 Apart edit all shortcuts 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.619
 that we want them to be in the tab 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.170
 multitasking such as messages 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.920
 notes and we will have them here reserved and 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.360
 at any time we can also 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.380
 return them again 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.380
 to multitasking 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.550
 we can activate or deactivate the tab 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.800
 holding down 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.230
 the back button appears and 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.180
 disappears and at the time of functioning what 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.580
 Well, we will simply have to press 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.410
 about an application we see that it has 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.530
 put on full screen now if 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.820
 open the tab again and press 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.960
 about youtube 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.960
 we will have youtube 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.609
 now we will have active in two tabs 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.310
 vertically the two youtube applications 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:05.759
 on the top and twitter the part 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.659
 lower we can increase or decrease 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.619
 any of the applications that 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.619
 we want 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.590
 and we know at all times where we are 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.560
 located to interact with the tab 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.540
 adequate by clicking on the application and 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.969
 seeing that there is a little arrow here 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.849
 that indicates the sense in which we are 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:29.640
 operating for example to activate the 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.010
 back button and the same would happen in the 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.489
 youtube that we are not in the video and 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.489
 we go back 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.640
 we can also invest the 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.990
 applications with the icon or if we want 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.990
 return to full screen 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.310
 directly pulsar and bolt on the 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.300
 screen icon can amplify 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.690
 do this with all applications 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.400
 what we have 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.400
 admitted in multitasking 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.920
 like the maps the videos 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.840
 the gallery or also the browser 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.840
 Internet 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.230
 as you can see the keyboard appears in 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.239
 miniature too so that we can 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.250
 used in the applications that 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.780
 need for example now we are 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.780
 browsing and we could consult 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.080
 the map 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.420
 I'm gone 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.590
 we could check the map while 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.209
 we continue browsing 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.739
 If there is no problem, look at all the 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.739
 lashes the layers 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.470
 and continue navigating with the browser to 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.470
 Internet 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.670
 apart we can use it in mode 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.210
 vertical or horizontal mode as you see 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.890
 the screen is divided 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.180
 between the different tabs that 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.180
 we have open to multitasking 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.330
 As you can see, the truth is that 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.249
 quite practical and quite visual 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.950
 quite 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:44.590
 visually very attractive 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.570
 now work in two with two 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.090
 different applications always as now 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.830
 we have said with the applications that 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.200
 Sanson allows us at the moment to use 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.700
 the multitasking that are hero that are the 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.740
 most common and those that come 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.290
 integrated within the system itself and 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.760
 well for the moment they're supposed to be 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.620
 go increasing compatibility with 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.280
 said applications allowing the use 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.440
 of some more secure at the moment this is 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.450
 what what we wanted to show you and more 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.940
 forward we will perform the analysis 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.500
 full of samsung galaxy 2 that the 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.880
 truth is that it is surprising us very 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.920
 pleasantly because it is a 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:22.050
 terminal with a lot of power and above all 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.050
 a lot of flexibility until then
