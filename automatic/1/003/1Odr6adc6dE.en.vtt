00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:09.030
 hello to all in this video i'm going 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.799
 explain the basics of technique 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.469
 cobra weaving that will you 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:15.030
 make it possible to make bracelets 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.590
 dragons for knives or tools 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.630
 caen you can even with this 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:24.270
 technical embellished with the wrists of bag 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.470
 backpack or panniers the technique of 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.390
 cobra braiding is really very 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.430
 simple to master on the principle you 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.529
 have a central structure on which 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.630
 you are going rolled up your very wise you 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.399
 have a single technique to master a 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.649
 mesh that you have made up once 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.969
 right once left and then in 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.999
 successes in you will be able to do 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.399
 all your very wise on a bracelet the 

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:46.109
 central part the structure that's all 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.449
 simply the brown rope goes that goes 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:50.820
 connect the two clasp and 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.820
 then on a satchel or a backpack the 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:59.609
 structure it's going to be the handle so of 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.690
 your equipment for this tutorial I 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.489
 will show you how to achieve your 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.989
 very wise cobra on a handful of 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.790
 saddlebags it will allow you already well 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.110
 master the basics and after power 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.520
 start you in your own very wise 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.590
 so for the material that I'm going 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.480
 use the white accor this will be 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.910
 much more visual for the video and for 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.370
 tooling an eagle shot and this will serve to 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.630
 the end for finishing is something 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.770
 something that is not essential if 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.140
 you do not have any you will be able 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.190
 you pass a little slideshow and 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.190
 learn kwassa tutorial 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.020
 the first thing to do that is going to be 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.940
 determine the middle of your reserve 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.200
 string parts and then place it under 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.760
 your structure you will be able 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.750
 then started the braiding in itself 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.890
 at first I will ask you 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.540
 braiding techniques rather 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.980
 reserved for very big beginners it is 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.450
 like that I learned it's a 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.040
 little bit easier to explain 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.030
 as much easier to understand 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.770
 and then afterwards I'll go 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.240
 show the technique a little bit more 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.500
 fast with a little less gestures 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.790
 techniques it will save you a little 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.470
 little time once you'll be 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.930
 very well mastered technique 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.580
 so we'll start from the left side 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.010
 you can as well started on the side 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.900
 of rock what a how to say a sequel 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.530
 of my that will be done in a sense 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.090
 then in the other 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.480
 I prefer to start on the left 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.130
 so I take all my reserves of shares 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.920
 string that was left and there 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:51.450
 I am going to build an ace over 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.760
 my structure this way then I 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:59.190
 take the string share that is found 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:01.440
 on the right side and so the end I 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.620
 will go through the lower loop of the 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.690
 s from above then i'm going to go 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:11.790
 under the structure and I will come out 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.390
 in the upper loop of the s by passing 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.150
 from below 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:26.130
 then just take the part to 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:27.570
 ropes to tighten the first my there 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.220
 you have your first wave of fact 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.100
 that you see you have a small 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.870
 loop that is on the side 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.190
 systematically when you go 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.590
 reattach the next trunk he goes 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.050
 have to take the rope that is 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.150
 on the loop side so every time 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.010
 you work on the side of the last 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.810
 loop the lowest loop so there 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.160
 the loop being right now we 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.550
 will go on the right so here we go 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.290
 to make an ace but inverted over 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.820
 the structure with the string reserve 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.750
 which is on the right 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:00.150
 there we will take the end of the rope 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.760
 which is on the left we will go through 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.460
 the bottom loop from above 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.030
 then under the structure and we will 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.930
 come out in our loop by entering 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.319
 from above 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:18.209
 and in the same way that we go 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:24.150
 tighten the loop and there we have our two 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:25.500
 first my cobras once I 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.370
 will be more experienced you will 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.630
 realize that you will not have 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.490
 need to do s you go 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.500
 work a little faster in 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.240
 Saving will read a technical gesture 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.970
 it will allow you to win a little 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.590
 of time so gold we take our brad 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.979
 by granting the one on the side 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.380
 left 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.910
 we will simply come over 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.210
 the structure place it so 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:49.229
 horizontal and with the other reserve on 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:53.340
 goes on then under the 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:54.750
 structure and we stand out in the loop 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.840
 as originally 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:02.000
 from there it pours from to 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:04.349
 ropes and made up the mesh 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.419
 we work near the other side 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:10.530
 the loop is on the side of me in 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:12.270
 below so we go over and we 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:16.560
 makes a loop and with the other side we 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:20.400
 passes over the horizontal brown underneath 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:23.699
 the structure and we stand out in the 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.320
 loop 1 as you see it's when 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:27.470
 even something that is much more 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.470
 quick 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.530
 as you see the technique of 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.389
 Braiding Cobra still some 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.770
 something simple enough to apprehend a 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.720
 once we get used to it and we arrive 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.889
 to make up what tomorrow is some 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.570
 something that is very repetitive 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:41.099
 there I will finish showing wise out 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.389
 camera and I find you at the end 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:46.349
 when you show how to do the 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:47.729
 finishing the braiding around the 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:50.159
 structure is now complete so 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:52.590
 we will be able to go to finishes then 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:54.720
 for that we have several techniques 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.780
 the first one is going to be like for the 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.509
 bracelets to cut right here is just 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.940
 here and thermo welded the end of 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:06.840
 the share grants the loops that goes to 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:09.810
 side so for example as on this 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.919
 just right bracelet is right there so that 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.599
 it's really a technique that is 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:12.990
 Perfectly suited for bracelets 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:14.760
 where the 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.900
 very tight message for the wrists 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.550
 it's because I find the most 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.290
 appropriate considering that there is always a small 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.330
 little movement so when I 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.550
 advise more is to return the share 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.070
 grant inside braiding so 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:29.240
 for that I use a regulate it is 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:32.760
 really very simple we will pass it 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:35.910
 in the structure under the stringed part 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:41.370
 under the pressing then we will come 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:47.820
 caught so both ends of 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:50.340
 string shares reserves and then we'll 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:54.270
 simply ironing inside 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:57.000
 this way so all the apparat strings 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.860
 which remains so it allows you more 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.790
 to have something relatively 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.890
 correct 

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:04.140
 and then after that you will be in place 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:07.500
 and so either on the sides or so the 

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:10.320
 let in the middle you pull slightly 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.910
 or with scissors cut you off here end 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.250
 in short, you do something 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:16.560
 relatively clean then the reserve 

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:19.110
 who is here I had on my other 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.120
 bag so on my satchel match and here 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.830
 that's what I did I work 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.360
 often by hand there really is not 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.130
 no worries that's never 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.150
 come out anyway you have when 

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.230
 even a lot of margin so 

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.440
 eventually you could easily 

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:33.980
 tightened so here on the end of your 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.980
 very wise 

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.340
 here is this tutorial on braiding 

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.690
 cobra if you have questions 

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.210
 as usual the inbox 

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:43.410
 or the comments section if you want 

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.970
 know how to play at the heart of the hand to 

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.020
 strings it's just on the site 

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.220
 the blade and the case 

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.780
 I put you the link in the description 

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.110
 it will allow you to visit the 

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.730
 site 

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:53.720
 I'm done now and I'll 

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:53.720
 see you soon for more videos
