really fast so if you like the normal

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.940 
really fast so if you like the normal
obsidian<00:01:56.390> state<00:01:56.630> or<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:56.869> normal<00:01:57.409> bowel<00:01:57.680> and

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:15.610 
could put like a diamond camera over it
i<00:02:14.779> think<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:15.109> look

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
i think that look

i think that look
more<00:02:15.830> insane<00:02:16.340> but<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.879> next<00:02:17.090> weapon<00:02:17.239> want<00:02:17.510> to

more insane but the next weapon want to

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.479 
more insane but the next weapon want to
be<00:02:17.629> looking<00:02:17.930> at<00:02:18.049> is<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.290> ASM<00:02:18.799> one<00:02:18.980> royalty

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
be looking at is the ASM one royalty

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.759 
be looking at is the ASM one royalty
this<00:02:20.090> is<00:02:20.209> actually<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.629> speakeasy<00:02:21.349> version

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
this is actually the speakeasy version

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.770 
this is actually the speakeasy version
so<00:02:22.010> it's<00:02:22.250> got<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.519> damage<00:02:22.819> going<00:02:23.060> down<00:02:23.239> by<00:02:23.450> one

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
this weapon is all so insane and just

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.289 
this weapon is all so insane and just
like<00:02:30.379> the<00:02:30.500> speakeasy<00:02:31.069> because<00:02:31.370> how<00:02:31.610> fast<00:02:32.060> it

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
like the speakeasy because how fast it

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.390 
like the speakeasy because how fast it
shoots<00:02:32.629> it's<00:02:32.900> like<00:02:33.379> they're<00:02:33.590> adding<00:02:33.950> in<00:02:34.159> the

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
shoots it's like they're adding in the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.100 
shoots it's like they're adding in the
best<00:02:34.730> variance<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.269> some<00:02:35.450> of<00:02:35.569> these<00:02:35.659> weapons

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
best variance to some of these weapons

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.170 
best variance to some of these weapons
and<00:02:36.319> some<00:02:36.590> weapons<00:02:36.980> are<00:02:37.190> they<00:02:37.610> added<00:02:37.909> in<00:02:38.000> they

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
and some weapons are they added in they

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.970 
and some weapons are they added in they
didn't<00:02:38.420> put<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.659> best<00:02:38.840> variant<00:02:39.260> or<00:02:39.500> which<00:02:39.829> is

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
didn't put the best variant or which is

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.830 
didn't put the best variant or which is
actually<00:02:40.190> quite<00:02:40.519> unfortunate<00:02:41.360> so<00:02:41.510> as<00:02:41.659> you<00:02:41.750> can

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
actually quite unfortunate so as you can

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.020 
actually quite unfortunate so as you can
see<00:02:42.019> it's<00:02:42.440> got<00:02:42.620> a<00:02:42.680> plus<00:02:42.950> to<00:02:43.129> fire<00:02:43.459> aid<00:02:43.610> it's<00:02:43.819> got

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
see it's got a plus to fire aid it's got

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.059 
see it's got a plus to fire aid it's got
the<00:02:44.150> nice<00:02:44.299> purple<00:02:44.629> camo<00:02:44.989> and<00:02:45.349> what's<00:02:45.799> pretty

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
the nice purple camo and what's pretty

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.000 
the nice purple camo and what's pretty
cool<00:02:46.310> about<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:47.269> royalty<00:02:47.720> elites<00:02:48.079> is<00:02:48.769> that

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
cool about the royalty elites is that

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.319 
cool about the royalty elites is that
obviously<00:02:49.190> they<00:02:49.579> don't<00:02:49.730> have<00:02:49.879> any<00:02:50.030> start

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
obviously they don't have any start

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.270 
obviously they don't have any start
increases<00:02:50.930> but<00:02:51.079> I'm<00:02:51.260> almost<00:02:51.530> definitely<00:02:52.069> sure

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
increases but I'm almost definitely sure

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.130 
increases but I'm almost definitely sure
they<00:02:52.430> give<00:02:52.609> you<00:02:52.700> like<00:02:52.730> an<00:02:53.000> extra<00:02:53.480> mag<00:02:53.720> or<00:02:53.959> some

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
they give you like an extra mag or some

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.900 
they give you like an extra mag or some
extra<00:02:54.530> bullets<00:02:54.829> which<00:02:54.950> isn't<00:02:55.310> too<00:02:55.459> bad<00:02:55.670> but

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
extra bullets which isn't too bad but

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.550 
extra bullets which isn't too bad but
for<00:02:56.359> a<00:02:56.390> royalty<00:02:56.780> really<00:02:56.989> you<00:02:57.230> would<00:02:57.410> be

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
for a royalty really you would be

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.979 
for a royalty really you would be
expecting<00:02:58.129> a<00:02:58.220> lot<00:02:58.489> better<00:02:58.700> but<00:02:59.180> so<00:02:59.480> far<00:02:59.750> go<00:02:59.930> to

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
expecting a lot better but so far go to

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.180 
expecting a lot better but so far go to
save<00:03:00.200> I<00:03:00.349> would<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.590> get<00:03:00.739> that<00:03:00.859> thing<00:03:01.010> I'd

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
save I would to get that thing I'd

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.099 
save I would to get that thing I'd
probably<00:03:01.430> scream<00:03:01.879> my<00:03:02.060> lungs<00:03:02.090> off<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.930> next

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
probably scream my lungs off the next

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:04.539

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
weapon insane this is actually the

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.909 
weapon insane this is actually the
normal<00:04:04.849> one<00:04:05.060> handed<00:04:05.480> sack<00:04:05.720> version<00:04:06.230> and<00:04:06.379> there

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:06.919 
normal one handed sack version and there

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:09.159 
normal one handed sack version and there
isn't<00:04:07.280> any<00:04:07.459> other<00:04:07.760> sack<00:04:08.120> one-handed<00:04:08.750> version

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:09.169 
isn't any other sack one-handed version

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:10.750 
isn't any other sack one-handed version
while<00:04:09.319> there<00:04:09.440> is<00:04:09.590> another<00:04:09.889> elite<00:04:10.190> version<00:04:10.430> but

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
while there is another elite version but

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.129 
while there is another elite version but
I<00:04:10.819> think<00:04:11.120> that<00:04:11.239> one<00:04:11.359> is<00:04:11.389> different<00:04:11.900> to<00:04:12.019> this

I think that one is different to this

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.020 
I think that one is different to this
one<00:04:12.379> so<00:04:12.799> it's<00:04:12.949> got<00:04:13.069> plus<00:04:13.280> three<00:04:13.459> damage<00:04:13.730> and

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030
