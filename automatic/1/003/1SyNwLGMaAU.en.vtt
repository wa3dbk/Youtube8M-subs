I'm<00:00:00.539> making<00:00:00.870> this<00:00:00.960> video<00:00:01.290> to<00:00:01.350> demonstrate

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
I'm making this video to demonstrate

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.180 
I'm making this video to demonstrate
that<00:00:01.979> a<00:00:02.250> Nikon<00:00:02.760> P<00:00:03.179> 7700<00:00:04.170> can<00:00:04.380> generally<00:00:04.799> focus

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
that a Nikon P 7700 can generally focus

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.499 
that a Nikon P 7700 can generally focus
without<00:00:05.339> any<00:00:05.700> problems

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
without any problems

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.419 
without any problems
contrary<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.410> some<00:00:07.500> of<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.770> videos<00:00:08.099> that<00:00:08.309> are

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
contrary to some of the videos that are

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:09.950 
contrary to some of the videos that are
out<00:00:08.519> there<00:00:08.790> in<00:00:08.970> which<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.360> camera<00:00:09.570> was<00:00:09.780> not

out there in which the camera was not
used<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.349> way<00:00:10.469> it<00:00:10.590> was<00:00:10.710> intended<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.219> be<00:00:11.400> used

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
used the way it was intended to be used

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.629 
used the way it was intended to be used
if<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:12.900> use<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.200> camera<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:14.250> way<00:00:14.400> it<00:00:14.519> is

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
if you use the camera the way it is

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.720 
if you use the camera the way it is
supposed<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.969> be<00:00:15.030> used<00:00:15.680> it<00:00:16.680> generally<00:00:17.310> will

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
supposed to be used it generally will

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.189 
supposed to be used it generally will
reliably<00:00:18.090> focus<00:00:19.160> that<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.189> problem<00:00:21.050> you<00:00:22.050> can

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
reliably focus that a problem you can

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.689 
reliably focus that a problem you can
see<00:00:22.380> there<00:00:22.590> there<00:00:22.740> was<00:00:22.830> not<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.039> single<00:00:23.369> miss

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
see there there was not a single miss

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.710 
see there there was not a single miss

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
focus now switch to the macro mode and

what you have this guide here if the bar
is<00:00:31.859> green<00:00:32.160> then<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.579> camera<00:00:32.940> will<00:00:32.969> generally

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
is green then the camera will generally

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:45.779 
is green then the camera will generally
focus

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.900 

did<00:00:46.789> I<00:00:46.879> miss<00:00:47.059> the<00:00:47.090> focus<00:00:47.570> yet<00:00:48.399> I'll<00:00:49.399> go<00:00:49.640> all<00:00:49.850> the

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
did I miss the focus yet I'll go all the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.330 
did I miss the focus yet I'll go all the
way<00:00:49.940> to<00:00:50.090> the<00:00:50.180> extreme<00:00:50.570> of<00:00:50.600> the<00:00:50.870> green<00:00:51.280> so<00:00:52.280> it

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
way to the extreme of the green so it

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.950 
way to the extreme of the green so it
just<00:00:52.519> turned<00:00:52.699> white<00:00:52.850> when<00:00:53.059> it<00:00:53.089> turns<00:00:53.390> one<00:00:53.600> the

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
just turned white when it turns one the

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.420 
just turned white when it turns one the
manufacturer<00:00:54.530> says<00:00:54.739> that<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:54.949> camera<00:00:55.309> will

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
manufacturer says that the camera will

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.970 
manufacturer says that the camera will
not<00:00:55.550> reliably<00:00:56.030> focus<00:00:56.480> so<00:00:57.140> you<00:00:57.199> go<00:00:57.469> back<00:00:57.710> to<00:00:57.890> the

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
not reliably focus so you go back to the

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:16.700 
not reliably focus so you go back to the
maximum<00:00:58.519> of<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:58.760> green<00:01:01.780> focus

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.050 

you<00:01:17.710> can<00:01:17.860> see<00:01:18.010> the<00:01:18.160> camera<00:01:18.460> is<00:01:18.490> not<00:01:18.700> missed<00:01:18.940> a

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
you can see the camera is not missed a

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.260 
you can see the camera is not missed a
single<00:01:19.090> focus<00:01:19.810> yet<00:01:20.700> if<00:01:21.700> you<00:01:21.880> use<00:01:22.000> the<00:01:22.120> camera

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
single focus yet if you use the camera

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.540 
single focus yet if you use the camera
correctly<00:01:22.840> and<00:01:23.050> you<00:01:23.200> zoom<00:01:23.890> where<00:01:24.160> it's<00:01:24.340> white

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
correctly and you zoom where it's white

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.180 
correctly and you zoom where it's white
you<00:01:24.880> still<00:01:25.420> may<00:01:25.540> get<00:01:25.690> lucky<00:01:25.810> enough<00:01:26.680> contrast

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
you still may get lucky enough contrast

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.970 
you still may get lucky enough contrast
the<00:01:27.280> counter<00:01:27.550> may<00:01:27.670> figure<00:01:28.060> it<00:01:28.180> out<00:01:28.330> but<00:01:29.140> it

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
the counter may figure it out but it

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.940 
the counter may figure it out but it
didn't<00:01:30.360> don't<00:01:31.360> expect<00:01:31.750> it<00:01:31.930> to<00:01:31.960> you're<00:01:32.770> in<00:01:32.860> the

didn't don't expect it to you're in the
white<00:01:33.100> zone<00:01:33.340> maybe<00:01:33.730> you'll<00:01:33.910> get<00:01:34.030> lucky<00:01:34.090> we'll

white zone maybe you'll get lucky we'll
try<00:01:34.720> it<00:01:34.750> again<00:01:34.870> now<00:01:35.370> suppose<00:01:36.370> I<00:01:36.400> go<00:01:36.580> back<00:01:36.730> to

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
try it again now suppose I go back to

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.310 
try it again now suppose I go back to
the<00:01:37.000> green<00:01:37.210> as<00:01:37.510> described<00:01:38.140> by<00:01:38.260> the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
manufacturer you'll see gets the focus

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.270 
manufacturer you'll see gets the focus
no<00:01:42.220> problem<00:01:42.730> I<00:01:43.590> may<00:01:44.590> not<00:01:44.740> explain<00:01:45.010> all<00:01:45.190> the

and<00:01:49.990> what's<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.350> YouTube<00:01:50.710> did<00:01:50.860> not<00:01:50.950> focus<00:01:51.160> on

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
and what's the YouTube did not focus on

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.070 
and what's the YouTube did not focus on
anything<00:01:51.729> because<00:01:52.210> he<00:01:52.360> had<00:01:52.510> it<00:01:52.660> zoomed<00:01:52.930> all

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
anything because he had it zoomed all

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.350 
anything because he had it zoomed all
the<00:01:53.140> way<00:01:53.260> in<00:01:53.560> with<00:01:54.490> everything<00:01:54.790> being<00:01:55.090> white

the way in with everything being white

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.480 
the way in with everything being white
in<00:01:56.170> which<00:01:56.350> case<00:01:56.560> you're<00:01:56.680> not<00:01:56.800> expected<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.369> get

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
in which case you're not expected to get

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.180 
in which case you're not expected to get
the<00:01:57.610> focus<00:01:57.850> go<00:01:58.630> back<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.140> to<00:01:59.830> the<00:01:59.950> green

the focus go back to the to the green
and<00:02:02.460> get<00:02:03.460> that<00:02:03.640> focus<00:02:04.080> reliable
