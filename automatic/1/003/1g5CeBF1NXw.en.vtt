00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:10.740
 the holo 1931 handset with windows phone 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.900
 more advanced so far and is a beautiful 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.790
 of an upgrade over fire 920 in 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.500
 practically all the questions 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.180
 considering this we separated five 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.980
 reasons you should take in 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.520
 consideration when buying it 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.520
 check out 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.820
 this is certainly one of the main 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.220
 Differentials 930 even 1920 released 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.960
 still in 2012 has a camera with 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.030
 sufficient quality to compete standing 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.450
 of equality with a series of top of 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.910
 line 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.830
 even in the present day in the case we have 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.620
 known the worst-seen sensor and lenses 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.809
 cause now counting with 20 megapixels 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.250
 optical image stabilization one of the 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.470
 best camera software from 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.180
 still the future of nokia 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.100
 is more or less uncertain 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.110
 superiority of the company in this 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:03.100
 especially impressive on models 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:05.199
 most advanced lumina lu line 1930 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.030
 uses the snapdragon 800 chip already 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.149
 relatively old to the standards of 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.430
 technology and does not really mind 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.500
 too much windows phone is able to rotate 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.840
 without gagging this configuration with 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.100
 super smooth multitasking and 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.600
 run any epe 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.869
 this raises even an issue 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.110
 important over performance 930 that was 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.640
 launched in 2014 with the 2013 chip and in the 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.920
 day-to-day apparent speed is not 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.930
 very different from the number 920 they bring 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.540
 a much more modest configuration 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.460
 or even with a nice upgrade to 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.470
 difference in day-to-day life so 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:44.829
 It's okay to continue switching smartphones. 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:46.509
 search for greater performance here we have the 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.400
 combination of two technologies that 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.299
 results in a predictable screen 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.070
 great 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.810
 the first one is the super amoled that 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.030
 has an excellent color saturation 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.740
 absolute levels of black she is 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.810
 present in several other models 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.909
 from other platforms 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.860
 the second is to create the black display 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.299
 nokia that further enhances the contrast 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.189
 color and allows it to be 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.470
 used in sunlight without problems 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:09.519
 something that usually does not happen with 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.470
 lcd screens 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.510
 even using full HD resolution 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.519
 in an age where several manufacturers already 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.410
 migrating to 2k is one of the 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.510
 best screens showing what 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.440
 increasing resolution does not always 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.440
 earnings for the user 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.459
 We have said some times that 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.140
 import very material manufacturer uses 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.879
 but if the smartphone has a design 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.560
 which justifies its price and 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.810
 market positioning 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.060
 This is exactly what happens here in the 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.620
 holo 1930 uses metal edges and a 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.870
 rear of plastic with balance 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.860
 excellent with standard bright colors 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.750
 of the line lucia 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.800
 but look at it to see what we are 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.800
 talking about a top-of-the-line model 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.400
 a nice point is that the 930 fire has 32 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.799
 internal storage gb by default 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.450
 enough space with a good amount 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.549
 archives for the vast majority of 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.980
 users and avoiding the standard of 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.019
 16 gigabytes used by most of the 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.000
 androids as well he could bring 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.890
 support for micro sd cards as there is 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.120
 space to spare for this but 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.709
 considering the price it is 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.329
 currently found this is a good 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.010
 differential 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.829
 there are the five reasons for you 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.610
 take the 1930 lu home but he is not 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.470
 Perfect 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.780
 I see this other video 5 details that 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.980
 bothered him and if he liked short here 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.900
 down and so our youtube channel 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.900
 Everyday has new video for you.
