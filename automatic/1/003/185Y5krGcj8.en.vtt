to<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.340> about<00:00:14.400> is<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.000> first<00:00:15.269> light

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
to you about is the first light

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.870 
to you about is the first light
not<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:16.080> light<00:00:16.350> or<00:00:16.560> another<00:00:16.949> one<00:00:17.160> but<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.670> light

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
not a light or another one but the light

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.060 
not a light or another one but the light
the<00:00:18.480> first<00:00:18.750> led<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.350> reproduce<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.890> full

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
the first led to reproduce the full
