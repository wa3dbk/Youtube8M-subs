00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:42.410 
windows which are getting quite worn now
it's<00:02:33.280> almost<00:02:34.120> time<00:02:34.330> for<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.570> touch-up<00:02:34.750> huh

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.080 

what<00:02:43.230> I<00:02:43.260> was<00:02:43.410> going<00:02:43.560> for<00:02:43.709> with<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.280> sound<00:02:44.580> was

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
what I was going for with the sound was

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.320 
what I was going for with the sound was
a<00:02:46.160> huge<00:02:47.160> range<00:02:47.550> with<00:02:48.000> easy<00:02:48.330> controls<00:02:48.920> so<00:02:50.330> it's

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
a huge range with easy controls so it's

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.290 
a huge range with easy controls so it's
got<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.540> typical<00:02:51.989> volume<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.620> tone<00:02:52.739> knob

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
got a typical volume and tone knob

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.940 
got a typical volume and tone knob
regular<00:02:54.300> guitar<00:02:54.480> setup<00:02:54.959> pretty<00:02:55.319> typical<00:02:55.530> and

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
regular guitar setup pretty typical and

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.250 
regular guitar setup pretty typical and
then<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.819> 3-way<00:02:57.180> pickup<00:02:57.390> selector<00:02:57.690> switch

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
then a 3-way pickup selector switch

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.680 
then a 3-way pickup selector switch
which<00:02:58.500> chooses<00:02:58.739> the<00:02:59.280> neck<00:02:59.459> pickup<00:02:59.700> the<00:03:00.480> bridge

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
which chooses the neck pickup the bridge

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.770 
which chooses the neck pickup the bridge
pickup<00:03:01.140> or<00:03:01.590> both<00:03:01.980> pickups<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.670> then<00:03:02.730> it's<00:03:03.660> got

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
pickup or both pickups and then it's got

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.840 
pickup or both pickups and then it's got
this<00:03:03.870> mini<00:03:04.140> toggle<00:03:04.530> switch<00:03:04.800> which<00:03:05.520> is<00:03:05.670> where

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
this mini toggle switch which is where

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.970 
this mini toggle switch which is where
the<00:03:05.940> magic<00:03:06.030> happens<00:03:06.569> so<00:03:07.380> when<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.739> mini

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
the magic happens so when the mini

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.090 
the magic happens so when the mini
switch<00:03:08.220> is<00:03:08.370> down<00:03:08.400> both<00:03:09.060> pickups<00:03:09.360> are<00:03:09.660> acting

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
switch is down both pickups are acting

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.589 
switch is down both pickups are acting
functionally<00:03:11.100> as<00:03:11.250> humbucker<00:03:11.790> type<00:03:12.239> pickups

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
functionally as humbucker type pickups

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.670 
functionally as humbucker type pickups
but<00:03:13.489> they<00:03:14.489> have<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.780> magnetic<00:03:16.200> structure<00:03:16.590> of

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
but they have the magnetic structure of

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.130 
but they have the magnetic structure of
a<00:03:16.739> single<00:03:17.069> coil<00:03:17.280> so<00:03:18.030> it's<00:03:18.300> not<00:03:18.750> your

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
a single coil so it's not your

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.590 
a single coil so it's not your
traditional<00:03:19.640> humbucker<00:03:20.640> sound<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.450> neck

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
traditional humbucker sound the neck

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:39.830 
traditional humbucker sound the neck
pickup<00:03:29.900> in<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:30.959> bridge<00:03:31.019> pickup<00:03:38.630> it's<00:03:39.630> got

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
pickup in the bridge pickup it's got

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.740 
pickup in the bridge pickup it's got
sort<00:03:40.080> of<00:03:40.140> a<00:03:40.430> single<00:03:41.430> coil<00:03:41.700> ish<00:03:41.970> humbucker

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
sort of a single coil ish humbucker

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.900 
sort of a single coil ish humbucker
sound<00:03:43.110> to<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:43.310> but<00:03:44.310> then<00:03:44.430> when<00:03:44.549> you<00:03:44.610> flipped

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
sound to it but then when you flipped

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.509 
sound to it but then when you flipped
the<00:03:45.030> mini<00:03:45.209> switch<00:03:45.510> all<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.870> way<00:03:45.959> up<00:03:46.280> it<00:03:47.280> puts

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
the mini switch all the way up it puts

00:03:47.519 --> 00:04:01.320 
the mini switch all the way up it puts
both<00:03:47.670> of<00:03:47.850> them<00:03:48.000> into<00:03:48.209> a<00:03:48.239> single<00:03:48.510> coil<00:03:48.840> sound

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.699 

the<00:04:02.330> middle<00:04:02.659> position<00:04:03.049> on<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:03.260> mini<00:04:03.409> switch

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
the middle position on the mini switch

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.649 
the middle position on the mini switch
is<00:04:03.920> a<00:04:04.189> unique<00:04:04.760> thing<00:04:05.030> that<00:04:05.180> I<00:04:05.209> don't<00:04:05.450> really

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:05.659 
is a unique thing that I don't really

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:10.660 
is a unique thing that I don't really
know<00:04:05.930> of<00:04:07.180> many<00:04:08.180> people<00:04:08.510> doing<00:04:08.720> but<00:04:09.579> what<00:04:10.579> it

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
know of many people doing but what it

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.160 
know of many people doing but what it
does<00:04:10.819> is<00:04:11.000> it<00:04:11.030> makes<00:04:11.329> the<00:04:11.540> neck<00:04:11.750> pickup<00:04:11.930> a

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
does is it makes the neck pickup a

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.569 
does is it makes the neck pickup a
single<00:04:12.439> coil<00:04:12.650> and<00:04:12.950> the<00:04:12.980> bridge<00:04:13.159> pickup<00:04:13.340> a

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
single coil and the bridge pickup a

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:28.110 
single coil and the bridge pickup a
humbucker<00:04:13.959> so<00:04:14.959> you<00:04:15.049> can<00:04:15.290> get<00:04:15.470> your<00:04:15.530> nice<00:04:16.489> shiny

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.820 

hmm<00:04:28.630> then<00:04:29.110> when<00:04:29.199> you<00:04:29.260> flip<00:04:29.440> over<00:04:29.620> to<00:04:29.680> the

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
hmm then when you flip over to the

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.140 
hmm then when you flip over to the
humbucker<00:04:30.310> you<00:04:30.490> got<00:04:32.520> as<00:04:33.520> you<00:04:33.669> flip<00:04:33.910> for<00:04:34.120> a

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
humbucker you got as you flip for a

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.110 
humbucker you got as you flip for a
different<00:04:34.540> lead<00:04:35.530> type<00:04:35.770> stuff<00:04:36.040> out<00:04:36.190> of<00:04:36.220> it<00:04:36.460> it's

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
different lead type stuff out of it it's

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.360 
different lead type stuff out of it it's
like<00:04:37.300> being<00:04:38.229> a<00:04:38.410> painter<00:04:38.650> and<00:04:38.919> starting<00:04:39.340> with

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
like being a painter and starting with

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.310 
like being a painter and starting with
eight<00:04:39.639> colors<00:04:40.090> and<00:04:40.360> then<00:04:40.720> someone<00:04:40.960> handing

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
eight colors and then someone handing

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.560 
eight colors and then someone handing
you<00:04:41.410> a<00:04:41.440> new<00:04:41.620> palette<00:04:41.979> that<00:04:42.130> has<00:04:42.310> 64<00:04:43.210> colors

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.659 
you a new palette that has 64 colors
there's<00:04:44.110> so<00:04:44.650> much<00:04:44.860> more<00:04:45.040> I<00:04:45.100> can<00:04:45.250> do<00:04:45.490> with<00:04:45.639> it

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
there's so much more I can do with it

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.610 
there's so much more I can do with it
now<00:04:45.790> there's<00:04:46.389> blood<00:04:46.690> in<00:04:46.720> this<00:04:46.990> and<00:04:47.260> I<00:04:47.560> don't
