00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.250
 times around the derbi so if I do 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.690

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.810
 Well, it's just for you 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.760
 announce good news to those who 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.750
 follow to those who follow a little the 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.340
 chain and the bike and then to redo 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.340
 a little presentation to skip this 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.420
 which would happen so I have plenty of good 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.219
 news as I wanted to say so I 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.880
 will say is that start with my part 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.890
 you announce that it's very simple I 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.230
 bought a lot of parts for my 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.520
 motorcycle yeah yeah again but 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.290
 this time it's more part 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.100
 aesthetic 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.840
 so I immediately tell you what 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.660
 that I took so I took a 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.840
 rearview mirror on maxi scoot a handsome 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.730
 blue mirrors a little darker 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.199
 blue sky but a good blue a good blues 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.530
 I find one that I like beautiful I like 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.699
 a lot this kind of blue then I 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.960
 do not know you can always go see 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.129
 on sport dam at rims level 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.659
 I took some kind of self pantyhose 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.670
 will do a little half of the rim 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.659
 like that but you 'll start from the other 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.280
 side in blue always 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.740
 so I do not have if you see a lot 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.420
 going ti will expand in which donated 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.060
 started end that will expand on the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.670
 rim that will end late to redo 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.500
 the same thing on the other side so that's it 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.540
 there are eight so for the 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.229
 two rims because these two by two 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.189
 by side then at the level of the pot ben 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.659
 yes because I also took something at 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.950
 step of the pot I will remove 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.920
 this cartridge and I'm going to put a 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.119
 scr cartridge so long like those 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.159
 who are not wise down but long 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.740
 in Kevlar 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.479
 it cost me 65 euros so that's when 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.560
 not bad, it's clear in my 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.170
 everything I took anyway that 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.270
 is about 300 euros of coins 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.390
 I took gray blue here for m at this 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:56.479
 level there so I would put 112 united 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.770
 6 and and here is this level here 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.119
 then I took a band 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.360
 blue edging but I'm not sure I 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.990
 will use it 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.229
 let me think 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.789
 What I took other makes 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.209
 I took so much stuff ah yes I 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.489
 took a stage wood box tailleville 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:21.930
 the end trick oil pump not limp 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:23.250
 here blue company the same and and this big 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.080

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.650
 bad of blue I took a blue chain 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.750
 So a continuous chain strengthen 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.950
 that this one already started to be retried 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.580
 So I said good bah as the 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.200
 order with the rest I took no 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.700
 bad stuff way was waiting what's that 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.250
 I would have thought I took what else 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.480
 I took corks from the corks 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.989

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.519
 everything I tell you will be blue and 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.349
 I took a sticker on 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.209

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.440
 curiosity to go see it will be this one 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.640
 normally 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.769
 so that makes a lot of changes 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.840
 I also took a gear selector 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:11.129
 blue and a tic a blue tig here like 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.909

 dexter will arrive and to finish he will 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.750

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.980
 rest blue feet too 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.930
 functioning in the troop of 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.129
 hairstyle the motorcycle will be she will be more 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.980
 red as you have known but she 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:30.510

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:32.519

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.080

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.580
 there is one of them that will necessarily 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.540
 to arrive by vo the other one would be a 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.970
 miracle that the two arrive at the same 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.200
 time and then good me I'm going to you 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.700

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.830

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:51.830
 70

 j 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.420
 well we will not leave long like this 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.060
 makes a lot of noise 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.860
 you must have realized I 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.430
 make a sound of mentally ill it's a 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.740
 crazy thing 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.100
 there are also two I also how 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:35.250
 injectors 80 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:37.730
 95 98 105 and 102 because here I am in 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.660
 108 is a little bit too big so 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.500
 I picked up some of them because 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.460
 never know and then I can always 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.210
 don to my friends if they need it 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.920
 So I started again little by little 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.000
 sprinklers and then finally sprinklers 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.520
 main all the same and then ben I 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.680
 would see well as I say them when 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.100
 I will have done all that decoration and where 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.630
 I will probably do two cameras 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.570
 embedded one with polystyrene 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.100
 with the other poker as soon as I had 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.230
 then good while waiting ben spent a 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.640
 good week and then we end up 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.840
 after mounting normally when 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:11.130
 all the pieces will be put and then 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:13.620
 I will put pictures on the facebook 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.940
 of dan sport if you follow you can 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.440
 go see and if you recognize the 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.020
 motorcycle was not hesitated to make a 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.370
 sign and then then that's how 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.290
 you want to contact me via facebook this 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.720

00:05:47.239 --> 00:05:50.089
 that my pieces will arrive before the 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:51.519

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:55.509
