I<00:01:38.250> wish<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.850> DVD<00:01:39.329> cover<00:01:39.659> itself<00:01:40.110> was<00:01:40.470> at<00:01:40.680> this

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
I wish the DVD cover itself was at this

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.889 
I wish the DVD cover itself was at this
image<00:01:41.310> too<00:01:41.820> because<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.240> looks<00:01:42.420> really<00:01:42.750> good

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
image too because it looks really good

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.440 
image too because it looks really good
but<00:01:43.229> instead<00:01:43.920> they<00:01:44.340> used<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.820> one<00:01:45.090> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
but instead they used this one the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.410 
but instead they used this one the
iconic<00:01:46.020> superhero<00:01:46.619> pose<00:01:46.950> if<00:01:47.640> only<00:01:47.880> he<00:01:48.180> wore

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
iconic superhero pose if only he wore

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.060 
iconic superhero pose if only he wore
his<00:01:48.450> superhero<00:01:49.290> suit<00:01:49.710> though<00:01:50.689> cuz<00:01:51.689> really<00:01:52.290> and

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
his superhero suit though cuz really and

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.859 
his superhero suit though cuz really and
then<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.399> back<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.850> just<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.180> disaster<00:01:54.720> in<00:01:54.840> my

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
then the back is just a disaster in my

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.469 
then the back is just a disaster in my
opinion<00:01:55.470> at<00:01:56.100> least<00:01:56.340> put<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.579> synopsis<00:01:57.030> there

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
opinion at least put the synopsis there

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.959 
opinion at least put the synopsis there
that<00:01:57.930> was<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.409> don't<00:01:59.040> know<00:01:59.219> why<00:01:59.460> they<00:01:59.610> did<00:01:59.790> that

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
that was I don't know why they did that

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.700 
that was I don't know why they did that
so<00:02:01.130> basically<00:02:02.130> they<00:02:02.340> went<00:02:02.490> with<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.759> CD<00:02:03.240> cover

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
so basically they went with the CD cover

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.880 
so basically they went with the CD cover
