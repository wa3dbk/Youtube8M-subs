00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.320 

let's<00:00:11.080> explain<00:00:11.500> this<00:00:11.950> new<00:00:12.220> Hydra<00:00:12.640> trim<00:00:12.910> corner

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.330 
let's explain this new Hydra trim corner

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.150 
let's explain this new Hydra trim corner
with<00:00:13.480> the<00:00:13.570> water<00:00:13.780> activated<00:00:14.410> backing<00:00:15.010> on<00:00:15.130> it

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
with the water activated backing on it

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.880 
with the water activated backing on it
and<00:00:15.490> how<00:00:16.150> this<00:00:16.390> thing<00:00:16.600> works<00:00:16.930> and<00:00:17.260> why<00:00:17.830> it

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
and how this thing works and why it

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.570 
and how this thing works and why it
works<00:00:18.450> first<00:00:19.450> off<00:00:19.779> the<00:00:20.200> back<00:00:20.439> is<00:00:20.770> a<00:00:21.130> water

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
works first off the back is a water

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.179 
works first off the back is a water
activated<00:00:22.360> adhesive<00:00:22.570> on<00:00:23.290> a<00:00:23.320> special<00:00:23.950> paper

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
activated adhesive on a special paper

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.730 
activated adhesive on a special paper
yeah<00:00:25.029> you<00:00:25.210> don't<00:00:25.300> need<00:00:25.510> nails<00:00:25.810> you<00:00:26.230> don't<00:00:26.410> need

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
yeah you don't need nails you don't need

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.280 
yeah you don't need nails you don't need
spray<00:00:27.160> glues<00:00:27.579> you<00:00:27.610> don't<00:00:28.270> need<00:00:28.480> crimping<00:00:29.050> you

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
spray glues you don't need crimping you

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.350 
spray glues you don't need crimping you
don't<00:00:29.470> have<00:00:29.650> to<00:00:29.800> mesh<00:00:30.009> tape<00:00:30.279> it<00:00:30.520> it<00:00:30.970> goes<00:00:31.150> on

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
don't have to mesh tape it it goes on

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.150 
don't have to mesh tape it it goes on
simply<00:00:31.840> by<00:00:32.050> water<00:00:32.320> and<00:00:32.590> you'll<00:00:32.680> see<00:00:32.860> that<00:00:33.010> in<00:00:33.100> a

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
simply by water and you'll see that in a

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.100 
simply by water and you'll see that in a
minute<00:00:33.280> but<00:00:33.850> what<00:00:33.940> makes<00:00:34.180> this<00:00:34.329> thing<00:00:34.510> work<00:00:34.570> is

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
minute but what makes this thing work is

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.610 
minute but what makes this thing work is
a<00:00:35.739> number<00:00:36.190> of<00:00:36.310> things<00:00:36.489> first<00:00:37.270> the<00:00:38.050> back<00:00:38.290> side

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
a number of things first the back side

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.250 
a number of things first the back side
has<00:00:39.040> a<00:00:39.100> water<00:00:39.579> activated<00:00:40.270> adhesive<00:00:40.420> that<00:00:41.020> is

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
has a water activated adhesive that is

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.950 
has a water activated adhesive that is
incredibly<00:00:42.190> strong<00:00:42.490> in<00:00:42.610> the<00:00:42.880> bonding<00:00:43.330> part<00:00:43.900> of

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
incredibly strong in the bonding part of

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.230 
incredibly strong in the bonding part of
the<00:00:44.110> corner<00:00:44.500> secondly<00:00:45.490> and<00:00:45.640> this<00:00:45.670> is<00:00:45.880> really

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:46.240 
the corner secondly and this is really

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.320 
the corner secondly and this is really
important<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:47.350> flange<00:00:47.650> just<00:00:47.950> is<00:00:48.790> peppered

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
important the flange just is peppered

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.030 
important the flange just is peppered
with<00:00:49.390> a<00:00:49.480> whole<00:00:49.690> bunch<00:00:49.900> of<00:00:50.020> holes<00:00:50.200> here<00:00:50.530> which

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
with a whole bunch of holes here which

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.730 
with a whole bunch of holes here which
makes<00:00:51.370> it<00:00:51.550> very<00:00:51.610> pliable<00:00:52.240> and<00:00:52.780> this<00:00:53.290> is<00:00:53.440> very

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:53.740 
makes it very pliable and this is very

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.470 
makes it very pliable and this is very
important<00:00:54.400> but<00:00:54.550> when<00:00:54.670> you<00:00:54.760> put<00:00:54.940> it<00:00:55.030> on<00:00:55.120> walls

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
important but when you put it on walls

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.140 
important but when you put it on walls
where<00:00:56.110> you<00:00:56.230> have<00:00:56.380> tapered<00:00:56.620> edges<00:00:56.950> or<00:00:57.520> you<00:00:58.060> know

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
where you have tapered edges or you know

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.450 
where you have tapered edges or you know
fractures<00:00:58.750> it<00:00:58.990> will<00:00:59.200> actually<00:00:59.530> move<00:01:00.250> around

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
fractures it will actually move around

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.390 
fractures it will actually move around
and<00:01:01.000> be<00:01:01.090> subtle<00:01:01.510> enough<00:01:01.780> to<00:01:01.930> lay<00:01:02.110> down<00:01:02.400> another

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
and be subtle enough to lay down another

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.820 
and be subtle enough to lay down another
really<00:01:03.880> nice<00:01:04.299> aspect<00:01:04.869> about<00:01:04.960> this<00:01:05.229> corner<00:01:05.650> is

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
really nice aspect about this corner is

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.539 
really nice aspect about this corner is
that<00:01:05.860> it<00:01:06.460> has<00:01:06.670> a<00:01:06.700> tapered<00:01:07.509> profile<00:01:08.280> similar<00:01:09.280> to

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
that it has a tapered profile similar to

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.280 
that it has a tapered profile similar to
that<00:01:09.670> of<00:01:09.729> no<00:01:10.060> code<00:01:10.329> out<00:01:10.540> there<00:01:10.780> but<00:01:11.049> a<00:01:11.079> much

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
that of no code out there but a much

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.399 
that of no code out there but a much
more<00:01:11.530> rapid<00:01:12.070> prototyper<00:01:12.909> here<00:01:13.270> so<00:01:13.810> tapers

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
more rapid prototyper here so tapers

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.740 
more rapid prototyper here so tapers
down<00:01:14.680> then<00:01:15.340> it<00:01:15.430> has<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:15.880> pliable<00:01:16.390> flange

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
down then it has the pliable flange

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.680 
down then it has the pliable flange
which<00:01:17.230> lot<00:01:17.590> which<00:01:17.830> bonds<00:01:18.550> it<00:01:18.640> down<00:01:18.820> so<00:01:19.540> when

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
which lot which bonds it down so when

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.200 
which lot which bonds it down so when
you<00:01:19.780> put<00:01:19.960> joint<00:01:20.260> compound<00:01:20.740> over<00:01:21.100> it<00:01:21.430> it<00:01:21.880> takes

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
you put joint compound over it it takes

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.930 
you put joint compound over it it takes
less<00:01:22.600> than<00:01:22.810> traditional<00:01:23.590> beads<00:01:23.890> number<00:01:24.790> one

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
less than traditional beads number one

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.850 
less than traditional beads number one
number<00:01:25.210> two<00:01:25.540> is<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:25.930> mud<00:01:26.140> goes<00:01:26.350> through<00:01:26.710> the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
number two is the mud goes through the

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.880 
number two is the mud goes through the
holes<00:01:27.100> and<00:01:27.430> locks<00:01:28.120> it<00:01:28.330> down<00:01:28.360> once<00:01:28.900> again<00:01:29.260> so

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
holes and locks it down once again so

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.130 
holes and locks it down once again so
you<00:01:29.979> have<00:01:30.040> the<00:01:30.340> incredible<00:01:30.970> bonding<00:01:31.420> power<00:01:31.690> of

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
you have the incredible bonding power of

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.950 
you have the incredible bonding power of
this<00:01:32.740> adhesive<00:01:33.400> on<00:01:33.520> the<00:01:33.640> back<00:01:33.820> and<00:01:34.210> then

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
this adhesive on the back and then

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.960 
this adhesive on the back and then
you've<00:01:35.110> got<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.500> joint<00:01:35.830> compound<00:01:36.310> going

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
you've got the joint compound going

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.969 
you've got the joint compound going
through<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.330> holes<00:01:37.540> locking<00:01:38.140> it<00:01:38.229> down<00:01:38.260> on<00:01:38.740> the

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
through the holes locking it down on the

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.130 
through the holes locking it down on the
front<00:01:39.280> in<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.360> real<00:01:40.570> world

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
front in the real world

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.200 
front in the real world
hanging<00:01:41.680> it<00:01:41.770> isn't<00:01:41.979> always<00:01:42.100> perfect<00:01:42.430> it's

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
hanging it isn't always perfect it's

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.820 
hanging it isn't always perfect it's
very<00:01:43.540> important<00:01:43.990> to<00:01:44.049> have<00:01:44.170> this<00:01:44.290> pliable

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
very important to have this pliable

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.690 
very important to have this pliable
handle<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.460> flange<00:01:45.820> so<00:01:46.299> when<00:01:46.450> you<00:01:46.570> put<00:01:46.840> it<00:01:46.960> over

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
handle a flange so when you put it over

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.580 
handle a flange so when you put it over
hanging<00:01:48.700> that<00:01:48.850> doesn't<00:01:49.299> line<00:01:49.479> up<00:01:49.780> that<00:01:50.350> it

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
hanging that doesn't line up that it

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.800 
hanging that doesn't line up that it
will<00:01:50.740> actually<00:01:50.890> lay<00:01:51.460> down<00:01:51.820> it's<00:01:52.450> pliable

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
will actually lay down it's pliable

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.420 
will actually lay down it's pliable
enough<00:01:53.290> that<00:01:53.440> it<00:01:53.530> will<00:01:53.619> follow<00:01:54.010> the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
enough that it will follow the

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.539 
enough that it will follow the
imperfections<00:01:55.180> of<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.479> drywall<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.920> to<00:01:57.250> even

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
imperfections of the drywall so to even

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.789 
imperfections of the drywall so to even
make<00:01:57.670> it<00:01:57.729> a<00:01:58.229> more<00:01:59.229> of<00:01:59.350> a<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:01.000> a<00:02:01.840> real-life

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
make it a more of a of a real-life

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.380 
make it a more of a of a real-life
situation<00:02:03.490> here

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
situation here

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.109 
situation here
yeah<00:02:06.390> when<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.659> put<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:06.929> thing<00:02:06.990> on<00:02:07.910> you<00:02:08.910> see

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
yeah when you put this thing on you see
