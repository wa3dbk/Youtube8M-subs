00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
biggest difference to these is that

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.950 
biggest difference to these is that
there's<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:52.880> Nike<00:01:53.060> swoosh<00:01:53.360> on<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.720> sides

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
which I don't really mind I think it you

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.270 
which I don't really mind I think it you
know<00:01:56.750> if<00:01:57.080> it<00:01:57.259> wasn't<00:01:57.380> on<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:57.770> shoe<00:01:57.979> it

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.980 
know if it wasn't on the shoe it
definitely<00:01:59.240> looked<00:01:59.390> different<00:01:59.720> but<00:01:59.810> I<00:01:59.840> don't

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
definitely looked different but I don't

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.450 
definitely looked different but I don't
think<00:02:00.170> it<00:02:00.259> makes<00:02:00.409> the<00:02:00.590> shoe<00:02:00.770> only<00:02:01.009> worse<00:02:01.190> or

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
think it makes the shoe only worse or

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.800 
think it makes the shoe only worse or
any<00:02:01.610> better<00:02:04.149> and<00:02:05.149> for<00:02:05.360> anyone<00:02:05.479> that<00:02:05.630> doesn't

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
any better and for anyone that doesn't

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.930 
any better and for anyone that doesn't
you<00:02:06.170> know<00:02:06.229> hadn't<00:02:06.860> had<00:02:06.979> the<00:02:07.070> opportunity<00:02:07.580> to

the same time soft and it's a table to

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.220 
the same time soft and it's a table to
bend<00:02:17.120> fairly<00:02:17.540> easy<00:02:17.750> as<00:02:17.870> why<00:02:18.019> these<00:02:18.080> are

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
bend fairly easy as why these are

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.900 
bend fairly easy as why these are
concerned<00:02:18.920> a<00:02:18.980> pretty<00:02:19.190> good<00:02:19.280> basketball<00:02:19.430> shoe

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
concerned a pretty good basketball shoe

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.530

and<00:02:21.850> I'm<00:02:22.850> going<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.120> sure<00:02:23.239> a<00:02:23.269> lot<00:02:23.390> of<00:02:23.450> people

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
and I'm going to sure a lot of people

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.229 
and I'm going to sure a lot of people
can<00:02:23.810> agree<00:02:23.930> that<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.430> fit<00:02:25.430> of<00:02:25.459> a<00:02:25.640> foamposite

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
can agree that the fit of a foamposite

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.990 
can agree that the fit of a foamposite
on<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.360> feet<00:02:26.570> is<00:02:26.690> very<00:02:26.900> tight<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.380> snug<00:02:28.010> but

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
on the feet is very tight and snug but

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.870 
on the feet is very tight and snug but
uh<00:02:29.200> it's<00:02:30.200> almost<00:02:30.440> like<00:02:30.650> perfect<00:02:31.190> for<00:02:31.340> it<00:02:31.550> free

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
uh it's almost like perfect for it free

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.670 
uh it's almost like perfect for it free
shied<00:02:32.180> I<00:02:32.209> think<00:02:32.630> they<00:02:32.750> fit<00:02:32.959> very<00:02:32.989> true<00:02:33.410> size
