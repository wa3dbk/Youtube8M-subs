00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.809 
I got a mine kotler that means I won't
have<00:03:19.889> to<00:03:20.010> come<00:03:20.130> up<00:03:20.250> here<00:03:20.389> but<00:03:21.389> just<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:22.790> get<00:03:23.790> all

on I'd hit that bottom now come over
here<00:03:31.100> not<00:03:32.100> on<00:03:32.250> their<00:03:33.079> on<00:03:34.079> their<00:03:34.220> you<00:03:35.220> know<00:03:35.340> hit

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
here not on their on their you know hit

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:41.539 
here not on their on their you know hit
the<00:03:35.519> button<00:03:35.609> again<00:03:36.420> and<00:03:39.290> where's<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.549> opening

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
the button again and where's the opening

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.379 
the button again and where's the opening
here<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.209> is<00:03:42.980> that<00:03:43.980> both<00:03:44.760> those<00:03:44.910> buttons<00:03:45.209> would

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
here it is that both those buttons would

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:46.789 
here it is that both those buttons would
have<00:03:45.540> put<00:03:45.660> another<00:03:45.900> mine<00:03:46.109> cart<00:03:46.319> back<00:03:46.470> in<00:03:46.620> there

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
have put another mine cart back in there

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.309 
have put another mine cart back in there
and<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:48.180> collected<00:03:48.600> the<00:03:48.720> ones<00:03:48.870> that<00:03:49.109> were<00:03:49.170> on

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
and I collected the ones that were on

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.890 
and I collected the ones that were on
the<00:03:49.440> pressure<00:03:49.590> plate<00:03:49.680> and<00:03:50.069> so<00:03:50.639> by<00:03:50.970> default<00:03:51.299> it

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
the pressure plate and so by default it

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.319 
the pressure plate and so by default it
just<00:03:52.500> one<00:03:52.709> being<00:03:53.160> removed<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.819> door<00:03:54.180> would

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
just one being removed the door would

00:03:54.329 --> 00:04:01.670 
just one being removed the door would
have<00:03:54.420> gone<00:03:54.560> so<00:03:57.230> sorry<00:03:58.230> um<00:03:58.730> so<00:04:00.049> then<00:04:01.049> you<00:04:01.530> would

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
have gone so sorry um so then you would

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.080 
have gone so sorry um so then you would
come<00:04:01.980> down<00:04:02.130> here<00:04:04.190> and<00:04:05.190> also<00:04:05.669> you<00:04:05.819> can't<00:04:05.970> get

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
come down here and also you can't get

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.180 
come down here and also you can't get
out<00:04:06.209> that<00:04:06.329> way<00:04:06.389> again<00:04:06.750> so<00:04:06.810> just<00:04:07.760> go<00:04:08.760> ahead<00:04:08.790> and

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:17.180 
out that way again so just go ahead and
yeah<00:04:12.079> um<00:04:14.480> couple<00:04:15.480> more<00:04:15.780> features<00:04:16.200> left

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
yeah um couple more features left

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.390 
yeah um couple more features left
uh<00:04:17.450> just<00:04:18.450> you<00:04:18.840> don't<00:04:18.989> as<00:04:19.290> I<00:04:19.530> said<00:04:19.590> before<00:04:19.920> you

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
uh just you don't as I said before you

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.520 
uh just you don't as I said before you
didn't<00:04:20.670> you<00:04:20.910> don't<00:04:21.120> need<00:04:21.269> this<00:04:21.450> you<00:04:21.690> can<00:04:22.320> just

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
didn't you don't need this you can just

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.550 
didn't you don't need this you can just
have<00:04:22.680> this<00:04:22.860> thing<00:04:26.150> so<00:04:27.150> I<00:04:27.480> did<00:04:27.960> things<00:04:28.320> like

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
have this thing so I did things like

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.890 
have this thing so I did things like
this<00:04:31.460> now<00:04:32.460> I'll<00:04:32.550> stand<00:04:32.760> back<00:04:32.910> from<00:04:33.030> it<00:04:33.210> it's

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
this now I'll stand back from it it's

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.190 
this now I'll stand back from it it's
going<00:04:34.110> to<00:04:34.170> happen<00:04:34.970> there<00:04:36.830> okay<00:04:39.020> so<00:04:40.020> you're<00:04:40.170> a

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
going to happen there okay so you're a

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.170 
going to happen there okay so you're a
three-down<00:04:40.880> punch<00:04:41.880> watch<00:04:42.090> where<00:04:42.390> these<00:04:42.570> were

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
three-down punch watch where these were

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:53.810 
three-down punch watch where these were
that<00:04:45.180> make<00:04:45.420> sense<00:04:48.650> and<00:04:51.080> you<00:04:52.080> drop<00:04:52.320> down<00:04:52.820> and

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
that make sense and you drop down and

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.060 
that make sense and you drop down and
you're<00:04:54.600> in<00:04:54.690> this<00:04:54.810> little<00:04:55.080> secret<00:04:55.740> underground

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
you're in this little secret underground

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.710 
you're in this little secret underground
base<00:04:56.900> and<00:04:57.900> you<00:04:58.080> can<00:04:58.200> just<00:04:58.350> walk<00:04:59.040> out<00:04:59.720> same

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
base and you can just walk out same

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.080 
base and you can just walk out same
thing<00:05:00.930> again<00:05:01.610> and<00:05:04.400> this<00:05:05.400> is<00:05:05.550> probably<00:05:05.670> a<00:05:05.880> bit

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
thing again and this is probably a bit

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.710 
thing again and this is probably a bit
harder<00:05:06.420> to<00:05:06.450> reset<00:05:06.960> because<00:05:07.460> but<00:05:08.460> you<00:05:09.240> can<00:05:09.480> just

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
harder to reset because but you can just

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.060 
harder to reset because but you can just
wait<00:05:09.840> five<00:05:10.080> minutes<00:05:10.380> and<00:05:10.590> hope<00:05:10.740> no<00:05:10.920> one<00:05:11.040> comes

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
wait five minutes and hope no one comes

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.590 
wait five minutes and hope no one comes
in<00:05:11.900> that's<00:05:12.950> possibly<00:05:13.950> the<00:05:14.040> way<00:05:14.190> I<00:05:14.220> do<00:05:14.600> that's

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
in that's possibly the way I do that's

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.340 
in that's possibly the way I do that's
just<00:05:15.750> made<00:05:15.990> using<00:05:16.290> this<00:05:17.360> piece<00:05:18.360> of<00:05:18.600> equipment

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.490 

as<00:05:22.350> you<00:05:22.440> can<00:05:22.560> see<00:05:22.650> it's<00:05:22.800> pretty<00:05:23.220> simple<00:05:24.500> no

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
as you can see it's pretty simple no

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.630 
as you can see it's pretty simple no
redstone<00:05:26.040> showing<00:05:27.980> off<00:05:28.980> see<00:05:29.220> on<00:05:29.460> the<00:05:29.610> outside

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
redstone showing off see on the outside

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:36.710 
redstone showing off see on the outside
but<00:05:30.090> yeah<00:05:30.770> so<00:05:31.770> and<00:05:32.010> um<00:05:33.410> yeah<00:05:34.410> I<00:05:35.330> may<00:05:36.330> lack<00:05:36.540> for

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.620 
command block because saying no I that I
hid<00:06:08.580> it<00:06:09.890> because<00:06:10.890> that's<00:06:11.310> the<00:06:12.030> easiest<00:06:12.210> thing
