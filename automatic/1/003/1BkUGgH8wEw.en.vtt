00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.080 
to do is open it up and as you can see
you're<00:01:57.210> very<00:01:57.240> very<00:01:57.810> simplistic<00:01:58.759> it<00:01:59.759> has<00:01:59.939> this

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
you're very very simplistic it has this

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.889 
you're very very simplistic it has this
big<00:02:00.360> green<00:02:01.110> thing<00:02:01.140> here<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.240> yeah<00:02:03.240> it's

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
big green thing here and yeah it's

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.109 
big green thing here and yeah it's
really<00:02:04.170> really<00:02:04.409> easy<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.770> use<00:02:04.829> so<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:06.030> go

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
really really easy to use so you can go

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.150 
really really easy to use so you can go
for<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.450> quick<00:02:06.750> scan<00:02:07.049> which<00:02:07.740> basically<00:02:08.039> just

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
for a quick scan which basically just

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.510 
for a quick scan which basically just
does<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.580> brief<00:02:08.819> scan<00:02:09.289> over<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.590> says<00:02:11.310> their

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
does a brief scan over and says their

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.979 
does a brief scan over and says their
scanner<00:02:11.849> limited<00:02:12.239> number<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.540> sensitive

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
scanner limited number of sensitive

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.550 
scanner limited number of sensitive
location

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
location

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.160 
location
on<00:02:13.739> your<00:02:14.069> Mac<00:02:14.220> so<00:02:14.760> basically<00:02:15.209> all<00:02:15.239> your<00:02:15.540> major

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
on your Mac so basically all your major

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.680 
on your Mac so basically all your major
system<00:02:16.650> files<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.190> stuff<00:02:17.370> like<00:02:17.520> that<00:02:17.630> or<00:02:18.630> you

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
system files and stuff like that or you

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.440 
system files and stuff like that or you
can<00:02:18.780> go<00:02:18.870> for<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.080> full<00:02:19.680> scan<00:02:19.980> which<00:02:20.340> scans<00:02:21.030> every

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
can go for a full scan which scans every

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
can go for a full scan which scans every
single<00:02:21.810> item<00:02:22.680> on<00:02:23.099> your<00:02:23.130> machine<00:02:24.050> now<00:02:25.050> it<00:02:25.319> took

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
single item on your machine now it took

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.010 
single item on your machine now it took
me<00:02:25.650> about<00:02:25.980> half<00:02:26.040> an<00:02:26.520> hour<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:27.180> scan<00:02:27.660> my<00:02:27.690> mac

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
me about half an hour to scan my mac

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.610 
me about half an hour to scan my mac
mini<00:02:28.349> and<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.920> has<00:02:29.130> about<00:02:29.220> eight<00:02:29.489> gigabytes<00:02:29.970> of

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
80 gigabytes in half an hour it's not

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.000 
80 gigabytes in half an hour it's not
too<00:02:37.800> bad<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:38.010> just<00:02:38.310> left<00:02:38.459> my<00:02:38.580> computer<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:40.010> just

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
too bad I just left my computer and just

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
just to select a single file or you know

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.150 
just to select a single file or you know
fold<00:02:50.700> or<00:02:50.850> anything<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.450> scan<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.040> you<00:02:53.040> can

to<00:03:01.650> say<00:03:01.830> i<00:03:01.860> wanted<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.360> scan<00:03:03.360> something<00:03:03.630> that<00:03:03.900> i

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
to say i wanted to scan something that i

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.280 
to say i wanted to scan something that i
thought<00:03:04.230> would<00:03:04.470> be<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:05.519> virus<00:03:06.269> or<00:03:06.510> something<00:03:06.720> so

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
thought would be a virus or something so

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.670

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
thought can twist was a virus just for

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.069 
thought can twist was a virus just for
reference<00:03:17.579> not<00:03:17.940> saying<00:03:18.180> as<00:03:18.269> a<00:03:18.359> virus<00:03:18.630> but<00:03:18.660> if

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
you want to go to there it automatically

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.380 
you want to go to there it automatically
say<00:03:22.290> no<00:03:22.530> effective<00:03:22.950> files<00:03:23.220> found<00:03:23.459> that<00:03:24.030> as<00:03:24.180> if

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
say no effective files found that as if

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.390 
say no effective files found that as if
you're<00:03:24.769> if<00:03:25.769> isn't<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:26.280> vector<00:03:27.030> file<00:03:27.500> so<00:03:28.500> again

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
you're if isn't a vector file so again

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.120 
you're if isn't a vector file so again
you<00:03:29.549> can<00:03:29.700> just<00:03:30.359> do<00:03:30.480> your<00:03:30.660> scans<00:03:31.019> here<00:03:31.260> next<00:03:31.980> one

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
you can just do your scans here next one

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.690 
you can just do your scans here next one
is<00:03:32.280> trusted<00:03:32.850> files<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:33.690> you<00:03:33.720> can<00:03:34.290> simply<00:03:34.980> my

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
is trusted files so you can simply my

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.150 
is trusted files so you can simply my
pleasant<00:03:35.910> find<00:03:36.600> other<00:03:36.780> by<00:03:37.590> pressing<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:37.950> plus

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
pleasant find other by pressing the plus

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.090 
pleasant find other by pressing the plus
there<00:03:38.430> you<00:03:38.850> can<00:03:39.030> select<00:03:39.209> what<00:03:39.569> files<00:03:39.959> you<00:03:40.859> want

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
there you can select what files you want

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.580 
there you can select what files you want
not<00:03:42.060> to<00:03:42.299> be<00:03:42.329> scanned<00:03:42.780> ones<00:03:43.350> that<00:03:43.500> you

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
not to be scanned ones that you

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.610 
not to be scanned ones that you
basically<00:03:43.769> think<00:03:44.280> won't<00:03:45.060> be<00:03:45.269> a<00:03:45.480> infected<00:03:46.380> file

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
basically think won't be a infected file

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.449 
basically think won't be a infected file
so<00:03:47.190> for<00:03:47.370> example<00:03:47.720> here<00:03:48.720> I<00:03:48.959> have<00:03:49.109> school<00:03:49.459> files

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
so for example here I have school files

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.949 
so for example here I have school files
these<00:03:50.760> are<00:03:50.910> all<00:03:51.030> projects<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:51.780> stuff<00:03:51.930> that

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
these are all projects and stuff that

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.770 
these are all projects and stuff that
I've<00:03:52.170> made<00:03:52.380> myself<00:03:52.590> and<00:03:53.010> I<00:03:53.790> doubt<00:03:54.540> that

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
I've made myself and I doubt that

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.180 
I've made myself and I doubt that
there'll<00:03:54.989> be<00:03:56.870> viruses<00:03:57.870> so<00:03:58.410> what<00:03:58.680> do<00:03:58.859> I<00:03:58.889> just

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
there'll be viruses so what do I just

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.580 
there'll be viruses so what do I just
click<00:03:59.370> Add<00:03:59.519> and<00:03:59.760> it<00:04:00.299> won't<00:04:00.540> scan<00:04:00.900> these<00:04:01.139> files

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
click Add and it won't scan these files

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.830 
click Add and it won't scan these files
although<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.310> wouldn't<00:04:02.609> exactly<00:04:02.840> recommend

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
although I wouldn't exactly recommend

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.780 
although I wouldn't exactly recommend
