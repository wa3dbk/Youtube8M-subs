00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
was the IDF profiling see when I worked

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.370 
was the IDF profiling see when I worked
for<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:56.950> UN<00:00:57.370> the<00:00:58.239> whole<00:00:58.510> situation<00:00:58.840> was

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 
for the UN the whole situation was

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.190 
for the UN the whole situation was
different<00:00:59.860> because<00:01:00.030> all<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.360> countries<00:01:01.810> are

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
different because all the countries are

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.319 
different because all the countries are
part<00:01:02.620> of<00:01:02.739> the<00:01:02.890> United<00:01:03.280> Nations<00:01:03.640> so<00:01:03.850> for<00:01:04.119> me

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:04.329 
part of the United Nations so for me

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:08.550 
part of the United Nations so for me
whether<00:01:05.049> I<00:01:05.170> went<00:01:05.409> to<00:01:05.530> Kuwait<00:01:05.880> Iraq<00:01:06.880> I<00:01:07.420> I<00:01:07.840> had<00:01:08.380> to

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
whether I went to Kuwait Iraq I I had to

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.770 
whether I went to Kuwait Iraq I I had to
just<00:01:08.799> document<00:01:09.009> what<00:01:09.520> I<00:01:09.549> saw<00:01:09.880> came<00:01:10.240> back<00:01:10.479> and

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
just document what I saw came back and

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.920 
just document what I saw came back and
it's<00:01:11.680> not<00:01:12.149> the<00:01:13.149> stories<00:01:13.540> were<00:01:13.689> never

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
it's not the stories were never

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.740 
it's not the stories were never
one-sided<00:01:14.860> because<00:01:14.979> I<00:01:15.369> know<00:01:15.790> a<00:01:16.180> lot<00:01:16.210> of<00:01:16.540> my

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
one-sided because I know a lot of my

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.450 
one-sided because I know a lot of my
colleagues<00:01:17.170> or<00:01:17.560> friends<00:01:17.590> who<00:01:18.040> work<00:01:18.250> for

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
colleagues or friends who work for

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.830 
colleagues or friends who work for
different<00:01:18.820> magazines<00:01:18.940> they<00:01:19.330> always<00:01:19.630> said

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
different magazines they always said

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.590 
different magazines they always said
that<00:01:20.470> they<00:01:20.799> had<00:01:20.979> a<00:01:21.010> point<00:01:21.340> of<00:01:21.460> view<00:01:21.520> or<00:01:22.390> the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
that they had a point of view or the

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.899 
that they had a point of view or the
magazine<00:01:22.810> had<00:01:23.229> a<00:01:23.260> point<00:01:23.620> of<00:01:23.770> view<00:01:23.920> and<00:01:24.159> so<00:01:24.670> this

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
magazine had a point of view and so this

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.289 
magazine had a point of view and so this
is<00:01:25.030> where<00:01:25.180> I<00:01:25.210> think<00:01:25.890> UN<00:01:26.890> was<00:01:27.610> very<00:01:28.000> different

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
is where I think UN was very different

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.870 
is where I think UN was very different
for<00:01:28.630> me<00:01:28.780> and<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:31.390> was<00:01:31.600> a<00:01:32.549> strange<00:01:33.549> thing

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
for me and it was a strange thing

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.580 
for me and it was a strange thing
because<00:01:34.210> I<00:01:34.240> always<00:01:34.510> walked<00:01:34.960> a<00:01:35.110> thin<00:01:35.350> line

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
because I always walked a thin line

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.630 
because I always walked a thin line
because<00:01:35.979> no<00:01:36.640> matter<00:01:36.790> where<00:01:37.090> I<00:01:37.119> went<00:01:38.130> both<00:01:39.130> both

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
because no matter where I went both both

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.210 
because no matter where I went both both
the<00:01:39.670> parties<00:01:40.210> were<00:01:40.360> part<00:01:40.630> of<00:01:40.720> the<00:01:40.840> UN<00:01:41.140> my<00:01:41.979> very

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
the parties were part of the UN my very

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.190 
the parties were part of the UN my very
sex<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:42.729> second<00:01:43.090> assignment<00:01:43.360> was<00:01:43.810> the

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
sex the second assignment was the

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.810 
sex the second assignment was the
Vietnamese<00:01:44.770> boat<00:01:44.979> people<00:01:45.040> in<00:01:47.610> Southeast<00:01:48.610> Asia

Vietnamese boat people in Southeast Asia

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.380

picture<00:02:30.849> maybe<00:02:31.030> I<00:02:31.120> should<00:02:31.390> carry<00:02:31.629> her<00:02:31.930> and

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
picture maybe I should carry her and

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.179 
picture maybe I should carry her and
take<00:02:32.829> her<00:02:32.860> into<00:02:33.159> this<00:02:34.079> shelter<00:02:35.079> and<00:02:35.590> there<00:02:36.040> was

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:36.189 
take her into this shelter and there was

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:41.339 
take her into this shelter and there was
a<00:02:36.220> nurse<00:02:36.549> and<00:02:37.480> anyway<00:02:38.519> that<00:02:39.519> night<00:02:40.349> she

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
a nurse and anyway that night she

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.860 
a nurse and anyway that night she
delivered<00:02:41.799> this<00:02:41.950> baby<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.610> next<00:02:43.299> morning<00:02:43.480> she
