working<00:00:10.590> at<00:00:10.860> Yale<00:00:11.010> University<00:00:11.070> I<00:00:11.730> found<00:00:12.000> out

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
working at Yale University I found out

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.509 
working at Yale University I found out
that<00:00:12.300> some<00:00:12.809> genes<00:00:13.170> are<00:00:13.469> patented<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.250> that

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
that some genes are patented and that

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.220 
that some genes are patented and that
you<00:00:14.670> can't<00:00:14.849> do<00:00:15.000> research<00:00:15.299> on<00:00:15.450> them<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.870> you

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
you can't do research on them and you

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.990 
you can't do research on them and you
can't<00:00:16.410> even<00:00:16.500> look<00:00:16.650> at<00:00:16.800> your<00:00:16.890> own<00:00:17.010> genes<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.940> I

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
can't even look at your own genes and I

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.510 
can't even look at your own genes and I
thought<00:00:18.210> what<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:18.510> seems<00:00:18.740> ridiculous<00:00:19.740> the
