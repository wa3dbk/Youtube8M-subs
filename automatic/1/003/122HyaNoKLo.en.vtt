00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.059
 let's do today is to clean some 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:18.020
 brushes as you see I have here two 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.020
 brushes has brought one is 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.740
 It has no markings especially 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.410
 I bought on the sell paradise page and 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:32.520
 They are bad but look how is the tip 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:34.620
 It's all spoiled and full of acrylic 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.830
 the law the second I bought it on the page 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.590
 at 10 point is yes that is kolinski del 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.989
 number 6 and it's okay what happens is that 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.900
 it's like a little displaced and a 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.670
 little bit spoiled there then we're going to 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.890
 need to fix the brushes 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.500
 we are going to need a glass cup 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.140
 to put our liquid employer there 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.630
 of brushes 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.910
 the brush cleaner I use this 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:02.910
 that is 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.820
 brand change in line systems I bought 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.190
 on a pretty cheap page that is 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.869
 they call google.com that to buy 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.990
 products and to start is nothing 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.220
 wrong and then we will use the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.010
 cuticle pusher 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:23.430
 so let's start by throwing a 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.430
 little brush cleaner in the glass 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.240
 it's not a little 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:37.350
 let's take our brushes and they 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.350
 let's put inside 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.679
 you will see that immediately after putting it 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.060
 the bristles of the brush are released 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.890
 heap 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.250
 ok and now let's take a 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.250
 napkin 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.540
 and cleaning the brush on the 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.540
 napkin 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.070
 let's do is clean the brush 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.080
 leave it quite a while and you see that 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.740
 the loss of acrylic is released 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.620
 that had stuck 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:18.310
 it serves you touchis is super loose and 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.910
 clean on the brush 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:25.410
 and let's leave the brush for a while 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.410
 submerged about 10 minutes 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.720
 ok when we've had a little while 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.460
 brush tucked about 10-15 minutes worth 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.190
 you can see that the tip is 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.440
 practically loose let's take the 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.680
 cuticle pusher 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.600
 and we are going to gently push the 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.910
 acrylic that had been stuck 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.830
 this has happened to me because the brush is not 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.230
 of quality and it's not hair with 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.380
 besides, I did not use cleaner before 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.060
 of brushes but he used 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.660
 directly the mold number for 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.660
 clean them 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.570
 Now I'm going to try to take care of a little 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.570
 of my brushes 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:27.390
 Make up as I see that it is clean of 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.880
 acrylic soak and let it take a 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.590
 and while I'm going to take the other 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.140
 brush that I have told you that yes it is the 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.030
 collins brush that this one does not have 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.620
 no acrylic pearls dry what 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.250
 happens is that as it is the first one that is 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.010
 using I had no experience and I did not 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.709
 I have taken too much care because I did not know 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.739
 Well, if the bristles are a bit bad 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:52.920
 it and the other to be dipped 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.580
 colin hair is that it immediately returns to 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.890
 its place 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.280
 then you have to do the same thing what 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.290
 we wet 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.830
 on the napkin we give some 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.830
 passed 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.959
 and then with the cuticle pusher 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.239
 very gently we eliminate any 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.080
 rest of acrylic glitter that 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.080
 may have been left 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.070
 it's worth looking now since I change only with 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.630
 have wet it a little in the liquid 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.630
 brush cleaner 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:49.240
 how is the hair brush collins 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.240
 what 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.560
 once clean the acrylic brushes 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.930
 and of glitter and the remains that 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.820
 have with the brush cleaner 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.169
 we miss 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:06.080
 monomer 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.080
 and here I clean my brushes with monomer 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:13.020
 this one that I'm wetting from 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:16.950
 is the synthetic hair 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.810
 As you can see, it has some hair tips 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.990
 that do not recover as they have 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:25.200
 been elected the tip of colitis 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:29.180
 I put the two together and mojo them a little bit 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.180
 so that they recover their natural form 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.640
 by taking the one with the hair brush with the 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.400
 discriminated that has been well 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.020
 after woman war canvas stays 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.320
 practically as if it were a brush 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.000
 new 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.740
 I already tell you that this is a little 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.820
 spoiled because I did not use it well 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.820
 I was learning 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.060
 and this one is the hair brush 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.350
 synthetic that has also stayed very 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.390
 all right 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:05.330
 before saving the brushes when 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:07.860
 all ye clean of everything is dry 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.770
 a little bit with a napkin 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:13.550
 and do not keep them until they are 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.550
 dry all 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.570
 I hope the video has been helped and 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:19.570
 thanks for watching me as always
