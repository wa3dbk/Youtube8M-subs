00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello very good welcome to all 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.000
 We continue with our extensive review of 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.470
 devices in this wild world congress 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.700
 this time we are with the mediapad 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.290
 Eme 18.0 an 8-inch tablet 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.920
 fairly compact dimensions are 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.920
 processor 4 and well let's see the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.820
 design of the half pack m 18.0 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.220
 indeed you have guessed 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.769
 we have an 8-inch screen 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.930
 The truth is that the design is quite 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.220
 flashy of the game tablet way like 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.170
 you are seeing we found a great 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.719
 screen that occupies much of the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.340
 frontal front camera and one of 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.559
 the things I liked most as 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.480
 you are watching we find the speakers 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.879
 in the front something not very usual 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.620
 and that we like a lot if 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.809
 we review a little bit we see one of the 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.640
 totally smooth songs if we go to the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.800
 another side we find buttons to upload 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.780
 lower volume also to block and 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.570
 unlock the terminal in the part 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.449
 lower we find the micro usb part 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.070
 upper bound for the 3.5 jack and 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.440
 in the back as you see apart the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.809
 screen printing we found the camera 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.610
 main of this device one of the 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.680
 aspects that he had told us 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.520
 most important is the issue of weight in 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.850
 this case we have 30 300 29 grams and so 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.410
 only 78 millimeters thick it 's time to 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.540
 review the explanations of this 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.370
 terminal specifically the processor that 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.220
 move this terminal is a quad core to 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.440
 1.6 gigahertz haik silicon and you 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.720
 accompanies a gig of ram in the aspect of 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.170
 internal storage we find two 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.240
 versions of 8 and 16 gigas and some 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.180
 of the most outstanding things with your 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.800
 extensive 4800 milliampere battery and the 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.009
 possibility as it could not be another 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.210
 connections mode 4g lte the following 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.950
 section is the software as it is 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.110
 saying the base android version 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.869
 upon which this terminal is based 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.240
 is version 4.2 point 2 also 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.009
 known as jelly beans evidently 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.570
 as is usually the case 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.340
 manufacturer has a layer of 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.040
 presentation that as you can see 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.020
 it works above android like 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.180
 you will all know it as you are seeing 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.619
 we can move easily by the 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.600
 desks that also end 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.399
 also the box of applications all 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.500
 Applications and widgets are included 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.490
 in these desks and we do not have 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.200
 a box as such 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.940
 if you can if you want to see we can see 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.120
 also at the top like 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.770
 we have notifications just 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.260
 we must move from the part 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.300
 superior and in addition to this we will have 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.920
 a fast and convenient energy control 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.660
 also in this part of the 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.880
 communications in addition to this also 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.130
 we can manage the multitasking of a 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.260
 very fast mode as you are seeing here 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.940
 we can see all the applications that 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.970
 they are running in the background 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.170
 we just have to move to 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.260
 eliminate them and if we want to study here 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.390
 we will eliminate them all at once as 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.730
 you are seeing the screen of is in one 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.400
 of Huawei is 8 inches use 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.000
 Exact ips technology and resolution 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.590
 are 800 x 1280 something that we commented 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.810
 before and he calls us powerfully 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.640
 the attention is his speakers and in the 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.680
 front that the truth give us a 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.300
 very good listening experience if 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.220
 you want to know the jokes by purges 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.880
 we can say that concretely it is m 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.440
 one has 189 photographic section as 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.100
 you are seeing this time we have the 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.440
 front camera of this one m1 and if we pass 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.250
 to the back the camera more 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.930
 relevant 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.860
 we have a 5 megapixel sensor 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.840
 able to record full hd obviously 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.030
 and as you are seeing the truth the 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.400
 Custom camera application with 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.720
 some really interesting options 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.849
 that you will already know many of you 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.849
 such as the option to access
