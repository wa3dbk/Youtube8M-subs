00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.680
 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.500
 tutorial this time I will explain how 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.070
 put in Spanish the sims 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:16.130
 4 many would happen to me as me 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.680
 download the game and it was multi language 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.500
 but unfortunately I realized that 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.860
 It was in English and it was a good annoyance 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.870
 in the description I leave a link to 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:31.530
 this file the language pack 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:34.590
 and another file on another link that is a 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.300
 tiny file that we need very 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.870
 well we are going to go where 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.930
 let's have the game the folder the game I 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.660
 I have it in the local disk the sims 4 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.760
 very well here where are these four 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.500
 files we're going to stay open the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.989
 language pack 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.809
 we take these two folders and just 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.910
 replace replace the files in the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:03.570
 destination and even replaced and replaced the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.740
 language pack outside out and 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:11.700
 now let's see we enter to install 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:18.000
 we open the folder is and the file that 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:20.340
 bat we drag here here very well I 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.310
 I do not do it because as you can see already 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.909
 I have here the file once dragged 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:31.350
 we would give it to edit 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:35.130
 execute and between these two quotes that 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.189
 is the important thing to explain you have 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.299
 that go to the location is at four 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.759
 game folders and here in the sims 4 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.819
 or the name that your game has 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.729
 dais to copy address as text be 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:53.849
 you have to copy in the way that 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.569
 you want the address of the location of the 

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:59.610
 game and it would simply be to paste here I 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:04.229
 as I already have done it because I get the 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:07.469
 same must wait we close simply 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.190
 you have to do this double click on 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.000
 that 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.250
 we give him to execute 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.410
 that the source is always open 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.860
 original account because if it is not open 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.920
 it will never work 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.440
 we give him there and as you can see he has 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.890
 left this icon on the desktop and that 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:31.700
 means that it is already done totally and 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.760
 perfectly and that is that the game is in 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.770
 There is no more Spanish this we can 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.770
 eliminate because it is not worth at all 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:46.130
 many will open the game from the sims 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.380
 4 launcher opens from here always 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.400
 with the open origin account if not 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:55.730
 game does not work and I do it from the 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.190
 desktop because you already create an access 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.950
 direct and it's simpler and the game already 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:07.440
 I would be totally in Castilian 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:11.240
 if it served you well I'm glad and if you have 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:15.770
 Some doubt ask me and yes 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:19.600
 and if you want then a like and if it improves a 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.600
