00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
intelligent ABS system which means that

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.060 
intelligent ABS system which means that

the vehicle is driving on and adjust the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.260 
the vehicle is driving on and adjust the
way<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.319> ABS<00:01:43.619> system<00:01:43.770> works<00:01:44.399> accordingly<00:01:44.969> and

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
way the ABS system works accordingly and

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.440 
way the ABS system works accordingly and
also<00:01:46.310> there's<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.399> differential<00:01:47.909> lock<00:01:48.119> on<00:01:48.299> this

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
also there's a differential lock on this

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.749 
also there's a differential lock on this
vehicle<00:01:48.659> which<00:01:49.350> means<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:50.100> can<00:01:50.310> drive<00:01:50.549> out<00:01:50.729> of

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
vehicle which means it can drive out of

vehicle which means it can drive out of
sticky<00:01:51.329> situations<00:01:51.509> more<00:01:52.049> easily<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.619> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
sticky situations more easily and the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.109 
sticky situations more easily and the
ABS<00:01:53.069> even<00:01:53.219> works<00:01:53.490> with<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.789> which<00:01:54.000> is

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
ABS even works with that which is

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.109 
ABS even works with that which is
excellent<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.750> we've<00:01:54.869> enough<00:01:55.110> roads<00:01:56.119> that's

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
excellent so we've enough roads that's

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.690 
excellent so we've enough roads that's
right<00:01:57.359> you're<00:01:57.630> not<00:01:57.750> going<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.959> get<00:01:58.049> wheel<00:01:58.259> lock

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
right you're not going to get wheel lock

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.399 
right you're not going to get wheel lock
the<00:01:59.700> other<00:01:59.819> thing<00:02:00.030> we<00:02:00.119> have<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.539> a<00:02:00.600> detachable

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
the other thing we have is a detachable

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.580 
the other thing we have is a detachable
stabilizer<00:02:02.100> bar<00:02:02.399> at<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.670> back<00:02:03.289> now<00:02:04.289> what<00:02:04.409> this

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
stabilizer bar at the back now what this

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.859 
stabilizer bar at the back now what this
does<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.159> gives<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.520> very<00:02:05.759> stable<00:02:06.149> on-road

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
does is it gives you very stable on-road

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.859 
does is it gives you very stable on-road
performance<00:02:06.929> so<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.039> reduces<00:02:08.459> body<00:02:08.640> roll<00:02:09.000> but

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
performance so it reduces body roll but

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.050 
performance so it reduces body roll but
off<00:02:10.170> road<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.890> can<00:02:11.039> detach<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.370> stabilizer

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
off road you can detach that stabilizer

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.120 
off road you can detach that stabilizer
bar<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.569> get<00:02:12.690> much<00:02:12.900> more<00:02:13.170> axle<00:02:13.920> articulation

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
bar and get much more axle articulation
