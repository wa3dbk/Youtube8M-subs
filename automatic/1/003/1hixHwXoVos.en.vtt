00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
to get us up in the top 35 and once that

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.840 
to get us up in the top 35 and once that
happens<00:04:41.530> you<00:04:42.070> know<00:04:42.160> it's<00:04:42.370> a<00:04:42.430> whole<00:04:42.550> different

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
happens you know it's a whole different

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.090 
happens you know it's a whole different
story<00:04:42.910> and<00:04:43.240> then<00:04:43.390> we<00:04:43.480> can<00:04:43.630> race<00:04:43.780> and<00:04:44.230> and<00:04:44.530> work

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
story and then we can race and and work

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.890 
story and then we can race and and work
on<00:04:45.280> different<00:04:45.820> things<00:04:46.000> to<00:04:46.300> get<00:04:46.419> better<00:04:46.630> and

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
on different things to get better and

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.570 
on different things to get better and
but<00:04:47.200> right<00:04:47.320> now<00:04:47.470> our<00:04:47.500> focus<00:04:47.650> just<00:04:48.070> qualifying

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
but right now our focus just qualifying

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.790 
but right now our focus just qualifying
qualifying<00:04:49.000> fall<00:04:49.210> fine<00:04:49.419> and<00:04:49.630> then<00:04:49.750> go<00:04:50.710> from

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
qualifying fall fine and then go from

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.750 
qualifying fall fine and then go from
there<00:04:50.950> hopefully<00:04:51.160> we'll<00:04:51.370> be<00:04:51.460> good<00:04:51.580> enough<00:04:51.700> to

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
there hopefully we'll be good enough to

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.909 
there hopefully we'll be good enough to
be<00:04:52.030> in<00:04:52.330> in<00:04:52.660> order<00:04:52.900> to<00:04:52.990> make<00:04:53.140> the<00:04:53.260> top<00:04:53.410> 35<00:04:53.680> you
