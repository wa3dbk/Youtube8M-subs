racing<00:00:26.850> is<00:00:27.539> much<00:00:28.080> closer<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.890> standard

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:29.850 
racing is much closer to a standard

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
endless runner it's you know it looks

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.200 
endless runner it's you know it looks
pretty<00:00:40.260> similar<00:00:40.469> though<00:00:40.710> right<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.219> mean<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
pretty similar though right I mean the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.900 
pretty similar though right I mean the
visuals<00:00:42.750> look<00:00:42.899> kind<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.230> same<00:00:43.290> the

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
visuals look kind of the same the

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.940 
visuals look kind of the same the
aesthetic<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.770> backgrounds<00:00:46.770> and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
aesthetic and backgrounds and

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.410 
aesthetic and backgrounds and
environments<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.790> you're<00:00:47.910> driving<00:00:48.270> around

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
environments that you're driving around

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.630 
environments that you're driving around
looked<00:00:48.690> quite<00:00:49.020> similar<00:00:49.469> as<00:00:49.590> well<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.010> indeed

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
looked quite similar as well and indeed

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.500 
looked quite similar as well and indeed
the<00:00:51.239> main<00:00:51.420> racer<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.309> know<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.550> can<00:00:54.059> see<00:00:54.270> here

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
the main racer you know you can see here

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.139 
the main racer you know you can see here
same<00:00:55.200> character<00:00:55.620> or<00:00:56.550> at<00:00:56.640> least<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:56.879> believe

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
same character or at least I believe

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.689 
same character or at least I believe
it's<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.450> same<00:00:57.480> character<00:00:58.110> and<00:00:58.370> I<00:00:59.370> think<00:00:59.399> it's

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
it's the same character and I think it's

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.540 
it's the same character and I think it's
even<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.000> same<00:01:00.090> truck<00:01:00.840> but<00:01:01.710> that's<00:01:02.190> actually

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
even the same truck but that's actually

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.149 
even the same truck but that's actually
totally<00:01:02.969> okay<00:01:03.480> because<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.469> know<00:01:04.499> what<00:01:04.589> beach

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
totally okay because you know what beach

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.550 
totally okay because you know what beach
buggy<00:01:05.369> racing<00:01:05.880> feels<00:01:06.689> really<00:01:06.990> really<00:01:07.170> good<00:01:07.350> I

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
buggy racing feels really really good I

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.230 
buggy racing feels really really good I
think<00:01:08.039> it<00:01:08.130> feels<00:01:08.340> really<00:01:08.490> really<00:01:08.700> good<00:01:08.789> anyway

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
think it feels really really good anyway

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.519 
think it feels really really good anyway
so<00:01:09.299> I've<00:01:09.749> been<00:01:09.840> playing<00:01:10.020> this<00:01:10.170> for<00:01:10.319> a<00:01:10.350> little

00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:10.529 
so I've been playing this for a little

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:11.840 
so I've been playing this for a little
while<00:01:10.679> now<00:01:10.829> I'm<00:01:10.950> doing<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.219> review<00:01:11.490> over<00:01:11.520> on

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
while now I'm doing a review over on

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.699 
while now I'm doing a review over on
Pocket<00:01:12.209> Gamer<00:01:12.359> code<00:01:12.840> at<00:01:12.929> UK<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:15.709> honestly

Pocket Gamer code at UK and honestly
it's<00:01:17.149> it<00:01:18.149> just<00:01:18.179> feels<00:01:18.659> really<00:01:19.289> right<00:01:19.590> from<00:01:20.490> the

00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:20.639 
it's it just feels really right from the

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:22.459 
it's it just feels really right from the
I<00:01:20.939> don't<00:01:21.420> know<00:01:21.479> an<00:01:21.659> hour<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> bit<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.380> I've

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:22.469 
I don't know an hour and a bit that I've

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:24.949 
I don't know an hour and a bit that I've
probably<00:01:22.649> put<00:01:22.920> into<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.279> so<00:01:23.429> far<00:01:23.719> it<00:01:24.719> feels

00:01:24.949 --> 00:01:24.959 
probably put into it so far it feels

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:30.440 
probably put into it so far it feels
right<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.469> so<00:01:25.740> much<00:01:25.889> as<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:28.579> physics<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
right in so much as the physics of the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.230 
right in so much as the physics of the
racing<00:01:30.899> feel<00:01:31.200> floaty<00:01:31.679> but<00:01:32.249> responsive<00:01:32.880> at<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
racing feel floaty but responsive at the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.929 
racing feel floaty but responsive at the
same<00:01:33.450> time<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:35.630> upgrade<00:01:36.630> path<00:01:36.990> feels<00:01:37.709> like<00:01:38.369> it

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
same time the upgrade path feels like it

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.879 
same time the upgrade path feels like it
actually<00:01:39.149> makes<00:01:39.569> a<00:01:39.810> difference<00:01:40.319> to<00:01:40.649> the<00:01:40.740> game

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:40.889 
actually makes a difference to the game

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:42.830 
actually makes a difference to the game
that<00:01:41.099> you're<00:01:41.159> playing<00:01:41.219> so<00:01:41.729> your<00:01:42.209> vehicle<00:01:42.599> does

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
that you're playing so your vehicle does

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.370 
that you're playing so your vehicle does
feel<00:01:43.649> like<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.340> actually<00:01:44.749> gets<00:01:45.749> better<00:01:45.989> as<00:01:46.319> you

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
feel like it actually gets better as you

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.979 
feel like it actually gets better as you
upgrade<00:01:46.919> it<00:01:47.340> unlike<00:01:47.819> you<00:01:47.969> know<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.389> lot<00:01:48.869> of

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:48.989 
upgrade it unlike you know a lot of

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:51.019 
upgrade it unlike you know a lot of
free-to-play<00:01:49.560> racing<00:01:50.009> games<00:01:50.219> where<00:01:50.909> it's

00:01:51.019 --> 00:01:51.029 
free-to-play racing games where it's

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:53.449 
free-to-play racing games where it's

just it just I don't know it feels like

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:54.979 
just it just I don't know it feels like
you<00:01:53.549> have<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.789> cross<00:01:54.419> a<00:01:54.450> certain<00:01:54.810> threshold

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:54.989 
you have to cross a certain threshold

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:56.690 
you have to cross a certain threshold
before<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.859> actually<00:01:56.009> feel<00:01:56.309> like<00:01:56.340> you're

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
before you actually feel like you're

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.580 
before you actually feel like you're
getting<00:01:57.179> some<00:01:57.569> you<00:01:57.779> know<00:01:57.929> getting<00:01:58.229> somewhere

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
getting some you know getting somewhere

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.779 
getting some you know getting somewhere
whereas<00:01:58.919> with<00:01:59.099> this<00:01:59.219> one<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.489> feels<00:01:59.520> like

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
whereas with this one it feels like

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:05.089 
whereas with this one it feels like
every<00:02:00.239> single<00:02:00.419> upgrade<00:02:00.929> matters<00:02:02.149> and<00:02:04.099> you

00:02:05.089 --> 00:02:05.099 
every single upgrade matters and you
