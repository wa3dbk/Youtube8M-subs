00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
sexiness or sex appeal is directly

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.699 
sexiness or sex appeal is directly
correlated<00:02:17.370> with<00:02:17.930> confidence<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.170> self

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
correlated with confidence and self

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.670 
correlated with confidence and self
confidence<00:02:19.740> and<00:02:20.280> self-esteem<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:21.680> it

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
confidence and self-esteem and it

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.500 
confidence and self-esteem and it
followed<00:02:23.040> if<00:02:23.190> you're<00:02:23.520> if<00:02:24.000> you're<00:02:24.150> not<00:02:24.300> so

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
followed if you're if you're not so

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.460 
followed if you're if you're not so
confident<00:02:24.990> in<00:02:25.140> your<00:02:26.010> self-esteem<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.730> low
