00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:09.150
 good afternoon my dear visitors 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.849
 channel today i want to start shooting 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.160
 a series of small video stories about 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.490
 making joinery we 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.750
 received an order for the manufacture of a corner 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.760
 such a bouquet of high 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.130
 the lower part of which was closed 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.400
 the top will be glazed here 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.010
 such a small worker drawing it 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.540
 bouquet all other calculations are done in 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.690
 notebooks and we set about preparing 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.879
 the making means buffet should be 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.050
 made entirely of oak 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.500
 but in agreement with the customer on 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.200
 bottom of the bottom and frame 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.920
 going here you see them now 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:55.469
 reaching to the bottom like carrier 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.149
 skeleton construction made from ki world 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.160
 in order to lighten the overall weight 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.899
 buffet floors in the room where he goes they 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.670
 stand on wooden beams that is 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.439
 the foundation of concrete lift no therefore 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.530
 the total weight of the buffet decided to reduce 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.070
 also on the upper part are made two here 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.560
 such here 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.310
 oak bottom which will also 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:21.600
 so interconnect 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:26.909
 tanks here below you will see the sides on the bottom 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:31.409
 part and sides on top of the top 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:35.310
 the part must be behind the mirror 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.670
 the wall so here's taken two made here 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.400
 there are two such frames now 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.049
 mirror why in this frame jumper 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:51.149
 I will explain later when it is collected 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:53.250
 whole these this buffer also 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.890
 already prepared in advance 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.729
 Here is such a tabletop so far this 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.969
 tabletop frame only 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:05.490
 why is the tabletop glued in this way 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.860
 I explain practically most of it for 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.330
 except for the front 10 centimeters 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:17.920
 will be closed standing on this countertop 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:21.430
 top of the buffet and similar 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:25.450
 construction bonding from a ladder 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.460
 allows us to avoid certain 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.760
 moments of the ship is not 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:33.490
 to the tabletop itself, well, it is attached 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.400
 of course there will be a code for the upper frames 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.350
 bottom of the buffet 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.050
 using special bosses so 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.460
 called floating method about which 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:48.420
 told in one of my articles on 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:52.960
 your prian.ru 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:55.950
 wait for the continuation of the story about 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:59.520
 making this glazed 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.520
 such a buffet
