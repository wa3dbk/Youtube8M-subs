instructions on how to make a motorcycle
this<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.690> same<00:00:06.899> shape<00:00:07.230> of<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.529> motorcycle

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
this is the same shape of the motorcycle

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.410 
this is the same shape of the motorcycle
it<00:00:08.160> just<00:00:08.370> comes<00:00:08.550> together<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:09.030> little<00:00:09.300> bit

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
it just comes together a little bit

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.200 
it just comes together a little bit
differently<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:10.139> little<00:00:10.620> bit<00:00:10.950> quicker<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.519> I

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
differently a little bit quicker and I

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.810 
differently a little bit quicker and I
definitely<00:00:12.360> got<00:00:12.929> was<00:00:13.590> thinking<00:00:13.950> about<00:00:14.099> this

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
definitely got was thinking about this

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.480 
definitely got was thinking about this

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
anyway I will use two different colors

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.400 
anyway I will use two different colors
of<00:00:34.550> balloon<00:00:35.550> just<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.210> see<00:00:36.360> how<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.290> all

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
of balloon just so you see how it all

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.630 
of balloon just so you see how it all
works<00:00:41.690> I'm<00:00:42.690> going<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.110> balloons<00:00:43.350> know<00:00:44.250> how

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
works I'm going to balloons know how

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.000 
works I'm going to balloons know how
much<00:00:44.789> air<00:00:45.000> did<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.239> leave<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:46.110> left<00:00:46.500> quite<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.800> bit

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
much air did I leave I left quite a bit

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.400 
much air did I leave I left quite a bit
of<00:00:47.129> air<00:00:47.280> on<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.329> maybe<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.050> should<00:00:49.320> have

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
of air on that and maybe I should have

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.170 
of air on that and maybe I should have
left<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.710> little<00:00:49.890> bit<00:00:50.039> less<00:00:50.250> on<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.910> but

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
left a little bit less on this but

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.930 
left a little bit less on this but
anyway<00:00:51.860> so<00:00:52.860> we're<00:00:52.980> gonna<00:00:53.070> do<00:00:53.280> two<00:00:53.460> faced<00:00:53.670> with

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
anyway so we're gonna do two faced with

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:13.480 
anyway so we're gonna do two faced with
two<00:00:54.870> fingers<00:00:55.230> right<00:00:55.260> there<00:01:10.790> so<00:01:11.790> these<00:01:12.479> two<00:01:12.869> are

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
two fingers right there so these two are

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.090 
two fingers right there so these two are
right<00:01:14.490> there<00:01:15.110> now<00:01:16.110> we're<00:01:16.259> going<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.560> take<00:01:16.770> one

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
right there now we're going to take one

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.260 
right there now we're going to take one
of<00:01:17.250> these<00:01:17.369> balloons<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.939> I'll<00:01:18.090> use<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.420> one

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
of these balloons and I'll use this one

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.810 
of these balloons and I'll use this one
that<00:01:21.270> will<00:01:22.020> eventually<00:01:22.830> we'll<00:01:23.340> put<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.610> tire

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
that will eventually we'll put the tire

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.800 
that will eventually we'll put the tire
over<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.479> part<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.080> we<00:01:25.290> are<00:01:25.500> right<00:01:26.040> there<00:01:26.810> now

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
over that part so we are right there now

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.410 
over that part so we are right there now
I'm<00:01:27.960> going<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.320> do<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:28.950> part<00:01:29.369> with<00:01:29.640> two<00:01:29.909> pinch

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
I'm going to do this part with two pinch

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.499 
I'm going to do this part with two pinch
twist<00:01:30.659> then<00:01:31.439> we'll<00:01:31.619> do<00:01:31.740> right<00:01:32.610> along<00:01:32.880> here<00:01:33.329> and

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
twist then we'll do right along here and

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:45.730 
twist then we'll do right along here and
two<00:01:33.869> pinch<00:01:34.140> twist<00:01:34.350> okay<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.430> vote<00:01:36.030> for<00:01:36.060> fingers

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:58.040 

then<00:01:46.850> fingers<00:01:49.460> to<00:01:50.460> move<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.910> Swiss<00:01:56.810> now<00:01:57.810> this

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
then fingers to move in Swiss now this

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.880 
then fingers to move in Swiss now this
part<00:01:58.440> will<00:01:58.710> go<00:01:59.190> up<00:01:59.370> to<00:01:59.520> be<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.640> handlebar

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
part will go up to be a handlebar

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.200 
part will go up to be a handlebar
because<00:02:01.890> we<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:02.250> less<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.640> blue<00:02:02.820> because

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
because we have less of the blue because

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.470 
because we have less of the blue because
we<00:02:03.240> use<00:02:03.480> some<00:02:03.690> of<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.930> here<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:05.060> that's<00:02:06.060> pretty

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
we use some of it here so that's pretty

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.590 
we use some of it here so that's pretty
much<00:02:06.600> where<00:02:07.140> we<00:02:07.380> are<00:02:07.740> we've<00:02:08.100> got<00:02:08.280> this<00:02:09.000> done<00:02:09.330> in

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
much where we are we've got this done in

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.999 
much where we are we've got this done in
here<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.110> there<00:02:10.290> and<00:02:10.410> now<00:02:10.470> we're<00:02:10.679> going<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.890> go

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
here and there and now we're going to go

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.720 
here and there and now we're going to go
down<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.700> ports<00:02:12.120> with<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.959> red<00:02:13.530> coloring<00:02:14.100> so

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
down the ports with the red coloring so

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.090 
down the ports with the red coloring so
it's<00:02:14.940> usually<00:02:15.090> best<00:02:15.480> about<00:02:16.080> two<00:02:16.350> fingers<00:02:16.770> and

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
it's usually best about two fingers and

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.440 
it's usually best about two fingers and
then<00:02:17.390> pinch<00:02:18.390> twist<00:02:19.310> then<00:02:20.310> another<00:02:21.000> piece

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
then pinch twist then another piece

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.490 
then pinch twist then another piece
quick<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.790> then<00:02:27.660> we'll<00:02:27.750> do<00:02:27.900> about<00:02:28.140> three

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
quick and then we'll do about three

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:37.670 
quick and then we'll do about three
fingers<00:02:29.270> three<00:02:30.270> fingers<00:02:30.300> again<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:37.500> looks

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
fingers three fingers again and it looks

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.140 
fingers three fingers again and it looks
like<00:02:37.770> I<00:02:38.010> should<00:02:38.250> have<00:02:38.310> given<00:02:38.610> myself<00:02:38.760> but<00:02:39.120> just

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
like I should have given myself but just

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.140 
like I should have given myself but just
a<00:02:39.540> little<00:02:39.720> bit<00:02:39.870> more<00:02:40.170> space<00:02:40.500> but<00:02:40.890> go<00:02:41.490> with<00:02:41.730> what

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
a little bit more space but go with what

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.360 
a little bit more space but go with what
we<00:02:42.300> have<00:02:42.480> another<00:02:43.290> bubble<00:02:43.620> we<00:02:43.950> could<00:02:44.160> walk

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
we have another bubble we could walk

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.250 
we have another bubble we could walk
alongside<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:46.250> wrap<00:02:47.250> around<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:49.050> front

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
alongside and wrap around to the front

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.840 
alongside and wrap around to the front
of<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.860> porters<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:51.739> little<00:02:52.739> bit<00:02:52.860> of<00:02:52.950> Air<00:02:53.100> Force

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
of the porters a little bit of Air Force
