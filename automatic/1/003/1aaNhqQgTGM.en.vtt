and<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.430> never<00:01:35.610> heard<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.060> before<00:01:36.390> so<00:01:36.600> I

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
and I never heard of it before so I

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.660 
and I never heard of it before so I
decided<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.229> go<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.680> see<00:01:37.770> what<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.369> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
decided to go and see what that is the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.609 
decided to go and see what that is the
judges<00:01:39.150> were<00:01:39.329> impressed<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:40.049> noted<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.500> her

I'm<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> girl<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.189> science<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.850> that's<00:02:03.240> great

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
I'm a girl in science and that's great

and a lot more girls are getting into

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.249 
and a lot more girls are getting into
science<00:02:05.219> but<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.240> think<00:02:06.570> there's<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.990> lot<00:02:07.140> of

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
science but I think there's a lot of
