00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
until I can get a gasket for that I

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.430 
until I can get a gasket for that I
decided<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.360> know<00:00:54.449> what<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:54.870> got<00:00:54.960> virtually

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
decided you know what it's got virtually

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.650 
decided you know what it's got virtually
the<00:00:55.559> same<00:00:55.590> piece<00:00:56.070> here<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.210> went<00:00:57.390> ahead<00:00:57.449> and

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
the same piece here so I went ahead and

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.529 
the same piece here so I went ahead and
pulled<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.960> burner<00:00:58.170> plate<00:00:58.500> out<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.510> put<00:01:00.510> it

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
pulled the burner plate out of it put it

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.740 
pulled the burner plate out of it put it
into<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> World<00:01:01.260> War<00:01:01.440> two<00:01:01.649> vintage<00:01:01.859> stove

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.830 

anyways<00:01:07.130> I've<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.580> pumped<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.330> up<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.510> little<00:01:09.600> bit

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
anyways I've I pumped it up a little bit

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.510 
anyways I've I pumped it up a little bit
kind<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.260> figured<00:01:10.530> out<00:01:10.650> what<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.070> how<00:01:11.460> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
kind of figured out what the how the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.109 
kind of figured out what the how the
controls<00:01:11.939> work<00:01:12.060> best<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.080> could<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:14.119> we're

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
controls work best I could and we're

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.850 
controls work best I could and we're
gonna<00:01:15.210> try<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> test<00:01:15.900> fire<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.680> will<00:01:16.799> be

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
gonna try a test fire so this will be

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.420 
gonna try a test fire so this will be
the<00:01:16.979> first<00:01:18.409> listen<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.530> dust<00:01:19.830> off<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.100> here

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
the first listen the dust off it here

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.950 
the first listen the dust off it here
this<00:01:20.549> will<00:01:20.610> be<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> first<00:01:21.119> test<00:01:21.360> firing<00:01:21.869> of

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
this will be the first test firing of

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.719 
this will be the first test firing of
this<00:01:22.080> stove<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:23.720> literally<00:01:25.369> probably<00:01:26.369> thirty

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
this stove in literally probably thirty

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.539 
this stove in literally probably thirty
five<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.119> forty<00:01:27.299> years<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:28.140> know<00:01:28.890> my<00:01:29.009> dad<00:01:29.189> had<00:01:29.430> it

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
five to forty years I know my dad had it

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.760 
five to forty years I know my dad had it
for<00:01:29.729> years<00:01:29.759> before<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.479> ever<00:01:30.689> got<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.560> had

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
for years before I ever got it and I had

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.710 
for years before I ever got it and I had
it<00:01:31.950> for<00:01:33.320> 15<00:01:34.320> years<00:01:34.860> longer<00:01:36.320> anyways<00:01:37.320> i<00:01:38.720> per

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
it for 15 years longer anyways i per

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.350 
it for 15 years longer anyways i per
instruction<00:01:40.320> for<00:01:40.500> pumping<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.860> up<00:01:40.950> here<00:01:41.159> I

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
instruction for pumping it up here I

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.270 
instruction for pumping it up here I
primed<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:43.020> pumping<00:01:43.680> mechanism<00:01:43.710> which

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
primed the pumping mechanism which

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.010 
primed the pumping mechanism which
actually<00:01:44.670> seemed<00:01:44.909> okay<00:01:45.329> but<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.630> did<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:45.990> a

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
actually seemed okay but I did have a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:02:01.090 
actually seemed okay but I did have a
little<00:01:46.229> bit<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:59.390> went<00:02:00.390> ahead<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.630> used

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
little bit of I went ahead and used

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.179 
little bit of I went ahead and used
Coleman<00:02:02.100> white<00:02:02.310> gas<00:02:03.229> now<00:02:04.229> here's<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.740> kind<00:02:05.130> of

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
Coleman white gas now here's the kind of

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.719 
Coleman white gas now here's the kind of
woman<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.790> truth<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.799> refilled<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.950> tank<00:02:08.250> and

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
woman the truth I refilled the tank and

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.869 
woman the truth I refilled the tank and
I<00:02:08.849> replaced<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.420> gas<00:02:09.629> cap<00:02:09.959> here<00:02:10.229> with<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.129> cap

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
I replaced the gas cap here with a cap

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.520 
I replaced the gas cap here with a cap
from<00:02:12.060> another<00:02:12.330> stove<00:02:12.629> this<00:02:13.020> had<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.290> older

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
from another stove this had the older

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.830 
from another stove this had the older
two

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
two

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.979 
two
pease<00:02:13.989> style<00:02:14.319> cap<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.860> gasket<00:02:15.280> was<00:02:15.340> shot

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
pease style cap the gasket was shot

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.089 
pease style cap the gasket was shot
threads<00:02:16.989> were<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.260> same<00:02:17.470> though<00:02:17.680> went<00:02:17.920> right

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
threads were the same though went right

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.890 
threads were the same though went right
on<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:18.700> it's<00:02:19.090> holding<00:02:19.209> pressure<00:02:21.660> there<00:02:22.660> isn't

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
on so it's holding pressure there isn't

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.400 
on so it's holding pressure there isn't
any<00:02:23.200> real<00:02:23.560> lighting<00:02:23.950> instructions<00:02:24.519> here<00:02:24.790> I

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
any real lighting instructions here I

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.540 
any real lighting instructions here I
figured<00:02:26.410> out<00:02:26.500> after<00:02:26.680> fiddling<00:02:27.129> around<00:02:27.250> with

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
figured out after fiddling around with

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.770 
figured out after fiddling around with
it<00:02:27.670> but<00:02:27.700> this<00:02:27.940> apparently<00:02:28.300> needs<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.599> be<00:02:28.690> in

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
it but this apparently needs to be in

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.539 
it but this apparently needs to be in
the<00:02:28.870> down<00:02:29.080> position<00:02:29.110> in<00:02:30.010> order<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.340> get<00:02:30.459> the

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
the down position in order to get the

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.640 
the down position in order to get the
air<00:02:30.670> flow<00:02:30.940> through<00:02:31.150> there<00:02:31.360> I<00:02:31.569> did<00:02:32.290> do<00:02:32.410> kind<00:02:32.620> of

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
air flow through there I did do kind of

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.949 
air flow through there I did do kind of
a<00:02:32.739> test<00:02:32.980> run<00:02:33.069> with<00:02:33.190> just<00:02:33.519> air<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:34.090> again<00:02:34.840> we're

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
a test run with just air and again we're

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.339 
a test run with just air and again we're
gonna<00:02:35.019> go<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.319> the<00:02:35.379> gas<00:02:35.590> here<00:02:36.209> it<00:02:37.209> says<00:02:37.420> 1/4

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
gonna go to the gas here it says 1/4

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:46.020
