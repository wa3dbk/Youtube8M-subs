00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:06.430

 ah 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.330
 can fan 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.320
 the name is AndrÃ© and original juice 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.200
 xalapa veracruz and current office is 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:37.020
 tattoo artist as I also do a bit of 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.020
 airbrush sculpture and painting 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.050
 10 years ago 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:53.640
 index is everything to my family 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.640
 treating my friends 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.960
 in the street practically I do not work 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.260
 in a studio because my craft first 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:10.080
 It was the sculptor then I had 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.080
 to work to get out for the material 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.640
 visit stores in Mexico but it's very 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.300
 scant information cost me a lot 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.370
 work be 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.260
 now it is when it is a very 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:27.760
 beautiful 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.650
 I wanted with days you learn a lot what 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.710
 Tattoo is important as you 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.830
 you say no, it's not that we have levels 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.280
 true 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.200
 but you see a tattoo artist when it's 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.170
 tattooed truth and he wants to grab it from 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.770
 filled to other people who treat you in 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.770
 home 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:52.270
 and they look for you and they do not have the material 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.940
 necessary to act on hygiene 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.680
 then from there you can classify not 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.770
 a tattoo artist 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.520
 in fact that is with all its bases as 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.719
 hygiene 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:10.759
 and knowledge in styles then there 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.759
 it's how we can 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.069
 but no 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:48.530
 and so 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:53.060
 I started with a tattooist is called 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.129
 Jesus called Galvan he was nicknamed but he is 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.129
 well known and he is one of the old 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:01.630
 Mexico school from here then 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:03.580
 I wanted good hands because 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.720
 he taught me many things we say 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.720
 that he was one of my teachers 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:16.819
 then I went to work with the gut on 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.819
 that hair tattoos with hell 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.310
 they are times with experiences that 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.349
 they helped me a lot I thank you 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.340
 them because they opened the doors for me 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.340
 as a person 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.520
 It's very cool that they know what 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:44.130
 the tattoo and later they too 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.130
 I would like to open my store 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:51.590
 and expose my paintings truth all 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:54.480
 that what I do I want to expose 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.720
 Just because 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.710
 Well, these paintings also I like 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:05.550
 that's what this is my job here 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:07.340
 like my family 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.569
 so 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.799
 and this is where I'm going 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:17.250
 take some money to keep 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:20.280
 because the paintings are not given away there 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.820
 than buying them and the paintings do not 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.450
 move from there if I do not sell them 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.980
 but I want to expose them on my own 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.700
 store 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.910
 galleries a little bit more 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.610
 bigger for you 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.650
 I can not sell the truth for people 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.510
 What do you want to do tattoos? 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.969
 I recommend that 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.219
 look for portfolios 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:47.969
 and that they are true, because 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:50.639
 now people with with technology 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:53.459
 you enter a store and they teach you 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:55.349
 jobs that are not theirs teach 

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:57.709
 very good jobs and when you leave the 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.709
 store 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:06.770
 I recommend that you meet the artist 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:10.950
 that deals with him and what 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:13.140
 your true work true 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.689
 and prices that do not worry about 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:20.419
 what 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:23.569
 a lot of people build that is expensive to 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:26.959
 that debunked the goal had with the cheap 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:30.909
 not then a good suit you're going to 

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:30.909
 dedicate is not only for life 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.360
 and that is not erased anymore, it is erased but 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.510
 the deleted is more expensive than the 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.820
 tattooed no 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.100
 I recommend that you look for me 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.150
 why 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:47.220
 and see a good tattoo 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.970
 and a good experience because we 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.970
 of an experience 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.770
 opera days 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:11.090
 the day by day sound check software 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.090
 as I thought
