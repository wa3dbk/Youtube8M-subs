so<00:00:00.390> if<00:00:00.570> we<00:00:00.750> know<00:00:00.960> that<00:00:00.989> our<00:00:01.260> body<00:00:01.469> is<00:00:01.589> acidic<00:00:02.129> is

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
so if we know that our body is acidic is

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.460 
so if we know that our body is acidic is
too<00:00:02.639> acidic<00:00:02.760> how<00:00:03.270> quickly<00:00:03.570> can<00:00:03.870> we<00:00:03.929> turn<00:00:04.319> that

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
too acidic how quickly can we turn that

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.349 
too acidic how quickly can we turn that
around<00:00:04.529> and<00:00:05.100> change<00:00:05.460> that<00:00:05.700> you<00:00:05.940> know<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.150> body

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
around and change that you know the body

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.200 
around and change that you know the body
is<00:00:06.540> very<00:00:06.810> forgiving<00:00:07.410> in<00:00:07.710> fact<00:00:08.429> in<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.000> world

of<00:00:09.389> epigenetics<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:10.920> can<00:00:11.099> change<00:00:11.429> the

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
of epigenetics you can change the

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.060 
of epigenetics you can change the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
clustered together you see water has a

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
molecule h2o but when you're drinking

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.199

drinking 20 to 40 h2o molecules that are
all<00:02:33.360> clustered<00:02:33.870> together<00:02:33.989> so<00:02:34.319> when<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.560> drink

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
all clustered together so when you drink

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.860 
all clustered together so when you drink
water<00:02:34.920> for<00:02:35.459> people<00:02:35.730> who<00:02:36.239> have<00:02:36.390> problems

drinking<00:02:37.410> water<00:02:37.709> it<00:02:38.190> feels<00:02:38.370> heavy<00:02:38.730> when<00:02:39.120> they

drinking water it feels heavy when they
drink<00:02:40.019> it<00:02:40.140> is<00:02:40.230> because<00:02:40.560> it's<00:02:40.739> all<00:02:41.010> clustered

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
drink it is because it's all clustered

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.180 
drink it is because it's all clustered
together<00:02:41.940> can't<00:02:42.420> permeate<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.170> cell<00:02:43.410> can't

together can't permeate the cell can't
permeate<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.760> membranes<00:02:45.269> so<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.140> want<00:02:46.560> to

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
permeate the membranes so you want to

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.009 
permeate the membranes so you want to

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
have a functionally structured water

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.830 
have a functionally structured water
where<00:02:49.920> we<00:02:49.950> split<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.610> water<00:02:50.819> apart<00:02:51.269> into<00:02:51.810> a

the<00:05:03.150> watermark<00:05:04.110> and<00:05:04.410> I<00:05:05.250> I<00:05:05.760> wanted<00:05:06.180> to<00:05:06.300> create

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
the watermark and I I wanted to create

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.300 
the watermark and I I wanted to create
something<00:05:06.660> that<00:05:07.020> was<00:05:07.229> affordable<00:05:07.919> that

something that was affordable that

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.850 
something that was affordable that
everyone<00:05:09.180> could<00:05:09.419> have<00:05:09.479> so<00:05:10.350> that<00:05:10.500> they<00:05:10.620> could

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
everyone could have so that they could

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
create this functionally structured

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.560 
create this functionally structured
water<00:05:13.310> so<00:05:14.310> does<00:05:14.460> somebody<00:05:14.669> need<00:05:15.030> an<00:05:15.300> an

that for their water I mean you're not

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.650 
that for their water I mean you're not
going<00:05:20.400> to<00:05:20.490> get<00:05:20.610> it<00:05:20.700> out<00:05:20.760> of<00:05:20.850> your<00:05:20.910> tap<00:05:21.120> water<00:05:21.150> or

that people can get that kind of water

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.969 
that people can get that kind of water
is<00:05:27.419> through<00:05:27.720> something<00:05:28.080> like<00:05:28.229> that<00:05:28.380> you<00:05:28.560> have

I<00:05:56.820> mean<00:05:57.330> we're<00:05:58.080> drinking<00:05:58.530> water<00:05:58.770> now<00:05:59.070> that's

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
I mean we're drinking water now that's

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.730 
I mean we're drinking water now that's
polluted<00:05:59.760> and<00:05:59.910> our<00:06:00.090> water<00:06:00.750> tables<00:06:01.289> polluted

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
polluted and our water tables polluted

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.790 
polluted and our water tables polluted
on<00:06:01.830> top<00:06:02.099> of<00:06:02.250> that<00:06:02.370> so<00:06:02.910> you<00:06:03.000> have<00:06:03.539> to<00:06:03.800> you're

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
on top of that so you have to you're

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.279 
on top of that so you have to you're

literally forced to be conscious about

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:08.690 
literally forced to be conscious about
the<00:06:07.800> kind<00:06:08.010> of<00:06:08.070> water<00:06:08.340> you're<00:06:08.580> drinking

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.710 
because you're not the water that you're
drinking<00:06:10.860> will<00:06:11.190> kill<00:06:11.430> you<00:06:11.610> can<00:06:12.330> someone<00:06:12.630> tell

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
drinking will kill you can someone tell

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.060

the<00:06:12.870> difference<00:06:13.200> if<00:06:13.349> they<00:06:13.470> go<00:06:13.650> into<00:06:13.889> an

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
the difference if they go into an

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.790 
the difference if they go into an
alkaline<00:06:14.520> water<00:06:14.990> regimen<00:06:15.990> for<00:06:16.200> a<00:06:16.229> couple
