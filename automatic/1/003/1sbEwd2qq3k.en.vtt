00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.440
 good morning a kitchen has wanted to go 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.940
 today we will prepare a dish is 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.730
 extremely simple 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.840
 marinated artichokes with regard to 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.689
 the equipment 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.840
 the ideal would be to carry a knife 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:39.500
 specific for cutting artichokes one 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.600
 porcelain baking dish or not in 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.720
 metal with regard to 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:49.100
 ingredients we need two beautiful 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.780
 artichokes fresh parsley 2 lemons one 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.390
 garlic clove extra virgin olive oil 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.730
 olive has cold pressed sea ​​salt 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.550
 integral or pink of the Himalayas 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.559
 just let's start with cleaning i 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.879
 the first thing we need to do is artichokes 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.499
 it is to deprive them of the external leaves also 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.889
 with your hands or if you prefer you do it with 

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:11.600
 we remove the small knife up to 

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:13.819
 reach the ones most hold there 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.079
 we realize why the color is 

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:19.520
 definitely more clear here 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:22.189
 we deprive the stem of all the filaments 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.590
 more coriaceous and hard exterior ed 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:28.029
 possibly at the initial part of the 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.029
 hard leaves that we have removed 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.910
 once we have it we are given e 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.820
 clean sprinkle them with lemon juice 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.940
 so that you don't even use the 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.730
 shank I recommend and will now we are 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.730
 ready to face them very finely 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:11.240
 we distribute the artichokes immediately with 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:15.560

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:18.540
