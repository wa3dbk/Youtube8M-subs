00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.620
 two generations to 6 back we had the 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.670
 audi allroad 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.410
 and I still think pretty well because I don't 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.030
 how internship bolts still weeks along with the 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.889
 double test photography of one 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.299
 audi allroad not just a him had to 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.010
 against a porsche cayenne s like the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.210
 war with v8 well for dessert you have one 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.340
 nice day i dont have many cars 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.930
 are used to doing fantastic 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.460
 two generations further and we have 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.810
 no longer the audi allroad 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.699
 does have down the audi a6 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.859
 allroad and that addition was needed 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.789
 because audio also has an a4 allroad one 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.470
 the distinction must of course be possible 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.940
 to make 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.559
 well the concept caught on anyway 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.469
 because all that does it for a reason 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.760
 now also on the lists with the audi a4 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.410
 some moisture and you really need it 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.140
 anyway quattro but i can just take a6 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.219
 avant he too was optional and raised 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.610
 we have that woman is not good by the 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.140
 colour 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.120
 plastic on the sides in the white 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.590
 continue to edit all this black 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.059
 add that 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.020
 well to make the concept useful at all 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.020
 I am going to find out today 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.770
 a brief explanation of which version this is 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.590
 is the three by mail tdi with 200 and the 4 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.030
 pk and that is the slowest as is already 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.260
 well there is yes he is only 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.630
 available with six cylinders 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.920
 of which a gasoline the the new session 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.380
 ribbon with compressor with three under 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.970
 pk and three diesels versions of which 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.880
 white slowly since you can also get it 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.009
 with Jan 540 hp the same engine and you can 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.119
 get him with another turbo on it and 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.640
 then you go the three pkv dog with that 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.950
 new bi turbo diesel from audi but 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.659
 must be in practice yes who can 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.890
 for six-cylinder film 4pk I don't even agree 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.590
 so much for deep in on that 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.330
 Emotional practice is really fed up with 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.490
 your compass power is short of 170 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.800
 to there are days in the netherlands also it 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.899
 don't drive and you have enough bad torque 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.460
 to do on grass or with trailers what 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.720
 you want 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.009
 so i would say leave that 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.740
 saves money too nation could 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.720
 I could also work super at low speeds 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.479
 you never combine it with the quattro 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.560
 problem with driving away and yes then 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.300
 are going to have little about the usefulness of the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.399
 car had to how it drives and drive it 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.899
 essentially different from a regular a6 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.920
 avant 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.750
 he is also company select and all that 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.880
 systems from comfortable to physicists 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.959
 within a week after this flight 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.270
 fehring becomes we harder or softer 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.560
 much more interesting is this 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.480
 that you can set higher or lower 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.890
 depending on your not so write 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.270
 to drive you lower it a bit and you have to 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.459
 into the terrain then you put it in position oh 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.739
 red that and I on that whole piece 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.520
 loose the wheels so you get some more 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.520
 ground clearance 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.130
 yes then the question has such a model 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.720
 added value to us or just 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.970
 a little tupperware on a large a6 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.380
 you can also get avant quattro on the 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.819
 a6 avant is there you don't have to 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.170
 so it's about 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.569
 are you actually going to do something with it 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.340
 the name or red 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.920
 I see it somewhere and especially because 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.750
 I think you have more to this car 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.640
 then for example an audi q7 even 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.220
 apart from that 3rd row or a whole one 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.660
 fat audi q5 because a real suv that have 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.510
 you just never need it in the Netherlands 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.530
 as you now have in horse trailers 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.530
 And the must again is of course 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.180
 grass in what is then what or very often 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.170
 on winter sports to bigelow you there 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.970
 have 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.049
 which is also a kind of mountain path on well 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.489
 then you might just want that 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.260
 ground clearance just always have that 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:19.549
 is right we have an audi all road 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.140
 good and then he doesn't even offer years 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.269
 so much less than a true SUV offers 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.739
 because really that tough areas where you 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.760
 really that of sup ground clearance needed 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.989
 have 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.989
 That will certainly never be the Netherlands 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.530
 total autohotkey you of course really 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.920
 the perfect winter sports car 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.120
 to grab 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.440
 I'm here with some snow on 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.820
 snowed in well the thing is high enough 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.600
 on ground clearance you always have 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.410
 quattro 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.760
 winter tire your fabric where comfort space 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.660
 that way around it is quite stubby 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.820
 all walked 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.870
 the ergonomics the options available de luxe 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.890
 the audio 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.120
 is a perfect find that he 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.520
 remarkably little control has been 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.830
 big car thin steering also a little old 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.880
 new suggested new a3 has that too 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.610
 Yes I like you have to say 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.580
 control remains audi it seemed bmw 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.480
 but she knows where problem is because it 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.830
 keeps getting better 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.840
 it is still one every says 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.890
 wow if you are that great for sensitive 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.600
 and 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.770
 and communicative but audi knows 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.940
 apparently it is wrong so let's 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.650
 hope the new models keep it 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:17.780
 getting better with everything comes clear 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.560
 not without price and then little comes up 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.330
 in general 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.240
 disadvantage in jules the biggest disadvantage of 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.800
 Oil price list here and him over the 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.750
 ordinary price list but the option list of 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.220
 this specific model 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.220
 we have the basic price of the audi a6 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.510
 allroad deep emergency eds when i was two 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.860
 seven half a thousand 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:38.570
 now a kind of pro line 6 900 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:43.010
 comfort key in this case 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:46.520
 1200 then come out from one hundred and ten 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.920
 one thousand three hundred and 29 euros for the 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.340
 slowest audi a6 allroad 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.540
 yes that is a damned amount of money and 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.490
 so I never see myself in my life 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.630
 I think buy this car because that's them 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.460
 they amount to me a bit 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.840
 above the cap 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.610
 you have the quick pick it up 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.720
 you have to pay so much for it than do 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.430
 I really only for the top 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.300
 ultimately suitable for a wire 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.300
 again the horse trailers
