00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
ventilated mother because in the summer

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.190

obviously<00:01:15.790> very<00:01:16.060> hot<00:01:16.270> in<00:01:16.390> Arizona

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
obviously very hot in Arizona

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.709 
obviously very hot in Arizona
and<00:01:17.560> I'd<00:01:18.009> recommend<00:01:18.340> these<00:01:18.579> in<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.299> summer

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:19.719

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
very very very high heat summer I think

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.950 
very very very high heat summer I think
that<00:01:23.680> they<00:01:24.280> feel<00:01:24.520> good<00:01:25.210> a<00:01:25.240> great<00:01:25.630> amount<00:01:25.840> of

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
that they feel good a great amount of

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.789 
that they feel good a great amount of
air<00:01:26.340> maybe<00:01:27.340> not<00:01:27.579> as<00:01:27.670> like<00:01:27.820> as<00:01:28.630> a<00:01:28.689> mesh<00:01:29.439> glove

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
air maybe not as like as a mesh glove

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.160 
air maybe not as like as a mesh glove
but<00:01:30.039> a<00:01:30.250> lot<00:01:30.460> this<00:01:30.610> club<00:01:31.270> obviously<00:01:31.719> has<00:01:31.840> a<00:01:32.110> lot

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
but a lot this club obviously has a lot

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.149 
but a lot this club obviously has a lot
more<00:01:32.320> protection<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:34.450> school<00:01:34.920> full<00:01:35.920> leather

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
more protection so school full leather

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:42.770 
more protection so school full leather
and<00:01:36.549> a<00:01:37.090> nice<00:01:37.299> hard<00:01:37.720> p<00:01:38.789> knuckle<00:01:39.789> and

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.499 

anyway<00:01:43.780> so<00:01:43.840> I<00:01:43.990> look<00:01:44.790> for<00:01:45.790> touring<00:01:46.210> I<00:01:46.329> don't

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
anyway so I look for touring I don't

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.780 
anyway so I look for touring I don't
know<00:01:46.570> if<00:01:46.720> I<00:01:46.780> could<00:01:46.840> recommend<00:01:47.079> it<00:01:47.409> because<00:01:47.790> in

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
know if I could recommend it because in

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.429 
know if I could recommend it because in
the<00:01:48.880> middle<00:01:49.149> and<00:01:49.659> the<00:01:49.869> insides<00:01:50.229> of<00:01:50.350> your

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
the middle and the insides of your

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.050 
the middle and the insides of your
fingers<00:01:50.860> between<00:01:51.189> your<00:01:51.369> fingers<00:01:51.579> if<00:01:51.939> that

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
fingers between your fingers if that

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.440 
fingers between your fingers if that
makes<00:01:52.240> sense

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.399 

I<00:01:54.479> don't<00:01:54.689> know<00:01:54.750> if<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:54.930> makes<00:01:54.960> sense<00:01:55.229> but

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
I don't know if that makes sense but

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.380 
I don't know if that makes sense but
anyways<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.430> leather<00:01:56.640> kind<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.939> bunches<00:01:57.240> up

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
anyways the leather kind of bunches up

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.060 
anyways the leather kind of bunches up
in<00:01:57.539> it<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.930> becomes<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.770> little

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
in it and it becomes a little

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.959 
in it and it becomes a little
comfortable<00:01:59.640> if<00:02:00.479> you're<00:02:01.200> as<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.070> physician<00:02:02.490> for

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
comfortable if you're as a physician for

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.319 
comfortable if you're as a physician for

anyways but touring yes Tori I think

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.510 
anyways but touring yes Tori I think
it's<00:02:20.350> yeah<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:20.590> think<00:02:20.710> in<00:02:20.950> different<00:02:21.070> glove

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
it's yeah I think in different glove

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.250 
it's yeah I think in different glove
that<00:02:21.790> doesn't<00:02:22.180> bunch<00:02:22.330> up<00:02:22.570> be<00:02:22.810> better<00:02:23.020> for

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
that doesn't bunch up be better for

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.200 
that doesn't bunch up be better for
touring<00:02:23.620> although<00:02:24.490> these<00:02:24.640> are<00:02:24.880> these<00:02:25.150> are

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
touring although these are these are

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.320 
touring although these are these are
perfectly<00:02:25.600> fine<00:02:25.690> for<00:02:25.930> turning<00:02:26.440> I've<00:02:26.590> been

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
perfectly fine for turning I've been

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.530 
perfectly fine for turning I've been
having<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:28.390> good<00:02:28.600> time<00:02:28.920> touring<00:02:29.920> in<00:02:30.160> them<00:02:30.540> and
