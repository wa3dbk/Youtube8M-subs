how to do a single x step now the time

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.120 
how to do a single x step now the time
step<00:00:03.449> is<00:00:03.629> a<00:00:03.659> really<00:00:04.020> cool<00:00:04.230> move<00:00:04.440> and<00:00:04.650> it<00:00:04.740> adds<00:00:04.920> a

step is a really cool move and it adds a
lot<00:00:05.339> of<00:00:05.400> different<00:00:05.970> basic<00:00:06.509> tap<00:00:06.810> moves

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
lot of different basic tap moves

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.160 
lot of different basic tap moves
all<00:00:07.290> together<00:00:07.620> it<00:00:08.040> has<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.940> stomp<00:00:09.269> it<00:00:09.510> has<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.840> hop

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
all together it has a stomp it has a hop

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.680 
all together it has a stomp it has a hop
it<00:00:10.440> has<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.040> fill<00:00:11.400> out<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.849> it<00:00:12.120> has<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.330> ball

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
it has a fill out and it has a ball

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.169 
it has a fill out and it has a ball
change<00:00:13.049> there's<00:00:13.469> four<00:00:13.860> basic<00:00:14.099> moves<00:00:14.610> all<00:00:14.820> in

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
change there's four basic moves all in

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.689 
change there's four basic moves all in
one<00:00:15.389> so<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.560> start<00:00:16.800> I'm<00:00:17.010> in<00:00:17.160> from<00:00:17.310> my<00:00:17.400> hands<00:00:17.580> on

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
one so to start I'm in from my hands on

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.220 
one so to start I'm in from my hands on
my<00:00:17.789> hips<00:00:18.000> because<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.449> always<00:00:18.600> helps<00:00:18.930> me<00:00:18.960> for

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
my hips because it always helps me for

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.720 
my hips because it always helps me for
balance<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.920> we're<00:00:20.189> going<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.369> start<00:00:20.609> with

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
balance and we're going to start with

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.759 
balance and we're going to start with
our<00:00:20.880> right<00:00:20.910> leg<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.960> first<00:00:22.260> we're<00:00:22.500> going<00:00:22.650> to

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
our right leg so first we're going to

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.330 
our right leg so first we're going to
stop<00:00:23.189> so<00:00:24.019> now<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.080> difference<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.279> a

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
stop so now the difference is that on a

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.700 
stop so now the difference is that on a
stop<00:00:26.760> I'm<00:00:26.970> going<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.330> pick<00:00:27.539> my<00:00:27.750> foot<00:00:28.050> back<00:00:28.439> up

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
stop I'm going to pick my foot back up

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.950 
stop I'm going to pick my foot back up
so<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.310> kind<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.609> reverberates<00:00:30.210> off<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.660> floor

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
so it kind of reverberates off the floor

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.010 
so it kind of reverberates off the floor
kind<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:31.590> lightning<00:00:32.040> hitting<00:00:32.250> stop<00:00:33.020> from

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
kind of like lightning hitting stop from

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.780 
kind of like lightning hitting stop from
there<00:00:34.230> I'm<00:00:34.500> going<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.770> hop<00:00:35.040> on<00:00:35.250> my<00:00:35.340> standing

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
there I'm going to hop on my standing

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.990 
there I'm going to hop on my standing
leg<00:00:35.969> hop<00:00:36.660> then<00:00:37.620> I'm<00:00:37.800> going<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.190> step<00:00:38.520> back<00:00:38.730> on

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
leg hop then I'm going to step back on

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.580 
leg hop then I'm going to step back on
my<00:00:39.270> free<00:00:39.510> leg<00:00:39.540> which<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.230> one<00:00:40.350> that's<00:00:40.379> in

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
my free leg which is the one that's in

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.490 
my free leg which is the one that's in
the<00:00:40.649> air<00:00:40.860> step<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.300> I'm<00:00:42.719> going<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.079> do<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> full

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
the air step and I'm going to do a full

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.619 
the air step and I'm going to do a full
lap<00:00:43.680> now<00:00:44.040> with<00:00:44.250> my<00:00:44.430> front<00:00:44.670> leg<00:00:44.879> which<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.420> a

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
lap now with my front leg which is a

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.220 
lap now with my front leg which is a
brush<00:00:46.200> step<00:00:47.120> laughs<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.480> then<00:00:48.930> we<00:00:49.050> have<00:00:49.200> a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
brush step laughs and then we have a

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.040 
brush step laughs and then we have a
ball<00:00:49.469> change<00:00:49.800> ball<00:00:50.430> change<00:00:50.719> let's<00:00:51.719> try<00:00:51.989> it

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
ball change ball change let's try it

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.900 
ball change ball change let's try it
again

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
again

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.450 
again
stomp<00:00:53.989> hop<00:00:55.160> step<00:00:56.160> flap<00:00:56.460> ball<00:00:57.360> change<00:00:58.370> one<00:00:59.370> more

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
stomp hop step flap ball change one more

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.709 
stomp hop step flap ball change one more
time<00:00:59.760> with<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.030> right<00:01:00.180> leg<00:01:00.410> some<00:01:01.520> hop<00:01:02.719> step

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
time with the right leg some hop step

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.210 
time with the right leg some hop step
flap<00:01:04.019> ball<00:01:04.890> change<00:01:06.080> now<00:01:07.080> when<00:01:07.650> we<00:01:07.770> want<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.100> go

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
flap ball change now when we want to go

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.890 
flap ball change now when we want to go
from<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.700> right<00:01:08.850> leg<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.330> left<00:01:09.360> leg<00:01:09.720> and

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
from the right leg to the left leg and

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.600 
from the right leg to the left leg and
back<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.350> forth<00:01:10.590> like<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:11.010> typically<00:01:11.430> do

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
back and forth like you typically do

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.359 
back and forth like you typically do
with<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.790> time<00:01:12.119> step<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.990> ball<00:01:13.229> change<00:01:13.710> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
with a time step the ball change the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.020 
with a time step the ball change the
pull<00:01:14.760> change<00:01:15.210> also<00:01:16.200> counts<00:01:16.619> as<00:01:16.680> our<00:01:16.920> soup<00:01:17.430> so

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
pull change also counts as our soup so

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.420 
pull change also counts as our soup so
it<00:01:18.240> kind<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.630> combines<00:01:19.259> two<00:01:19.710> moves<00:01:19.920> into<00:01:20.250> one

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
it kind of combines two moves into one

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.370 
it kind of combines two moves into one
so<00:01:21.060> let<00:01:21.180> me<00:01:21.299> show<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.540> how<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.780> go<00:01:21.990> from<00:01:22.020> one<00:01:22.350> to

back<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.560> like<00:01:40.710> 40s<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.280> 50s<00:01:41.640> because

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
back in the like 40s and 50s because

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.609 
back in the like 40s and 50s because
they<00:01:42.210> started<00:01:42.570> incorporating<00:01:42.869> like<00:01:43.409> some

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
they started incorporating like some

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.160 
they started incorporating like some
traditional<00:01:44.250> time<00:01:44.549> step<00:01:44.909> arms<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:45.899> let<00:01:46.079> me

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
traditional time step arms so let me

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.289 
traditional time step arms so let me
show<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.380> how<00:01:46.619> those<00:01:46.829> go<00:01:47.100> now<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:48.030> for<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
show you how those go now so for the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.789 
show you how those go now so for the
stop<00:01:48.540> your<00:01:48.810> hands<00:01:49.170> are<00:01:49.229> going<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.409> go<00:01:49.530> forward

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
stop your hands are going to go forward

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.109 
stop your hands are going to go forward
like<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.399> stop<00:01:50.640> sign

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
like in a stop sign

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.859 
like in a stop sign
stop<00:01:52.020> from<00:01:52.770> there<00:01:53.040> they<00:01:53.220> open<00:01:53.640> up<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.689> hop

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
stop from there they open up on the hop

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.190 
stop from there they open up on the hop
kind<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:56.040> I'm<00:01:56.219> an<00:01:56.340> airplane<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.840> step
