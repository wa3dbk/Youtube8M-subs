reviewing the Malta 127 HS this is a

reviewing the Malta 127 HS this is a
Molotov<00:00:05.420> high-performance<00:00:06.420> paint<00:00:06.660> marker

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
Molotov high-performance paint marker

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.280 
Molotov high-performance paint marker
it's<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:08.340> 2<00:00:08.519> millimetre<00:00:08.940> nib<00:00:09.210> they<00:00:09.840> also<00:00:09.990> come

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
it's the 2 millimetre nib they also come

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.830 
it's the 2 millimetre nib they also come
in<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.590> one<00:00:10.769> millimeter<00:00:11.010> nib<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:12.210> same<00:00:12.599> body

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
in a one millimeter nib of the same body

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.070 
in a one millimeter nib of the same body
size<00:00:13.080> but<00:00:13.860> they<00:00:13.980> also<00:00:14.160> come<00:00:14.670> in<00:00:14.849> like<00:00:15.420> all<00:00:15.870> the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
size but they also come in like all the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.470 
size but they also come in like all the
way<00:00:16.170> up<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.440> huge<00:00:16.680> tagging<00:00:17.100> markers<00:00:17.430> so<00:00:18.000> this

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
way up to huge tagging markers so this

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.160 
way up to huge tagging markers so this
is<00:00:18.630> kind<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.230> smaller<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.270> two<00:00:21.480> that

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
is kind of the smaller of the two that

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.509 
is kind of the smaller of the two that
you<00:00:22.439> would<00:00:22.560> probably<00:00:22.859> end<00:00:22.920> up<00:00:23.039> using<00:00:23.220> for

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
you would probably end up using for

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.550 
you would probably end up using for
sketching<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.060> whatnot<00:00:24.330> but<00:00:24.930> yeah<00:00:25.410> we're

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
sketching and whatnot but yeah we're

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.160 
sketching and whatnot but yeah we're
going<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.710> do<00:00:25.890> first<00:00:26.550> off<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.820> caller<00:00:27.150> spot<00:00:27.510> with

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
going to do first off a caller spot with

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.830 
going to do first off a caller spot with
some<00:00:28.769> assorted<00:00:29.039> colors<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.420> first<00:00:30.599> color

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
some assorted colors so the first color

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.400 
some assorted colors so the first color
is<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.080> 205<00:00:31.800> Amazon<00:00:32.430> hell<00:00:32.730> this<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.450> like<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> very

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
have used them quite a bit before the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.520 
have used them quite a bit before the
review<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.670> they're<00:00:57.360> definitely<00:00:57.989> holding<00:00:58.379> up

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
review and they're definitely holding up

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.630

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
going to be a 13 traffic read next up

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.429 
going to be a 13 traffic read next up
we've<00:01:15.150> got<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.750> double<00:01:16.380> O<00:01:16.470> 9<00:01:16.770> Sahara<00:01:17.640> beige

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.320 
pastel nice tan color
now<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.650> ordered<00:01:26.280> these<00:01:26.430> markers<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.060> set

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
now I ordered these markers in a set

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.929 
now I ordered these markers in a set
that<00:01:27.780> was<00:01:27.990> random<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:28.979> I'd<00:01:29.369> end<00:01:29.640> up<00:01:29.729> choosing

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
that was random so I'd end up choosing

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.600 
that was random so I'd end up choosing
these<00:01:30.150> colors<00:01:30.450> but<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.659> was<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.810> nice<00:01:30.990> mix<00:01:31.320> and

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
these colors but it was a nice mix and

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:44.230 
these colors but it was a nice mix and
this<00:01:32.610> next<00:01:32.850> one<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> no<00:01:33.540> 8<00:01:33.720> 5<00:01:34.049> dare<00:01:34.770> Orange

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.920 

and<00:01:45.830> lastly<00:01:46.830> we<00:01:47.010> got<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.370> vanilla<00:01:48.030> pastel

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
and lastly we got the vanilla pastel

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.130 
and lastly we got the vanilla pastel
this<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.320> one<00:01:49.530> one<00:01:49.710> five<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.550> now<00:01:51.240> Malta<00:01:51.690> has

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
this is one one five and now Malta has

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.850 
this is one one five and now Malta has
all<00:01:52.380> these<00:01:52.620> number<00:01:53.120> signification<00:01:54.120> like

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
all these number signification like

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.970 
all these number signification like
whatever<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.850> can<00:01:57.350> kind<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.410> use

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
whatever so that you can kind of use

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.840 
whatever so that you can kind of use
both<00:01:59.280> their<00:01:59.550> spray<00:01:59.790> paint<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:01.370> their<00:02:02.370> markers

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
both their spray paint and their markers

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.580 
both their spray paint and their markers
like<00:02:03.120> within<00:02:03.510> one<00:02:03.690> another<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.170> all<00:02:04.380> these

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
like within one another so all these

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.550 
like within one another so all these
paints<00:02:05.010> actually<00:02:05.400> mimic<00:02:05.760> the<00:02:05.970> same<00:02:06.120> exact

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
paints actually mimic the same exact

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.990 
paints actually mimic the same exact
paints<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.620> are<00:02:07.740> mixed<00:02:07.860> in<00:02:08.610> their<00:02:08.790> spray

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
paints that are mixed in their spray

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.240 
paints that are mixed in their spray
paint<00:02:09.210> so<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.450> can<00:02:09.720> do<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.680> with<00:02:10.860> canvas

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
paint so you can do that with canvas

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.250 
paint so you can do that with canvas
work<00:02:11.460> and<00:02:11.670> everything<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.780> won't<00:02:12.930> test<00:02:13.170> the

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
work and everything and I won't test the

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.760 
work and everything and I won't test the
white<00:02:13.410> on<00:02:13.530> white<00:02:13.710> seeing<00:02:14.100> as<00:02:14.510> it's<00:02:15.510> white<00:02:16.080> but

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
white on white seeing as it's white but

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.820 
white on white seeing as it's white but
um<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.250> got<00:02:17.520> some<00:02:17.730> black<00:02:18.350> here<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.500> test<00:02:19.710> the

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
um I got some black here to test the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.810 
um I got some black here to test the
opacity<00:02:20.100> of<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.460> white<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:21.780> specifically

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
opacity of the white and I specifically

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.610 
opacity of the white and I specifically
heard<00:02:23.820> really<00:02:24.150> good<00:02:24.360> things<00:02:24.420> about<00:02:24.930> the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
heard really good things about the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.690 
heard really good things about the
opacity<00:02:26.010> of<00:02:27.020> these<00:02:28.020> markers<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.740> I'm<00:02:29.400> pretty

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
opacity of these markers and I'm pretty

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.970 
opacity of these markers and I'm pretty
sure<00:02:29.820> it's<00:02:30.120> because<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:31.020> they<00:02:31.230> are<00:02:31.410> based<00:02:31.740> on

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
sure it's because that they are based on

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.850 
sure it's because that they are based on
the<00:02:32.160> same<00:02:33.110> inks<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.170> they<00:02:34.350> use<00:02:34.530> for<00:02:34.740> their

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
the same inks that they use for their

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.760 
the same inks that they use for their
tagging<00:02:35.280> markers<00:02:35.610> so<00:02:36.300> it's<00:02:36.870> super<00:02:37.650> high

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
tagging markers so it's super high

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.220 
tagging markers so it's super high
opacity<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.580> this<00:02:38.700> is<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.060> signal<00:02:39.840> white<00:02:39.990> one

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
opacity and this is the signal white one

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.490 
opacity and this is the signal white one
six<00:02:40.500> out<00:02:40.710> but<00:02:41.370> um<00:02:41.630> it's<00:02:42.630> just<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.930> really<00:02:43.320> really

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
six out but um it's just a really really

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.560 
six out but um it's just a really really
uh<00:02:43.650> opaque<00:02:44.570> white<00:02:46.790> splotch<00:02:47.790> right<00:02:48.180> there<00:02:48.390> this

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
uh opaque white splotch right there this

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.160 
uh opaque white splotch right there this
is<00:02:48.630> non-porous<00:02:49.320> but<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.670> have<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.030> little<00:02:51.959> hello

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
is non-porous but I have a little hello

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.170 
is non-porous but I have a little hello
my<00:02:52.320> name<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:53.220> show<00:02:53.630> it<00:02:54.630> on<00:02:54.989> like<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.470> porous

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
my name is to show it on like a porous

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.560 
my name is to show it on like a porous
surface<00:02:57.180> where<00:02:57.600> it'll<00:02:57.870> kind<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.260> like<00:02:58.410> set<00:02:58.709> in

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.210 

alright<00:03:03.570> so<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:03.870> can<00:03:04.020> see<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.410> with<00:03:05.070> just

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
alright so you can see that with just

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.250 
alright so you can see that with just
the<00:03:05.340> one<00:03:05.580> stroke<00:03:05.850> on<00:03:06.090> top<00:03:06.330> it<00:03:06.810> sets<00:03:07.110> in<00:03:07.230> a

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
the one stroke on top it sets in a

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.500 
the one stroke on top it sets in a
little<00:03:07.560> bit<00:03:07.650> more<00:03:07.830> but<00:03:08.070> just<00:03:08.310> like<00:03:09.239> a<00:03:09.270> standard

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
little bit more but just like a standard

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.870 
little bit more but just like a standard
coloring<00:03:10.170> section<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.860> doesn't<00:03:11.400> set<00:03:11.580> in<00:03:11.700> much

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
coloring section it doesn't set in much

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.050 
coloring section it doesn't set in much
at<00:03:12.030> all<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:12.860> that's<00:03:13.860> I<00:03:14.280> guess<00:03:14.580> really<00:03:14.850> good

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
at all and that's I guess really good

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.300 
at all and that's I guess really good
for<00:03:15.420> um<00:03:15.600> this<00:03:15.930> white<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.860> know<00:03:16.980> I've<00:03:17.160> had

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
for um this white you know I've had

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.490 
for um this white you know I've had
trouble<00:03:17.700> with<00:03:17.820> just<00:03:18.540> about<00:03:18.630> every<00:03:18.959> other<00:03:19.080> type

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
trouble with just about every other type

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.350 
trouble with just about every other type
of<00:03:19.530> white<00:03:19.830> paint<00:03:20.340> marker<00:03:20.640> but<00:03:20.820> this

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
of white paint marker but this

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.940 
of white paint marker but this
definitely<00:03:21.810> is<00:03:21.989> a<00:03:22.020> going<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.620> stick<00:03:22.830> around

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
definitely is a going to stick around

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.090 
definitely is a going to stick around
and<00:03:23.690> I've<00:03:24.690> heard<00:03:25.020> good<00:03:25.200> things<00:03:25.260> about<00:03:25.560> their

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
and I've heard good things about their

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.320 
and I've heard good things about their
big<00:03:26.420> mixing<00:03:27.420> bottles<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:28.730> like<00:03:29.730> hold<00:03:29.970> up<00:03:30.120> um

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
big mixing bottles to like hold up um

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.979 
big mixing bottles to like hold up um
and<00:03:30.840> refill<00:03:31.470> their<00:03:31.860> markers<00:03:32.610> with<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.300> think

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
and refill their markers with so I think

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.860 
and refill their markers with so I think
that'll<00:03:34.230> cut<00:03:34.410> down<00:03:34.590> on<00:03:34.739> cost<00:03:35.120> for<00:03:36.120> these<00:03:36.239> but

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
that'll cut down on cost for these but

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.190 
that'll cut down on cost for these but
um<00:03:37.050> I<00:03:37.380> also<00:03:37.970> tested<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.239> out<00:03:39.330> on<00:03:39.510> some<00:03:39.690> vinyl<00:03:40.080> I

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
um I also tested it out on some vinyl I

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.320 
um I also tested it out on some vinyl I
did<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:40.620> beforehand<00:03:41.040> so<00:03:41.190> it<00:03:41.310> would<00:03:41.430> dry<00:03:41.730> but

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
did it beforehand so it would dry but

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.660 
did it beforehand so it would dry but
much<00:03:42.690> like<00:03:42.900> all<00:03:43.200> other<00:03:43.500> paint<00:03:44.160> markers<00:03:44.489> it

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
much like all other paint markers it

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.690 
much like all other paint markers it
just<00:03:44.850> scratches<00:03:45.030> off<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.540> vinyl<00:03:46.370> but<00:03:47.370> besides

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
just scratches off the vinyl but besides

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.870 
just scratches off the vinyl but besides
that<00:03:47.820> I<00:03:47.970> don't<00:03:48.120> see<00:03:48.390> any<00:03:49.100> like<00:03:50.100> scenario<00:03:50.610> when

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
that I don't see any like scenario when

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.600 
that I don't see any like scenario when
these<00:03:51.390> markers<00:03:51.780> wouldn't<00:03:52.110> be<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:52.460> very<00:03:53.460> good

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
these markers wouldn't be a very good

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.740 
these markers wouldn't be a very good
choice<00:03:53.760> they<00:03:54.390> are<00:03:54.510> a<00:03:54.540> little

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
choice they are a little

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.750 
choice they are a little
been<00:03:54.870> more<00:03:55.020> expensive<00:03:55.260> than<00:03:55.650> your<00:03:55.770> decos<00:03:56.460> or

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
been more expensive than your decos or

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.170 
been more expensive than your decos or
post<00:03:57.750> cos<00:03:57.960> but<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:58.470> definitely<00:03:59.100> recommend<00:03:59.880> them

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
post cos but I definitely recommend them

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.210 
post cos but I definitely recommend them
for<00:04:00.210> anybody<00:04:00.600> really<00:04:01.380> high<00:04:01.530> opacity<00:04:02.010> as<00:04:02.100> you

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
for anybody really high opacity as you

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.030 
for anybody really high opacity as you
can<00:04:02.340> see<00:04:02.490> the<00:04:02.640> white<00:04:03.260> didn't<00:04:04.260> set<00:04:04.440> in<00:04:04.590> at<00:04:04.830> all

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
can see the white didn't set in at all

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.700 
can see the white didn't set in at all
on<00:04:05.520> both<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:06.510> hello<00:04:06.810> my<00:04:06.960> name<00:04:07.140> is<00:04:07.170> and<00:04:07.530> like

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
on both the hello my name is and like

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.220 
on both the hello my name is and like
the<00:04:07.920> kind<00:04:08.250> of<00:04:08.310> unpause<00:04:09.180> surface<00:04:09.750> so<00:04:10.020> you<00:04:10.050> can

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
the kind of unpause surface so you can

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.380 
the kind of unpause surface so you can
really<00:04:10.560> expect<00:04:11.040> that<00:04:11.100> and<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.940> colors<00:04:12.240> are

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
really expect that and the colors are

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.710 
really expect that and the colors are
very<00:04:12.510> true<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:13.640> what<00:04:14.640> their<00:04:15.209> caps<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:15.600> stuff

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
very true to what their caps and stuff

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.280 
very true to what their caps and stuff
say<00:04:16.109> and<00:04:17.100> they<00:04:17.489> do<00:04:17.549> have<00:04:17.880> a<00:04:17.940> like<00:04:18.359> clear<00:04:18.930> window

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
say and they do have a like clear window

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.960 
say and they do have a like clear window
it's<00:04:20.010> kind<00:04:20.250> of<00:04:20.280> hard<00:04:20.430> to<00:04:20.459> tell<00:04:20.670> but<00:04:20.790> this

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
it's kind of hard to tell but this

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.190 
it's kind of hard to tell but this
section<00:04:21.269> right<00:04:21.390> here<00:04:21.450> is<00:04:21.570> actually<00:04:21.900> clear<00:04:22.079> so

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
section right here is actually clear so

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.600 
section right here is actually clear so
you<00:04:22.260> can<00:04:22.380> see<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.620> paint<00:04:22.830> right<00:04:23.010> inside<00:04:23.340> of<00:04:23.370> it

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
you can see the paint right inside of it

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.950 
you can see the paint right inside of it
and<00:04:24.140> I<00:04:25.140> did<00:04:25.590> find<00:04:25.830> that<00:04:26.600> especially<00:04:27.600> with<00:04:27.750> this

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
and I did find that especially with this

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.159 
and I did find that especially with this
green<00:04:28.560> kind<00:04:29.370> of<00:04:29.460> all<00:04:30.000> of<00:04:30.240> one<00:04:30.419> you<00:04:30.870> can<00:04:30.990> see<00:04:31.140> the

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
green kind of all of one you can see the

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.140 
green kind of all of one you can see the
paint's<00:04:31.560> that's<00:04:32.400> like<00:04:32.550> a<00:04:32.580> little<00:04:32.790> bit<00:04:33.000> more

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
paint's that's like a little bit more

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.850 
paint's that's like a little bit more
pigment<00:04:33.540> in<00:04:33.600> there<00:04:33.810> so<00:04:34.350> just<00:04:34.560> make<00:04:34.680> sure<00:04:34.830> to

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
pigment in there so just make sure to

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.260 
pigment in there so just make sure to
shake<00:04:35.100> them<00:04:35.310> up<00:04:35.400> I<00:04:35.550> didn't<00:04:35.790> find<00:04:35.910> that<00:04:36.060> it<00:04:36.210> was

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
shake them up I didn't find that it was

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.720 
shake them up I didn't find that it was
drawing<00:04:36.570> any<00:04:36.919> like<00:04:37.919> different<00:04:38.250> colors<00:04:38.520> while

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
drawing any like different colors while

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.840 
drawing any like different colors while
I<00:04:38.760> was<00:04:38.970> using<00:04:39.150> it<00:04:39.360> but<00:04:39.810> these<00:04:40.230> definitely<00:04:40.850> held

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
I was using it but these definitely held

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.570 
I was using it but these definitely held
up<00:04:42.030> well<00:04:42.240> and<00:04:42.510> I<00:04:43.230> can<00:04:43.470> suggest<00:04:43.650> them<00:04:44.100> kind<00:04:44.520> of

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
up well and I can suggest them kind of

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.010 
up well and I can suggest them kind of
give<00:04:44.700> you<00:04:44.790> a<00:04:44.850> size<00:04:45.060> comparison<00:04:45.090> these<00:04:45.810> are<00:04:45.990> a

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
give you a size comparison these are a

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.560 
give you a size comparison these are a
lot<00:04:46.230> smaller<00:04:46.560> than<00:04:46.800> decos<00:04:47.490> they're<00:04:48.210> kind<00:04:48.480> of

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
lot smaller than decos they're kind of

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.170 
lot smaller than decos they're kind of
the<00:04:48.720> same<00:04:48.960> thickness<00:04:49.560> as<00:04:49.919> this<00:04:50.460> inner<00:04:50.669> ring<00:04:50.760> on

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
the same thickness as this inner ring on

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.360 
the same thickness as this inner ring on
the<00:04:51.300> deco<00:04:51.600> so<00:04:52.500> you<00:04:52.590> can<00:04:52.710> kind<00:04:52.860> of<00:04:52.919> get<00:04:53.040> the<00:04:53.070> size

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
the deco so you can kind of get the size

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.240 
the deco so you can kind of get the size
of<00:04:53.490> their<00:04:53.610> body<00:04:53.820> but<00:04:54.710> like<00:04:55.710> I<00:04:55.800> said<00:04:55.860> you<00:04:56.130> can

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
of their body but like I said you can

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.240 
of their body but like I said you can
get<00:04:56.340> some<00:04:56.550> really<00:04:56.700> good<00:04:56.880> like<00:04:57.810> refill<00:04:58.710> bottles

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
get some really good like refill bottles

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.730 
get some really good like refill bottles
of<00:04:59.490> ink<00:04:59.669> like<00:05:00.000> pretty<00:05:00.750> big<00:05:00.930> sizes<00:05:01.229> I'd<00:05:01.560> say

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
of ink like pretty big sizes I'd say

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.560 
of ink like pretty big sizes I'd say
that<00:05:01.950> would<00:05:02.070> refill<00:05:02.490> ten<00:05:02.790> and<00:05:02.910> twelve<00:05:03.120> markers

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
that would refill ten and twelve markers

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.900 
that would refill ten and twelve markers
for<00:05:04.500> like<00:05:04.650> ten<00:05:04.830> or<00:05:04.950> fifteen<00:05:05.250> bucks<00:05:05.460> so<00:05:05.700> if<00:05:05.820> you

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
for like ten or fifteen bucks so if you

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.300 
for like ten or fifteen bucks so if you
just<00:05:06.090> buy<00:05:06.210> a<00:05:06.240> set<00:05:06.540> of<00:05:06.710> basic<00:05:07.710> markers<00:05:08.100> you<00:05:08.280> can

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
just buy a set of basic markers you can

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.540 
just buy a set of basic markers you can
then<00:05:08.580> refill<00:05:09.510> them<00:05:09.690> I<00:05:10.620> know<00:05:10.950> they<00:05:11.220> come<00:05:11.400> in

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
then refill them I know they come in

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.000 
then refill them I know they come in
really<00:05:11.700> large<00:05:12.000> sets<00:05:12.390> but<00:05:12.840> I<00:05:12.900> got<00:05:13.410> just<00:05:13.830> eight

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
really large sets but I got just eight

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.250 
really large sets but I got just eight
simple<00:05:14.430> ones<00:05:14.610> really<00:05:15.300> happy<00:05:15.900> with<00:05:16.050> them<00:05:16.200> and

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
the comments I can answer questions I

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.130 
the comments I can answer questions I
picked<00:05:31.470> mine<00:05:31.650> off<00:05:31.800> of<00:05:32.190> bombing<00:05:33.060> signs<00:05:33.270> there

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
picked mine off of bombing signs there

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.969 
picked mine off of bombing signs there
I'm<00:05:34.919> pretty<00:05:35.220> sure<00:05:35.340> the<00:05:35.460> only<00:05:36.140> store<00:05:37.140> in<00:05:37.169> the

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
I'm pretty sure the only store in the

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.610 
I'm pretty sure the only store in the
u.s.<00:05:38.280> that<00:05:38.970> has<00:05:39.419> them<00:05:39.690> bomb<00:05:39.840> science<00:05:40.200> also<00:05:40.350> in

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
u.s. that has them bomb science also in

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.250 
u.s. that has them bomb science also in
Canada<00:05:40.830> but<00:05:41.250> they<00:05:42.060> have<00:05:42.150> a<00:05:42.240> US<00:05:42.540> branch<00:05:42.840> now<00:05:43.050> and

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
Canada but they have a US branch now and

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.780 
Canada but they have a US branch now and
I<00:05:44.160> know<00:05:44.940> you<00:05:45.150> can<00:05:45.390> also<00:05:45.540> get<00:05:45.810> them<00:05:46.020> at<00:05:46.550> 33<00:05:47.550> third

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
I know you can also get them at 33 third

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.000 
I know you can also get them at 33 third
so<00:05:48.300> I'm<00:05:48.990> not<00:05:49.260> sure<00:05:49.440> the<00:05:49.530> price<00:05:49.740> difference

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
so I'm not sure the price difference

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.830 
so I'm not sure the price difference
between<00:05:50.370> the<00:05:50.460> two<00:05:50.610> sides<00:05:50.880> but<00:05:51.180> I<00:05:51.240> got<00:05:51.510> mine<00:05:51.660> off

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
between the two sides but I got mine off

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.610 
between the two sides but I got mine off
bombing<00:05:52.169> signs<00:05:52.410> and<00:05:53.330> you<00:05:54.330> can<00:05:54.540> too<00:05:54.720> if<00:05:55.500> you

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
spend a little bit more than your

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.170 
spend a little bit more than your
classic<00:06:03.870> deco<00:06:04.490> mala<00:06:05.490> tiles<00:06:05.729> are<00:06:05.849> definitely

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
classic deco mala tiles are definitely

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.409 
classic deco mala tiles are definitely
the<00:06:06.240> way<00:06:06.330> to<00:06:06.360> go<00:06:06.510> really<00:06:07.020> high<00:06:07.169> opacity

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
the way to go really high opacity

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:09.850 
the way to go really high opacity
if<00:06:08.689> you're<00:06:08.990> just<00:06:09.199> going<00:06:09.349> to<00:06:09.439> go<00:06:09.530> for<00:06:09.740> one

don't know any other paint markers that
have<00:06:14.150> held<00:06:14.870> up<00:06:15.050> well<00:06:15.289> I<00:06:15.639> did<00:06:16.639> pick<00:06:17.030> up<00:06:17.120> a

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
have held up well I did pick up a

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.110 
have held up well I did pick up a
sharpie<00:06:18.139> poster<00:06:18.530> paint<00:06:18.740> recently<00:06:19.580> and<00:06:19.819> that

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
sharpie poster paint recently and that

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.909 
sharpie poster paint recently and that
does<00:06:20.330> okay<00:06:20.780> that's<00:06:20.990> probably<00:06:21.110> the<00:06:21.590> second

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 
does okay that's probably the second

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.550 
does okay that's probably the second
best<00:06:22.099> I've<00:06:22.370> found<00:06:23.050> just<00:06:24.050> because<00:06:24.319> you<00:06:24.439> can

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
best I've found just because you can

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.529 
best I've found just because you can
juice<00:06:24.740> it<00:06:24.860> a<00:06:24.979> ton<00:06:25.159> and<00:06:25.310> layer<00:06:25.520> it<00:06:25.729> up<00:06:25.849> but
