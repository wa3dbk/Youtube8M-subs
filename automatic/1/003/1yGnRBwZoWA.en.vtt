also<00:02:04.170> think<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.680> shoulder<00:02:04.979> pad<00:02:05.130> design

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
also think that the shoulder pad design

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.709 
also think that the shoulder pad design
could<00:02:05.640> have<00:02:05.729> been<00:02:05.880> refined<00:02:06.210> for<00:02:06.329> something
