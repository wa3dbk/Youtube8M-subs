00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:17.660
 the old home was folded with it 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.680
 and then do not make nonsense 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.939
 That was a tough job today 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.519
 We are happy about the three points 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.740
 otherwise there was already a problem 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.720
 for us some of course, first of all 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.420
 line because felt six to eight 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.439
 had great chances and had forgiven 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.870
 what kind of a worse 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.120
 bit to a bit difficult and 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.730
 unnecessarily then we certainly have 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.690
 with the temperature too high 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.969
 that was very nice 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.250
 warm late summer 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:46.800
 that's what my game noted yes 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.480
 but by and large, of course 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.050
 free points cultural scene none 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.170
 bad team 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.809
 It was really exhausting 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.340
 Always had a short drink break but you 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.960
 Can not drink so much water 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.020
 how to lose and become natural 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.520
 very intense and today was also without 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.379
 the weather in the seven then play 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.900
 it can do just that and it has 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.229
 all a little bit off and yes 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.150
 the forces have slowly disappeared 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.439
 yes why is it going after five or eight ? 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.720
 already have two great chances 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.189
 had I have to do that makes are 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.450
 then you get a little bit more under 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.400
 pressure because of course the home team 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.930
 year with a good example wants and also 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.000
 the team is very good and can 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.200
 I have just noted is okay here 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.150
 only they are in the game are pure 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.079
 came after bavaria not met 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.220
 has and relatively tough game where we always 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.490
 again during the game time always 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.380
 they really had chances again 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.880
 just forgive clearly 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.719
 but good and is the go- to then 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.640
 conclusion is of course very annoying 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.979
 because you cut off that too badly 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.170
 yes I think we have the chances 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.479
 make that very different and clear when the 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.100
 markets are angry, then they get 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.720
 training we have made stupid mistakes 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.810
 This will make the enemy again 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.539
 stronger and so we ourselves have the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.000
 made stronger and we do not have more 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.890
 Access to others is fortunate 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.439
 The two gates shot make stupid 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.490
 got a go 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.490
 Well, the main thing 35
