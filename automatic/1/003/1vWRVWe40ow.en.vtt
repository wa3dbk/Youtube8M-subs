00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.430
 hello everyone I'm a kid and we're 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.260
 new in online gta 5 and today I'm going to 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.719
 teach a good trick 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.300
 It's a trick because I'm going to show you how 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.010
 make them invisible in the body 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.150
 complete and also the vehicle that 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.949
 we have at that time and so we can 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.660
 trolling our friends another of the 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.539
 people that we see out there in the sessions 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.300
 normal good first thing the only thing that 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.060
 we need is to have a vehicle and have 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.920
 to a friend in the session I am in 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.329
 a session by imitation but I already say 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.000
 that a normal session also works 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.500
 if you want to make it a standard for 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.199
 trolling other people could do it 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.970
 perfectly good now is about 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.640
 to arrive my friend can you come 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.720
 it's worth once he has arrived he has to 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.730
 enter the garage of Saints Justo 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.820
 when it is reappearing that is 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.010
 coming out we have to hit him 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.960
 let's go backwards to get out of almost 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.520
 almost the parking that so that his responso 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.190
 in the door that opens the door that 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.530
 reappear then when he presses the 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.540
 circle button for example is when the 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.490
 place and press the circle to the two 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.780
 seconds more or less control depends 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.960
 the city the car you have to go 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.390
 coming back and hitting a hit is worth not now 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.640
 has happened vale does not always happen 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.909
 the first time you have to try 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.409
 it will try for the fifth time and 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.930
 I tell you that the first one does not always pass 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.200
 so you have to try several 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.270
 times until you get the trick 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.119
 the trick ss when it is about to 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.960
 reappear you have to hit hard 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.210
 ok then it will stay invisible 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.310
 will disappear from the map as you can see 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.630
 it's not even on the map now I've said that 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.340
 he has stayed 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.440
 just nailed to the door has been 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.570
 stayed in this position horizontally 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.520
 between the door and can not and not for a 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.369
 side or for the other then I'm going to 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.570
 try to take out so you can see 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.750
 take off a few hits to the car to 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:10.759
 see if I take it out but I'm a bit clumsy 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.110
 the pp put together and gps calculate is worth a lot 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.690
 people will tell me there because I have not done the 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.380
 trick because it did not hit you and you've 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.030
 remained invisible is it because from his 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.830
 console from his intellect he is 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.410
 seeing the yes you see what so that 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.800
 we do not see him then if 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.300
 You do it because you will see well what 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.220
 that so people are not going to see you 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.620
 so if I did it then he sees me 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.870
 I saw well then I could not tell you no 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.970
 I'm invisible what happens that you 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.579
 you see me maybe I had a little bit of 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.620
 I say I'm crazy if I say I'm 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:44.959
 invisible and yes I'm seeing then 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.750
 I have made my friend invisible so that 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.340
 you can verify that it is true that 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.610
 invisible now he has told me that he has 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.630
 got out of 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:58.150
 from the garage and sell me for a hit 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.970
 you have noticed the blow now I am going to go down 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.080
 and I'm going to climb on top of the car 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.330
 seeing that he is shooting me 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.460
 can shoot can lower the car 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.590
 can punch punching can do what 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.620
 you want it is invisible it does not come out in the 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.290
 map is not worth anything is there you can see 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.720
 arm and I'm going to get in the car 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.430
 I'm going to put up the car I go up with 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.409
 tranquility I'm up I'm flying 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.799
 I also have to say one thing that the 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:28.689
 policeman who sees what the others 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.980
 players by yourself who sees us will see us 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:32.500
 invisible but the police yes that 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.120
 they come back so if they give us stars 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.480
 They stripped because otherwise the police 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.549
 is going to kill and if you die you are again 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.700
 normal here the guy was hitting me 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.530
 punching and the truth that is a trick 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.359
 pretty funny if you want to fight 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.189
 some friend or some hit that's out there 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.319
 good in nothing I hope you liked it 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:52.930
