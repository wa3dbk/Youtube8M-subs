3g network close to the indoor antenna

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.930 
3g network close to the indoor antenna
when<00:02:03.350> you<00:02:03.470> are<00:02:03.620> observing<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:04.100> leds<00:02:04.550> on<00:02:04.850> the

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
when you are observing the leds on the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.690 
when you are observing the leds on the
booster<00:02:05.300> make<00:02:06.110> sure<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.440> orange<00:02:06.800> public<00:02:07.250> LED

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
booster make sure the orange public LED

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.940 
booster make sure the orange public LED
does<00:02:07.850> not<00:02:08.000> trigger<00:02:08.209> aren't<00:02:08.750> any<00:02:08.929> stage<00:02:09.170> this

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
does not trigger aren't any stage this

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.880 
does not trigger aren't any stage this
is<00:02:10.070> led<00:02:10.550> to<00:02:10.759> if<00:02:11.660> it<00:02:11.870> does<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.380> solution<00:02:12.800> is

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
is led to if it does the solution is

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.660 
is led to if it does the solution is
lengthen<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.520> cable<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:16.070> other<00:02:16.190> possible

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
lengthen the cable the other possible

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.520 
lengthen the cable the other possible
problem<00:02:17.060> is<00:02:17.480> that<00:02:17.750> there<00:02:17.900> are<00:02:17.930> two<00:02:18.170> operators

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
problem is that there are two operators

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.620 
problem is that there are two operators
maths<00:02:18.860> in<00:02:19.070> the<00:02:19.190> area<00:02:19.430> as<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:20.270> booster<00:02:20.540> is

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
maths in the area as a booster is

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.870 
maths in the area as a booster is
punching<00:02:21.020> at<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.170> wrong<00:02:21.320> must<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:22.459> solution

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
punching at the wrong must the solution

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.940 
punching at the wrong must the solution
is<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.570> rotate<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:24.020> booster<00:02:24.410> until<00:02:24.890> the

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
is to rotate the booster until the

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.210 
is to rotate the booster until the
occasion<00:02:25.250> of<00:02:25.400> signal<00:02:25.760> peak<00:02:29.739> if<00:02:30.739> your<00:02:30.920> mobile

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
occasion of signal peak if your mobile

occasion of signal peak if your mobile
phone<00:02:31.310> operator<00:02:31.820> is<00:02:32.120> on<00:02:32.390> this<00:02:32.540> mask<00:02:32.780> you<00:02:33.320> will

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
phone operator is on this mask you will

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.459 
phone operator is on this mask you will
get<00:02:33.530> excellent<00:02:33.890> indoor<00:02:34.280> coverage
