00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.260
 and they all follow after seeing today with 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:08.620
 a new video and good this other video 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.740
 of Project 64 since I was 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.289
 saying that the link that 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.909
 I put virus does not get virus just that as 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:18.670
 is the mocker because it can be what they are 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:19.720
 the issues but this one has no virus and 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.109
 well I will make a better video 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.820
 explained how you can install the 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.679
 project are four and fill a 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.169
 nintendo 64 emulator in your 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:31.480
 good computer let's start is 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.969
 when the links that are in the 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.850
 description we download the link of the 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:38.739
 nintendo 64 emulator and I left them several 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.550
 rom options to download 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:45.250
 for example that I have super Mario 64 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.070
 first we are going to extract the project 64 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.430
 from the folder that is sponsor to the post 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.780
 right to access here 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.780
 an extract button is going to close 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.500
 here extracted we can already erase this if 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.800
 they want 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.600
 to the open 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.540
 and here it will not appear all the 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.979
 files that the emulator needs 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.260
 we are only going to execute the project 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.260
 from 4 to 4 jdd success point 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.700
 here we select the language what 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:26.210
 that we want for example Spanish 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.530
 and it does not come out anymore this is the interface of 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.630
 emulator 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.420
 good since we have the interface of 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.119
 discovered emulator we minimize it and 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.580
 we are going to extract the rice that we were 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.619
 let's record on the list for example here 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.040
 we have to eat here in right click is 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.040
 bring here 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.680
 and strange 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:55.440
 I have here a rum with ending points 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.560
 764 how are we going to open it up let's go to 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.020
 go to file open round 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.050
 here we will leave a type finder what 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.280
 what we do say is to select it 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.280
 whoever we have it 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.420
 and automatically we will open this on 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.519
 room 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.519
 here we do the emulation started 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.220
 one 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:29.640
 when they want how can you have the rum 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.640
 Now what I am going to teach you is 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:38.420
 here in the video plans 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.420
 we are not going to play anything 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.370
 he either 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.210
 because it says it's something from javascript 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.480
 that you can not but something just 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:56.030
 there may be a problem they have with 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.840
 this has to activate totally 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.709
 disabled 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.569
 if they already dodged it and I appreciate that they have 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.760
 that look for a problem out there because 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.920
 there is something more computer because 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.060
 Normally if you have to work not 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.610
 there have to be problems in nothing 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.870
 and I left many people down here in 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.459
 the description so they get in and it's 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.680
 for us who want some are 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.090
 too many others for example the super 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.090
 mario 8 megas 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:30.620
 and just because they are here to play 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.620
 play but
