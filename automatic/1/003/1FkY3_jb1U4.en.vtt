00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.090
 we the terrorists carried away to the art schools of france went 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.190
 to hit the crates 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.820
 nato who healed by sir so if you want we press the 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.820
 stuff and we can talk about stuff our evening products 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.509
 hariri who answered yes 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.449
 I will say and on the internet 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.230
 how are you going to say hello? 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.730
 he knows he is filmed 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.980
 so I'll talk a little bit about the game because the agent who is a little 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.640
 whatever 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.880
 you can see it 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.570
 the little bags 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.260
 it belongs to a french who tries to defuse the forms 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.550
 that's not to know who it was 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.550
 so I'll go see my brother on hand 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.670
 in Asia we will win again here 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.210
 a good brother and indicated it on the body 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.630
 Why 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.110
 15 hours 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.950
 so she at afp 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.950
 the sea 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.220
 his teammate 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.170
 to prove it 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.070
 here is any bad treatment on poker 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.070
 me 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.370
 so if he was interested 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.210
 so we can see the barrel 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.720
 the patient's soldiers 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.560
 so for example I want you can change lazare so I promise you 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.940
 hunting 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.630
 the state was planning mouth 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.890
 I shoot it makes impacts 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.960
 good luck poverty 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.330
 I am happy 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.920
 so go buy it and in the bins 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.380
 listen to the genre 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.380
 it's not for nothing the doors 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.890
 so I have to see that with humor 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.770
 my character but 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.150
 his serious daughter on the quran is boring because 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.989
 later on I kill someone 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.779
 finally i want to know nobody 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:14.779
 we insist m here is a guy 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.599
 I shot it 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.289
 bastien 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:22.289
 here is the summary of the field 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:26.299
 adjustable to the arbitrary 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.339
 the files 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:32.369
 so to keep the guys who are hanging out workouts 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.849
 for example an amalgam that aims to decipher all 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.849
 these little laptops I talked to you just now 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:43.499
 as far as I can do this the sky 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:46.779
 he scored demolition 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:49.859
 lightning 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:51.489
 m monday 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.489
 that's where the car worked well for 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:59.399
 that's all 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:03.259
 so we can see the pictures of the other players 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:08.449
 wait i'm going 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:09.999
 with marmara 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:12.699
 I suppose 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:14.009
 only do 

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:17.029
 you have to see the person and do not miss it 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.499
 we want to zoom in identical folder 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:23.129
 he said he believed that m 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.589
 attention it appeared identical 6% 

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:27.749
 If I want 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.309
 I can shoot through the wood 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:32.609
 so how does that 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.849
 this checkbook saved 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.149
 she raises 

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:38.559
 morning 

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:41.559
 with clear 

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:45.799
 this one lists the collected pebbles which will sit champions 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:49.699
 only to the Asian recidivism if it has evolved a little 

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:53.399
 crossed with their flash-balls 5 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:55.999
 I am lost 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:58.999
 brazil was las vegas 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.549
 so michael jackson 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.999
 france who thinks that in term 

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:07.999
 at the club since earlier this is insulting to the French 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.979
 but it's good war 

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:12.809
 his parents of children 

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:16.229
 in the club did not take the mouth 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.499
 I hope that before 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:20.400
 but that good comments the country 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.519
 Why 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.560
 because if you promise he was banging on the big short a movie on the 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.629
 right path 

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:32.120
 on their arrival by the earthquake this conference 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.050
 r 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.090
 it is true that 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.090
 it's a bit likely because I do not talk too much about the game 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.940
 see them a little the graphics of the five later a controversy is close 

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:45.469
 it is a player that I am in guinea I do not question 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.830
 this time 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.830
 I am a little worse effect during the shootout pan 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.580
 this time 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.120
 two points separate me so I think my grandpa must work 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.370
 personally 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.779
 it's because there 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:07.610
 they are all alike to a little 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.389
 so I'm going to talk about the game this time it's a bit like in the case of 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:11.080
 big lakes 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.870
 direct mistakes% 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.870
 it's a little war 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:16.810
 but for m 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.810
 the character of 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:26.039
 you deep silence it's possible 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:30.280
 so the basilica saint-pierre in vatican sleiman not there 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.039
 the loot 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:37.039
 in the evening 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:40.939
 here is some paper 

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:43.449
 he's building a real that's going on 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:46.449
 why not a civic role 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.020
 although so obvious that to compensate 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:58.180
 there are guys who make mother banier 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.180
 face death at the end of October at the palace 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:04.639
 with three wins three games 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:07.879
 otherwise we will not be able to come back and will not be able to play with our 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:10.879
 I hope it is but my brother 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:16.809
 so here she 

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:20.149
 we can see inscriptions in Arabic she three women had a third 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.050
 here are the palaces 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.729
 we can think of ap power 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:32.169
 a hair of a point 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:35.169
 they buy fucking 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:38.089
 so I'm able to beat
