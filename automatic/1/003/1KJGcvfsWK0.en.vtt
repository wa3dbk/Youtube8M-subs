00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
their watches and the inspiration behind

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.050 
their watches and the inspiration behind
the<00:01:14.380> watch<00:01:14.530> is<00:01:14.710> very<00:01:14.979> impressive<00:01:15.250> if<00:01:15.670> I<00:01:15.790> we<00:01:15.940> got

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
the watch is very impressive if I we got

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.940 
the watch is very impressive if I we got
some<00:01:16.240> ideas<00:01:16.570> for<00:01:16.930> how<00:01:17.050> we<00:01:17.080> can<00:01:17.380> do<00:01:17.470> our<00:01:17.500> garage

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
some ideas for how we can do our garage

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.140 
some ideas for how we can do our garage
our<00:01:18.369> carriage<00:01:18.670> is<00:01:18.820> obviously<00:01:19.090> very

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
our carriage is obviously very

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.420 
our carriage is obviously very
functional<00:01:19.720> a<00:01:19.780> racetrack<00:01:19.990> but<00:01:20.770> also<00:01:20.979> we<00:01:21.280> want

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
functional a racetrack but also we want

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.130 
functional a racetrack but also we want
to<00:01:21.490> entertain<00:01:21.729> our<00:01:22.030> partners<00:01:22.420> and<00:01:22.570> guests<00:01:22.900> and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
to entertain our partners and guests and

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.510 
to entertain our partners and guests and
it<00:01:23.979> really<00:01:24.250> makes<00:01:24.550> a<00:01:24.790> big<00:01:25.180> impression<00:01:26.520> that's

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
it really makes a big impression that's

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.450 
it really makes a big impression that's
what<00:01:27.729> I<00:01:27.759> love<00:01:28.090> about<00:01:28.240> IWC<00:01:29.170> is<00:01:29.410> it's<00:01:30.190> not<00:01:30.400> just

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
what I love about IWC is it's not just

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.270 
what I love about IWC is it's not just
about<00:01:30.880> a<00:01:31.030> watch<00:01:31.450> that<00:01:32.020> you're<00:01:32.170> buying<00:01:32.440> you<00:01:33.070> buy

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
about a watch that you're buying you buy

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.480 
about a watch that you're buying you buy
into<00:01:33.580> an<00:01:34.090> experience<00:01:34.750> a<00:01:35.170> story<00:01:35.560> but<00:01:36.130> every

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
into an experience a story but every

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.790 
into an experience a story but every
second<00:01:36.970> there<00:01:37.630> is<00:01:37.780> a<00:01:37.810> memory<00:01:38.320> there's<00:01:38.619> some

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
second there is a memory there's some

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.190 
second there is a memory there's some
sort<00:01:38.979> of<00:01:39.040> connection<00:01:39.400> to<00:01:39.880> something<00:01:40.450> I<00:01:40.990> think

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
sort of connection to something I think

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.990 
sort of connection to something I think
the<00:01:41.380> thing<00:01:41.530> that<00:01:41.560> really<00:01:41.950> is<00:01:42.399> brought<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:42.970> life

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
the thing that really is brought to life

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.990 
the thing that really is brought to life
is<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:44.590> reason<00:01:44.979> for<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.250> relationship<00:01:45.819> with

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
is the reason for the relationship with

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.820 
is the reason for the relationship with
the<00:01:46.060> Formula<00:01:46.390> One<00:01:46.539> team<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:47.050> display<00:01:47.470> also

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
the Formula One team the display also

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.260 
the Formula One team the display also
brings<00:01:48.100> to<00:01:48.310> life<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.490> use<00:01:48.910> of<00:01:49.119> different

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
brings to life the use of different

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.210 
brings to life the use of different
materials<00:01:49.929> and<00:01:50.170> how<00:01:50.289> they<00:01:50.440> used<00:01:50.679> in<00:01:50.830> Formula

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
materials and how they used in Formula

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.650 
materials and how they used in Formula
One<00:01:51.369> and<00:01:51.640> how<00:01:52.000> they're<00:01:52.179> used<00:01:52.360> in<00:01:52.509> watch

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
One and how they're used in watch

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.630 
One and how they're used in watch
manufacturer<00:01:53.319> and<00:01:53.470> I<00:01:53.560> think<00:01:53.770> this<00:01:54.220> is<00:01:54.369> way

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
manufacturer and I think this is way

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.730 
manufacturer and I think this is way
beyond<00:01:55.149> just<00:01:55.330> a<00:01:55.720> regular<00:01:56.200> marketing

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
beyond just a regular marketing

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.320 
beyond just a regular marketing
relationship<00:01:57.009> there's<00:01:57.729> that<00:01:57.880> an<00:01:58.030> actual

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
relationship there's that an actual

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.779 
relationship there's that an actual
technology<00:01:59.080> relationship<00:01:59.920> as<00:02:00.069> well<00:02:00.190> when<00:02:00.759> I

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
technology relationship as well when I

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.800 
technology relationship as well when I
think<00:02:00.910> about<00:02:01.240> I<00:02:01.420> CC<00:02:02.259> one<00:02:02.770> key<00:02:03.100> it's

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
think about I CC one key it's

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.760 
think about I CC one key it's
performance<00:02:04.810> one<00:02:05.590> Keys<00:02:05.860> tradition<00:02:06.819> it's<00:02:07.770> so

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
performance one Keys tradition it's so

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.309 
performance one Keys tradition it's so
mordom<00:02:09.580> and<00:02:09.819> different<00:02:10.360> from<00:02:11.020> everything

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
mordom and different from everything

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:11.880 
mordom and different from everything

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
love the look in the feel of the watch

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.490 
love the look in the feel of the watch
is<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.640> craftsmanship<00:02:16.569> it's<00:02:16.810> just<00:02:17.050> so

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
is the craftsmanship it's just so

stellar<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:19.300> I<00:02:19.630> don't<00:02:19.720> think<00:02:20.050> I've<00:02:20.140> ever<00:02:20.380> had

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
stellar and I don't think I've ever had

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.280 
stellar and I don't think I've ever had
to<00:02:20.800> set<00:02:21.100> my<00:02:21.490> watch<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.450> second<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.110> watch
