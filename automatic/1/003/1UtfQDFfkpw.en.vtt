now<00:00:21.279> who<00:00:22.279> uses<00:00:22.670> the<00:00:23.619> deltoid<00:00:24.619> muscle<00:00:25.240> mainly

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
now who uses the deltoid muscle mainly

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.060 
now who uses the deltoid muscle mainly
people<00:00:26.449> exercise<00:00:27.199> a<00:00:27.230> lot<00:00:27.439> we<00:00:27.619> do<00:00:27.830> a<00:00:27.859> lot<00:00:28.039> of
