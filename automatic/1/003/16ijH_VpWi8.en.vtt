00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
well they look nice and stuff but

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.470 
well they look nice and stuff but
they're<00:00:56.250> no<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.579> know<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:57.059> not<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.239> weapon

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
they're no you know it's not a weapon

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
and also the panic attacks shotgun which

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.770 
and also the panic attacks shotgun which
let's<00:01:01.620> be<00:01:01.680> honest<00:01:02.129> nobody<00:01:02.730> really<00:01:03.270> likes<00:01:03.480> here

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
let's be honest nobody really likes here

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.560 
let's be honest nobody really likes here
it's<00:01:03.960> just<00:01:04.170> basically<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.680> beggars<00:01:05.129> bazooka<00:01:05.570> in

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
it's just basically a beggars bazooka in

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.600 
it's just basically a beggars bazooka in
a<00:01:06.720> shotgun<00:01:07.020> form<00:01:07.560> which<00:01:07.890> doesn't<00:01:08.369> work<00:01:08.580> very

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
a shotgun form which doesn't work very

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.450 
a shotgun form which doesn't work very
well<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.720> my<00:01:09.900> honest<00:01:10.290> opinion<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:11.100> guys<00:01:11.280> may

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
well in my honest opinion you guys may

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.710 
well in my honest opinion you guys may
have<00:01:11.490> different<00:01:11.970> ones<00:01:12.090> but<00:01:12.299> that's<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.540> how

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
have different ones but that's just how

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.880 
have different ones but that's just how
I<00:01:12.750> feel<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.590> with<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:15.180> minigun<00:01:16.140> which<00:01:16.590> I

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
I feel so with this minigun which I

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.100 
I feel so with this minigun which I
think<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.340> brings<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.820> lot<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.060> potential<00:01:18.630> and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
think it brings a lot of potential and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.140 
think it brings a lot of potential and
it<00:01:19.170> looks<00:01:19.350> absolutely<00:01:19.619> fantastic<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.939> art

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
it looks absolutely fantastic the art

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.109 
it looks absolutely fantastic the art
design<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.570> textures<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.470> on<00:01:22.680> spot-on<00:01:23.610> and

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
design and textures on it on spot-on and

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.810 
design and textures on it on spot-on and
look<00:01:24.689> really<00:01:25.350> good<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.770> think<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:26.159> has<00:01:26.340> an

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
look really good and I think it has an

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.810 
look really good and I think it has an
extreme<00:01:27.509> amount<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.500> potential<00:01:29.040> because<00:01:29.670> of

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
extreme amount of potential because of

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.310 
extreme amount of potential because of
the<00:01:29.909> style<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.869> way<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.020> it's

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
the style of it in the way that it's

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.429 
the style of it in the way that it's
shaped<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.799> stuff<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.280> feel<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.210> as<00:01:33.360> for<00:01:33.869> the

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
shaped and stuff I feel that as for the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.710 
shaped and stuff I feel that as for the
stats<00:01:34.799> we<00:01:35.100> could<00:01:35.310> have<00:01:35.490> something<00:01:35.939> similar<00:01:36.329> to

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
stats we could have something similar to

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.050 
stats we could have something similar to
the<00:01:37.380> precision<00:01:37.890> powerup<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.909> new

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
the precision powerup in the new

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.410 
the precision powerup in the new
mannpower<00:01:39.600> gamemode<00:01:39.720> we're<00:01:40.610> for<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:42.090> got

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
mannpower gamemode we're for it it's got

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.120 
mannpower gamemode we're for it it's got
a<00:01:42.890> less<00:01:43.890> spread<00:01:44.759> out<00:01:44.970> bullet<00:01:45.570> spread<00:01:45.810> but<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
a less spread out bullet spread but the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.710 
a less spread out bullet spread but the
fire<00:01:47.759> rate<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.270> reduced<00:01:49.009> massively<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.939> or<00:01:51.329> it

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
fire rate is reduced massively so or it

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.080 
fire rate is reduced massively so or it
would<00:01:51.869> be<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:52.020> lot<00:01:52.380> more<00:01:52.409> precision<00:01:53.040> but<00:01:53.790> the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
would be a lot more precision but the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.690 
would be a lot more precision but the
fire<00:01:54.810> rate<00:01:55.170> wouldn't<00:01:55.560> come<00:01:55.740> out<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.159> quick<00:01:56.430> so

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
fire rate wouldn't come out so quick so

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.999 
fire rate wouldn't come out so quick so
it's<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.939> lot<00:01:57.090> more<00:01:57.270> slowed<00:01:57.600> down<00:01:57.899> or<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.829> could

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
it's a lot more slowed down or you could

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.620 
it's a lot more slowed down or you could
do<00:01:59.189> something<00:01:59.909> a<00:02:00.030> little<00:02:00.149> bit<00:02:00.390> more

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
do something a little bit more

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.539 
do something a little bit more
interesting<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.770> lot<00:02:01.890> more<00:02:01.950> different<00:02:02.490> you

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
interesting and a lot more different you

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.050 
interesting and a lot more different you
could<00:02:02.700> have<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:04.280> still<00:02:05.280> has<00:02:05.310> some<00:02:05.790> form

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
could have it so it still has some form

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.969 
could have it so it still has some form
of<00:02:06.149> precision<00:02:06.719> because<00:02:07.049> obviously<00:02:07.200> it's<00:02:07.740> not

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
of precision because obviously it's not

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.979 
of precision because obviously it's not
got<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> massive<00:02:08.580> barrel<00:02:09.119> it's<00:02:09.360> only<00:02:09.539> got<00:02:09.750> one

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
got a massive barrel it's only got one

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.630 
got a massive barrel it's only got one
barrel<00:02:10.440> where<00:02:10.649> any<00:02:10.860> one<00:02:10.979> bullet<00:02:11.250> can<00:02:11.400> come

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
barrel where any one bullet can come

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.979 
barrel where any one bullet can come
through<00:02:11.760> at<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.970> time<00:02:12.209> so<00:02:12.480> obviously<00:02:12.810> there's

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
through at a time so obviously there's

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.580 
through at a time so obviously there's
going<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.140> have<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.349> be

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
going to have to be

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.619 
going to have to be
some<00:02:13.800> form<00:02:14.040> of<00:02:14.099> precision<00:02:14.580> with<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.910> but

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
some form of precision with that but

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.509 
some form of precision with that but
also<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:16.110> can<00:02:16.440> have<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.739> so<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.069> was<00:02:17.220> burst

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
also you can have it so it was burst

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.100 
also you can have it so it was burst
fire<00:02:17.940> or<00:02:18.150> something<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:18.780> wasn't<00:02:19.050> a

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
fire or something so it wasn't a

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.250 
fire or something so it wasn't a
constant<00:02:19.620> string<00:02:20.000> but<00:02:21.000> yeah<00:02:21.330> they<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:22.110> just

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
constant string but yeah they I just

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.220 
constant string but yeah they I just
think<00:02:22.709> that'd<00:02:22.860> be<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.069> really<00:02:23.459> good<00:02:23.730> idea

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
think that'd be a really good idea

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.110 
think that'd be a really good idea
that's<00:02:25.230> just<00:02:25.500> my<00:02:25.800> opinion<00:02:26.010> now<00:02:26.519> and<00:02:26.819> I'd<00:02:26.970> love

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
that's just my opinion now and I'd love

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.420
