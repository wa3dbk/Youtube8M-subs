00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:15.129
 of rare vehicles 5 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:17.160
 today I'll show you where to find the bike 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.980
 of the police 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:30.610
 then it is exactly in this 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:32.980
 point and I advise then that a 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.630
 policeman with I advise before 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.470
 kill him 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.540
 because he will see you so much and then 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.560
 take the bike on the street table 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:47.670

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:54.790
 also minutes and then escape here in the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:58.420
 desert because why the best place 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.969

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.989

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:11.909
 they start to crowd with police 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:15.180
 ok this bike is really beautiful but 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.970

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:40.090

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:44.060
 to say is not found in places too 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.969

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.590
