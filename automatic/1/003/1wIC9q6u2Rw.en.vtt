in<00:00:07.319> this<00:00:07.859> lesson<00:00:08.189> we're<00:00:08.700> going<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:09.090> look<00:00:09.240> at

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
in this lesson we're going to look at

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.390 
in this lesson we're going to look at
one<00:00:09.570> more<00:00:09.599> way<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:09.990> control<00:00:10.379> an<00:00:10.559> image<00:00:10.830> called

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
one more way to control an image called

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.820 
one more way to control an image called
a<00:00:11.549> graduated<00:00:12.299> filter<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.900> want<00:00:13.320> you<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.530> do<00:00:13.650> this

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
a graduated filter I want you to do this

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.490 
a graduated filter I want you to do this
go<00:00:14.309> into<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.789> develop<00:00:15.150> folder<00:00:15.510> and<00:00:15.750> select

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
go into the develop folder and select

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.439 
go into the develop folder and select
this<00:00:16.650> image<00:00:16.830> right<00:00:17.130> here<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.400> go<00:00:18.150> into

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
this image right here and go into

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.769 
this image right here and go into
develop<00:00:19.160> now<00:00:20.160> in<00:00:20.430> this<00:00:20.699> image<00:00:20.970> basically<00:00:21.449> I

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
develop now in this image basically I

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.680 
develop now in this image basically I
have<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.230> problem<00:00:22.800> in<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.730> sky<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.090> I

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:24.690 
have a problem in that the sky is I

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.870 
have a problem in that the sky is I
guess<00:00:24.900> it's<00:00:25.080> okay<00:00:25.440> but<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.160> front<00:00:26.520> needs<00:00:26.730> to

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
guess it's okay but the front needs to

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.580 
guess it's okay but the front needs to
be<00:00:27.060> lightened<00:00:27.449> up<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.780> little<00:00:28.020> bit<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.380> other

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
be lightened up a little bit in other

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.740 
be lightened up a little bit in other
words<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:29.010> need<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.520> control<00:00:29.850> this<00:00:30.119> image<00:00:30.539> in

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
words I need to control this image in

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.500 
words I need to control this image in
pieces<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.529> want<00:00:32.189> one<00:00:32.430> area<00:00:32.730> maybe<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.180> stay<00:00:33.359> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
pieces I want one area maybe to stay the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.630 
pieces I want one area maybe to stay the
same<00:00:33.750> while<00:00:34.350> I'm<00:00:34.530> making<00:00:34.710> another<00:00:35.160> area

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
same while I'm making another area

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.340 
same while I'm making another area
lighter<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.329> there's<00:00:36.660> more<00:00:36.809> than<00:00:36.989> one<00:00:37.140> way<00:00:37.289> to

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
lighter and there's more than one way to

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.860 
lighter and there's more than one way to
do<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.710> but<00:00:38.430> one<00:00:38.640> way<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.850> do<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.539> if

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
do this but one way to do this is if

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.719 
do this but one way to do this is if
you've<00:00:40.019> got<00:00:40.199> these<00:00:40.350> linear<00:00:40.829> lines<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.579> work

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:41.729 
you've got these linear lines to work

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:44.569 
you've got these linear lines to work
with<00:00:41.969> which<00:00:42.210> we<00:00:42.390> do<00:00:42.569> is<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.350> graduated<00:00:44.219> filter

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
with which we do is the graduated filter

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.169 
with which we do is the graduated filter
so<00:00:45.210> it's<00:00:45.510> right<00:00:45.960> here<00:00:46.670> now<00:00:47.670> when<00:00:47.819> you<00:00:47.940> select

00:00:48.169 --> 00:00:48.179 
so it's right here now when you select

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:50.389 
so it's right here now when you select
it<00:00:48.749> basically<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.589> get<00:00:49.800> these<00:00:50.039> different

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
it basically you get these different

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.340 
it basically you get these different
effects<00:00:51.030> right<00:00:51.329> here<00:00:51.510> now<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.690> might<00:00:51.929> not<00:00:52.079> see

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
effects right here now you might not see

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.110 
effects right here now you might not see
this<00:00:52.559> if<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.280> click<00:00:53.549> this<00:00:53.670> button<00:00:53.729> right<00:00:53.999> here

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
this if you click this button right here

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.239 
this if you click this button right here
collapses<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:54.929> open<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.739> again<00:00:55.829> there<00:00:56.129> they

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:56.249 
collapses on open it again there they

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:58.579 
collapses on open it again there they
are<00:00:56.420> temperature<00:00:57.420> exposure<00:00:57.809> all<00:00:58.229> kinds<00:00:58.530> of

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
are temperature exposure all kinds of

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.610 
are temperature exposure all kinds of
things<00:00:58.829> before<00:00:59.429> I<00:00:59.850> begin<00:01:00.449> using<00:01:01.049> the<00:01:01.170> tool<00:01:01.379> if

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
things before I begin using the tool if

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.369 
things before I begin using the tool if
everything<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.639> set<00:01:02.879> exactly<00:01:03.149> like<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.170> I

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
everything is set exactly like this I

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.380 
everything is set exactly like this I
will<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> difficult<00:01:05.280> time<00:01:05.670> figuring<00:01:06.210> out

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
will have a difficult time figuring out

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.330 
will have a difficult time figuring out
exactly<00:01:06.810> how<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.049> set<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.650> usually<00:01:07.860> take

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
exactly how to set it so I usually take

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.789 
exactly how to set it so I usually take
one<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.790> them<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.210> change<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.990> some<00:01:10.200> before<00:01:10.770> I

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
one of them and change it some before I

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.340 
one of them and change it some before I
start<00:01:11.159> like<00:01:11.670> exposure<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.390> come<00:01:12.990> over<00:01:13.080> here<00:01:13.290> and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
start like exposure I come over here and

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.860 
start like exposure I come over here and
begin<00:01:13.560> drawing<00:01:13.830> what<00:01:14.700> it's<00:01:14.850> doing<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
begin drawing what it's doing is in the

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.930 
begin drawing what it's doing is in the
sense<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.410> you<00:01:16.560> can't<00:01:16.770> really<00:01:16.950> see<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.520> but

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
sense and you can't really see this but

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.570 
sense and you can't really see this but
it's<00:01:18.090> drawing<00:01:18.660> a<00:01:18.990> gradient<00:01:19.620> and<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.550> gradient

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
it's drawing a gradient and the gradient

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.360 
it's drawing a gradient and the gradient
that<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.600> drawing<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.290> controlling<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
that it's drawing is controlling the

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.400 
that it's drawing is controlling the
areas<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.450> going<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.720> change<00:01:24.780> from

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
areas that it's going to change from

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.780 
areas that it's going to change from
here<00:01:26.400> down<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.240> from<00:01:28.050> here<00:01:28.410> up<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:29.370> in<00:01:29.580> this

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
here down and from here up so in this

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.180 
here down and from here up so in this
case<00:01:30.120> I<00:01:30.450> drew<00:01:31.050> it<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.590> dragged<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.040> up

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
case I drew it and I dragged it up

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.070 
case I drew it and I dragged it up
because<00:01:32.970> it's<00:01:33.240> going<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.420> go<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.840> change

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
because it's going to go and change

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.200 
because it's going to go and change
things<00:01:34.440> down<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.950> way<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.970> I'm<00:01:36.060> going<00:01:36.180> to

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
things down this way so I'm going to

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.090 
things down this way so I'm going to
pick<00:01:36.330> up<00:01:36.480> the<00:01:36.600> pin<00:01:36.840> right<00:01:37.080> here<00:01:37.140> I'm<00:01:37.860> going<00:01:38.040> to

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
pick up the pin right here I'm going to

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.750 
pick up the pin right here I'm going to
drag<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.490> down<00:01:38.550> to<00:01:39.060> about<00:01:39.510> say<00:01:40.200> there<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.160> can

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
drag that down to about say there I can

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.310 
drag that down to about say there I can
make<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.090> little<00:01:42.390> bit<00:01:42.600> bigger<00:01:42.870> by

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
make this a little bit bigger by

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.290 
make this a little bit bigger by
dragging<00:01:43.890> here<00:01:44.280> or<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:44.610> go<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.730> the<00:01:44.910> edges

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
dragging here or I can go to the edges

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.000 
dragging here or I can go to the edges
right<00:01:45.450> here<00:01:45.690> I<00:01:45.720> can<00:01:45.930> change<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.620> way<00:01:46.800> if

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
right here I can change it this way if

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.040 
right here I can change it this way if
you're<00:01:47.520> rotating<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.480> best<00:01:48.660> thing<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.840> do

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
you're rotating it the best thing to do

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.660 
you're rotating it the best thing to do
is<00:01:49.140> get<00:01:49.260> as<00:01:49.380> far<00:01:49.650> away<00:01:49.920> from<00:01:49.980> the<00:01:50.190> pin<00:01:50.400> as<00:01:50.550> you

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
is get as far away from the pin as you

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.520 
is get as far away from the pin as you
can<00:01:50.909> because<00:01:51.300> it<00:01:51.510> makes<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.720> easier<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.260> make

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
can because it makes it easier to make

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.130 
can because it makes it easier to make
the<00:01:52.650> exact<00:01:53.159> rotation<00:01:54.120> that<00:01:54.330> you<00:01:54.570> want<00:01:54.870> and

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
the exact rotation that you want and

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.750 
the exact rotation that you want and
again<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.409> can<00:01:55.530> get<00:01:55.650> up<00:01:55.770> here<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.010> I<00:01:56.190> can<00:01:56.370> move

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
again I can get up here and I can move

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.730 
again I can get up here and I can move
it<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.090> stretch<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.840> out<00:01:57.930> if<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.230> want<00:01:58.440> to<00:01:58.590> make

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
it and stretch it out if I want to make

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.310 
it and stretch it out if I want to make
that<00:01:58.860> effect<00:01:59.250> more<00:01:59.490> gradual<00:02:00.030> want<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.110> keep

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
that effect more gradual want to keep

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.000 
that effect more gradual want to keep
that<00:02:01.530> down<00:02:01.830> to<00:02:02.280> about<00:02:02.390> there<00:02:03.830> actually<00:02:04.830> that

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
that down to about there actually that

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.440 
that down to about there actually that
doesn't<00:02:05.190> look<00:02:05.310> too<00:02:05.370> bad<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:05.700> far<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:06.360> we're

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
doesn't look too bad so far so we're

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.700 
doesn't look too bad so far so we're
going<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.659> leave<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.050> alone<00:02:07.229> for<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.680> moment

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
going to leave that alone for the moment

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.430 
going to leave that alone for the moment
once<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.879> have<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.119> fixed<00:02:09.539> like<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.289> can

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
once I have it fixed like that I can

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.220 
once I have it fixed like that I can
change<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.890> anytime<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.340> want<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:12.000> can<00:02:12.599> now<00:02:12.870> come

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
change it anytime I want I can now come

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.500 
change it anytime I want I can now come
over<00:02:13.260> here<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:13.890> watch<00:02:14.069> what<00:02:14.280> happens<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:15.389> now

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
over here and watch what happens so now

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.920 
over here and watch what happens so now
I<00:02:15.569> can<00:02:15.749> watch<00:02:16.189> exactly<00:02:17.189> what<00:02:17.790> it's<00:02:17.939> doing<00:02:18.030> now

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
I can watch exactly what it's doing now

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.590 
I can watch exactly what it's doing now
I<00:02:18.959> do<00:02:19.109> want<00:02:19.439> to<00:02:19.499> lighten<00:02:19.950> up<00:02:20.129> the

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
I do want to lighten up the

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.150 
I do want to lighten up the
areas<00:02:20.960> I<00:02:21.110> really<00:02:21.380> would<00:02:21.500> like<00:02:21.620> those<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:22.010> be<00:02:22.130> a

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
areas I really would like those to be a

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.280 
areas I really would like those to be a
little<00:02:22.220> bit<00:02:22.550> lighter<00:02:22.820> go<00:02:23.570> down<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:23.870> sharpness

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
little bit lighter go down to sharpness

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.190 
little bit lighter go down to sharpness
here<00:02:24.470> watch<00:02:24.650> this<00:02:24.950> well<00:02:25.850> I'm<00:02:26.090> trying<00:02:26.570> to<00:02:26.690> maybe

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
here watch this well I'm trying to maybe

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.890 
here watch this well I'm trying to maybe
change<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.280> entire<00:02:28.610> perspective<00:02:29.540> of<00:02:29.750> the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
change the entire perspective of the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.050 
change the entire perspective of the
image<00:02:30.260> in<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.590> sense<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:31.280> make<00:02:31.460> it<00:02:31.580> look<00:02:31.790> more

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
image in a sense to make it look more

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.390 
image in a sense to make it look more
like<00:02:32.270> I<00:02:32.480> had<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.840> lens<00:02:33.050> open<00:02:33.650> when<00:02:34.040> I<00:02:34.070> shot<00:02:34.370> the

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
like I had the lens open when I shot the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.850 
like I had the lens open when I shot the
photo<00:02:34.730> so<00:02:35.210> the<00:02:35.450> Boathouse<00:02:35.960> is<00:02:36.200> out<00:02:36.530> of<00:02:36.650> focus

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
photo so the Boathouse is out of focus

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.550 
photo so the Boathouse is out of focus
and<00:02:37.160> everything<00:02:37.790> else<00:02:38.150> is<00:02:38.360> going<00:02:38.660> into<00:02:39.170> focus

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
and everything else is going into focus

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.190 
and everything else is going into focus
so<00:02:39.710> everything<00:02:40.490> I<00:02:40.670> do<00:02:40.790> here<00:02:41.690> will<00:02:42.080> be

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
so everything I do here will be

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.340 
so everything I do here will be
controlled<00:02:42.620> by<00:02:42.710> that<00:02:42.770> linear<00:02:43.520> gradient<00:02:44.180> I<00:02:44.660> do

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
controlled by that linear gradient I do

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.620 
controlled by that linear gradient I do
want<00:02:45.620> to<00:02:45.650> bring<00:02:45.830> it<00:02:46.040> down<00:02:46.340> just<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:47.330> little<00:02:47.360> bit

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
want to bring it down just a little bit

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.600 
want to bring it down just a little bit
maybe<00:02:47.960> like<00:02:48.200> that<00:02:48.440> so<00:02:48.710> it's<00:02:48.860> not<00:02:49.100> affecting

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
maybe like that so it's not affecting

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.810 
maybe like that so it's not affecting
that<00:02:49.760> water<00:02:50.090> as<00:02:50.360> much<00:02:51.310> something<00:02:52.310> maybe<00:02:52.490> like

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
that water as much something maybe like

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.370 
that water as much something maybe like
that<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.060> I<00:02:53.330> think<00:02:53.390> I'll<00:02:53.660> bring<00:02:53.870> this<00:02:54.080> down

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
that and I think I'll bring this down

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.860 
that and I think I'll bring this down
just<00:02:54.800> a<00:02:54.950> little<00:02:54.980> bit<00:02:55.190> more<00:02:55.430> like<00:02:55.610> this<00:02:55.880> so<00:02:56.720> we

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
just a little bit more like this so we

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.600 
just a little bit more like this so we
don't<00:02:57.050> get<00:02:57.200> that<00:02:57.260> effect<00:02:57.470> over<00:02:57.980> here<00:02:58.220> on<00:02:58.370> the

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
don't get that effect over here on the

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.080 
don't get that effect over here on the
corner

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
corner

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.150 
corner
now<00:02:59.570> I<00:02:59.600> like<00:02:59.960> that<00:02:59.990> we<00:03:00.440> can<00:03:00.590> come<00:03:00.860> back<00:03:00.980> and

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
now I like that we can come back and

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.950 
now I like that we can come back and
work<00:03:01.310> on<00:03:01.490> it<00:03:01.520> if<00:03:01.700> we<00:03:01.820> want<00:03:02.030> to<00:03:02.090> but<00:03:02.600> I<00:03:02.630> want<00:03:02.870> to

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
work on it if we want to but I want to

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.470 
work on it if we want to but I want to
pop<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.440> sky<00:03:03.710> a<00:03:03.740> little<00:03:04.130> bit<00:03:04.280> too<00:03:04.520> so<00:03:05.270> what<00:03:05.390> I'm

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
pop the sky a little bit too so what I'm

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.850 
pop the sky a little bit too so what I'm
going<00:03:05.660> to<00:03:05.750> do<00:03:05.990> is<00:03:06.260> I'm<00:03:06.500> going<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:06.650> draw<00:03:06.830> another

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
going to do is I'm going to draw another

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.500 
going to do is I'm going to draw another
one<00:03:07.130> well<00:03:07.760> you<00:03:07.880> can<00:03:08.000> have<00:03:08.090> as<00:03:08.180> many<00:03:08.330> as<00:03:08.450> you

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
one well you can have as many as you

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.030 
one well you can have as many as you
want<00:03:08.570> and<00:03:09.320> I'm<00:03:09.380> going<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.560> get<00:03:09.680> right<00:03:09.800> about

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
want and I'm going to get right about

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.950 
want and I'm going to get right about
here<00:03:10.460> but<00:03:11.150> I'm<00:03:11.270> going<00:03:11.360> to<00:03:11.420> pull<00:03:11.630> it<00:03:11.660> this<00:03:11.900> way

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
here but I'm going to pull it this way

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.080 
here but I'm going to pull it this way
because<00:03:12.590> I<00:03:12.710> want<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:12.920> impact<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.400> sky<00:03:13.670> that's

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
because I want to impact the sky that's

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.370 
because I want to impact the sky that's
way<00:03:14.270> too<00:03:14.300> much<00:03:14.660> but<00:03:14.900> I'm<00:03:14.990> not<00:03:15.080> going<00:03:15.200> to<00:03:15.260> worry

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
way too much but I'm not going to worry

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.960 
way too much but I'm not going to worry
about<00:03:15.440> that<00:03:15.800> and<00:03:15.950> it<00:03:16.340> also<00:03:16.490> is<00:03:16.670> blurred

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
about that and it also is blurred

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.310 
about that and it also is blurred
because<00:03:17.330> it<00:03:17.420> remembers<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.840> last<00:03:17.990> thing<00:03:18.230> I

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
because it remembers the last thing I

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.290 
because it remembers the last thing I
did<00:03:18.500> which<00:03:18.710> was<00:03:18.950> sharpness<00:03:19.520> again<00:03:20.090> don't

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
did which was sharpness again don't

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.070 
did which was sharpness again don't
worry<00:03:20.480> about<00:03:20.600> that

and<00:03:21.530> start<00:03:21.740> right<00:03:21.860> about<00:03:21.980> there<00:03:22.340> I'm<00:03:23.060> going<00:03:23.180> to

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
and start right about there I'm going to

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.100 
and start right about there I'm going to
bring<00:03:23.510> it<00:03:23.600> up<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:24.380> about<00:03:24.890> there<00:03:25.880> and<00:03:26.480> let's<00:03:26.960> go

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
ahead and see if I can hit that angle

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.570 
ahead and see if I can hit that angle
kind<00:03:29.330> of<00:03:29.390> get<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.600> treeline<00:03:30.050> maybe<00:03:30.920> something

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
kind of get the treeline maybe something

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.990 
kind of get the treeline maybe something
like<00:03:32.030> that<00:03:32.320> okay<00:03:33.350> now<00:03:33.980> with<00:03:34.220> that<00:03:34.460> where<00:03:34.880> I've
