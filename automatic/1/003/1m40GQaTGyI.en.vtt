 balotelli good with the control a 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.600
 then follow, however, aim too high 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:03.820
 the milan minute the striker 29 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.580

 power there is no precision in the 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.960
 conclusion of the midfielder of the 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.360
 lazio minute 43 the specialist andrea

 throw it on a penalty kick try to 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.780
 morens that worries us that 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.000
 however with his fists he rejects the 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.619

 door ends here the first time 1 to 0 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.610
 for Italy an Italy that could do 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.729
 better to close the game anyway 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.500
 suffers little in the second minute shot 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.660
 immediately mario balotelli again 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.520
 protagonist in this diagonal that does not 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.440
 find the door mirror 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.899
 enter Cassano and Fantantonio is the only one 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.910
 immediately to the eleventh mario balotelli is 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.700
 the crossbar to say no to the attacker 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.890
 of Milan who wanted the goal a minute 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.720
 after the same balotelli hides the 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.209
 ball to the opposing defenders goes to 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.160
 cross for candreva that puts his head 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:09.130
 and again the crossbar says no 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.080
 at italy the race goes out no need 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.440
 one of these is alessio cerci 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.330
 that at the thirty-seventh worries 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.720
 maurice who defends herself and takes refuge in 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.000
 angle 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.120
 at the unexpected fortieth arrives the 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.190
 Luxembourg draws football 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.720
 of corner of 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.340
 bush and the header of jean o 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.080
 ice cream the renato curi i anticipates 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.760
 aquilani puts the ball behind 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.470
 buffon for one to one 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.210
 the reaction of Italy with de sciglio 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.990
 that puts the ball in the middle comes from 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.540
 Ignatius Abbot 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.900
 the Milan bomb is the answer 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.390
 still of Maurice and this the last one 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.010
 start of the race ends 1 to 1 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.140
 for Italy it is the seventh game 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.550
 consecutive without victory of the first 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.320
 time he can't beat the 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.210
 luxembourg in its history 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.230
 so the Azzurri leave for Brazil 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.230
 with an alarm bell
