prismacolor<00:00:14.519> because<00:00:15.179> right<00:00:15.330> now<00:00:15.450> use

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
prismacolor because right now use

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.170 
prismacolor because right now use
Crayola<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.230> if<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.340> get<00:00:17.520> prismacolor<00:00:17.820> my

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
Crayola and if I get prismacolor my

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.160 
Crayola and if I get prismacolor my
drawings<00:00:18.510> might<00:00:18.660> look<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.900> bit<00:00:18.930> better

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
drawings might look a bit better

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.029 
drawings might look a bit better
hopefully

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
hopefully

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.720

but<00:00:20.699> anyway<00:00:20.970> so<00:00:21.510> weird<00:00:21.720> phantom<00:00:22.080> foxy<00:00:22.439> and

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
but anyway so weird phantom foxy and

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.830 
but anyway so weird phantom foxy and
then<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.910> like<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.180> way<00:00:24.269> this<00:00:24.420> turned<00:00:24.630> out

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
then I like the way this turned out

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.140 
then I like the way this turned out
except<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.590> use<00:00:25.890> our<00:00:26.130> different<00:00:26.519> marker<00:00:26.910> it's<00:00:27.029> a

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
except I use our different marker it's a

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.599 
except I use our different marker it's a
bad<00:00:27.449> mark<00:00:27.750> over<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.410> know<00:00:28.500> headline<00:00:29.279> him<00:00:29.429> and

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
bad mark over you know headline him and

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.200 
bad mark over you know headline him and
yeah<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:30.779> may<00:00:30.960> look<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.439> bit<00:00:31.560> weird<00:00:31.710> or<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.850> I

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
yeah so may look a bit weird or and I

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.370 
yeah so may look a bit weird or and I
