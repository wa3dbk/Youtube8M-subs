00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
okay here is my very first attempt at a

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.590 
okay here is my very first attempt at a
video<00:00:10.760> making<00:00:11.120> I<00:00:11.620> just<00:00:12.620> received<00:00:13.040> my<00:00:14.379> ear<00:00:15.379> I'm

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:16.600 
video making I just received my ear I'm

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.510 
video making I just received my ear I'm
high<00:00:17.600> output<00:00:18.020> LED<00:00:18.230> light<00:00:18.770> with<00:00:19.160> 81

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
high output LED light with 81

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.019 
high output LED light with 81
interconnected<00:00:20.330> diodes<00:00:20.770> it<00:00:21.770> appears<00:00:22.669> to<00:00:22.880> be

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
interconnected diodes it appears to be

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.310 
interconnected diodes it appears to be
quite<00:00:23.630> small<00:00:24.820> I<00:00:25.820> had<00:00:26.419> no<00:00:26.570> idea<00:00:26.689> it<00:00:27.169> was<00:00:27.259> this

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
quite small I had no idea it was this

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.569 
quite small I had no idea it was this
small<00:00:28.329> but<00:00:29.329> I'm<00:00:29.419> hoping<00:00:29.810> it'll<00:00:30.339> do<00:00:31.339> what<00:00:31.550> I

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
small but I'm hoping it'll do what I

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.540 
small but I'm hoping it'll do what I
need<00:00:31.820> I<00:00:32.470> saw<00:00:33.470> it<00:00:33.560> online<00:00:33.710> somebody<00:00:34.400> else

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
need I saw it online somebody else

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.069 
need I saw it online somebody else
talked<00:00:34.820> about<00:00:35.090> it<00:00:35.210> and<00:00:35.329> thought<00:00:35.660> I<00:00:35.840> should

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
talked about it and thought I should

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:44.140 
talked about it and thought I should
have<00:00:36.260> one<00:00:36.940> well<00:00:38.650> it<00:00:40.690> appears<00:00:41.690> to<00:00:42.140> be<00:00:43.120> what<00:00:44.120> I

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
have one well it appears to be what I

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:53.170 
have one well it appears to be what I
ordered<00:00:44.540> and<00:00:48.760> looks<00:00:49.760> like<00:00:50.320> it<00:00:51.320> will<00:00:51.530> do<00:00:52.180> 6500

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
ordered and looks like it will do 6500

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.540 
ordered and looks like it will do 6500

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
Kelvin 3100 Lux which is quite high and

track and power adapter with switch okay
let's<00:01:05.689> take<00:01:06.049> this<00:01:06.110> out<00:01:07.150> and<00:01:08.380> see<00:01:09.380> what<00:01:09.500> it

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
let's take this out and see what it

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.739 
let's take this out and see what it
looks<00:01:09.619> like

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:10.749 
looks like

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:23.880 
looks like
instruction<00:01:11.749> manual<00:01:11.780> I<00:01:13.509> work<00:01:14.509> for<00:01:18.640> LED<00:01:20.530> lamp

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.270 

very<00:01:24.890> very<00:01:25.640> small<00:01:26.119> I<00:01:26.560> really<00:01:27.560> had<00:01:27.710> no<00:01:27.920> idea<00:01:27.950> it

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
very very small I really had no idea it

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.200 
very very small I really had no idea it
was<00:01:28.340> this<00:01:28.520> small<00:01:29.140> for<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.229> price<00:01:30.469> I<00:01:31.030> guess<00:01:32.030> I

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
was this small for the price I guess I

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.499 
was this small for the price I guess I
should<00:01:32.899> have<00:01:33.049> researched<00:01:33.259> it<00:01:33.710> a<00:01:33.799> lot<00:01:34.100> more

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:45.789 

okay<00:01:39.249> there's<00:01:40.249> the<00:01:40.579> brackets<00:01:44.439> it's<00:01:45.439> just<00:01:45.649> a

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
okay there's the brackets it's just a

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.039 
okay there's the brackets it's just a
metal<00:01:46.159> bracket<00:01:46.700> I<00:01:46.789> think<00:01:47.060> it's<00:01:47.210> encased<00:01:47.689> with

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
metal bracket I think it's encased with

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.020 
metal bracket I think it's encased with
copper<00:01:49.840> or<00:01:50.840> in<00:01:51.049> yeah<00:01:51.439> encased<00:01:52.219> inside<00:01:52.579> with

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
copper or in yeah encased inside with

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:03.390 
copper or in yeah encased inside with
copper<00:01:55.719> our<00:01:56.859> cable<00:01:59.409> and

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.749 

mounting<00:02:04.400> connectors<00:02:05.120> to<00:02:05.480> the<00:02:05.510> aquarium

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.720 

plastic<00:02:10.759> okay<00:02:12.340> here's<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.640> power<00:02:14.030> cord<00:02:14.540> and

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
plastic okay here's the power cord and

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:23.020 
plastic okay here's the power cord and
when<00:02:16.730> I<00:02:16.760> see<00:02:17.090> this<00:02:17.300> attaches<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:20.980> bars<00:02:22.030> to

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
when I see this attaches to the bars to

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.230 
when I see this attaches to the bars to
connect<00:02:23.420> electricity<00:02:24.850> hmm<00:02:25.910> very<00:02:26.360> very<00:02:26.690> small

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
connect electricity hmm very very small

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.310 
connect electricity hmm very very small
really<00:02:29.240> didn't<00:02:29.540> realize<00:02:29.600> it<00:02:30.080> was<00:02:30.140> this<00:02:30.290> small

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
really didn't realize it was this small

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.140 
really didn't realize it was this small
very<00:02:33.320> very<00:02:33.530> small<00:02:34.100> probably<00:02:34.730> not<00:02:34.850> going<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.000> do

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
very very small probably not going to do

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.690 
very very small probably not going to do
what<00:02:35.270> I<00:02:36.310> hoped<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.520> would

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
what I hoped it would

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.120 
what I hoped it would
so<00:02:40.700> that's<00:02:41.570> it

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
so that's it

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.230 
so that's it
guess<00:02:43.130> I<00:02:43.250> have<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.400> put<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:43.580> type<00:02:43.730> together<00:02:44.000> so

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
guess I have to put the type together so

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.150 
guess I have to put the type together so
I'll<00:02:44.390> put<00:02:44.600> you<00:02:44.720> on<00:02:44.750> pause<00:02:44.990> and<00:02:45.440> see<00:02:45.950> what<00:02:46.100> it

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
I'll put you on pause and see what it

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.910 
I'll put you on pause and see what it
looks<00:02:46.310> like<00:02:46.870> all<00:02:47.870> right<00:02:48.050> well<00:02:48.440> here's<00:02:48.650> part

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
looks like all right well here's part

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:57.760 
looks like all right well here's part
two<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:50.500> I've<00:02:51.500> got<00:02:51.740> it<00:02:51.860> installed<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:54.040> is<00:02:56.770> very

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
two and I've got it installed it is very

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.680 
two and I've got it installed it is very
tiny<00:02:58.100> I<00:02:58.280> didn't<00:02:58.610> realize<00:02:58.910> it<00:02:59.150> was<00:02:59.240> this<00:02:59.420> tiny

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
tiny I didn't realize it was this tiny

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.130 
tiny I didn't realize it was this tiny
I've<00:03:00.500> got<00:03:00.650> it<00:03:00.740> on<00:03:00.860> my<00:03:00.980> 29<00:03:01.400> gallon<00:03:01.610> tall<00:03:02.140> but

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
I've got it on my 29 gallon tall but

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.380 
I've got it on my 29 gallon tall but
believe<00:03:03.470> it<00:03:03.590> or<00:03:03.680> not<00:03:04.330> it<00:03:05.330> is<00:03:05.600> very<00:03:06.320> bright<00:03:07.390> it

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
believe it or not it is very bright it

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.940

that<00:03:36.860> white<00:03:37.010> spot<00:03:37.310> there<00:03:37.670> is<00:03:37.790> going<00:03:37.910> to<00:03:37.970> be

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
that white spot there is going to be

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.870 
that white spot there is going to be
Beach<00:03:38.390> white<00:03:38.690> beach<00:03:38.900> scent<00:03:39.230> and<00:03:39.769> back<00:03:40.640> there

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
Beach white beach scent and back there

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.240 
Beach white beach scent and back there
maybe<00:03:41.840> a<00:03:41.959> Stone<00:03:42.650> hedge<00:03:43.239> Stonehenge<00:03:44.239> looking

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
maybe a Stone hedge Stonehenge looking

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.250 
maybe a Stone hedge Stonehenge looking
formation<00:03:46.250> of<00:03:46.489> slate<00:03:48.250> but<00:03:49.570> it<00:03:50.570> is<00:03:50.720> very<00:03:50.989> bright

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
formation of slate but it is very bright

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.590 
formation of slate but it is very bright
I<00:03:51.560> will<00:03:52.100> have<00:03:52.720> that<00:03:53.720> on<00:03:54.019> as<00:03:54.230> well<00:03:54.260> but<00:03:55.600> just

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
I will have that on as well but just

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.630 
I will have that on as well but just
with<00:03:56.750> that<00:03:56.900> little<00:03:57.140> light<00:03:58.120> I'm<00:03:59.120> amazed<00:03:59.540> at<00:04:00.640> the

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
with that little light I'm amazed at the

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.430 
with that little light I'm amazed at the
brightness<00:04:03.430> so<00:04:04.430> hopefully<00:04:04.940> we'll<00:04:05.090> see<00:04:05.239> I

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
brightness so hopefully we'll see I

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.539 
brightness so hopefully we'll see I
guess<00:04:06.440> I<00:04:06.560> should<00:04:06.739> have<00:04:06.769> researched<00:04:07.040> it<00:04:07.459> a

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
guess I should have researched it a

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:14.270 
guess I should have researched it a
little<00:04:07.700> bit<00:04:07.850> more<00:04:09.070> but<00:04:10.070> it<00:04:10.790> is<00:04:10.970> quite<00:04:11.269> bright

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.990 

so<00:04:15.450> that's<00:04:16.450> it<00:04:17.220> it<00:04:18.220> would<00:04:18.310> be<00:04:18.400> perfect<00:04:18.790> for<00:04:18.820> a

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
so that's it it would be perfect for a

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.890 
so that's it it would be perfect for a
much<00:04:19.239> much<00:04:19.510> smaller<00:04:19.750> tank<00:04:20.910> maybe<00:04:21.910> 10<00:04:22.330> 5<00:04:22.660> 10

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
much much smaller tank maybe 10 5 10

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.670 
much much smaller tank maybe 10 5 10
gallon<00:04:23.290> but<00:04:24.220> otherwise<00:04:24.930> it<00:04:25.930> should<00:04:26.260> do<00:04:26.500> the

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
gallon but otherwise it should do the

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.520 
gallon but otherwise it should do the
trick<00:04:26.860> I<00:04:27.040> basically<00:04:27.490> bought<00:04:27.730> it<00:04:27.910> for<00:04:28.530> this

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
trick I basically bought it for this

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.070 
trick I basically bought it for this
particular<00:04:29.830> reason<00:04:30.190> to<00:04:30.550> fill<00:04:30.850> that<00:04:31.080> area

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
particular reason to fill that area

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.570 
particular reason to fill that area
where<00:04:32.260> the<00:04:32.290> plants<00:04:32.620> are<00:04:32.710> going<00:04:32.800> to<00:04:32.890> be<00:04:33.010> on<00:04:33.340> the

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
where the plants are going to be on the

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.240 
where the plants are going to be on the
driftwood<00:04:33.880> other<00:04:34.660> than<00:04:34.930> that<00:04:35.080> that's<00:04:35.860> about

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
driftwood other than that that's about

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
driftwood other than that that's about
it<00:04:36.990> thanks<00:04:37.990> very<00:04:38.050> much<00:04:38.290> for<00:04:38.410> watching<00:04:38.470> hope
