in case we get

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.160 
in case we get
any<00:04:26.130> rage<00:04:26.550> quits<00:04:26.970> with<00:04:27.120> our<00:04:27.270> normal<00:04:27.690> squad<00:04:27.990> we

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
any rage quits with our normal squad we

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.810 
any rage quits with our normal squad we
get<00:04:28.350> to<00:04:28.470> use<00:04:28.620> that<00:04:28.830> one<00:04:29.010> for<00:04:29.040> one<00:04:29.340> match<00:04:29.580> so<00:04:29.760> I

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
get to use that one for one match so I

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.610 
get to use that one for one match so I
think<00:04:29.940> that's<00:04:30.240> quite<00:04:30.420> a<00:04:30.510> good<00:04:30.720> idea<00:04:31.050> sort<00:04:31.560> of

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
think that's quite a good idea sort of

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.170 
think that's quite a good idea sort of
opens<00:04:32.010> it<00:04:32.160> up<00:04:32.190> gives<00:04:32.520> us<00:04:32.670> a<00:04:32.700> chance<00:04:32.790> to<00:04:33.090> use

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
opens it up gives us a chance to use

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.030 
opens it up gives us a chance to use
some<00:04:33.450> different<00:04:33.600> players<00:04:34.380> and<00:04:34.650> stuff<00:04:34.830> like

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
some different players and stuff like

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.400 
some different players and stuff like
that<00:04:35.100> now<00:04:35.730> if<00:04:35.970> we<00:04:36.210> get<00:04:36.510> a<00:04:36.690> hat<00:04:36.990> trick<00:04:37.140> with

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
that now if we get a hat trick with

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.990 
that now if we get a hat trick with
Hulett<00:04:37.710> we<00:04:37.860> would<00:04:38.100> get<00:04:38.280> for<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.610> next<00:04:38.820> game<00:04:38.940> we

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
Hulett we would get for the next game we

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.970 
Hulett we would get for the next game we
play<00:04:39.300> we<00:04:39.810> would<00:04:39.990> get<00:04:40.140> to<00:04:40.290> use<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:40.500> squad<00:04:40.860> on

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
play we would get to use the squad on

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.070 
play we would get to use the squad on
the<00:04:41.070> right<00:04:41.250> which<00:04:41.490> is<00:04:41.520> this<00:04:41.910> one<00:04:42.150> squad<00:04:42.810> number

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
the right which is this one squad number

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.770 
the right which is this one squad number
two<00:04:43.230> would<00:04:43.500> be<00:04:43.680> this<00:04:43.890> a<00:04:44.250> bonus<00:04:44.820> it's<00:04:45.480> a<00:04:45.570> four

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
two would be this a bonus it's a four

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.800 
two would be this a bonus it's a four
triple<00:04:46.080> to<00:04:46.200> side<00:04:46.500> with<00:04:46.890> Man<00:04:47.700> City<00:04:48.000> players<00:04:48.300> at

Juventus<00:04:49.620> play<00:04:49.830> and<00:04:50.160> of<00:04:50.280> course<00:04:50.520> Herr<00:04:50.730> Litten

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
Juventus play and of course Herr Litten

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.000 
Juventus play and of course Herr Litten
climber<00:04:51.240> as<00:04:51.600> well<00:04:51.840> so<00:04:52.230> that<00:04:52.710> should<00:04:52.890> be

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
climber as well so that should be

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.670 
climber as well so that should be
another<00:04:53.340> overpowered<00:04:54.210> really<00:04:54.690> really<00:04:55.170> Opie

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
another overpowered really really Opie

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.480 
another overpowered really really Opie
powerful<00:04:56.600> awesome<00:04:57.600> squad<00:04:57.930> to<00:04:58.110> use<00:04:58.320> for<00:04:59.220> just

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
powerful awesome squad to use for just

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.390 
powerful awesome squad to use for just
one<00:04:59.760> match<00:05:00.060> so<00:05:00.450> that's<00:05:01.320> a<00:05:01.560> cool<00:05:01.800> way<00:05:02.010> to<00:05:02.040> sort

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
one match so that's a cool way to sort

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.920 
one match so that's a cool way to sort
of<00:05:02.520> make<00:05:03.030> the<00:05:03.150> series<00:05:03.510> a<00:05:03.540> little<00:05:03.810> bit

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
of make the series a little bit

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.260 
of make the series a little bit
different<00:05:04.380> as<00:05:04.530> well<00:05:04.710> and<00:05:04.980> perhaps<00:05:05.610> i<00:05:05.910> would<00:05:05.970> do

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
different as well and perhaps i would do

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.210 
different as well and perhaps i would do
it<00:05:06.420> so<00:05:06.630> that<00:05:06.840> if<00:05:06.960> we<00:05:07.110> if<00:05:07.380> we<00:05:07.470> get<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:07.920> hat<00:05:08.100> trick

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
it so that if we if we get the hat trick

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.040 
it so that if we if we get the hat trick
with<00:05:08.430> her<00:05:08.580> lit<00:05:08.730> the<00:05:09.000> next<00:05:09.270> game<00:05:09.420> we<00:05:09.450> play<00:05:09.780> would

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
with her lit the next game we play would

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.080 
with her lit the next game we play would
possibly<00:05:10.320> be<00:05:10.590> one<00:05:10.920> of<00:05:11.040> these<00:05:11.160> live<00:05:11.520> episodes

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
possibly be one of these live episodes

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.820 
possibly be one of these live episodes
where<00:05:12.300> i'm<00:05:12.420> using<00:05:12.720> one<00:05:12.930> of<00:05:12.960> these<00:05:13.200> squads<00:05:13.590> you

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
where i'm using one of these squads you

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.860 
where i'm using one of these squads you
know<00:05:13.980> so<00:05:14.370> that<00:05:14.400> that<00:05:14.970> could<00:05:15.180> possibly<00:05:15.510> be<00:05:15.630> done

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
know so that that could possibly be done

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.920 
know so that that could possibly be done
as<00:05:16.110> well<00:05:16.320> and<00:05:17.190> then<00:05:17.700> the<00:05:17.850> final<00:05:18.030> rule<00:05:18.420> of<00:05:18.720> this

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
as well and then the final rule of this

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.020 
as well and then the final rule of this
series<00:05:19.230> is<00:05:19.590> i<00:05:19.980> was<00:05:20.310> trying<00:05:20.550> to<00:05:20.580> figure<00:05:20.880> out<00:05:20.910> a

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
series is i was trying to figure out a

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.360 
series is i was trying to figure out a
way<00:05:21.300> to<00:05:21.360> involve<00:05:21.960> packs<00:05:22.410> in<00:05:22.740> this<00:05:22.920> series<00:05:23.160> and

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
way to involve packs in this series and

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.710 
way to involve packs in this series and
i<00:05:23.430> couldn't<00:05:23.700> really<00:05:23.850> think<00:05:23.940> of<00:05:24.180> it<00:05:24.330> because

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
i couldn't really think of it because

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.030 
i couldn't really think of it because
obviously<00:05:24.870> i'm<00:05:25.110> not<00:05:25.140> giving<00:05:25.530> myself<00:05:25.650> like

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
obviously i'm not giving myself like

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.530 
obviously i'm not giving myself like
coin<00:05:26.340> bonuses<00:05:26.880> i'm<00:05:27.000> just<00:05:27.180> going<00:05:27.300> to<00:05:27.330> be<00:05:27.450> like

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
coin bonuses i'm just going to be like

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.900 
coin bonuses i'm just going to be like
upgrading<00:05:28.050> players<00:05:28.530> each<00:05:28.680> time<00:05:28.950> so<00:05:29.520> a<00:05:29.550> way

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
upgrading players each time so a way

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.940 
upgrading players each time so a way
that<00:05:30.120> we<00:05:30.240> can<00:05:30.420> involve<00:05:30.840> packs<00:05:31.260> in<00:05:31.530> this<00:05:31.710> series

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
that we can involve packs in this series

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.220 
that we can involve packs in this series
is<00:05:32.220> as<00:05:32.460> follows<00:05:32.790> so<00:05:32.820> every<00:05:33.540> now<00:05:33.690> and<00:05:33.840> again<00:05:33.870> i

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
is as follows so every now and again i

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.410 
is as follows so every now and again i
would<00:05:34.440> say<00:05:34.800> open<00:05:35.250> three<00:05:35.610> packs<00:05:35.880> or<00:05:36.120> something

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
would say open three packs or something

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.030 
would say open three packs or something
like<00:05:36.540> that<00:05:36.600> or<00:05:36.900> maybe<00:05:37.050> if<00:05:37.260> EA<00:05:37.500> released<00:05:37.890> some

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
like that or maybe if EA released some

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.310 
like that or maybe if EA released some
25k<00:05:38.730> packs<00:05:38.970> or<00:05:39.150> something<00:05:39.420> like<00:05:39.480> that<00:05:39.570> perhaps

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
25k packs or something like that perhaps

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.130 
25k packs or something like that perhaps
i<00:05:40.500> would<00:05:40.590> open<00:05:41.220> a<00:05:41.310> couple<00:05:41.520> of<00:05:41.760> them<00:05:41.970> and<00:05:42.720> if<00:05:42.990> I

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
i would open a couple of them and if I

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.110 
i would open a couple of them and if I
packed<00:05:43.410> someone<00:05:43.740> that<00:05:43.830> was<00:05:43.950> lower<00:05:44.460> rated<00:05:44.580> than

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
packed someone that was lower rated than

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.030 
packed someone that was lower rated than
79<00:05:45.780> which<00:05:45.990> is<00:05:46.140> quite<00:05:46.410> likely<00:05:46.650> to<00:05:46.920> happen

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
79 which is quite likely to happen

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.730 
79 which is quite likely to happen
though<00:05:47.370> in<00:05:47.520> some<00:05:47.550> pack<00:05:47.850> luck<00:05:48.090> and<00:05:48.300> I<00:05:49.050> have<00:05:49.590> to

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
though in some pack luck and I have to

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.980 
though in some pack luck and I have to
downgrade<00:05:49.920> a<00:05:50.160> player<00:05:50.460> now<00:05:50.880> that<00:05:51.540> gives<00:05:51.720> sort

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
downgrade a player now that gives sort

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.560 
downgrade a player now that gives sort
of<00:05:52.050> swing<00:05:52.320> both<00:05:52.560> ways<00:05:52.590> because<00:05:53.160> if<00:05:54.000> I<00:05:54.330> open

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 
of swing both ways because if I open

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.840 
of swing both ways because if I open
three<00:05:54.840> packs<00:05:55.080> all<00:05:55.380> of<00:05:55.680> them<00:05:55.830> were<00:05:55.950> below<00:05:56.220> 79

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
three packs all of them were below 79

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.610 
three packs all of them were below 79
rated<00:05:57.330> you<00:05:57.540> know<00:05:57.720> that<00:05:57.930> the<00:05:58.110> best<00:05:58.320> rated

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
rated you know that the best rated

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.680 
rated you know that the best rated
player<00:05:58.800> in<00:05:58.950> that<00:05:58.980> pack<00:05:59.280> was<00:05:59.490> less<00:05:59.670> than<00:05:59.700> 79<00:06:00.300> I'd

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
player in that pack was less than 79 I'd

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.450 
player in that pack was less than 79 I'd
have<00:06:00.870> to<00:06:00.990> downgrade<00:06:01.200> like<00:06:01.590> three<00:06:01.860> players<00:06:02.130> and

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
have to downgrade like three players and

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.580 
have to downgrade like three players and
that<00:06:02.490> could<00:06:02.820> sort<00:06:03.030> of<00:06:03.090> set<00:06:03.300> me<00:06:03.450> right<00:06:03.480> back<00:06:03.900> but

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
that could sort of set me right back but

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.470 
that could sort of set me right back but
on<00:06:04.710> the<00:06:04.770> flip<00:06:04.980> side<00:06:05.010> if<00:06:05.490> I<00:06:05.820> pack<00:06:06.060> someone<00:06:06.360> that

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:06.480 
on the flip side if I pack someone that

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.930 
on the flip side if I pack someone that
was<00:06:06.570> 80<00:06:06.810> to<00:06:07.140> 84<00:06:07.710> rated<00:06:08.190> I<00:06:08.310> would<00:06:08.730> get<00:06:08.850> to

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
was 80 to 84 rated I would get to

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.510 
was 80 to 84 rated I would get to
upgrade<00:06:09.330> a<00:06:09.360> player<00:06:09.660> so<00:06:09.960> if<00:06:10.080> we<00:06:10.110> got<00:06:10.350> 382<00:06:11.070> rated

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
upgrade a player so if we got 382 rated

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.940 
upgrade a player so if we got 382 rated
players<00:06:11.760> in<00:06:12.030> in<00:06:12.450> three<00:06:12.990> consecutive<00:06:13.140> packs<00:06:13.800> or

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:13.950 
players in in three consecutive packs or

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.560 
players in in three consecutive packs or
something<00:06:14.250> we<00:06:14.400> could<00:06:14.520> be<00:06:14.670> up<00:06:14.850> three<00:06:15.210> players

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570
