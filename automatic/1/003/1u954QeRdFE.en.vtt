00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.060
 use a program that will prepare 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:15.190
 The pen drive 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:18.070

 of the vine plan this tutorial is 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:25.070
 divided into two parts the first stage 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:27.939
 would be the preparation of the pendrive 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:32.870
 and the second stage already with the pendrive 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:36.190
 ready let's see how it's done to 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.190
 lift the system 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.280
 to begin with let's use a 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.200
 program that is called yum and that I'm going to 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.750

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.790

 a computer any computer 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.220
 and gray

 he asks me what pendrive I'm going to 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.530
 install would be to select mine 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.630
 they ask me what operating system are we going 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.630
 to use 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.830
 let's find 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:20.610
 windows 7 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.610
 which is the one that is installed 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.259
 and then ask me where 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.060
 is the iso the iso is that the also the 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.280
 I'm going to leave in a link ready for 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.350
 you download it I have it 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.350
 prepared here we are going to look for it

 let's wait for all this to end 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.520
 process 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.500
 I finish completely next 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:15.110
 well we have our pendrive ready 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.060
 to recover the image of the plan 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.330
 Sarmiento I hope you have served them
