 thyme and a few more things 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:30.750
 I will not start the recipe by doing the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.940
 beckham sauce and let's use this 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.340
 Stainless steel pan coated with 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.250
 pottery that is amazing 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.829
 the food does not stick at all 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.910
 You do not even have to put a penguin 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:48.329
 fat beyond logic that triple bottom and 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.809
 heat foods equally 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:55.039

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.000
 chili 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.690
 I'm going to think about the bass guitar 1 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.960
 while the reduced sauce goes to the 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:16.710

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.580

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.009
 salt is a little bit pepper 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.580
 two so close to this recipe that I 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.610
 I do not have a business, it's like a success. 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.750

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:37.250
 sage a leaf of ham and I'll go 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.250

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.710
