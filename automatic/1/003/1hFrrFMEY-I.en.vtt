00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.710 
quick cuz I feel like it needed to go
more<00:02:03.640> quickly<00:02:03.729> because<00:02:04.179> they<00:02:04.300> actually<00:02:04.420> the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
more quickly because they actually the

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.809 
more quickly because they actually the
opening<00:02:05.140> in<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.289> ending<00:02:05.739> are<00:02:05.950> better<00:02:06.340> like

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
opening in the ending are better like

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.059 
opening in the ending are better like
their<00:02:07.270> their<00:02:07.720> paces<00:02:08.020> a<00:02:08.259> little<00:02:08.500> bit<00:02:08.679> quicker

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
their their paces a little bit quicker

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.589 
their their paces a little bit quicker
because<00:02:09.429> obviously<00:02:09.819> it's<00:02:10.300> just<00:02:10.450> a<00:02:10.509> little

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
because obviously it's just a little

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.479 
because obviously it's just a little
opening<00:02:11.020> and<00:02:11.170> ending<00:02:11.260> for<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.650> show<00:02:11.920> but<00:02:12.310> that

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
opening and ending for the show but that

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.309 
opening and ending for the show but that
pace<00:02:12.760> felt<00:02:13.060> better<00:02:13.300> for<00:02:13.629> the<00:02:13.750> type<00:02:13.900> of<00:02:13.930> humor

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319
