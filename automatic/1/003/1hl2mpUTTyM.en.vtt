00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:11.380
 good bittersweet feelings for 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.300
 because good that we have removed from the 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.340
 champions 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:20.320
 sweet feeling for good because I 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.320
 let's say the pressure of 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.039
 one 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.690
 from that very moment that we are in 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:40.730
 decline 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:42.410
 every night I'm happy for the goal 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.120
 but well I think the most important thing 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.070
 here is how the team goes, no no 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.550
 if I do I do not score 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.510
 what happens has to happen that I love 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.339
 out of 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.290
 the day of champions was already good 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:03.210
 think about the local tournament 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.210
 the first team 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.690
 thick 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.960
 we are doing here u2 systems 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.360
 Paul of the defined 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.410
 psychologically important comparatives 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.290
 mark this goal seems 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:24.630
 and we can say yes because I had 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.540
 I wanted to score a goal I already had playing 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.630
 parties and food to eat it from the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.370
 bench so make happy for the 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.380
 I hope that goal is the first of many 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.980
 final the working to focus on the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.630
 video 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.840
 in the local tournament which is what we 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.840
 compete 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.650
 we have not talked to the coach 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.420
 we have seen what I understand 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:07.470
 I already tell the insurance 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.810
 we'll see what happens and I think the most 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:14.630
 important is that if the coaches 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.630
 because as if wanting to add 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.290
 in the Russian league the best possible
