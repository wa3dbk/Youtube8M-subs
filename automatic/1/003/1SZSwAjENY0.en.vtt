00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:45.610

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.330
 go straight into the garage 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.690
 or else if not accelerate a little bit and 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.569
 you will enter the garage 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:02:01.720
 so now we will see directly 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:02:04.660
 that I have two vaka here we are 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:10.479

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:12.040
 glee which you see there we find ourselves for 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.010
 the second part of the video 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.989
 so this time I'm alone so 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.620
 you have many more friends than for the 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:23.260
 first part so the second part 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.690
 you need to mourn 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.110
 to sell your sports cars 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.879
 normally so which is to put 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.270
 a little more car for hiddink is 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.540
 next to your garage 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.460

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.850
 put in the box in the in the 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.590
 garage 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.470
 I wanted to explain a second 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.260
 times of course in the garage makes you 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.790
 sell vambre since remark want 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.940
 you really sell this vehicle you 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.000
 do start or finally geesthacht you 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.010
 go to the playstation store menu or 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.250
 finally playstation network or to man 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.950
 the xbox live market for those at xbox 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.540
 you spammed the x button or there is 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.300
 as soon as you are as soon as the loading 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.260
 start with me the x month button and 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:12.410
 until pick the market after you 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:16.040
 expect that any nickel charge soon 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.920
 that everything charged does round or I do not 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.950
 do not know it must be for a 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.960
 to go back and normally 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.710
 you would reappear in your car 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:31.700
 luxury duke who is for me the vaca 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:34.000
 so we can not do the bug anymore 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.020
 to resell our car so 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.300
 you can be you will be able to sell 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.070
 your luxury car only once per 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.900
 day in the game so all 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.000
 twenty-four minutes what's so it's a 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.709
 a little bit nil but we know better than 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.530
 nothing frankly it's already better than 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.800
 nothing if we have a sure fashion to a hundred thousand 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.450
 euros it's really fast so me 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.890
 it costs only 100 me but hey I'm going 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.470
 do it two or three times and I will not buy 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.660
 the aveyron and I will then do them then 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:05.120
 What do we have to do 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:07.150
 we will sell sell you want 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.880
 you really ride start vehicles 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.380
 playstation store yes so we are waiting for a 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.510
 little bit and there to spam 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.280
 convoys countdown is in the air 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.570
 about this program because if 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.109
 you do it before spoon the 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.750
 loading 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.980
 you are going to sell your vehicle and you 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.230
 can go farther then 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.040
 you see that there is apple stop there 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.040
 we wait for everything loaded 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:35.630
 that is all charged conf and around and 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.960
 normally if everything worked out well you 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:42.080
 fall back into your sports car 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.150
 so I did not specify it needs the train station and 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.169
 the guard and next to that I think 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.509
 everyone is successful 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:50.389
 launch a bug to sell the cars 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:52.759
 but you have to park the car next to 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.629
 los santos custom well on one side because 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:58.310
 that I think we have to fend for ourselves 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:59.900
 not too much either does not need to go 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.020
 at the speed of light either but 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:07.129
 we're not going to do a mission and come back 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:09.979
 really make it go fast enough when 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:11.029
 same logic so the loads are 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:12.889
 pretty long 11 months 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:14.389
 so here you go back into a 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.699
 part me i'm in a party with 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:21.080
 people and it will deconcentrate me juice 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:26.389
 people are not and I hear 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:29.900
 still good brief is definitely back on 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:32.960
 laughs spawn from another vaka that's the 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.400
 class so born late it does not work my 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.419
 friend who was with me before that 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.589
 did not walk for him I do not know 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:38.779
 why it may be because it 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:40.039
 walk but that some cars so 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:45.349
 there you can see that I can sell 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:48.020
 my vehicle at 104 thousand 525 dollars 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:49.189
 so we 're just going to want the number you want 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.490
 really sell his vehicles 

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:54.800
 say I sell them and it stays 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:58.639
 always copy in my garage 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.439
 so after ben repeat that every time 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:03.979
 so it's a little stupid it's necessary 

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:05.389
 a friend with you but good but good 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.580
 So, as you can see 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:08.409
 now I have two hundred and eight thousand 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.879
 dollars 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:13.189
 so it's really a glyph that goes 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:14.990
 save you a lot of money 

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:17.870
 a little less time than normally 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:20.870
 but a lot more than if you bleach 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:24.080
 is pale and I think that can you 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:26.120
 serve so I hope the jtf 5 en does not 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.759
 will not plead what I think this 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:32.120
 video interest them as I think 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:35.930
 to have found this glitch first so 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.939
 that's if you liked this little glitch in 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.279
 the fall it is always fun 

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:42.379
 a comment and subscribe so 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:45.490
 here it was bull is innocent and x 

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:45.490
 hi freeroll
