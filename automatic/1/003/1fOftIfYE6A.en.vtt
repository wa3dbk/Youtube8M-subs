00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 Professor Martin Saavedra talks to us about 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.779
 planning in training 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.779
 related to swimming 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.820
 what 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.100
 t 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.710
 the purpose of any training 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.279
 is to produce physiological adaptations and 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.710
 psychological that allow the swimmer 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.380
 improve your performance the goal is 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.679
 adapt to the organism so that it is capable 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.680
 to give the maximum for this is 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.050
 requires proper planning 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.290
 best way to do it is by dividing the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.010
 year of training in units also 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.360
 called more operational cycles 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.660
 ensuring in this way that the 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.820
 systematic adaptations are 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.340
 correlate with the optimal moment and the 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.289
 just time for more tests 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.719
 important of the calendar and it 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.910
 plan with the objectives of the 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.110
 most important competences during the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.020
 year and the same from there if the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.910
 number of months sessions that 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.880
 usually in a macro cycles and that 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.460
 It can take eight months or it can be 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.670
 an integrated eight-week classic by 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.500
 endesa example in that other cycle 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.540
 differentiates differs in different 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.950
 stages of transition to a period 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.950
 oratory and the competitive period 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:30.600
 of death 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.380
 in each one we have to develop the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.810
 different capacities where they can 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.320
 get sides in the best way to the 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:49.909
 tuning that the final part 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:51.500
 anticipated the competition if you have two 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.800
 nationals in the year in the case of 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.720
 swimming that usually like this 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.540
 plan on those two nationals and 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.590
 then you have tournaments during and during 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:06.200
 those nationals but always aiming 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.729
 here the cargo arrives in the best way and 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.720
 nationals for example are the most 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.310
 important 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.500
 if you have Americans also according to 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.620
 level that has the side if for example 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.170
 you have now competing fans 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.709
 every two every two months that are made more 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.980
 integrated principle where that stage is 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.140
 their period are weekly instead of 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.209
 month the professor martÃ­n saavedra us 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.840
 he counted that federated swimmers 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:35.120
 they have two nationals during the year and 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.580
 now the cars are preparing for 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.459
 a South American meeting and so 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.709
 I exist organizing is generally 78 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.780
 months the first month of transition 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.819
 then a preparatory period where 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.510
 be and is the part 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:53.389
 where we see where we work 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.400
 periodization of force loads the 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:57.260
 style of metric quantity volume the 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.540
 intensity to load the different 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.430
 energy systems 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.450
 and well then pointing to the part 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.489
 competitive where if in a city he was quoted 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.950
 middle bottom background does the most part 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.139
 specific about your test and your 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.060
 equal distance and the face you want that 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:16.909
 have to do to get the best 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.400
 way we now have in two 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:21.829
 skills that are the attempts 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.840
 initials that awana that the frame play 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.340
 in san juan and san luis of those three 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.799
 let's see where the group from which 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.379
 we can engage all and then we 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.900
 we have an October the national that is 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:35.120
 at 750 meters and pitt the area and by 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.879
 first time to the South American that the 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.799
 american universe car that in chile 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:43.200
 at the end of November then we are 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:46.800
 preparing for the national and then 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.629
 make a much more reduced preparation 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.150
 but to get to point something to the ground 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.480
 nationalized Mexican then the other to 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.480
 another month
