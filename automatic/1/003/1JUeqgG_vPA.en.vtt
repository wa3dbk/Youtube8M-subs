00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.199
 bush faces 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:18.989
 collaborated in the shortest time we are here in the park of the alamillo efe 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.029
 in a natural environment like good 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.150
 We were going to take advantage of the 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.689
 this means to be a physical activity 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.449
 under a time schedule for it we will work the range of motion 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.730
 strength and endurance 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.179
 throughout the millennia 

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:36.960
 to work the resistance the ejido 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.470
 run through the park 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.050
 but before starting 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.050
 let's perform a good warm-up 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.990
 It is important to warm up before doing a physical activity for reasons of 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.810
 security 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.840
 since we will do it in a progressive way in intensity so that 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.040
 our heart 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.870
 artery muscles and joints adapt to strength 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.659
 once the billing 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.659
 let's do the stretching series 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.060
 We will start doing a series of stretching exercises which 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.280
 we must keep day 30 seconds and repeating what three to four times 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.670
 the most important thing is that we do not have to feel pain just adopt the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.160
 position and keep it feeling a moderate tension and accompanying it with 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.480
 a breath knows 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.700
 once the heating is done 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.439
 now we can start training through the race 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.490
 we will perform a physical activity a moderate intensity 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.990
 what it means works enough to raise the heart rate 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.440
 Sudan and still not allow to have a fluent conversation 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:14.099
 we eat it 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.429
 for this we will use the carbon formula 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:20.849
 and the data that we have to know is first the intensity 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:26.219
 we want to throw between 50 and 85 percent of the heart rate 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:30.259
 although we will take as reference a range included 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:31.959
 between 60 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.489
 and 75% of the heart rate to develop aerobic resistance to 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.489
 Sometimes low moderate 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:47.169
 in the case that we have a good physical condition I will be momentary 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:50.169
 up to 85% of heart rate 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.760
 Another data to know is our heart rate more and whose author 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.760
 it's so high 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:06.059
 and finally our heart rate basagoiti that we have to 

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.839
 take her 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:08.159
 preferably 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.159
 when waking up in the morning and lying 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.549
 once we have all this data 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.579
 we do the calculation to work intensity now between him 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:25.489
 60 and 75% of another heart rate so that when we're running 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.489
 the accusations varied within integrate or calculated 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.659
 as you see now we are running 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:37.439
 and if we observe our pulsations we see that we are within the interval 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:38.789
 calculated 

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:43.509
 In the event that we do not have a heart rate monitor we have already commented 

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:46.739
 to be able to maintain a conversation without not missing the air 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.079
 to finish we must progressively lower the pace of the race 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.789
 to adapt the organism again to a resting situation 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.489
 and a series of stretches ends in the city 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:10.390
 remember 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.130
 we must also go to cannes 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.749
 before 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:14.509
 and after the exercise
