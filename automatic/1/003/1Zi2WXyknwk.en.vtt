00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.600 
haven't seen the series before basically
what<00:00:09.809> we<00:00:09.960> do<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.290> we<00:00:10.469> work<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.920> break<00:00:11.160> down<00:00:11.370> as

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
what we do is we work to break down as

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.030 
what we do is we work to break down as
much<00:00:12.030> as<00:00:12.090> possible<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.929> good<00:00:13.139> round<00:00:13.349> by<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.769> pro

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
much as possible a good round by a pro

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.070 
much as possible a good round by a pro
player<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.639> this<00:00:15.120> helps<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.480> show<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:15.809> the

player and this helps to show you the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.529 
player and this helps to show you the
ins<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.440> outs<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.830> each<00:00:17.580> element<00:00:18.270> that

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
ins and outs of each element that

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.630 
ins and outs of each element that
contributed<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.439> round<00:00:19.650> so<00:00:19.980> this<00:00:20.430> week

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
contributed to the round so this week

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.740 
contributed to the round so this week
we're<00:00:20.850> going<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.000> take<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.240> look<00:00:21.420> at<00:00:21.539> around

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
we're going to take a look at around

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:34.940 
we're going to take a look at around
played<00:00:22.020> on<00:00:22.170> train<00:00:22.500> by<00:00:22.769> cephus

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.830 

so<00:00:35.950> like<00:00:36.130> most<00:00:36.340> of<00:00:36.580> the<00:00:36.640> clips<00:00:36.850> we<00:00:37.030> do<00:00:37.210> here<00:00:37.480> it

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
so like most of the clips we do here it

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.870 
so like most of the clips we do here it
seems<00:00:38.170> pretty<00:00:38.410> straightforward<00:00:38.800> but<00:00:39.460> the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:39.880 
seems pretty straightforward but the

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.400 
seems pretty straightforward but the
inner<00:00:40.090> workings<00:00:40.630> to<00:00:40.780> the<00:00:40.870> round<00:00:41.050> are<00:00:41.170> kind<00:00:41.350> of

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
inner workings to the round are kind of

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.800 
inner workings to the round are kind of
cool<00:00:41.590> let's<00:00:42.100> run<00:00:42.310> through<00:00:42.460> them<00:00:42.610> ok<00:00:43.390> so<00:00:43.450> right

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:43.810 
cool let's run through them ok so right

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.510 
cool let's run through them ok so right
off<00:00:43.840> the<00:00:43.990> bat<00:00:44.140> Quantic<00:00:44.800> throws<00:00:44.980> a<00:00:45.040> series<00:00:45.490> of

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
off the bat Quantic throws a series of

off the bat Quantic throws a series of
standard<00:00:46.150> smokes<00:00:46.480> and<00:00:46.660> flashes<00:00:47.080> outside<00:00:47.500> that

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
standard smokes and flashes outside that

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.470 
standard smokes and flashes outside that
teams<00:00:48.190> usually<00:00:48.430> throw<00:00:48.910> when<00:00:49.060> they're<00:00:49.180> doing<00:00:49.330> a

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
teams usually throw when they're doing a

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.270 
teams usually throw when they're doing a
quick<00:00:49.660> take<00:00:49.900> and<00:00:50.350> not<00:00:50.530> going<00:00:50.680> to<00:00:50.800> do<00:00:50.890> it<00:00:51.010> here

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
quick take and not going to do it here

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.980 
quick take and not going to do it here
they<00:00:51.520> are<00:00:51.670> going<00:00:51.850> to<00:00:51.940> return<00:00:52.180> to<00:00:52.390> spawn<00:00:52.690> and

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:52.990 
they are going to return to spawn and

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.020 
they are going to return to spawn and
rebuy<00:00:53.410> nades<00:00:53.710> that<00:00:54.010> they<00:00:54.130> need<00:00:54.310> for<00:00:54.550> later<00:00:54.790> and

rebuy nades that they need for later and
they're<00:00:55.330> going<00:00:55.420> to<00:00:55.510> kind<00:00:55.690> of<00:00:55.750> work<00:00:55.870> pics<00:00:56.260> so

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
they're going to kind of work pics so

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.220 
they're going to kind of work pics so
hrg<00:00:57.580> is<00:00:57.700> thinking<00:00:58.120> there's<00:00:58.390> possibly<00:00:58.840> a<00:00:58.960> quick

which<00:02:26.080> I<00:02:26.200> think<00:02:26.410> they<00:02:26.560> did<00:02:26.770> but<00:02:27.400> they<00:02:27.430> wound<00:02:27.730> up

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
which I think they did but they wound up

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.340 
which I think they did but they wound up
falling<00:02:28.120> all<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.510> way<00:02:28.630> back<00:02:28.870> with<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.170> bomb

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
falling all the way back with the bomb

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.470 
falling all the way back with the bomb
so<00:02:29.770> back<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.250> ct's<00:02:30.610> perspective<00:02:31.239> what<00:02:31.390> are

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
so back to the ct's perspective what are

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.570 
so back to the ct's perspective what are
they<00:02:31.569> thinking<00:02:31.750> at<00:02:32.020> this<00:02:32.140> point<00:02:32.230> well<00:02:32.980> FNS

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
they thinking at this point well FNS

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.979

outside so he rotates through Z which is

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.960 
outside so he rotates through Z which is
the<00:02:37.660> right<00:02:37.870> play<00:02:38.170> his<00:02:38.709> only<00:02:39.069> problem<00:02:39.489> here<00:02:39.910> is

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
the right play his only problem here is

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.089 
the right play his only problem here is
he<00:02:40.209> has<00:02:40.300> no<00:02:40.660> idea<00:02:40.690> where<00:02:41.380> symphysis<00:02:41.800> could<00:02:41.980> be

he has no idea where symphysis could be

he has no idea where symphysis could be
at<00:02:42.190> this<00:02:42.340> point<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:42.940> it<00:02:43.090> turns<00:02:43.300> out<00:02:43.480> he'd<00:02:43.780> be

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
at this point and it turns out he'd be

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.600 
at this point and it turns out he'd be
in<00:02:44.019> the<00:02:44.140> perfect<00:02:44.410> position<00:02:44.739> to<00:02:45.040> stop<00:02:45.430> the
