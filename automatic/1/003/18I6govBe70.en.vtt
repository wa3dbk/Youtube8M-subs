00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.249 
release for the Apollo platform since it
the<00:00:11.280> initial<00:00:11.490> introduction<00:00:12.120> in<00:00:12.269> 2012<00:00:12.780> so

the initial introduction in 2012 so
let's<00:00:13.500> take<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.710> look<00:00:13.889> at<00:00:14.009> this<00:00:14.099> Apollo

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
let's take a look at this Apollo

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.490 
let's take a look at this Apollo
expanded<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.360> really<00:00:15.630> three<00:00:15.929> things<00:00:15.960> it

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
expanded is really three things it

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.310 
expanded is really three things it
allows<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.369> mix<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.300> match<00:00:18.539> any<00:00:18.900> for

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
allows you to mix and match any for

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.200 
allows you to mix and match any for
Apollo's<00:00:19.800> in<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.070> same<00:00:20.279> system<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:20.880> we<00:00:21.060> can

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
Apollo's in the same system so we can

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.060 
Apollo's in the same system so we can
connect<00:00:21.539> multiple<00:00:21.990> Apollo's<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.980> then

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
connect multiple Apollo's and then

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.269 
connect multiple Apollo's and then
Apollo<00:00:23.400> twin<00:00:23.789> Apollo<00:00:24.539> 16<00:00:24.810> s<00:00:25.320> Apollo<00:00:25.560> quads<00:00:25.949> any

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
for Apollo's can be mixed and matched in

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.019 
for Apollo's can be mixed and matched in
the<00:00:28.980> same<00:00:29.160> system<00:00:29.550> through<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> single

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
the same system through a single

are<00:01:45.780> all<00:01:45.840> unison<00:01:46.710> enabled<00:01:47.159> distortion<00:01:47.700> pedals

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
are all unison enabled distortion pedals

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.460 
are all unison enabled distortion pedals
so<00:01:48.119> when<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.329> plug<00:01:48.570> into<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.869> high<00:01:49.110> impedance

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
so when you plug into the high impedance

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.130 
so when you plug into the high impedance
input<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.189> your<00:01:50.610> Apollo<00:01:50.939> twin<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.750> actually

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
input on your Apollo twin it actually

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.840 
input on your Apollo twin it actually
changes<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.680> impedance<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.369> allows<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.820> to

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
changes the impedance and allows it to

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.789 
changes the impedance and allows it to
match<00:01:54.119> what<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.509> original<00:01:54.780> impedance<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.619> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
match what the original impedance of the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.649 
match what the original impedance of the
tube<00:01:55.950> screamer<00:01:56.189> was<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.060> actually<00:01:57.270> load

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
tube screamer was so it actually load

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.209 
tube screamer was so it actually load
your<00:01:57.840> pickups<00:01:58.170> properly<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.860> sounds<00:01:59.189> just

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
your pickups properly and it sounds just

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.730 
your pickups properly and it sounds just
like<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.820> original<00:02:00.090> stomp<00:02:00.630> box<00:02:00.840> very<00:02:01.409> cool

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
like the original stomp box very cool

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.709 
like the original stomp box very cool

that you want to get out of these amps
so<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:40.080> Freedman<00:02:40.380> amp<00:02:40.560> collection<00:02:40.890> by<00:02:41.010> brain

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
so the Freedman amp collection by brain

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.610 
so the Freedman amp collection by brain
works<00:02:41.490> also<00:02:42.210> comes<00:02:42.540> with<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.750> bx<00:02:43.080> tanner<00:02:43.350> and

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
works also comes with a bx tanner and

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.040 
works also comes with a bx tanner and
last<00:02:44.130> but<00:02:44.250> not<00:02:44.460> least<00:02:44.520> we're<00:02:45.300> introducing<00:02:45.900> for

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
last but not least we're introducing for

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.200 
last but not least we're introducing for
the<00:02:46.080> first<00:02:46.140> time<00:02:46.470> at<00:02:46.620> an<00:02:46.710> audio<00:02:46.950> interface

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
the first time at an audio interface

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.210 
the first time at an audio interface
auto-tune<00:02:48.210> live<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:48.960> you<00:02:49.620> can<00:02:49.800> actually<00:02:49.950> do

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
auto-tune live so you can actually do

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.160 
auto-tune live so you can actually do
pitch<00:02:50.490> correction<00:02:50.790> informant<00:02:51.420> correction<00:02:51.810> in

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
pitch correction informant correction in

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.780 
pitch correction informant correction in
an<00:02:52.950> audio<00:02:53.280> interface<00:02:53.430> in<00:02:53.910> life<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:54.420> at<00:02:55.110> our

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
an audio interface in life so at our

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.370 
an audio interface in life so at our
high<00:02:56.790> sampling<00:02:57.270> rates<00:02:57.480> this<00:02:57.660> is<00:02:57.840> 1.1

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
high sampling rates this is 1.1

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.900 
high sampling rates this is 1.1
milliseconds<00:02:59.010> latency<00:02:59.370> so<00:02:59.520> it's<00:02:59.640> suitable

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
milliseconds latency so it's suitable

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.180 
milliseconds latency so it's suitable
for<00:03:00.030> onstage<00:03:00.810> performance<00:03:01.440> or<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:01.860> studio

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
for onstage performance or in the studio

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.010 
for onstage performance or in the studio
we're<00:03:02.790> really<00:03:02.970> excited<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.600> original

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
we're really excited the original

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.410 
we're really excited the original
auto-tune<00:03:04.410> it<00:03:04.650> will<00:03:05.310> track<00:03:05.550> MIDI<00:03:05.850> notes<00:03:06.090> and

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
auto-tune it will track MIDI notes and

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.440 
auto-tune it will track MIDI notes and
keyboard<00:03:06.810> scales<00:03:07.140> so<00:03:07.560> very<00:03:08.160> cool<00:03:08.550> so<00:03:09.270> that's
