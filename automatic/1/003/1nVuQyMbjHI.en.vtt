00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 What are you saying, beauty? 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.349
 I'll show the devil's income 3 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:14.250
 on the gtx 550 ti card and remembering that I 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:20.010
 I have 8 GB of memory, right? 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:27.180
 processor is weak core 2 quad 3.2 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:29.699
 ghz and but I already played with her and can 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.350
 see who likes it, I'll do this 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.780
 test and came back recording to you a 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:41.399
 a match that I'm going to make the head and 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:52.710
 show you here there are screen options 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:54.300
 in full resolution with high quality 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.020
 average but there is no difference 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.480
 physics is also not seen 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.409
 difference so more so when you 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.799
 passes over the water is the mark 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.920
 in these kind of things it 's training 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:16.860
 in soil and on average the difference 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:23.490
 more connected to stop the edges a little 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:26.460
 so that of 3d is much reduced 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.770
 also dedicated because it looks like it has 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.350
 explosions much effect so it ends up giving 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:37.409
 so normal so it's more top of the 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.930
 nvidia as soon as you can run from 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.680
 Good , no yes, give it a hassle. 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.380
 they will see the game 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:51.509
 It's what I'm playing with the monk, right? 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.040
 It was already 60, not 150 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.950
 in fact, people say that this 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.130
 here is the most difficult act that having 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:03.259
 Devil has more questions and I'm note 3 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.259
 hotels is much more difficult 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.800
 Come on, let's get the culture together. 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.530
 remembering that you are running background that 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.960
 the program only here is nothing prevents it 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.620
 It's meant to record from second 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:20.530
 plan 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:23.310
 Look at the scent of face with a spirit 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.310
 insufficient 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:32.099
 so when played quiet take 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:36.420
 Carefully helped me with my 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:42.690
 personal position and with conversations with 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:46.580
 She can be underneath you or even take 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.580
 Beware of angry rams 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.950
 the company the price then weight nÃ© 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.760
 she does not want to die and the mother dies 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.290
 it worked out 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.849
 died 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.849
 I left without consensus 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:22.280
 raimundo can see very difficult even though 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.720
 I 'm not here to show you 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.349
 skill in the whole game to show that 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.750
 the performance of that board 's game in the 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:34.380
 game and how you could see the wheel of 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:40.530
 good who interested you like very much 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:43.829
 of that game and if you have this card 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.739
 or you have the game and you want to 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:49.290
 illegal so can choose gtx who 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:54.720
 I want to enjoy the lack of colors. 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:57.870
 now the party is going to be thanks 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.110
 legalistic and came the quality was when 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.180
 we give one here 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:07.190
 that physical part and detailing 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:11.970
 even having average stays perfect 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:13.920
 off is running fine on this 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:19.410
 part that has the effects of the new fire 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.340
 and smoke is also running smoothly and 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.940
 that's right 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.630
 Who liked the video can comment there? 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.320
 any doubt is just to make sure that I 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.680
 to return 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:35.729
 I've already seen some of my videos. 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.460
 the return even takes doubts and help and is 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:43.470
 That's okay, until the next video I 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:46.889
 I'll put is test of other games with 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:50.550
 the gtx 550 other games I got 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:52.630
 recently here and as soon as I can 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.580

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.910
 A hug and even more to everyone and
