00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
down and this weekend's a very good time

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.779 
down and this weekend's a very good time
to<00:00:21.600> do<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:22.410> go<00:00:22.560> ahead<00:00:22.680> put<00:00:23.130> step<00:00:23.369> one<00:00:23.580> down

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
to do that so go ahead put step one down

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.609 
to do that so go ahead put step one down
now<00:00:24.240> if<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.510> are<00:00:24.539> over<00:00:24.960> seeding<00:00:25.230> make<00:00:25.470> sure

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
now if you are over seeding make sure

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.019 
now if you are over seeding make sure
that<00:00:25.769> you're<00:00:25.890> using<00:00:26.039> step<00:00:26.369> one<00:00:26.550> preceding

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
that you're using step one preceding

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.550 
that you're using step one preceding
it's<00:00:27.150> very<00:00:27.359> important<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.750> do<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:27.990> it'll

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
it's very important to do that it'll

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.050 
it's very important to do that it'll
still<00:00:28.920> prevent<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.279> crabgrass<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.730> lot<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.000> the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
still prevent the crabgrass a lot of the

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.339 
still prevent the crabgrass a lot of the
weed<00:00:30.210> seeds<00:00:30.480> from<00:00:30.599> germinating<00:00:30.660> but<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.230> does

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
weed seeds from germinating but it does

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.200 
weed seeds from germinating but it does
allow<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.619> grass<00:00:31.890> seed<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.790> go<00:00:32.940> ahead<00:00:33.090> and

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
allow the grass seed to go ahead and

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.030 
allow the grass seed to go ahead and
germinate<00:00:33.540> also<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.320> doesn't<00:00:34.710> prevent

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
germinate also so it doesn't prevent

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.740 
germinate also so it doesn't prevent
that<00:00:35.219> from<00:00:35.280> happening<00:00:35.460> if<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.300> don't<00:00:36.540> use<00:00:36.719> a

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
that from happening if you don't use a

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.090 
that from happening if you don't use a
step<00:00:36.989> one<00:00:37.140> proceeding<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.590> put<00:00:37.739> grass<00:00:37.920> you

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
step one proceeding and put grass you

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.350 
step one proceeding and put grass you
down<00:00:38.250> or<00:00:38.280> think<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.640> have<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.850> oversee<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.300> at

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
down or think you have to oversee it at

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.030 
down or think you have to oversee it at
some<00:00:39.540> point<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:40.170> will<00:00:40.200> prevent<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.800> grass

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
some point it will prevent that grass

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.319 
some point it will prevent that grass
seed<00:00:41.280> from<00:00:41.430> Germany<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.000> want<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.239> make

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
seed from Germany so you want to make

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.670 
seed from Germany so you want to make
sure<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.570> you're<00:00:42.600> very<00:00:42.870> careful<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.290> and

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
sure that you're very careful that and

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.229 
sure that you're very careful that and
there<00:00:44.070> are<00:00:44.190> advantages<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.640> buying<00:00:44.850> all<00:00:45.030> four

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
there are advantages to buying all four

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.520 
there are advantages to buying all four
steps<00:00:45.510> on<00:00:45.660> one<00:00:45.750> time<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.020> savings<00:00:46.379> are

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
steps on one time the savings are

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.110 
steps on one time the savings are
significant<00:00:47.129> sometimes<00:00:47.430> up<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.610> forty<00:00:48.000> fifty

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
significant sometimes up to forty fifty

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.720 
significant sometimes up to forty fifty
percent<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:49.190> you<00:00:50.190> want<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.399> make<00:00:50.489> sure<00:00:50.520> that

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
percent so you want to make sure that

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.160 
percent so you want to make sure that
you<00:00:50.820> go<00:00:50.940> ahead<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.180> do<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.719> there<00:00:52.050> are

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
you go ahead and do that and there are

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.170 
you go ahead and do that and there are
also<00:00:52.410> very<00:00:52.770> good<00:00:52.949> organic<00:00:53.430> options<00:00:53.730> for<00:00:54.059> that

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
also very good organic options for that

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.340 
also very good organic options for that
as<00:00:54.300> well<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.510> if<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.809> want<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:54.989> take<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> look<00:00:55.260> at

speaking<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.579> fertilizing<00:01:02.969> getting<00:01:03.690> out<00:01:03.840> and

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
speaking of fertilizing getting out and

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.870 
speaking of fertilizing getting out and
fertilizing<00:01:04.559> your<00:01:04.589> shrubs<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.309> bushes<00:01:05.369> is

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
also very important this is the time

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.289 
also very important this is the time
that<00:01:07.890> they<00:01:08.100> really<00:01:08.400> suck<00:01:08.640> up<00:01:08.820> especially<00:01:09.060> as

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
that they really suck up especially as

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.850 
that they really suck up especially as
they're<00:01:09.420> starting<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.780> wake<00:01:09.960> up<00:01:09.990> they<00:01:10.590> really

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
they're starting to wake up they really

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.500 
they're starting to wake up they really
suck<00:01:11.040> up<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.220> fertilizer<00:01:11.760> nutrients<00:01:12.390> and

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
suck up that fertilizer nutrients and

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.940 
suck up that fertilizer nutrients and
it's<00:01:12.600> important<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.930> have<00:01:13.020> some<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.770> that

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
it's important to have some of that
