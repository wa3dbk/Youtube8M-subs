Stone Age maybe it rained a full day and
we<00:01:03.930> put<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> mark<00:01:04.409> on<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.890> wall<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.400> our<00:01:05.489> cave

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
we put a mark on the wall of our cave

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.130 
we put a mark on the wall of our cave
number<00:01:07.619> two<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.010> two<00:01:08.280> marks<00:01:08.810> we<00:01:09.810> haven't<00:01:10.020> gone

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
number two is two marks we haven't gone

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.719 
number two is two marks we haven't gone
out<00:01:10.200> because<00:01:10.530> it's<00:01:10.710> been<00:01:10.860> raining<00:01:11.130> for<00:01:11.340> two

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
out because it's been raining for two

out because it's been raining for two
days<00:01:13.130> three<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:15.150> three<00:01:15.600> marks<00:01:16.310> now<00:01:17.310> we

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
days three is this three marks now we

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.609 
days three is this three marks now we
could<00:01:17.670> put<00:01:17.909> four<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.450> five<00:01:18.689> marks<00:01:19.140> for<00:01:19.380> four

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
could put four and five marks for four

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.100 
could put four and five marks for four
and<00:01:19.740> five<00:01:19.950> but<00:01:20.310> there's<00:01:20.460> an<00:01:20.610> easier<00:01:21.000> way<00:01:21.110> five

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
and five but there's an easier way five

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.210 
and five but there's an easier way five
is<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.670> handful<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.380> an<00:01:25.380> easy<00:01:25.590> way<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.890> mark

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
is a handful and an easy way to mark

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.359 
is a handful and an easy way to mark
that<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.450> V<00:01:28.040> so<00:01:29.040> that's<00:01:29.340> five<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> V<00:01:30.600> now

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
that is a V so that's five is a V now

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.480 
that is a V so that's five is a V now
four<00:01:32.479> we<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.780> take<00:01:33.990> one<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.650> front<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.340> that

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
four we just take one in front of that

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.319 
four we just take one in front of that
in<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.689> one<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.290> like<00:01:37.950> subtraction<00:01:38.729> one<00:01:39.180> in

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
in the one is like subtraction one in

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.670 
in the one is like subtraction one in
front<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:40.049> 5<00:01:40.560> minus<00:01:41.009> 1<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.250> 4<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:42.680> there

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
front of it is 5 minus 1 is 4 and there

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.429 
front of it is 5 minus 1 is 4 and there
we<00:01:43.829> go<00:01:44.009> there's<00:01:44.399> 1<00:01:44.790> 2<00:01:45.000> 3<00:01:45.210> 4<00:01:45.540> 5<00:01:45.780> in<00:01:46.110> Roman

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
we go there's 1 2 3 4 5 in Roman

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.550 
we go there's 1 2 3 4 5 in Roman
numerals<00:01:46.829> then<00:01:47.640> put<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> 1<00:01:48.210> after<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.079> V<00:01:49.259> and

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
numerals then put a 1 after the V and

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.210 
numerals then put a 1 after the V and
there<00:01:50.460> are<00:01:50.549> 6<00:01:50.899> and<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:52.020> course<00:01:52.259> 2<00:01:52.560> ones<00:01:52.829> after

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
there are 6 and of course 2 ones after

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:01.959 
there are 6 and of course 2 ones after
the<00:01:53.430> V<00:01:53.759> which<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.450> 5<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:55.079> 5<00:01:55.649> 6<00:01:55.950> 7<00:01:56.399> +<00:01:56.549> 3<00:01:57.380> is<00:01:58.380> 8<00:01:59.899> now

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
the V which is 5 is 5 6 7 + 3 is 8 now

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:07.050 
the V which is 5 is 5 6 7 + 3 is 8 now
10<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.299> two<00:02:03.840> handfuls<00:02:04.729> that's<00:02:05.729> an<00:02:06.030> X

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
10 is two handfuls that's an X

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.880 
10 is two handfuls that's an X
and<00:02:07.320> if<00:02:08.320> we<00:02:08.800> want<00:02:09.039> to<00:02:09.160> do<00:02:09.340> 9<00:02:09.840> we<00:02:10.840> can<00:02:10.869> just<00:02:11.200> do<00:02:11.440> 1

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
and if we want to do 9 we can just do 1

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.210 
and if we want to do 9 we can just do 1
in<00:02:12.130> front<00:02:12.310> of<00:02:12.490> the<00:02:12.580> X<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.350> there's<00:02:14.350> our<00:02:14.590> 9<00:02:14.830> and

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
in front of the X and there's our 9 and

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.140 
in front of the X and there's our 9 and
there's<00:02:15.820> 1<00:02:16.120> 2<00:02:16.300> 3<00:02:16.330> 4<00:02:16.750> 5<00:02:16.900> 6<00:02:17.230> 7<00:02:17.410> 8<00:02:17.650> 9<00:02:17.710> and<00:02:18.250> 10

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
on till we get to 20 and that's 2 X's a

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:34.080 
on till we get to 20 and that's 2 X's a
real<00:02:28.060> simple<00:02:28.390> system<00:02:29.790> 3<00:02:30.790> X's<00:02:31.330> is<00:02:31.570> 30<00:02:32.020> and<00:02:33.090> when

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
real simple system 3 X's is 30 and when

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.660 
real simple system 3 X's is 30 and when
we<00:02:34.209> get<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.420> every<00:02:34.840> time<00:02:35.050> we<00:02:35.230> get<00:02:35.350> to<00:02:35.500> 5<00:02:35.830> or<00:02:36.340> 10

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
we get to every time we get to 5 or 10

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.960 
we get to every time we get to 5 or 10
it<00:02:37.510> changes<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.560> a<00:02:38.590> new<00:02:38.800> letter<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:40.140> 50<00:02:41.140> is

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
it changes to a new letter so 50 is

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.070 
it changes to a new letter so 50 is
another<00:02:43.230> 5<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:45.030> we<00:02:46.030> can<00:02:46.180> do<00:02:46.270> an<00:02:46.390> L<00:02:46.600> with<00:02:46.930> our

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
another 5 and we can do an L with our

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.320 
another 5 and we can do an L with our
hand<00:02:47.440> so<00:02:48.270> there<00:02:49.270> is<00:02:49.420> our<00:02:49.630> L<00:02:49.959> that's<00:02:50.530> 50<00:02:51.100> in<00:02:51.760> an<00:02:52.090> X

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
hand so there is our L that's 50 in an X

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.229 
hand so there is our L that's 50 in an X
in<00:02:52.630> front<00:02:52.930> of<00:02:53.050> that<00:02:53.140> L<00:02:53.410> is<00:02:53.790> 50<00:02:54.790> minus<00:02:55.450> 10<00:02:55.720> is<00:02:55.989> 40

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
in front of that L is 50 minus 10 is 40

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.010 
in front of that L is 50 minus 10 is 40
so<00:02:58.239> there<00:02:58.420> we<00:02:58.570> go<00:02:58.750> there's<00:02:59.680> 40<00:03:00.220> and<00:03:00.430> 50<00:03:01.270> and<00:03:01.450> an

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
so there we go there's 40 and 50 and an

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.070 
so there we go there's 40 and 50 and an
X<00:03:02.260> after<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:02.890> L<00:03:03.010> of<00:03:03.040> course<00:03:03.400> is<00:03:03.780> easy<00:03:04.780> that's

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
X after the L of course is easy that's

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:13.979 
X after the L of course is easy that's
60<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:07.140> 2<00:03:08.140> X's<00:03:08.590> after<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.220> L<00:03:09.370> is<00:03:10.110> 70<00:03:11.110> and<00:03:12.630> 3<00:03:13.630> X's

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
60 and 2 X's after the L is 70 and 3 X's

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.509 
60 and 2 X's after the L is 70 and 3 X's
after<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.500> L<00:03:14.620> is<00:03:15.010> 50<00:03:16.000> 60<00:03:16.450> 70<00:03:16.870> 80<00:03:17.250> now<00:03:18.250> let's

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
after the L is 50 60 70 80 now let's

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.330 
after the L is 50 60 70 80 now let's
jump<00:03:18.850> to<00:03:19.030> a<00:03:19.060> hundred<00:03:19.540> now<00:03:20.230> a<00:03:20.500> hundred<00:03:21.130> is

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
jump to a hundred now a hundred is

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.570 
jump to a hundred now a hundred is
marked<00:03:22.330> as<00:03:22.540> a<00:03:22.780> new<00:03:23.080> letter<00:03:23.350> is<00:03:23.890> C<00:03:24.340> in<00:03:24.580> a<00:03:25.540> sea<00:03:25.870> a

Centurion<00:03:27.580> was<00:03:27.760> a<00:03:27.820> soldier<00:03:28.209> in<00:03:28.420> Roman<00:03:29.049> times

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
Centurion was a soldier in Roman times

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.860 
Centurion was a soldier in Roman times
with<00:03:29.709> a<00:03:29.739> hundred<00:03:30.160> men<00:03:30.310> under<00:03:30.640> him<00:03:30.790> we<00:03:31.630> still

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
with a hundred men under him we still

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.420 
with a hundred men under him we still
talked<00:03:32.140> about<00:03:32.410> a<00:03:32.440> century<00:03:32.920> is<00:03:33.040> a<00:03:33.070> hundred

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
talked about a century is a hundred

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.069 
talked about a century is a hundred
years<00:03:33.670> it<00:03:33.880> all<00:03:34.030> comes<00:03:34.390> from<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.690> same<00:03:35.100> basics

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
years it all comes from the same basics

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.539 
years it all comes from the same basics
so<00:03:38.079> in<00:03:38.200> X<00:03:38.560> in<00:03:38.920> front<00:03:39.220> of<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.430> sea<00:03:39.670> is<00:03:40.019> 90<00:03:41.019> and

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
so in X in front of the sea is 90 and

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:47.120 
so in X in front of the sea is 90 and
then<00:03:42.549> when<00:03:43.000> we<00:03:43.090> get<00:03:43.239> to<00:03:43.299> 200<00:03:44.110> that's<00:03:44.260> two<00:03:44.650> seas

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.690 

three<00:03:48.130> seas<00:03:48.400> is<00:03:48.670> 300<00:03:49.560> again<00:03:50.560> we'll<00:03:50.739> get<00:03:50.860> to<00:03:51.040> 500

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
three seas is 300 again we'll get to 500

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.030 
three seas is 300 again we'll get to 500
it's<00:03:51.880> going<00:03:52.030> to<00:03:52.090> be<00:03:52.209> a<00:03:52.239> new<00:03:52.450> letter<00:03:52.690> and<00:03:53.040> that's

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
it's going to be a new letter and that's

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.610 
it's going to be a new letter and that's
going<00:03:54.280> to<00:03:54.340> be<00:03:54.519> a<00:03:54.549> d<00:03:55.110> now<00:03:56.110> an<00:03:56.230> easy<00:03:56.380> way<00:03:56.590> to

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
going to be a d now an easy way to

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.039 
going to be a d now an easy way to
remember<00:03:56.739> that<00:03:57.130> is<00:03:57.519> a<00:03:58.079> CD<00:03:59.489> worth<00:04:00.750> $400<00:04:01.750> who<00:04:01.930> is

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
remember that is a CD worth $400 who is

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.310 
remember that is a CD worth $400 who is
probably<00:04:02.440> signed<00:04:02.739> by<00:04:02.920> one<00:04:03.130> of<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.340> Beatles

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
probably signed by one of the Beatles

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:10.690 
probably signed by one of the Beatles
then<00:04:05.320> put<00:04:05.590> a<00:04:05.620> see<00:04:05.980> after<00:04:06.549> the<00:04:06.700> D<00:04:06.989> is<00:04:07.989> 600

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
then put a see after the D is 600

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.599 
then put a see after the D is 600
to<00:04:11.700> seize<00:04:12.030> after<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.080> deed<00:04:13.320> and<00:04:16.220> 703<00:04:17.220> seize

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
to seize after the deed and 703 seize

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.300 
to seize after the deed and 703 seize
after<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.570> D<00:04:18.720> is<00:04:18.900> 800<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:21.560> then<00:04:22.560> we<00:04:22.770> jump<00:04:23.040> to<00:04:23.280> a

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
after the D is 800 and then we jump to a

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.640 
after the D is 800 and then we jump to a
thousand<00:04:23.940> and<00:04:24.060> that's<00:04:24.510> a<00:04:24.720> new<00:04:24.870> letter<00:04:25.140> that's

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
thousand and that's a new letter that's

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.460 
thousand and that's a new letter that's
an<00:04:25.860> M<00:04:26.160> sort<00:04:26.790> of<00:04:26.880> a<00:04:26.970> mega<00:04:27.300> number<00:04:27.740> and<00:04:29.600> it<00:04:30.600> C<00:04:31.380> in

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
an M sort of a mega number and it C in

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.290 
an M sort of a mega number and it C in
front<00:04:31.740> of<00:04:31.830> that<00:04:31.950> is<00:04:32.220> a<00:04:32.280> hundred<00:04:32.880> from<00:04:33.240> a

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
front of that is a hundred from a

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.170 
front of that is a hundred from a
thousand<00:04:33.960> is<00:04:34.140> 900<00:04:34.860> so<00:04:35.430> we<00:04:35.550> practice<00:04:35.820> our

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
thousand is 900 so we practice our

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.400 
thousand is 900 so we practice our
subtraction<00:04:36.420> here<00:04:37.250> two<00:04:38.250> M's<00:04:38.430> is<00:04:39.420> two<00:04:39.810> thousand

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
subtraction here two M's is two thousand

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.940 
subtraction here two M's is two thousand
and<00:04:40.940> then<00:04:41.940> three<00:04:42.419> M's<00:04:42.630> of<00:04:42.930> course<00:04:43.200> is<00:04:43.500> three

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
and then three M's of course is three

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.210 
and then three M's of course is three
thousand<00:04:45.020> now<00:04:46.020> that's<00:04:46.380> all<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.800> numbers<00:04:47.190> that

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
thousand now that's all the numbers that

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.940 
thousand now that's all the numbers that
they<00:04:47.580> had<00:04:47.910> all<00:04:48.270> the<00:04:49.020> letters<00:04:49.350> that<00:04:49.380> they<00:04:49.710> had

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
they had all the letters that they had

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.790 
they had all the letters that they had
and<00:04:50.750> think<00:04:51.750> of<00:04:51.870> all<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.169> numbers<00:04:52.470> that<00:04:52.500> we

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
and think of all the numbers that we

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.280 
and think of all the numbers that we
have<00:04:52.830> in<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:53.640> gigabytes<00:04:54.240> and<00:04:54.600> all<00:04:54.840> the

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
have in the gigabytes and all the

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.010 
have in the gigabytes and all the
different<00:04:55.470> ways<00:04:56.150> well<00:04:57.150> they<00:04:57.360> had<00:04:57.600> a<00:04:57.630> way<00:04:57.870> of

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
different ways well they had a way of

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.570 
different ways well they had a way of
going<00:04:58.200> a<00:04:58.470> little<00:04:58.620> bit<00:04:58.770> further<00:04:59.100> what<00:04:59.370> they

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
going a little bit further what they

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.270 
going a little bit further what they
would<00:04:59.760> do<00:04:59.970> like<00:05:00.270> the<00:05:00.450> next<00:05:00.690> number<00:05:00.990> four<00:05:01.380> would

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
would do like the next number four would

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.340 
would do like the next number four would
be<00:05:02.340> four<00:05:03.090> with<00:05:03.270> a<00:05:03.300> line<00:05:03.570> over<00:05:03.600> it<00:05:03.930> and<00:05:04.110> five

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
be four with a line over it and five

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.070 
be four with a line over it and five
would<00:05:04.650> be<00:05:04.710> a<00:05:04.860> five<00:05:05.430> a<00:05:05.760> V<00:05:06.150> with<00:05:06.330> a<00:05:06.390> line<00:05:06.690> over<00:05:06.720> it

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
would be a five a V with a line over it

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.040 
would be a five a V with a line over it
so<00:05:08.010> they<00:05:08.400> had<00:05:08.760> some<00:05:09.000> tricks<00:05:09.300> around<00:05:09.540> it<00:05:09.900> but

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
so they had some tricks around it but

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.750 
so they had some tricks around it but
they<00:05:10.169> couldn't<00:05:10.410> make<00:05:10.620> all<00:05:10.980> the<00:05:11.220> complicated

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
they couldn't make all the complicated

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.960 
they couldn't make all the complicated
numbers<00:05:12.240> that<00:05:12.450> we<00:05:12.660> make<00:05:12.930> so<00:05:13.650> much<00:05:13.919> easier

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.800 

now<00:05:18.970> look<00:05:19.970> at<00:05:20.120> this<00:05:20.300> number

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
now look at this number

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.870 
now look at this number
this<00:05:20.960> is<00:05:21.880> 1348<00:05:22.880> in<00:05:23.440> our<00:05:24.440> numbers<00:05:25.010> and<00:05:25.310> in<00:05:25.520> Roman

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
this is 1348 in our numbers and in Roman

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:32.740 
this is 1348 in our numbers and in Roman
numerals<00:05:27.430> 1m<00:05:28.430> is<00:05:28.940> a<00:05:28.970> thousand<00:05:31.060> three<00:05:32.060> C's<00:05:32.360> are

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
numerals 1m is a thousand three C's are

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:39.430 
numerals 1m is a thousand three C's are
three<00:05:33.710> hundred<00:05:35.590> Excel<00:05:36.590> is<00:05:36.830> four<00:05:37.310> T<00:05:37.460> and<00:05:37.670> V<00:05:38.230> 1<00:05:39.230> 1

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
three hundred Excel is four T and V 1 1

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.410 
three hundred Excel is four T and V 1 1
1<00:05:39.680> is<00:05:39.710> 8<00:05:41.080> now<00:05:42.080> if<00:05:42.350> we<00:05:42.860> mix<00:05:43.070> them<00:05:43.220> around<00:05:43.420> that's

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:44.420 
1 is 8 now if we mix them around that's

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.610 
1 is 8 now if we mix them around that's
still<00:05:44.810> 40<00:05:45.290> that's<00:05:46.190> still<00:05:46.580> 300<00:05:46.960> that's<00:05:47.960> still<00:05:48.350> 8

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
still 40 that's still 300 that's still 8

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.010 
still 40 that's still 300 that's still 8
and<00:05:48.920> that's<00:05:49.640> still<00:05:50.000> a<00:05:50.030> thousand<00:05:50.690> no<00:05:50.780> matter

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
and that's still a thousand no matter

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.840 
and that's still a thousand no matter
where<00:05:51.320> you<00:05:51.500> put<00:05:51.740> them<00:05:51.920> it<00:05:52.130> doesn't<00:05:52.430> make<00:05:52.700> any

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850 
where you put them it doesn't make any

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.450 
where you put them it doesn't make any
difference<00:05:52.990> can<00:05:53.990> you<00:05:54.020> see<00:05:54.320> that<00:05:54.500> there's

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
difference can you see that there's

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.650 
difference can you see that there's
still<00:05:55.730> the<00:05:55.850> same<00:05:56.090> value<00:05:56.600> it's<00:05:56.840> still<00:05:57.580> 1348<00:05:58.660> now

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
still the same value it's still 1348 now

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.920 
still the same value it's still 1348 now
let's<00:05:59.900> just<00:06:00.080> take<00:06:00.260> the<00:06:00.410> 348<00:06:01.220> in<00:06:01.490> in<00:06:02.480> our

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
let's just take the 348 in in our

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.990 
let's just take the 348 in in our
numbers<00:06:03.350> if<00:06:03.560> you<00:06:03.620> mix<00:06:04.070> them<00:06:04.220> around<00:06:04.550> and<00:06:04.940> put

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
numbers if you mix them around and put

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.720 
numbers if you mix them around and put
them<00:06:05.450> in<00:06:05.540> different<00:06:05.930> places<00:06:06.220> it's<00:06:07.220> different

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 
them in different places it's different

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.700 
them in different places it's different
it's<00:06:08.150> a<00:06:08.360> whole<00:06:08.720> different<00:06:08.960> number<00:06:09.470> worth

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
it's a whole different number worth

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.490 
it's a whole different number worth
twice<00:06:10.190> as<00:06:10.250> much<00:06:10.550> and<00:06:11.080> if<00:06:12.080> you<00:06:12.110> move<00:06:12.350> them

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
twice as much and if you move them

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.590 
twice as much and if you move them
around<00:06:12.620> you<00:06:12.950> get<00:06:13.160> a<00:06:13.190> whole<00:06:13.550> third<00:06:13.940> number<00:06:14.330> so

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
around you get a whole third number so

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.040 
around you get a whole third number so
we're<00:06:15.110> a<00:06:15.410> number<00:06:15.770> is<00:06:16.190> becomes<00:06:17.150> very<00:06:17.450> important

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
we're a number is becomes very important

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.330 
we're a number is becomes very important
this<00:06:18.500> is<00:06:18.710> called<00:06:18.980> place<00:06:19.400> value<00:06:20.919> so<00:06:21.919> zero

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
this is called place value so zero

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.150 
this is called place value so zero
allows<00:06:23.240> us<00:06:23.570> to<00:06:23.750> have<00:06:23.930> place<00:06:24.290> value<00:06:24.740> where<00:06:25.130> a

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 
allows us to have place value where a

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.860 
allows us to have place value where a
number<00:06:25.610> is<00:06:26.140> for<00:06:27.140> instance<00:06:27.500> 5<00:06:28.190> 0<00:06:28.520> 5<00:06:28.850> 0<00:06:28.880> becomes

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 
number is for instance 5 0 5 0 becomes

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.640 
number is for instance 5 0 5 0 becomes
55<00:06:30.500> without<00:06:31.040> the<00:06:31.220> zeros<00:06:31.580> it's<00:06:31.850> just<00:06:32.090> 55<00:06:32.690> it's<00:06:33.590> a

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
55 without the zeros it's just 55 it's a

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.180 
55 without the zeros it's just 55 it's a
whole<00:06:33.860> different<00:06:34.070> number<00:06:35.500> now<00:06:36.500> watch<00:06:36.800> as<00:06:37.040> we

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
whole different number now watch as we

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:43.150 
whole different number now watch as we
add<00:06:37.340> zeros<00:06:38.410> after<00:06:39.410> a<00:06:39.440> number<00:06:41.560> that<00:06:42.560> changes

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 
add zeros after a number that changes

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.510 
add zeros after a number that changes
the<00:06:43.310> value<00:06:44.169> incredibly<00:06:45.169> and<00:06:45.380> if<00:06:46.160> you<00:06:46.250> add<00:06:46.370> them

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 
the value incredibly and if you add them

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.010 
the value incredibly and if you add them
before<00:06:46.850> the<00:06:47.030> number<00:06:47.390> each<00:06:48.380> zero<00:06:49.570> makes<00:06:50.570> it<00:06:50.750> 10

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 
before the number each zero makes it 10

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:57.010 
before the number each zero makes it 10
times<00:06:51.640> different<00:06:52.640> in<00:06:52.820> value<00:06:54.730> so<00:06:55.990> watch<00:06:56.990> for

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.020
