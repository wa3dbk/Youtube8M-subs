00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
of the drywall they have the magnet just

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.110 
of the drywall they have the magnet just
the<00:03:05.410> right<00:03:05.590> size<00:03:05.920> so<00:03:05.950> that<00:03:06.280> it<00:03:06.430> just<00:03:06.790> doesn't

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
the right size so that it just doesn't

target and set it on there I could

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.200 
target and set it on there I could
actually<00:03:13.630> get<00:03:14.020> it<00:03:14.170> to<00:03:14.290> hold<00:03:14.910> but<00:03:15.910> with<00:03:16.180> a

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
actually get it to hold but with a

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.270 
actually get it to hold but with a
simple<00:03:16.660> touch<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:17.140> can<00:03:17.290> see<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:17.740> doesn't<00:03:18.160> hold

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280

it's<00:03:22.750> real<00:03:23.050> easy<00:03:23.080> to<00:03:23.470> tell<00:03:23.830> that<00:03:24.040> you're

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
it's real easy to tell that you're

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.240
