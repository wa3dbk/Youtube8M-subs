00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.250
 hello how are these videos on 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.370
 gagadget.com 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.490
 and today we will tell you about one of 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:22.240
 most anticipated smartphones of 2013 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:25.650
 samsung galaxy s4 in terms of design 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.360
 galaxy s4 is not much different from galaxy s 3 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.180
 times that silver bezel on the sides 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.720
 has become thinner and is now more like 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.600
 metal 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.970
 although of course this metal here and 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.460
 doesn't smell 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.290
 pascal corpus got unobtrusive 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.730
 pattern is clearly visible to him when looking 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.950
 at an angle and even though the increased screen 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:53.080
 smartphone has become less as nickname 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:56.680
 galaxy s4 already a whole millimeter already on 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:59.200
 half a millimeter thinner than galaxy s3 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.770
 so say our English-speaking friends 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.269
 nobody cares 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.290
 the location of the buttons and connectors on the galaxy 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.409
 s4 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:12.009
 not changed under the screen still 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:15.189
 there is a mechanical home button 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:18.999
 next to her touch keys call 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:20.979
 context menu and return on the left 

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:24.569
 faces double adjustment button 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:28.390
 volume on the right key lock 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:33.189
 on the bottom butt as usual 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:35.109
 micro usb connector and main microphone on 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.299
 top end connector for 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:37.929
 headphone 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.079
 auxiliary microphone which 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:43.359
 used by noise reduction system 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.369
 here learned new element this 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:47.969
 red transmitter with which 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.350
 galaxy s4 can control tv 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:52.569
 space robots 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.880
 ships and other household appliances 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:57.130
 the screen already mentioned deserves 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.649
 separate talk five inch 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.340
 full amoled matrix 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.039
 hd 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.670
 produces a very smooth colorful and 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.220
 Contrast image in the settings you can 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.770
 choose one of several modes 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.090
 transmissions for example modes dynamically 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.220
 Perry gives a rich picture 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.769
 color balance and sew it do in 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.270
 cold side 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.390
 standard 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.420
 produces less saturated colors while 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.730
 adobe rgb is closest to the ideal with 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.820
 color point of view is not color 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.530
 balance despite the fact that court pixels in 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.960
 galaxy s4 located according to the scheme 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.150
 pentail negative effects with such 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.520
 sad density is simply not noticeable 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.520
 and so the only serious him myself 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.710
 galaxy s4 screens you can call it not 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.500
 high maximum brightness which 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.530
 is only 282 shackles on 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.780
 square meter in galaxy s4 quite a bit 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.680
 attention was paid to managing 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.020
 help gestures 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.090
 for example, if you hold your hand on 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.000
 smartphone magnified screen then 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.220
 the device will show its status also 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.100
 gestures can draw pictures 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.100
 page gallery in browser and so on 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.170
 in practice it is not only uncomfortable 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.680
 it also worsens the autonomous time 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.810
 work 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.750
 so I advise you to immediately shut down 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.370
 control gestures in the settings and more 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.910
 galaxy s4 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.940
 the screen reacts to gloves but worse than 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.030
 in the same lumia 820 13 megapixel 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.010
 galaxy s4 camera does very 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.580
 quite good pictures both in the afternoon and in 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.500
 twilight but at night the quality 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.660
 predictably falls the phone has 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.810
 several amusing shooting modes 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:43.050
 for example can take pictures of the main and 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.030
 front cameras simultaneously while 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.330
 this is a shot from the front camera 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.790
 pasted into the main photo of the video 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.630
 also recorded good quality 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.630
 with stereo sound 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.230
 by 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.319
 the heart of galaxy s4 is powerful 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.800
 exynos 5 octa processor which consists 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:38.069
 of two quad cores one 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.409
 on the basis of arm cortex a15 works then 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:42.840
 when high is needed 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:45.629
 performance 2 based on arm cortex 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.500
 a7 then when you need to save charge 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:50.009
 battery 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:56.669
 In addition to the use sns 5 octa 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:58.289
 graphics core powervr sgx544mp 3 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.849
 the result is a smartphone shows 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:03.719
 highest results 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:06.659
 most benchmarks at the expense of two 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:08.190
 megabytes of RAM in galaxy s4 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:10.680
 no problems with attracted 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.050
 reloading applications and web pages 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.479
 which then many owners of galaxy 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.919
 s3 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:19.800
 certainly a powerful new iron 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:22.379
 consumes more energy than the old and 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.360
 weak to fight this company 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:28.560
 samsung increased battery capacity in 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:31.259
 galaxy s4 up to 2600 milliampere hours 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.259
 which allowed us to get a little autonomy 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:37.110
 better than the galaxy s3 with the ultimate 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:40.080
 galaxy s4 can be called very successful 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.969
 smartphone it has a high-quality screen 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.039
 excellent camera quality 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:45.500
 performance and quite good 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:48.150
 battery life 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.340
 the only thing to complain about is 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.190
 appearance which acts as a flagship 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:56.219
 other manufacturers however it is not 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:58.580
 prevents us from recommending galaxy s4 to 

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:58.580
 purchase
