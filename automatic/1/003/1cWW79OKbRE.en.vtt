00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
it was the first time I used it so at

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.520 
it was the first time I used it so at
least<00:01:57.070> I<00:01:57.189> know<00:01:57.250> for<00:01:57.670> future<00:01:58.030> anyway<00:01:58.479> so<00:01:59.229> once<00:01:59.409> I

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
least I know for future anyway so once I

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.230 
least I know for future anyway so once I
filled<00:01:59.799> it<00:01:59.920> in<00:02:00.009> with<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.250> pencil<00:02:00.460> I<00:02:00.820> just<00:02:01.090> go

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.430 
just to make sure that I don't get any
fallout<00:03:11.360> because<00:03:11.510> I<00:03:11.720> think<00:03:12.200> it'd<00:03:12.290> be<00:03:12.320> really

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
fallout because I think it'd be really

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.340 
fallout because I think it'd be really
hard<00:03:12.950> to<00:03:13.280> clean<00:03:13.400> up<00:03:13.520> and<00:03:14.090> then<00:03:14.120> I'm<00:03:14.870> literally

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
hard to clean up and then I'm literally

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.590 
hard to clean up and then I'm literally
using<00:03:15.920> a<00:03:16.010> tiny<00:03:16.310> tiny<00:03:16.640> brush<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:17.270> bringing

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
using a tiny tiny brush and bringing

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.750 
using a tiny tiny brush and bringing
this<00:03:17.750> right<00:03:18.500> into<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:18.920> crease<00:03:19.190> and<00:03:19.370> I'm<00:03:19.550> not

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
this right into the crease and I'm not

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.580 
this right into the crease and I'm not
really<00:03:20.060> blending<00:03:20.480> this<00:03:20.570> out<00:03:20.780> at<00:03:20.959> all<00:03:21.140> because

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
really blending this out at all because

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.330 
really blending this out at all because
this<00:03:21.709> look<00:03:21.950> is<00:03:22.100> a<00:03:22.160> very<00:03:22.549> harsh<00:03:23.120> crease<00:03:24.250> so<00:03:25.250> you

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
this look is a very harsh crease so you

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.890 
this look is a very harsh crease so you
just<00:03:25.489> want<00:03:25.640> to<00:03:25.670> be<00:03:25.790> really<00:03:26.180> careful<00:03:26.360> with<00:03:26.690> this

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
just want to be really careful with this

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.870 
just want to be really careful with this
and<00:03:27.260> then<00:03:27.530> once<00:03:27.920> you<00:03:28.070> have<00:03:28.190> in<00:03:28.430> your<00:03:28.610> cut

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
and then once you have in your cut

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.300 
and then once you have in your cut
crease<00:03:29.120> just<00:03:29.180> blend<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:30.170> very<00:03:30.620> outer<00:03:31.010> edge

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
crease just blend the very outer edge

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.850 
crease just blend the very outer edge
nowhere<00:03:32.299> else<00:03:32.450> just<00:03:32.870> the<00:03:33.049> outer<00:03:33.320> corners<00:03:33.830> just

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
nowhere else just the outer corners just

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.720 
nowhere else just the outer corners just
to<00:03:34.220> kind<00:03:34.430> of<00:03:34.519> soften<00:03:35.000> that<00:03:35.120> line<00:03:35.180> slightly<00:03:36.730> so

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
to kind of soften that line slightly so

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.930 
to kind of soften that line slightly so
for<00:03:37.910> my<00:03:38.030> brow<00:03:38.269> bone<00:03:38.600> I'm<00:03:38.900> using<00:03:39.200> this<00:03:39.560> and

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
for my brow bone I'm using this and

eyeshadow in time resist white and I do

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.970 
eyeshadow in time resist white and I do
notice<00:03:46.760> that<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.600> contrast<00:03:48.230> of<00:03:48.410> colors<00:03:48.709> just

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
notice that the contrast of colors just

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.650 
notice that the contrast of colors just
makes<00:03:49.190> this<00:03:49.370> even<00:03:49.580> more<00:03:49.730> dramatic<00:03:50.360> so<00:03:50.390> I'm

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
makes this even more dramatic so I'm

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.420 
makes this even more dramatic so I'm
using<00:03:50.840> kind<00:03:51.080> of<00:03:51.230> white<00:03:51.470> and<00:03:51.500> black<00:03:51.950> and<00:03:52.190> goals

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
using kind of white and black and goals

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.270 
using kind of white and black and goals
but<00:03:53.049> I'm<00:03:54.049> just<00:03:54.290> bringing<00:03:54.709> that<00:03:54.739> to<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.100> brow

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280
