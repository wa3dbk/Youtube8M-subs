00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
you need to understand and master as a

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.760 
you need to understand and master as a
shooter<00:00:34.450> and<00:00:34.660> more<00:00:34.840> importantly<00:00:35.200> as<00:00:35.350> a<00:00:35.380> scorer

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
shooter and more importantly as a scorer

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.310 
shooter and more importantly as a scorer
and<00:00:36.430> that<00:00:36.610> is<00:00:36.820> creating<00:00:37.390> space<00:00:37.780> off<00:00:38.110> the

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
and that is creating space off the

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.260 
and that is creating space off the
dribble<00:00:38.590> and<00:00:38.860> this<00:00:39.010> really<00:00:39.430> separates<00:00:40.030> the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
dribble and this really separates the

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.299 
dribble and this really separates the
so-called<00:00:41.200> pure<00:00:41.500> shooters<00:00:42.010> from<00:00:42.190> the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
keep up okay so as for creating space

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.249

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
to create space to for you to get your

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.260 
to create space to for you to get your
shot<00:01:20.050> off<00:01:20.229> and<00:01:20.470> the<00:01:21.009> main<00:01:21.280> idea<00:01:21.820> with<00:01:22.060> these

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
shot off and the main idea with these

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.060 
shot off and the main idea with these
two<00:01:22.479> moves<00:01:22.750> is<00:01:22.960> to<00:01:23.080> get<00:01:23.259> the<00:01:23.380> defense<00:01:23.830> on<00:01:24.040> your

dribble<00:01:33.190> okay<00:01:33.460> and<00:01:33.850> we<00:01:34.750> got<00:01:34.869> a<00:01:34.899> video<00:01:35.110> in<00:01:35.590> like

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
dribble okay and we got a video in like

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.010 
dribble okay and we got a video in like
15<00:01:36.670> seconds<00:01:37.090> that<00:01:37.270> I'm<00:01:37.360> gonna<00:01:37.450> show<00:01:37.690> you<00:01:37.750> but

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
15 seconds that I'm gonna show you but

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.710 
15 seconds that I'm gonna show you but
the<00:01:38.649> key<00:01:38.920> point<00:01:39.280> here<00:01:39.369> is<00:01:39.640> to<00:01:39.819> get<00:01:40.090> the<00:01:40.240> defense

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
the key point here is to get the defense

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.260 
the key point here is to get the defense
on<00:01:40.959> your<00:01:41.170> hip<00:01:41.470> with<00:01:42.069> these<00:01:42.280> two<00:01:42.580> moves<00:01:42.880> before

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
on your hip with these two moves before

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.330 
on your hip with these two moves before
you<00:01:43.569> rise<00:01:43.840> up<00:01:44.080> and<00:01:44.350> hit<00:01:44.560> your<00:01:44.649> shot<00:01:44.860> in<00:01:45.130> his

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
you rise up and hit your shot in his

00:01:45.340 --> 00:02:01.930 
you rise up and hit your shot in his
face<00:01:45.550> okay<00:01:45.880> so<00:01:46.080> take<00:01:47.080> a<00:01:47.110> look<00:01:47.289> at<00:01:47.410> that<00:01:47.500> video

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.580 

okay<00:02:02.940> so<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.210> hope<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.750> video<00:02:03.900> cleared<00:02:04.320> things

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
okay so I hope that video cleared things

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.590 
okay so I hope that video cleared things
off<00:02:04.830> those<00:02:05.040> two<00:02:05.310> moves<00:02:05.550> are<00:02:05.760> really<00:02:05.970> effective

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
off those two moves are really effective

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.270 
off those two moves are really effective
I<00:02:06.690> know<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:07.020> was<00:02:07.110> kind<00:02:07.260> of<00:02:07.380> dummy<00:02:07.650> defense

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
I know that was kind of dummy defense

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.120 
I know that was kind of dummy defense
there<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.729> video<00:02:08.970> but<00:02:09.149> it's<00:02:09.330> just<00:02:09.540> a<00:02:10.130> shot

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
there in the video but it's just a shot

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.910 
there in the video but it's just a shot
from<00:02:11.460> a<00:02:11.670> workout<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.410> me<00:02:13.410> and<00:02:13.590> one<00:02:13.800> of<00:02:13.830> my

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.250 
it's obviously just one piece of one
small<00:02:26.370> piece<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.940> puzzle<00:02:27.330> in<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:28.050> whole

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
small piece of the puzzle in the whole

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.410 
small piece of the puzzle in the whole
development<00:02:28.980> process<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.820> becoming<00:02:29.970> a

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
development process of becoming a

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.270 
development process of becoming a
prolific<00:02:30.840> shooter<00:02:31.410> not<00:02:31.590> just<00:02:31.800> a<00:02:31.890> shooter<00:02:32.250> who

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
prolific shooter not just a shooter who

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.120 
prolific shooter not just a shooter who
can<00:02:32.640> knock<00:02:33.180> down<00:02:33.209> spot<00:02:33.870> up<00:02:34.020> shots<00:02:34.320> in<00:02:34.560> practice

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
can knock down spot up shots in practice

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.000 
can knock down spot up shots in practice
but<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.610> real<00:02:36.090> shooter<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.810> real<00:02:37.080> scorer<00:02:37.590> who<00:02:37.830> can

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
but a real shooter a real scorer who can

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.580 
but a real shooter a real scorer who can
go<00:02:38.190> out<00:02:38.220> in<00:02:38.630> dominate<00:02:39.630> defenders<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.320> become

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
go out in dominate defenders and become

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.470 
go out in dominate defenders and become
the<00:02:40.709> most<00:02:40.800> deadly<00:02:41.400> player<00:02:41.760> on<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.239> floor

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
the most deadly player on the floor

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.820 
the most deadly player on the floor
because<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:42.900> their<00:02:43.020> shooting<00:02:43.260> ability<00:02:43.709> and

because of their shooting ability and

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.490 
because of their shooting ability and
their<00:02:43.920> scoring<00:02:44.250> ability<00:02:44.459> so<00:02:45.200> obviously<00:02:46.200> this

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
their scoring ability so obviously this

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.350 
their scoring ability so obviously this
