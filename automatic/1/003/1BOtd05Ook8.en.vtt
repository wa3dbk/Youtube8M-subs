the<00:01:17.759> one<00:01:17.939> issue<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.270> did<00:01:18.540> see<00:01:18.810> right<00:01:19.020> out<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
the one issue I did see right out of the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.230 
the one issue I did see right out of the
box<00:01:19.439> though<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.799> with<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.130> power<00:01:20.700> brick<00:01:21.000> it

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
box though is with this power brick it

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.149 
box though is with this power brick it
doesn't<00:01:21.509> have<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.720> flippable<00:01:22.290> retractable

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
doesn't have that flippable retractable

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.850 
doesn't have that flippable retractable
prong<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.970> really<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.720> mobile<00:01:25.049> aspect<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.650> at

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
prong so really the mobile aspect of at

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.010 
prong so really the mobile aspect of at
least<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.159> power<00:01:26.369> brick<00:01:26.580> really<00:01:27.210> quite<00:01:27.570> isn't

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
least the power brick really quite isn't

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.890 
least the power brick really quite isn't
there<00:01:28.259> was<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> not<00:01:30.000> really<00:01:30.030> impressed<00:01:30.659> with

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
there was a not really impressed with

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.600 
there was a not really impressed with
that<00:01:30.930> aspect<00:01:31.560> but<00:01:31.740> we'll<00:01:32.070> see<00:01:32.189> how<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.430> works

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
that aspect but we'll see how it works

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.370 
that aspect but we'll see how it works
in<00:01:32.850> real<00:01:32.909> world<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.509> how<00:01:33.600> annoying<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.140> really

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
in real world and how annoying it really

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.679 
in real world and how annoying it really
is<00:01:34.560> another<00:01:35.400> thing<00:01:35.549> Logitech<00:01:36.030> throws<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.479> is

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
is another thing Logitech throws in is

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.990 
is another thing Logitech throws in is
this<00:01:37.110> kind<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.560> safety<00:01:37.890> warning<00:01:38.520> sheet<00:01:38.790> I

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
this kind of safety warning sheet I

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.490 
this kind of safety warning sheet I
guess<00:01:39.210> it's<00:01:39.390> kind<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.750> legal<00:01:39.960> thing<00:01:40.140> they

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
guess it's kind of a legal thing they
