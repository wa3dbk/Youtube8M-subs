help pupils to mentally visualize what
they're<00:00:13.769> doing<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.700> make<00:00:14.969> it<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.269> little<00:00:15.360> bit

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
they're doing and make it a little bit

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:25.779 
they're doing and make it a little bit
easier<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:17.660> first<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.869> all<00:00:19.050> I'm<00:00:19.230> starting<00:00:20.039> up

60 I'm adding on six so I've added six

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:29.240 
60 I'm adding on six so I've added six
units<00:01:20.100> on<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:21.049> actually<00:01:27.229> how<00:01:28.229> many<00:01:28.290> more<00:01:28.860> do<00:01:29.130> I

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
units on I actually how many more do I

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.450 
units on I actually how many more do I
need<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.729> add<00:01:29.909> on<00:01:30.180> I'm<00:01:30.479> at<00:01:31.020> sick<00:01:31.409> added<00:01:31.829> six<00:01:32.159> I

that gets me 62 which is my answer pause
the<00:01:48.470> video<00:01:48.830> and<00:01:49.310> have<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:49.700> go<00:01:49.910> at<00:01:50.030> these

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
the video and have a go at these

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.200 
the video and have a go at these
questions<00:01:50.720> yourself<00:01:51.320> using<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.490> method<00:01:52.940> of

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
questions yourself using the method of

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:04.180 
questions yourself using the method of
reaching<00:01:54.070> to<00:01:55.070> 10<00:01:56.860> so<00:01:59.830> I<00:02:02.230> know<00:02:03.230> I'm<00:02:03.590> a<00:02:03.890> deal<00:02:04.100> on

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
reaching to 10 so I know I'm a deal on

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.680 
reaching to 10 so I know I'm a deal on
55<00:02:04.970> so<00:02:05.750> I<00:02:05.840> put<00:02:06.200> my<00:02:06.410> tens<00:02:06.800> of<00:02:07.010> my<00:02:07.130> units<00:02:07.640> I<00:02:07.970> will

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
55 so I put my tens of my units I will

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:19.690 
55 so I put my tens of my units I will
start<00:02:09.229> by<00:02:10.100> adding<00:02:10.369> my<00:02:10.910> sister<00:02:18.010> okay<00:02:19.010> for<00:02:19.580> my

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
start by adding my sister okay for my

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.820 
start by adding my sister okay for my
units<00:02:20.330> I'm<00:02:20.900> actually<00:02:21.110> adding<00:02:21.650> on<00:02:22.070> five<00:02:23.560> if<00:02:24.560> I'm

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
units I'm actually adding on five if I'm

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.880 
units I'm actually adding on five if I'm
adding<00:02:25.130> on<00:02:25.520> five<00:02:25.940> that<00:02:26.690> will<00:02:26.810> actually<00:02:27.500> get<00:02:27.710> me

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
adding on five that will actually get me

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.350 
adding on five that will actually get me
to<00:02:28.070> less<00:02:28.340> than<00:02:28.370> 80<00:02:29.000> so<00:02:29.990> I<00:02:30.140> don't<00:02:30.620> leave<00:02:31.150> on<00:02:32.150> this

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
to less than 80 so I don't leave on this

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.800 
to less than 80 so I don't leave on this
one<00:02:32.660> I<00:02:32.990> just<00:02:33.470> need<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:33.800> add<00:02:34.010> on<00:02:34.340> five<00:02:34.670> gets<00:02:35.540> into

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
one I just need to add on five gets into

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.380 
one I just need to add on five gets into
78

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.900 

my<00:02:40.390> answer<00:02:41.260> now<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:44.410> bottom<00:02:44.920> one<00:02:45.130> I<00:02:45.340> am<00:02:45.670> going

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
my answer now the bottom one I am going

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.250 
my answer now the bottom one I am going
to<00:02:45.970> have<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.210> start<00:02:46.450> bridging<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.900> gap<00:02:47.080> so

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
to have to start bridging the gap so

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.770 
to have to start bridging the gap so
they<00:02:47.380> look<00:02:47.530> at<00:02:47.620> that<00:02:47.710> one<00:02:47.830> together<00:02:48.780> starting

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
they look at that one together starting

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:57.900 
they look at that one together starting
at<00:02:50.320> thirty<00:02:50.800> seven<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:55.630> eight<00:02:56.520> I've<00:02:57.520> done<00:02:57.760> my

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
at thirty seven and eight I've done my

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.949 
at thirty seven and eight I've done my
ten<00:02:58.270> Spears<00:02:58.720> I'm<00:02:59.620> adding<00:03:00.160> on<00:03:00.280> 40<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:01.750> that

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
ten Spears I'm adding on 40 and that

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.930 
ten Spears I'm adding on 40 and that
gets<00:03:02.320> me<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:03.330> 77<00:03:04.330> now<00:03:05.290> I<00:03:05.620> know<00:03:05.950> if<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:06.459> add<00:03:06.700> on

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
gets me to 77 now I know if I add on

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.680 
gets me to 77 now I know if I add on
eight<00:03:07.300> to<00:03:07.780> 77<00:03:08.709> it<00:03:09.250> will<00:03:09.459> go<00:03:09.670> into<00:03:10.000> my<00:03:10.300> tens

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
eight to 77 it will go into my tens

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.449 
eight to 77 it will go into my tens
column<00:03:11.250> so<00:03:12.250> make<00:03:12.580> it<00:03:12.850> more<00:03:13.600> than<00:03:14.020> 80<00:03:14.380> so<00:03:15.340> my

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
column so make it more than 80 so my

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.830 
column so make it more than 80 so my
first<00:03:15.790> step<00:03:16.239> is<00:03:16.540> I'm<00:03:17.140> gonna<00:03:17.410> make<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.920> up<00:03:18.190> to<00:03:18.220> 80

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
first step is I'm gonna make it up to 80

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.100 
first step is I'm gonna make it up to 80
that's<00:03:19.840> adding<00:03:20.350> on<00:03:20.500> three<00:03:21.270> I've<00:03:22.270> added<00:03:22.750> on

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
that's adding on three I've added on

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
that's adding on three I've added on
three<00:03:23.560> but<00:03:24.190> I<00:03:24.220> need<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:24.880> add<00:03:25.090> on<00:03:25.390> eight<00:03:26.100> so<00:03:27.100> I

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
three but I need to add on eight so I

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.130 
three but I need to add on eight so I
need<00:03:27.520> to<00:03:27.790> add<00:03:28.030> on<00:03:28.860> another<00:03:29.860> five<00:03:30.850> which<00:03:31.780> gets

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
need to add on another five which gets

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.400 
need to add on another five which gets
