00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:11.200
 I always tell the players that 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:13.570
 when when we win when we train 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.110
 well is everything that can get what 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.550
 they want to some extent also 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.930
 but I'm very open for that I think 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.530
 that moods in any 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:28.140
 human being is fundamental and above all 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:30.320
 in the football career of being 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.110
 players of a big like colo colo 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.060
 who have such expressions and 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.390
 expressions have pressures partner deals 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.770
 a week to give you peace of mind 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.930
 freedom joy when it comes to work 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.059
 because I know that the commitments of the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.970
 weekends are there are many things in 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.520
 game and play with a a large weight of 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.629
 Wear this shirt with a single change 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.800
 in a single change the equipment is the same 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.900
 with two changes let's say because it 's 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.590
 also nacho gonzález because they already know 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.530
 you who beat him to a renny vega 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.310
 and today in the morning I was very much with gonzález 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.240
 gutiérrez delgado romo and bravo is there 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.960
 the change from bravo to hair goes that 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.840
 caroca coria fuensalida and olivi with 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.050
 pineda personal an alternative not 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.390
 we have a pretty firm day but good 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.320
 I have to see it tomorrow after we'll do 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.320
 soccer on thursday 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.890
 with the team that today had rest 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.510
 well deserved and there good what I am 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.270
 analyzing to see how we are going to 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.280
 replace the carachito pro bravo is a 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.310
 of the possibilities that were put 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.290
 platelets that is a new methods like 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.000
 to accelerate recoveries for 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.670
 that is better the recovery less 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.369
 painful and the fibers go away 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.590
 replenishing doctor but do not know what 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.469
 I listen again 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:02.060
 I calculate that it will be fine because 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:05.420
 luck is not such a big tear 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.130
 everywhere the classic is lived by 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.299
 more that there is still time that there is 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.610
 matches ahead one has the 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.590
 classic in the head we have a 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.680
 very difficult match with rangers that is 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.269
 at a high level a very compact team 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.120
 that are very strong essentially but 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:26.420
 also hurt you offensively that 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.319
 they have also taken the habit of 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.630
 the results have won him Catholic 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.459
 they have beaten the Spanish raul tied 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.900
 at the last moment of the game that 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.099
 it means they are doing very well 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.010
 things and that we make a 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.810
 very difficult commitment 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.120
 On Sunday we have no commitment 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.170
 we can be talking about water but that 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.450
 through our head 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.069
 when you lie down the night does not pass 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.930
 that has no doubt because it happens to me 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.569
 we also arrange things a 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.140
 little bit because I think that in the previous 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:01.090
 we had planned something is not that 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.190
 have been surprised because we already knew the 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.380
 way of playing Catholic but if the with 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.730
 the intensity that they played and 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.140
 we are like we were 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.530
 marches more back then that 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.530
 appearance 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.290
 as we give I am very open in that I 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.540
 opine I let him talk two minutes to them 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.830
 They downloaded a little bit because 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.270
 they knew that we had not played 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.580
 according to what we have been doing already 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.290
 what we can and then it takes a 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.600
 little the word are manifesting a 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.600
 little what I saw was a little 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.220
 disconnected and we corrected some things 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.650
 on the blackboard practically and I think that 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.360
 the second time of colo colo was a lot 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.800
 better because especially when one is 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.290
 aware that things are not being 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.580
 doing well that can be improved there 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.900
 to change on time if we had not 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.520
 changed on time surely this 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.320
 we would have missed it well 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.910
 wake briones very optimistic if I am 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.880
 optimist but I always told him that 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.490
 the optimist because he saw that he had more 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.260
 to fight if he came in a king who does not 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.140
 find weapons and everything there is complicated 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:02.010
 a lot but I saw the weapons there as 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:05.220
 I say we have what then in that 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.400
 in that aspect we are we are barbarians 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.840
 and it was an unthinkable medium that today is 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.760
 doing what is being done for me 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.920
 not for the players that we the 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.959
 first day we assume we mark them 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.310
 what will be the work guidelines 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.840
 the goals if they got themselves 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.070
 immediately never 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.800
 they spared the work then in that 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.990
 aspect we were all optimistic but 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.760
 but it was not the task was not easy today 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.400
 we are well on our way not yet 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.890
 we have achieved things but surely 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.460
 this road we will reach the 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.460
 objectives
