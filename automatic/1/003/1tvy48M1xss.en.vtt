screw how I do it

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.250

I<00:02:45.930> put<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.050> back<00:02:47.260> in<00:02:47.530> first<00:02:48.630> so<00:02:49.630> it<00:02:49.810> kind<00:02:50.230> of

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
I put the back in first so it kind of

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
I put the back in first so it kind of
makes<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:50.680> little<00:02:50.709> easier<00:02:55.350> but<00:02:56.350> back<00:02:56.770> in<00:02:57.040> on

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
makes it a little easier but back in on

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.430 
makes it a little easier but back in on
this<00:02:57.580> side<00:02:59.100> wants<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.190> backs<00:03:00.489> in<00:03:00.819> it's<00:03:01.440> it's

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
this side wants the backs in it's it's

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.900 
this side wants the backs in it's it's
easier<00:03:02.800> when<00:03:03.160> you<00:03:03.280> put<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.580> back<00:03:03.820> end<00:03:04.120> because

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
easier when you put the back end because

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.210 
easier when you put the back end because
the<00:03:06.910> back<00:03:07.270> could<00:03:07.570> only<00:03:07.720> fit<00:03:08.020> in<00:03:08.200> with<00:03:08.800> the<00:03:08.950> gap

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
the back could only fit in with the gap

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:16.830 
the back could only fit in with the gap
right<00:03:09.610> and<00:03:12.780> no<00:03:13.780> one<00:03:14.080> sits<00:03:14.290> in<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.560> gap<00:03:14.769> and<00:03:15.840> you

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
right and no one sits in the gap and you

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.949 
right and no one sits in the gap and you
could<00:03:17.019> just<00:03:17.200> add<00:03:17.410> your<00:03:17.620> screw<00:03:18.330> so<00:03:19.330> you're<00:03:19.810> just
