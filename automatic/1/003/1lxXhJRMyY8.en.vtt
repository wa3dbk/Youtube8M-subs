00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.820 
hefty amount of memory and the only way
to<00:02:01.920> access<00:02:02.190> it<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:03.360> take<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.750> cover<00:02:03.990> off<00:02:04.110> so

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
to access it is to take the cover off so

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.380 
to access it is to take the cover off so
let's<00:02:05.040> put<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.370> cover<00:02:05.550> back<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.820> by<00:02:06.150> the<00:02:06.210> way

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
let's put the cover back on by the way

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.109 
let's put the cover back on by the way
this<00:02:06.930> is<00:02:07.230> carbon<00:02:07.860> fiber<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.670> it's<00:02:08.790> very

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
this is carbon fiber and it's very

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.540 
this is carbon fiber and it's very
lightweight<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:10.080> contributes<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:11.400> the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
lightweight and it contributes to the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.020 
lightweight and it contributes to the
overall<00:02:11.750> light<00:02:12.750> weight<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.650> phone<00:02:14.870> the

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
overall light weight of the phone the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.840 
overall light weight of the phone the
fascinate<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.240> part<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.200> galaxy<00:02:19.560> s<00:02:20.190> series

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
fascinate is part of the galaxy s series

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.020 
fascinate is part of the galaxy s series
of<00:02:21.330> phones<00:02:21.660> from<00:02:21.990> Samsung<00:02:22.610> pretty<00:02:23.610> much<00:02:23.760> every

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
of phones from Samsung pretty much every

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.210 
of phones from Samsung pretty much every
carrier<00:02:24.300> has<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.720> galaxy<00:02:25.260> s<00:02:25.410> but<00:02:25.920> they're<00:02:26.070> all

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
carrier has a galaxy s but they're all

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.100 
carrier has a galaxy s but they're all
slightly<00:02:26.520> different<00:02:27.150> from<00:02:27.330> carrier<00:02:27.780> to

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
slightly different from carrier to

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.320 
slightly different from carrier to
carrier<00:02:28.250> so<00:02:29.250> let's<00:02:29.760> take<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:29.970> look<00:02:30.180> at<00:02:30.210> the

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
carrier so let's take a look at the

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.450 
carrier so let's take a look at the
phone<00:02:30.480> this<00:02:31.110> is<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.470> lens<00:02:31.680> for<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.010> phone<00:02:32.220> it

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
phone this is the lens for the phone it

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.260 
phone this is the lens for the phone it
does<00:02:32.670> have<00:02:33.000> an<00:02:33.270> LED<00:02:33.900> flash<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:35.130> still<00:02:35.850> image

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
does have an LED flash the still image

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.220 
does have an LED flash the still image
resolution<00:02:36.510> is<00:02:37.080> 5<00:02:37.410> megapixel<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:39.230> video

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
resolution is 5 megapixel the video

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.300 
resolution is 5 megapixel the video
resolution<00:02:41.100> of<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.490> samsung<00:02:42.000> fascinate<00:02:42.210> is

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
resolution of the samsung fascinate is

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.330 
resolution of the samsung fascinate is
720p<00:02:44.310> HD<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.480> it<00:02:46.140> does<00:02:46.320> a<00:02:46.350> fairly<00:02:46.800> good<00:02:47.010> job<00:02:47.040> of

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
720p HD and it does a fairly good job of

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.390 
720p HD and it does a fairly good job of
taking<00:02:47.970> HD<00:02:48.690> video<00:02:49.050> within<00:02:49.380> reason<00:02:49.890> for<00:02:50.100> a<00:02:50.130> cell

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
taking HD video within reason for a cell

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.670 
taking HD video within reason for a cell
phone<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:51.330> we'll<00:02:51.510> take<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.690> little<00:02:52.080> closer<00:02:52.380> look

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
phone so we'll take a little closer look

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.950 
phone so we'll take a little closer look
at<00:02:52.860> what<00:02:53.040> will<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.400> videos<00:02:53.700> looks<00:02:54.210> like<00:02:54.420> later

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
at what will the videos looks like later

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.480 
at what will the videos looks like later
let's<00:02:55.560> take<00:02:55.740> a<00:02:55.770> look<00:02:56.010> at<00:02:56.100> some<00:02:56.310> of<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.460> other
