00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.420
 hi friends with you xenia fireplace 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.580
 Danish project herd foto.ru 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.490
 I present to you a new translation of the video 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.060
 lesson on studio shooting kids up to 1 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.430
 of the year 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.050
 if you like what i do you 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.300
 want to get more like 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.920
 video transfers put likes and 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.140
 subscribe to my channel 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.759
 and who are we here so beautiful when 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.860
 you are planning on shooting babies 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.660
 consider the time you need in order 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.149
 to feed the child so that he pass 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.860
 dad cried and so on you never 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.090
 can you guess what will do 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.770
 the child is therefore always needed 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.710
 adapt to what he wants 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.930
 do now and every shot does not look like 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.430
 Iâ€™m going to cover the previous one 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.930
 window to remove excess 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.940
 daylight because we will 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.559
 use studio on block and not 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.140
 I will completely remove the light from the window I 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.640
 will work with mixed light when 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.899
 I want to create children 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.480
 maximum natural lighting 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.689
 so even if i use pulsed 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.650
 the light i always use is a big softbox 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.939
 some kids really like 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.100
 watch as it lights up and goes out 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.840
 pulsed light on some get scared off 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.909
 this and in this case you will have 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.520
 adapt and shoot naturally 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.259
 lighting in the room when shooting 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.909
 babies should be very warm let 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.159
 you have to sweat back and baby 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.909
 it will be better about what a happy child so 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.590
 better pictures use 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.600
 all sorts of accessories shooting 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.360
 babies this is exactly what will help you 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.520
 hand over your idea your idea i 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.439
 constantly looking for a new material 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.170
 for the background to lay on 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.200
 floor various accessories on which or 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.610
 in which you can put the child sometimes 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.079
 and specially ordered accessories 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.579
 a certain color in order to 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.530
 create a specific palette on 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.180
 I like to save photos 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.040
 naturalness in photos especially 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.770
 when you are photographing a baby naked 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.630
 everything must look very natural I 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.280
 try to avoid bright pink bright 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.829
 blue flowers that scream 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.780
 see children's photography for me is 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:13.440
 it looks tasteless personally I think that 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:16.200
 the simpler the better I really like 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.300
 take pictures of 6 month old babies they 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.770
 They are already responding to the sounds of smiling at you in 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.360
 the answer and for me is very important 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.599
 fix exactly this moment 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.910
 happy baby today we are lucky and have 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.370
 we are in the studio very smiling baby but not 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.860
 always so lucky sometimes kids are not in 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.269
 in a mood but I have never been 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.950
 such a situation so that we completely 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.620
 canceled the shooting because we can't 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.120
 calm the baby there is always a way out 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.620
 any situation to teach 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.930
 the photo you want 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.930
 you're so cool and 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.720
 I always start shooting very carefully 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.370
 and gradually because you are a new person 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.080
 for a child he doesn't know you you need 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.360
 first make friends and make friends 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.190
 get used to each other also have you 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.380
 in the hands of a large child camera 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.760
 in an unusual situation for him 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.640
 so I start very carefully and 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.860
 gradually very important scare the child 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.930
 in these first minutes because if he 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.490
 get scared then you have to start everything 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.490
 first to gain his trust 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.890
 the shooting process itself everything happens 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:28.780
 very unpredictable and sometimes I guess 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:31.150
 I look crazy when you try 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.250
 make the child smile you must 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.930
 be very positive and don't be afraid to lead 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.910
 yourself totally stupid 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.950
 don't worry about the sounds you 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.570
 publish it like you look into this 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.920
 moment because the most important thing is to get 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:49.210
 on the child's fish today I take off two 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.380
 lens 2470 aperture 2 and 8 and 90 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.030
 millimeters macro 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.120
 I like to use a macro lens 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.160
 for shooting details of objects 2470 gives 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.050
 I have quite a large run on focal 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.080
 by distance 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.430
 it's just great we all finished 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.590
 if you feel you already got those 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.000
 the shots who wanted the best 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.920
 change the situation if you have 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.890
 further plan because the baby is not 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.390
 will sit for hours and pose for you 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.340
 will be good if you ask parents 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.989
 don't bother your baby before shooting 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.630
 because some parents love 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.070
 play with the baby while you 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.540
 preparing for the shooting process in 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.720
 In this case, the child is just fast 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:28.000
 get tired will be better if you are exactly like 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.920
 the photographer will be the only person 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.630
 which makes the child smile and 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.190
 parents can do something in the frame 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.860
 join you later process 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.080
 shooting if you are very friendly 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.810
 and find contact with the child then your 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.790
 photo shoot failed if you liked 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.290
