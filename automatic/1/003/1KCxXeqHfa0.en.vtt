each<00:02:28.100> movie<00:02:28.670> comes<00:02:28.880> into<00:02:29.209> this<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:31.209> notice

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
each movie comes into this and notice

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.820 
each movie comes into this and notice
how<00:02:32.239> it<00:02:32.450> says<00:02:32.480> blu-ray<00:02:33.080> right<00:02:33.290> there<00:02:33.500> on<00:02:33.709> the

how it says blu-ray right there on the
left-hand<00:02:34.130> side<00:02:34.310> so<00:02:35.120> this<00:02:35.300> is<00:02:35.330> part<00:02:35.660> 1<00:02:38.080> part<00:02:39.080> 2

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
left-hand side so this is part 1 part 2

and I believe most of the extras are in

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.729 
and I believe most of the extras are in
standard<00:02:44.600> definition<00:02:45.050> it's<00:02:45.890> just<00:02:46.130> DVD<00:02:47.739> about

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
standard definition it's just DVD about

standard definition it's just DVD about
what<00:02:49.010> we<00:02:49.130> care<00:02:49.370> more<00:02:49.610> most<00:02:50.299> about<00:02:50.540> here<00:02:50.750> r<00:02:50.930> is

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
what we care more most about here r is

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.370 
what we care more most about here r is
the<00:02:51.380> presentation<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.489> movies<00:02:52.880> and<00:02:53.380> it

the presentation the movies and it

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.310 
the presentation the movies and it
