00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hi darlings, whats up 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.620
 today I came back with more hair loss 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.139
 of hairstyle as you should already have 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.389
 seen anything people in the video right 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.099
 It's a hairstyle that I use a lot. 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.780
 because I find him very joker and he is 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.240
 very easy to do 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.250
 I wore it before I left my hair. 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.900
 so all cacheadinho and now I think 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.580
 that it will become much more beautiful 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.189
 Because I thought I could do this. 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.300
 influenced is a glass and deconstructed 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.310
 so aside 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.660
 well you'll see I hope you guys 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.660
 like me well 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.539
 come on then let's go the loves 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.579
 to separate the hair is more cacheadinho 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.449
 Today I know he'll find a way. 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.239
 different 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.120
 but then I'll tell you in another video to 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.800
 You guys I did I 'll test but I will 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.290
 Turn it just for you to see how it is. 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:06.510
 back play alone I liked the effect 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.610
 I just did not get it right here. 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.200
 in the front and I ended up learning more 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.619
 I thought it was so cool that you 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.549
 it is 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.799
 then I'll tell you the church is 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:30.630
 testing the first good thing that we will 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:34.710
 need for today 31 the line only will 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.079
 To do the hairstyle, come on. 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.840
 I'll start by getting some of the 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.119
 line is just a little dry 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.810
 Actually, I'm going to let it go. I do not know. 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.810
 to sustain 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.750
 I'll let him take a little of what 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.750
 explain right 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:13.390
 looks after I learned to stay 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:16.140
 I better get out much technical 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.360
 so one that matters 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.880
 before I left my hair in my hair 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.500
 it was flat then leave the tips 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.850
 to do this 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.740
 hairstyle but now as he quoted from 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.790
 Ronaldinho, I think it's going to be going to give a 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.600
 it's very different 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.150
 Bon Jovi is a little bit playing the hair 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:43.090
 so to the side because I want that 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:46.840
 hairstyle here and I'll get through it 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:50.530
 do a little twist on it like that 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.500
 thrashing her hair but not 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:03:00.370
 do not lose the volume and I come with a clamp 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:03.010
 here and I already learned that part is the 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.980
 people go a year as I need 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.830
 I'll do the same thing canceled here. 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.820
 Only here I'm going to hold one less 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.820
 possible 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:19.750
 only in front at least possible 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:24.690
 the hair does not lose the car shape and 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.690
 I'm going to pull there 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.870
 Right when I get here I have too. 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.480
 You see, it's just that it gives a beautiful 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.950
 Sunday thyago nÃ© 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.710
 Just hangin ' on the side, it looks really cool as well. 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.750
 charming, right? 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.850
 I liked one more option 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.470
 it's two then we thought and we 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:08.560
 we take advantage of the girl jac only starts to 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:11.860
 lose that coke on the side but 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:15.640
 remembering that it is a deconstructed glass 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:20.590
 so it's cool that you have several dots 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:26.040
 loose because the charm of the hairstyle is only 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.040
 only two clips is enough 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:35.970
 Just go up to me and just go up and put the 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.970
 staple here 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.930
 no need another cassol clamp 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.930
 loose ink 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.830
 there 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.990
 here i have some frilas no case 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.100
 use a little of the line again or if 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:08.320
 You have the here use here I use a lot 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:10.270
 The people there that I mussi can also be in the 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.040
 truth is even better because more is not 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.040
 hold the hairstyle longer 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.400
 Are you very happy here? 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:28.739
 I'm going to put another group here because I 

00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:32.489
 I thought you got very loose from this water. 

00:05:28.739 --> 00:05:39.800
 good here even hidden in here 

00:05:32.489 --> 00:05:39.800
 half to give a firmness to the hairstyle 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.050
 and that's it 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:50.009
 the tomato is that I'm also leaving the 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:53.539
 Which do you prefer I left high? 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.539
 Turn over for you to see how it got 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:03.469
 looks very sophisticated with the tips 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.469
 on here 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:19.889
 covering made a difference gives an up on 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.889
 visual can not download if done here 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:43.600
 and this is easy being gets very risky 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:44.380
 turn everything you want to return hope 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.890
 yea 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:51.450
 if the smooth part of my hair 

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.450
 the year has passed out 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.870
 Saturday my dear for your part 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:00.850
 This is it, my loves, I do not expect 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.070
 much that you have enjoyed 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.720
 in case you do this hairstyle take a 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.370
 to check in the instagram that I 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:10.710
 I loved seeing it 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.710
 a kiss and until the next champions
