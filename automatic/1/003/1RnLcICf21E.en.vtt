00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
do that's that's the only thing I was

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.849 
do that's that's the only thing I was
concerned<00:03:52.030> about<00:03:52.299> and<00:03:52.599> who<00:03:53.319> cares<00:03:53.560> about

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
concerned about and who cares about

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.619 
concerned about and who cares about
crafting<00:03:54.489> and<00:03:54.700> that's<00:03:54.819> how<00:03:54.939> I<00:03:54.969> was<00:03:55.269> as<00:03:55.480> a<00:03:55.569> kid

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
crafting and that's how I was as a kid

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.500 
crafting and that's how I was as a kid
so<00:03:55.840> I<00:03:56.349> think<00:03:56.650> how<00:03:57.639> you<00:03:57.700> guys<00:03:57.999> are<00:03:58.150> making<00:03:58.239> the

so I think how you guys are making the

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.819 
so I think how you guys are making the
game<00:03:58.599> right<00:03:58.780> now<00:03:58.810> making<00:03:59.079> it<00:03:59.260> really<00:03:59.409> complex

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
game right now making it really complex

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.459 
game right now making it really complex
with<00:04:00.040> crafting<00:04:00.519> and<00:04:00.760> like<00:04:01.569> really<00:04:01.780> you<00:04:02.379> know

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:02.469 
with crafting and like really you know

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:05.399 
with crafting and like really you know
new<00:04:02.799> collecting<00:04:03.219> on<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.810> combat<00:04:04.810> aspect<00:04:05.290> of

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 
new collecting on the combat aspect of

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:07.020 
new collecting on the combat aspect of
the<00:04:05.469> game<00:04:05.500> is<00:04:05.799> really<00:04:06.069> hurting<00:04:06.790> your

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
the game is really hurting your

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.089 
the game is really hurting your
subscription<00:04:07.629> base<00:04:07.780> you<00:04:08.439> need<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:08.769> make<00:04:08.889> the

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
subscription base you need to make the

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.190 
subscription base you need to make the
game<00:04:09.280> more<00:04:09.549> flashy<00:04:10.000> you<00:04:10.389> have<00:04:10.569> more<00:04:10.810> kind<00:04:11.109> of

game more flashy you have more kind of

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.110 
game more flashy you have more kind of
better<00:04:11.379> combat<00:04:11.829> you<00:04:12.400> need<00:04:12.549> to<00:04:12.669> meet<00:04:12.790> you<00:04:12.969> need

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
better combat you need to meet you need

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.839 
better combat you need to meet you need
to<00:04:13.239> make<00:04:13.359> the<00:04:13.480> game<00:04:13.629> better<00:04:13.870> combat<00:04:14.560> than<00:04:14.950> the

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
to make the game better combat than the

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.009 
to make the game better combat than the
shroud<00:04:16.060> avatar<00:04:16.509> the<00:04:16.660> shroud<00:04:16.840> of<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:16.930> avatar
