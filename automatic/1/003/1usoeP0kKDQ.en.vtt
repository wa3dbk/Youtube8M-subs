00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
right you can see that light is now

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.229 
right you can see that light is now

flashlight are still the same they are

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.820 
flashlight are still the same they are
now<00:02:39.650> distributed<00:02:40.130> over<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:40.760> greater<00:02:41.180> area<00:02:41.830> each

square<00:02:43.370> will<00:02:43.640> experience<00:02:44.239> less<00:02:44.600> of<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.959> heat

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
square will experience less of the heat

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.140 
square will experience less of the heat
and<00:02:45.410> energy<00:02:45.590> than<00:02:46.190> it<00:02:46.340> does<00:02:46.580> when<00:02:46.940> it<00:02:47.030> is

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
and energy than it does when it is

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.140

concentrated<00:02:47.540> directly<00:02:48.530> overhead<00:02:49.150> more

squares<00:02:50.510> are<00:02:50.720> sharing<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.530> heat<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:51.980> energy

squares are sharing the heat and energy

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.470 
squares are sharing the heat and energy
so<00:02:52.970> each<00:02:53.269> one<00:02:53.510> gets<00:02:53.900> a<00:02:54.080> less<00:02:54.350> intense<00:02:54.860> amount

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
so each one gets a less intense amount

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.449 
so each one gets a less intense amount
when<00:02:56.480> we<00:02:56.630> have<00:02:56.870> less<00:02:57.200> intense<00:02:57.739> heat<00:02:58.040> to<00:02:58.340> our

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
when we have less intense heat to our
