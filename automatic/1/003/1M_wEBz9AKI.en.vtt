absolutely stunning panoramic view and

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.310 
absolutely stunning panoramic view and
this<00:00:34.520> really<00:00:34.760> inspired<00:00:35.360> the<00:00:35.570> designers<00:00:36.110> they

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
this really inspired the designers they

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.250 
this really inspired the designers they
were<00:00:36.379> trying<00:00:37.010> to<00:00:37.070> make<00:00:37.160> a<00:00:37.190> connection<00:00:37.850> with

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
were trying to make a connection with

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.530 
were trying to make a connection with
California<00:00:39.260> and<00:00:39.530> so<00:00:40.130> they<00:00:40.310> were<00:00:40.700> thinking<00:00:41.300> hey

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
California and so they were thinking hey

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.450 
California and so they were thinking hey
this<00:00:42.230> is<00:00:42.410> just<00:00:42.590> like<00:00:42.710> being<00:00:43.070> in<00:00:43.220> California

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
this is just like being in California

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.150 
this is just like being in California
high<00:00:44.000> up<00:00:44.150> on<00:00:44.300> a<00:00:44.329> hillside<00:00:44.570> and<00:00:45.079> watching<00:00:46.040> a

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
high up on a hillside and watching a

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.790 
high up on a hillside and watching a
sunset<00:00:46.430> so<00:00:47.090> that<00:00:47.630> sort<00:00:47.930> of<00:00:47.989> established<00:00:48.649> the

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
sunset so that sort of established the

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.889 
sunset so that sort of established the
color<00:00:49.040> palette<00:00:49.520> and<00:00:49.700> then<00:00:49.880> the<00:00:50.329> mid-century

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
color palette and then the mid-century

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.680 
color palette and then the mid-century
design<00:00:51.280> aesthetic<00:00:52.280> really<00:00:52.970> fit<00:00:53.300> with<00:00:53.630> the

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
design aesthetic really fit with the

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.280 
design aesthetic really fit with the
idea<00:00:54.440> of<00:00:54.730> simplifying<00:00:55.730> it<00:00:56.090> and<00:00:56.329> opening<00:00:57.050> it

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
idea of simplifying it and opening it

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.160 
idea of simplifying it and opening it
and<00:00:57.559> keeping<00:00:57.950> it<00:00:58.040> fresh<00:00:58.340> and<00:00:58.640> simple<00:00:59.120> so<00:00:59.690> that

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
and keeping it fresh and simple so that

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.350 
and keeping it fresh and simple so that
design<00:01:00.620> aesthetic<00:01:01.160> you'll<00:01:01.309> see<00:01:01.640> in<00:01:02.090> the

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
design aesthetic you'll see in the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.789 
design aesthetic you'll see in the
furniture<00:01:02.719> in<00:01:03.380> the<00:01:03.890> cool<00:01:04.990> lamps<00:01:05.990> and<00:01:06.229> lights
