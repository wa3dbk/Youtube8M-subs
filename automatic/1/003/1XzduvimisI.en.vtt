 Is good to Tteyuu I think you just Well batting that a good 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:15.910
 The number of games in our open talk game itself is also small 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.660
 Because I think that it is the result of having the other party also be actively shaken in the place where I'm still searching 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.420
 What about the house version About the batting order 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.010

 It's a good idea for the team to be on top of the team 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:45.110
 I think not 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:48.280
 For example, even if you get out of your way, you should show your attitude to attack first 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.280

00:00:49.770 --> 00:01:00.750

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:02.890

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.240

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.750
 After all I said that there is a meter named Yukari 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.170
 I wonder if it's 12 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.170
 That's fine 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:29.289

 As if it were 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.110

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:45.040
 Because I have a lot of care drawers for that 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:48.880

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.250
