that's why we always want enough for the
McDonald's<00:02:16.630> and<00:02:16.720> Burger<00:02:16.810> King<00:02:17.080> I've<00:02:17.470> been

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
McDonald's and Burger King I've been

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.440 
McDonald's and Burger King I've been
meaning<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.010> ask<00:02:18.100> him<00:02:18.400> about<00:02:18.519> that<00:02:18.640> but<00:02:19.090> he

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
meaning to ask him about that but he

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.890 
meaning to ask him about that but he
can't<00:02:19.690> talk<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:21.790> course<00:02:22.060> leather<00:02:22.360> all<00:02:22.660> back

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
can't talk of course leather all back

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.840 
can't talk of course leather all back
here<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:23.290> everything<00:02:23.590> in<00:02:23.890> America<00:02:24.069> models<00:02:24.760> I

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
here and everything in America models I

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.550 
here and everything in America models I
think<00:02:25.090> some<00:02:25.510> of<00:02:25.540> you<00:02:25.750> probably<00:02:25.930> have<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.230> power

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
think some of you probably have a power

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.190 
think some of you probably have a power
inverter<00:02:27.040> here<00:02:27.480> it's<00:02:28.480> winter<00:02:28.870> that's<00:02:29.019> why<00:02:29.170> I

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
inverter here it's winter that's why I

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.940 
inverter here it's winter that's why I
have<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.440> gloves<00:02:29.650> on

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
have the gloves on

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.800 
have the gloves on
but<00:02:30.310> in<00:02:30.489> America<00:02:30.610> models<00:02:31.239> I<00:02:31.330> think<00:02:31.540> you<00:02:31.660> have

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
but in America models I think you have

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.600 
but in America models I think you have
the<00:02:31.930> power<00:02:32.140> inverter<00:02:32.650> here<00:02:32.950> while<00:02:33.400> the

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
the power inverter here while the

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.110 
the power inverter here while the
inverters<00:02:34.209> inside<00:02:34.600> somewhere<00:02:34.959> and<00:02:35.170> up<00:02:36.120> 110

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
inverters inside somewhere and up 110

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.410 
inverters inside somewhere and up 110
110<00:02:37.780> volt<00:02:38.110> outlet<00:02:38.260> I<00:02:38.910> think<00:02:39.910> in<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.180> summer

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
110 volt outlet I think in the summer

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.060
