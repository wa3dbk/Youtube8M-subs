00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.050
 hello and welcome I am 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.650
 constantly for all those not me yet 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.640
 know 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.610
 I'm a musician guitar teacher and also 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.760
 Online guitar teacher with this video 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.050
 I'll go to all the guitars 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.100
 newcomer so all the straight now 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.390
 start playing with the guitar and the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.910
 First steps, I'll say it 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.199
 Anyone who already wants to try 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.089
 internet a bit like that 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.559
 beginner reaction has looked 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.370
 probably have noticed it 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.780
 there is a lot 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.129
 but unfortunately god is all very 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.579
 tears that it does not really matter 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.680
 everything together well and s2 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.109
 is very many of these beginner lessons 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.969
 are just too hard for one 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.880
 the first time a guitar 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.590
 Some things are in hand, yes 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.960
 really not feasible 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.350
 That's why I have one 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.490
 complete free online fueled course 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.420
 will create the whole or that 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.440
 basic knowledge I say for that 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.240
 Guitar games should bring something closer 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.970
 as I said, the best part is he too 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.000
 is really completely free cost 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.920
 Nothing 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.140
 how does it work? 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.789
 in the form of newsletters 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.160
 So that means you get in from me 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.679
 intervals a newsletter sent 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.720

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:46.380

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.899

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.789
