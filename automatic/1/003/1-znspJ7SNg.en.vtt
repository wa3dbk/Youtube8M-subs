00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.920
 not all kids who are so welcome 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.390
 new advance video in this case 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.940
 based on the information of was the 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.110
 fantasy 15 unveiled the jump festa no 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.910
 I'm going to do a commented job of 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.230
 trailer fixing me detail detail because 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.719
 really everything that you see in the 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.070
 trailer is written let's say it's 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.529
 detailed in what I am going to comment now 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.760
 I recommend it 100% to do is 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.560
 the full video because I'm going to give 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.269
 a lot of information that has emerged from 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.859
 this event and will try to bring your hand 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.869
 it is possible to give pure information and 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.460
 hard and on that basis because we can already in 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.349
 the comments and talk about all 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.910
 the topics to start by revealing the 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.550
 unknown yesterday the female character 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.500
 is fit, yes and no 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.050
 his japanese name is fitness and his name 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.329
 in English it would be cindy considering 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.680
 that the Japanese network of cites been and that 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.539
 they mention this name a couple of times already 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.820
 presenting the character I think so 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.350
 that steve in female version but not 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.329
 However, they have said that his character 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.920
 history will have a very small role very 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:53.180
 teeny not being just relevant 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.969
 it will simply give advice about 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.739
 gameplay in some moments and you're done 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.329
 I'll trust that if it's going to come out more 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.980
 forward as a male character with what 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.660
 which I will not say much more about 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.550
 this fiction 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.110
 Sydney or whatever you want to call it acid 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.640
 abounded nothing else amounted to 100 and the 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.400
 we'll see in the missing demo 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.229
 episodes falls with which we will wait for 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.150
 March to judge what role it has 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.500
 really inside the game with respect 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.210
 to the colossus the giant that we saw yesterday in 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.090
 the scandal is basically have 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.830
 effectively a titan is a beast 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.750
 invoked that we can get once 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.960
 that we defeated her in the classic style 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.250
 the franchise and it will have a huge role 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.900
 in history it is so particular to you 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.420
 so it will have a relevant role in the 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.490
 plot we will not see it in the demo not 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.340
 But we will see other 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.450
 invocations in this episode skype the 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.190
 relationship they have for you right now 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.660
 in the titan looking towards the ground 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.280
 watching noctis and trying to crush 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.440
 with your foot while it's obviously not 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.300
 the repels as a weapon is the animation 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.470
 initiation invocation is valid 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.660
 the character is quite good indeed 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.310
 it reminds me a lot to the titans of 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.200
 scienceno that today is not against and I have 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.179
 attacked titans as you know the series 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.800
 of treasure now that we talk about the 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.050
 central cities we see a new one 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.179
 flame the stars is basically a 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.039
 small villa a small village that turns 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:05.720
 around titan's story either 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.890
 will be the demo but good comment 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.289
 for example that there is a motel in which 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.820
 we can rest eat buy and do 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.320
 other kind of events we see how we 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.430
 discriminates over the city and things in the 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.579
 background or characters 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.769
 a restaurant a terrace so there's 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:21.019
 enough life inside what comes to 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.219
 be the franchise habitually 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.569
 let's go to a technical demo which 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:25.430
 we found the dog of this city 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.680
 It looks like it's just a minigame or 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.870
 some kind of extra inside fermat 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.730
 there 15 but it is not defined at one hundred 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.859
 per cent what does it consist of? 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.120
 to the dog and wait for a city to see in 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:36.859
 what's left the thing seems like nice 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.829
 at least one thing sympathetic to its added 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:40.819
 cool and finally you can click on the 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.680
 screen to the abyss to see the video 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.689
 Full follow of hair lasted our 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.819
 22 is in Japanese but hey something is 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.379
 something 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.659
 following with hector we already know that the 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.310
 general corleone the group is urinated on 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:52.780
 certain moment of the game is not because 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.370
 Noctis is a friend but because 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.469
 obligation has to do it let's say that 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.900
 has a pending debt at the level 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:03:00.700
 plot and will join the team will be 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.319
 temporary form is apparently going to be 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.760
 more members that join the team in 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.019
 certain moments of the game this 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.510
 character waited for him last year in 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.549
 the e3 but in a visual level is so 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.930
 similar to others that had almost passed a 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.319
 little unnoticed the so many of leds in 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.030
 screen right now 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.109
 talking about the fighting beyond 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.430
 the invocations I have commented on 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.870
 example that at the beginning it was thought that 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.879
 we just did not want to use magic 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.319
 but they finally said that good 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.060
 every person who can have his 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.760
 own and make a more balanced team 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.400
 not simply based on jocs at work 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.319
 but in different affinities of the 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.459
 characters also commented that it is 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.349
 which is working right now sell 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.819
 More actions plus variety of action 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.469
 magics are not very spectacular and for 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.329
 they like that in the video notwithstanding 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:40.159
 that they have finished one hundred percent 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.780
 just the subject of invocations like 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.150
 said before we'll see in the safe demo 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.680
 we will see how they are how it is applied if 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.209
 They are guys in the fantasy 12 remain 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.859
 out there if a guy kills if you see that what 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.090
 they replace in the team finally 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:52.189
 we will see I have enough expectations 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.200
 after seeing the titan who has a 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.580
 It looks spectacular by the way 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.900
 but apparently what I go 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.700
 working is coherent without getting the 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.440
 harmonic adjustment that is realistic that is 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.780
 well that seems to have that presence 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.760
 your hands to your control the first thing that 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.989
 have done for this is to add trains of 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.120
 this way then travel within them 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.739
 as it happened for the palace 8 and then 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.349
 good in addition to the car have trains 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.849
 well in short, one more vehicle 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.220
 important nonetheless comes on the part 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:19.130
 of sleep because I sleep among so many and 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.479
 15 it is mandatory necessary in what 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.799
 measure can affect the dream of the game 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.360
 basically as follows 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.370
 if you do not sleep this bonus of 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.320
 statistics that you get to eat is lost or 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.880
 is lost is the effect the element of 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.410
 sleep has been added to emphasize that 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.360
 those people seem real from this 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.460
 are forced to sleep for 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.800
 be fine not to be in a state 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.180
 perfect eating in camps and such 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.570
 adds extra effects as saying earlier 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.000
 moment 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.100
 in this game you will be able to raise level to 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.930
 how crazy is it like this if you do not sleep 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.310
 you do not level up you have to go to 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.169
 camps create a kind of 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.850
 bonfires and riding a small camp 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.130
 where to sleep with the characters of this 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.410
 way to recover energy and this energy to 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.100
 Later I could use it to upload 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.840
 Of the level 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.800
 this is added for pro players 7 the 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.540
 people who want to get to the end of the 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.730
 game at a very low level 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.590
 very little will be able to do it but at the expense of 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.810
 this obviously was more complicated 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.060
 so he said it seems that they can 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.530
 be three days without sleep but after 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.940
 of this will start to know effects 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.800
 negative imagine that the characters that 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.360
 will slow down and make the most 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.150
 effective that the attacks still fail 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.680
 that otherwise would not fail and so on 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.000
 in fact they say song two moments of 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.610
 the story the characters are 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.330
 struggling for several days with which 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.810
 I understand that there will be battles 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.570
 massive military style and that 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.130
 you will not be able to sleep per se how we can 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.240
 recover from these negative secrets 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.460
 apart from sleeping then buying 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.200
 food and how we will do it cooking in 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.910
 camps combined afterwards with 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.500
 which will gain positive effects and 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.270
 sleeping well as sprint are kept 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.860
 all the effects we will see until what 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.480
 point is cumulative the subject of 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.730
 effects because if I sleep like 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.780
 sleep and sleep in 20 minutes 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.420
 real time 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.440
 Maybe the passage is too much 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.570
 empowered to go for a boss and 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.010
 kill the blows we'll see what's left 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.140
 the thing notwithstanding as a detail that 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.000
 one day pnv to fatá if 15 equals one 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.340
 hour in real life notwithstanding eye 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.310
 because in that 40 45 minutes the game are 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.330
 by day and the rest is at night since the 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.550
 game will be nocturnal 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.500
 but even absurd levels this is so 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.210
 development can change as commented 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.250
 but the serious dimension had not me 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.110
 it sounds pretty good that it depends on the day 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.789
 at night the time that passes is the 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.590
 energy you need if you sleep if you do not 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:20.810
 you sleep if you eat if you do not eat other 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.819
 characters feel affected by it 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.379
 I think a very interesting day not 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:26.120
 new either but good so it's 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:27.979
 well implemented and we'll see how it is 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.360
 in the game already to close I think that 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:31.310
 it's important because it concerns us all 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.409
 is what are several languages ​​doing 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.270
 in the demo that will launch in March together 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:36.650
 with zelanda 7 but see you will be the 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.389
 espanyol if they are only english 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.129
 Japanese but nevertheless good is because 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:42.080
 like the demos so big and has so many 

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:43.430
 elements to keep in mind that this 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.990
 location information is not 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.460
 included in the initial release of 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.319
 March take out and go down or what with a 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.750
 patch afterwards added in the language 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:52.819
 Spanish the French language the language 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.900
 Italian but good a priori is which 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:56.210
 is working hard for this 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.690
 demo is something really solid and I do not know 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:01.279
 stay in a simple first contact 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.439
 anecdotal I do not know the part that lasted 23 

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:04.849
 hours Spain will arrive in March along with 

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:06.050
 the first remittances of fire you need 

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:08.180
 but I personally already have it 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:11.029
 reserved and I really want to 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.320
 play fantasy 15 episodes fall and if 

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:14.150
 by then I have a 

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.010
 now or I have some way of recording 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.710
 the whole demo and comment it little by little 

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:20.240
 I will do it without any problem 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.440
 and nothing more kids this has been all 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.210
 as you see a lot of information about 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.340
 missing and 15 more even than the one 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.780
 lets show the trailer you have seen 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.420
 repeated images I do not feel much but 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.890
 is what there is and nothing else will be the 

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.060
 comments which thing who is to say to me 

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:33.950
 you can do it without any kind of 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.180
 problem but we won there and it's just a 

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:37.730
 One more thing I came that real behind 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.260
 from Asia liked we would like a thumb 

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.940
 up a like and if we did not like it 

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.770
 I'm so sorry, I'm sorry to see 

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.770
 that the expectation about something that you store 

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:47.000
 you expected more epic and nothing more 

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.650
 if you want to share the video with many 

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.880
 colleagues how are you friends in forums in 

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.410
 community call the fantasy where 

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.390
 you want then you are invited to it from 

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.590
 done would not increase too and nothing else 

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:57.880
 until the next video I hope that you 

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.880
 has liked this until another
