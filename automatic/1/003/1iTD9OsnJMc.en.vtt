00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.640 
reasoning abilities so I moved up to the
level<00:03:56.079> of<00:03:56.200> man<00:03:56.440> so<00:03:57.370> man<00:03:57.760> if<00:03:58.209> man<00:03:58.959> eats<00:03:59.260> of<00:03:59.500> this

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
level of man so man if man eats of this

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.190 
level of man so man if man eats of this
fruit<00:03:59.980> he's<00:04:00.670> bound<00:04:00.940> to<00:04:01.090> move<00:04:01.299> upward<00:04:01.750> so<00:04:01.959> he'll

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
fruit he's bound to move upward so he'll

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.350 
fruit he's bound to move upward so he'll
move<00:04:02.410> upward<00:04:02.799> to<00:04:03.010> the

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
move upward to the

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.890 
move upward to the
of<00:04:03.630> God<00:04:04.220> so<00:04:05.220> is<00:04:05.430> only<00:04:05.670> puts<00:04:06.180> them<00:04:06.390> on<00:04:06.510> sort<00:04:06.840> of

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
of God so is only puts them on sort of

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.480 
of God so is only puts them on sort of
this<00:04:07.020> tier<00:04:07.410> he<00:04:07.620> says<00:04:07.830> this<00:04:07.980> is<00:04:08.130> what's<00:04:08.340> going

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
this tier he says this is what's going

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.830 
this tier he says this is what's going
to<00:04:08.550> happen<00:04:08.880> this<00:04:09.030> is<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.270> result<00:04:09.600> of<00:04:09.750> eating

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
to happen this is the result of eating

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.520 
to happen this is the result of eating
the<00:04:10.050> fruit<00:04:10.310> then<00:04:11.310> line<00:04:11.520> seven<00:04:12.000> 13th<00:04:12.540> or<00:04:12.750> 7:15
