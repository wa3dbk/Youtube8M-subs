playing very good defense force and look

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.050 
playing very good defense force and look
at<00:06:08.770> that<00:06:08.800> look<00:06:09.130> at<00:06:09.250> our<00:06:09.340> stats<00:06:09.670> he<00:06:09.940> was

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
at that look at our stats he was

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.760 
at that look at our stats he was
dreadful<00:06:10.780> three-point<00:06:11.200> shooting<00:06:11.440> the<00:06:11.590> first

half but total game we ended up shooting
pretty<00:06:14.410> well<00:06:14.620> actually<00:06:14.770> thought<00:06:15.100> that<00:06:15.220> we<00:06:15.340> may

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
pretty well actually thought that we may

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.430 
pretty well actually thought that we may
have<00:06:15.610> broken<00:06:15.910> a<00:06:16.090> few<00:06:16.210> records<00:06:16.420> but<00:06:16.750> I<00:06:16.930> paired

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
have broken a few records but I paired

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.840 
have broken a few records but I paired
us<00:06:17.560> up<00:06:17.680> true<00:06:18.010> there<00:06:18.280> are<00:06:18.310> other<00:06:18.430> teams<00:06:18.700> that

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
us up true there are other teams that

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.490 
us up true there are other teams that
shot<00:06:19.060> ridiculously<00:06:19.660> well<00:06:19.900> compared<00:06:20.290> to<00:06:20.380> us

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
shot ridiculously well compared to us

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.640 
shot ridiculously well compared to us
and<00:06:21.090> Paul<00:06:22.090> Pierce<00:06:22.360> just<00:06:22.510> look<00:06:22.720> at<00:06:22.810> that<00:06:22.840> that's

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
and Paul Pierce just look at that that's

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.220 
and Paul Pierce just look at that that's
why<00:06:24.010> Paul<00:06:24.340> Pierce<00:06:24.760> is<00:06:25.000> so<00:06:25.180> valuable<00:06:25.540> he<00:06:26.080> can

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:26.230
