dungeons<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:15.810> think<00:02:16.620> what<00:02:16.740> keeps<00:02:16.920> this

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
dungeons that I think what keeps this

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.910 
dungeons that I think what keeps this
game<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.459> exciting<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.330> mean<00:02:18.630> it's<00:02:19.590> been

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
game and exciting I mean it's been

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.140 
game and exciting I mean it's been
criticized<00:02:20.430> for<00:02:20.640> being<00:02:21.590> repetitive<00:02:22.590> but<00:02:23.220> this

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
criticized for being repetitive but this

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.449 
criticized for being repetitive but this
with<00:02:24.330> all<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.569> differences<00:02:25.140> in<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.980> pokemon

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
with all the differences in the pokemon

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.199 
with all the differences in the pokemon
that<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.730> can<00:02:26.880> see<00:02:27.600> in<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:29.209> different

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
that you can see in the different

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.670 
that you can see in the different
pokemon<00:02:30.360> that<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:30.840> can<00:02:30.959> catch<00:02:31.230> throughout

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
pokemon that you can catch throughout

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.650 
pokemon that you can catch throughout
all<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.980> different<00:02:32.340> grades<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.300> I<00:02:33.360> think

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
all the different grades that I think

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.460 
all the different grades that I think
keeps<00:02:33.959> it<00:02:34.140> from<00:02:34.290> being<00:02:34.350> repetitive<00:02:34.830> ways<00:02:35.760> for

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
keeps it from being repetitive ways for

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.650 
keeps it from being repetitive ways for
Pokemon<00:02:37.470> fans<00:02:37.739> that<00:02:38.010> is<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:38.489> see<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.360> group<00:02:39.510> of

Pokemon fans that is you see a group of
Paris<00:02:40.110> act<00:02:40.350> here<00:02:40.680> haven't<00:02:41.519> seen<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:41.730> in<00:02:42.380> the

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
Paris act here haven't seen that in the

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.460 
Paris act here haven't seen that in the
game<00:02:43.530> before<00:02:43.739> so<00:02:44.130> yeah<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.580> don't<00:02:45.090> know<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:45.239> think

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
game before so yeah I don't know I think

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.520 
game before so yeah I don't know I think
personally<00:02:46.470> this<00:02:46.650> game<00:02:46.860> is<00:02:47.010> very<00:02:47.100> fun<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.000> I

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
personally this game is very fun and I

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.650 
personally this game is very fun and I
mean<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.650> dungeons<00:02:50.070> are<00:02:50.190> repetitive<00:02:50.519> but<00:02:51.180> the

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
mean the dungeons are repetitive but the

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.710 
mean the dungeons are repetitive but the
game<00:02:51.840> itself<00:02:52.910> well<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:53.940> don't<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.450> doesn't

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
game itself well I don't that doesn't

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.820 
game itself well I don't that doesn't
really<00:02:54.810> make<00:02:54.959> sense<00:02:55.019> but<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.410> dungeons<00:02:55.739> are

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
really make sense but the dungeons are

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.910 
really make sense but the dungeons are
repetitive<00:02:56.100> but<00:02:56.600> it<00:02:57.600> doesn't<00:02:57.930> feel<00:02:58.350> so

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
repetitive but it doesn't feel so

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.180 
repetitive but it doesn't feel so
repetitive<00:02:59.220> I<00:02:59.519> don't<00:02:59.790> know<00:02:59.850> whatever<00:03:01.190> maybe

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
repetitive I don't know whatever maybe

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.530 
repetitive I don't know whatever maybe
you<00:03:02.340> understand<00:03:02.730> what<00:03:02.820> I'm<00:03:02.910> saying<00:03:02.940> maybe<00:03:03.269> not

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.780 
just switched to that Pikachu this one
has<00:03:30.570> quick<00:03:30.870> attack<00:03:31.170> which<00:03:32.040> is<00:03:32.190> actually<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.730> I

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
has quick attack which is actually and I

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.610 
has quick attack which is actually and I
get<00:03:32.940> another<00:03:33.090> venema<00:03:33.480> quick<00:03:34.230> attack<00:03:34.410> is

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
get another venema quick attack is

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.819 
get another venema quick attack is
actually<00:03:34.890> good<00:03:35.430> because<00:03:35.459> it<00:03:36.030> can<00:03:36.299> just<00:03:36.829> whip

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
actually good because it can just whip

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.920 
actually good because it can just whip
through<00:03:40.880> large<00:03:41.880> groups<00:03:42.209> of<00:03:42.329> guys<00:03:42.510> very

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
through large groups of guys very

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.060 
through large groups of guys very
quickly<00:03:43.260> hence<00:03:43.650> quick<00:03:43.950> attack<00:03:44.220> and

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
quickly hence quick attack and

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.370 
quickly hence quick attack and
that<00:03:47.070> I<00:03:47.310> believe<00:03:47.760> this<00:03:47.880> tail<00:03:48.180> whip<00:03:48.450> which

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
that I believe this tail whip which

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.700 
that I believe this tail whip which
helps<00:03:49.890> aid<00:03:50.370> quick<00:03:50.760> attack<00:03:51.110> so<00:03:52.110> I'm<00:03:52.200> just<00:03:52.440> tail

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
helps aid quick attack so I'm just tail

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.570 
helps aid quick attack so I'm just tail
whipping<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.310> quick<00:03:54.030> attacking<00:03:54.510> and<00:03:55.580> Pikachu

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
whipping and quick attacking and Pikachu

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.610 
whipping and quick attacking and Pikachu
is<00:03:56.910> moving<00:03:57.270> very<00:03:57.300> slowly<00:03:57.810> because<00:03:58.020> of<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.410> leg

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
is moving very slowly because of the leg

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.450 
is moving very slowly because of the leg
I<00:03:58.920> stop<00:03:59.850> there<00:04:00.090> for<00:04:00.240> a<00:04:00.330> second<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:01.020> try<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.460> let

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
I stop there for a second to try to let

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.140 
I stop there for a second to try to let
the<00:04:02.610> video<00:04:02.880> catch<00:04:03.150> up<00:04:03.360> unfortunately<00:04:05.150> it's

the video catch up unfortunately it's

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.990 
the video catch up unfortunately it's
not<00:04:06.410> like<00:04:07.410> I<00:04:07.530> said<00:04:07.740> hopefully<00:04:07.950> I'm<00:04:08.310> going<00:04:08.940> to

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
not like I said hopefully I'm going to

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.200 
not like I said hopefully I'm going to
be<00:04:09.120> able<00:04:09.210> to<00:04:09.360> get<00:04:09.480> this<00:04:09.570> fixed<00:04:10.290> somehow<00:04:11.210> and

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
be able to get this fixed somehow and

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.330 
be able to get this fixed somehow and
now<00:04:12.330> we're<00:04:12.480> going<00:04:12.570> to<00:04:12.630> have<00:04:12.750> a<00:04:12.810> quick

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
now we're going to have a quick

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.880 
now we're going to have a quick
transition<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.610> bring<00:04:14.850> us<00:04:15.410> back<00:04:16.410> towards<00:04:16.800> a

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
transition to bring us back towards a

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.400 
transition to bring us back towards a
career<00:04:17.070> started<00:04:17.489> I<00:04:17.580> paused<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.660> game<00:04:18.690> for<00:04:19.380> a

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
career started I paused the game for a

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.090 
career started I paused the game for a
minute<00:04:20.000> to<00:04:21.000> let<00:04:21.270> the<00:04:21.750> video<00:04:22.440> ketchup<00:04:22.920> and

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
minute to let the video ketchup and

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:30.620 
minute to let the video ketchup and
hopefully<00:04:24.080> stop<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.380> lag<00:04:28.040> seem<00:04:29.040> to<00:04:29.370> have<00:04:29.630> ya
