my<00:01:24.560> small<00:01:24.860> food<00:01:25.490> processor<00:01:26.000> but<00:01:26.180> I<00:01:26.240> would

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
my small food processor but I would

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.840 
my small food processor but I would
advise<00:01:26.810> to<00:01:27.200> use<00:01:27.410> a<00:01:27.650> regular<00:01:27.920> food<00:01:28.340> processor

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
it's probably going to be faster because

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.040 
it's probably going to be faster because
we're<00:01:31.400> going<00:01:31.670> to<00:01:31.880> be<00:01:32.000> processing<00:01:32.450> it<00:01:32.690> until

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
we're going to be processing it until

we're going to be processing it until
it's<00:01:33.230> nice<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:33.560> creamy<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:34.400> in<00:01:34.670> my<00:01:34.820> small

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
it's nice and creamy and in my small

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.130 
it's nice and creamy and in my small
tiny<00:01:35.659> food<00:01:36.020> processor<00:01:36.560> it<00:01:37.070> took<00:01:37.430> a<00:01:37.610> while<00:01:38.140> so

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
tiny food processor it took a while so

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.830 
tiny food processor it took a while so
I'm<00:01:39.320> adding<00:01:39.530> my<00:01:39.920> wrote<00:01:40.130> into<00:01:40.460> my<00:01:40.610> mini<00:01:41.570> food

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
I'm adding my wrote into my mini food

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.740 
I'm adding my wrote into my mini food
processor<00:01:42.440> and<00:01:42.860> then<00:01:43.730> I'm<00:01:43.909> processing<00:01:44.180> it

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
processor and then I'm processing it

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:54.150 
processor and then I'm processing it
until<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.740> horseradish<00:01:46.220> is<00:01:46.640> nice<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:47.180> creamy

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.770 

Hayden<00:01:55.160> I'm<00:01:55.280> adding<00:01:55.610> my<00:01:55.790> salt<00:01:56.650> my<00:01:57.650> sugar<00:01:58.780> my

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
Hayden I'm adding my salt my sugar my

lemon juice and hot water and now the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.290 
lemon juice and hot water and now the
amount<00:02:03.200> of<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.500> water<00:02:03.740> will<00:02:04.070> depend<00:02:04.520> on<00:02:04.790> your

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
amount of the water will depend on your

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.139 
amount of the water will depend on your
horseradish<00:02:06.020> so<00:02:06.590> I<00:02:06.860> kept<00:02:07.160> adding<00:02:07.400> more<00:02:07.970> and

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149

more<00:02:08.240> I<00:02:08.360> ended<00:02:08.750> up<00:02:08.869> adding<00:02:09.080> six<00:02:09.590> tablespoons

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
more I ended up adding six tablespoons

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.730 
more I ended up adding six tablespoons
