00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
and I'm actually going to ink this up

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.030 
and I'm actually going to ink this up
with<00:01:25.060> my<00:01:25.290> Versamark<00:01:26.290> ink<00:01:26.710> pad<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.710> of<00:01:29.860> course

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
with my Versamark ink pad and of course

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.440 
with my Versamark ink pad and of course
you<00:01:30.130> can<00:01:30.280> use<00:01:30.430> your<00:01:30.550> stamp-a-ma-jig<00:01:30.940> if<00:01:31.360> you

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
you can use your stamp-a-ma-jig if you

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.300 
you can use your stamp-a-ma-jig if you
like<00:01:31.720> but<00:01:32.080> I<00:01:32.290> find<00:01:32.620> that<00:01:32.710> this<00:01:32.890> set<00:01:33.130> is

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
like but I find that this set is

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.020 
like but I find that this set is
actually<00:01:33.730> fairly<00:01:33.880> easy<00:01:34.180> to<00:01:34.330> line<00:01:34.600> up<00:01:34.840> and<00:01:36.030> it

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
actually fairly easy to line up and it

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.560 
actually fairly easy to line up and it
doesn't<00:01:37.390> have<00:01:37.510> to<00:01:37.660> be<00:01:37.690> perfect

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.480 

so<00:01:41.200> you're<00:01:41.350> just<00:01:41.440> going<00:01:41.590> to<00:01:41.680> stamp<00:01:41.890> that<00:01:42.100> right

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
so you're just going to stamp that right

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.390 
so you're just going to stamp that right
over<00:01:42.700> top<00:01:42.970> of<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.240> words<00:01:43.450> with<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:43.930> Versamark

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.530 

and<00:01:48.400> now<00:01:48.729> you're<00:01:48.940> not<00:01:48.970> gonna<00:01:49.120> be<00:01:49.210> able<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:49.420> see

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
and now you're not gonna be able to see

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.410 
and now you're not gonna be able to see
that<00:01:49.690> on<00:01:50.380> camera<00:01:50.890> but<00:01:51.310> it<00:01:51.580> is<00:01:51.700> there<00:01:54.300> then<00:01:55.300> I'm

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420

again and I have one of these little

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.440 
again and I have one of these little
sponge<00:03:02.069> daubers<00:03:02.519> and<00:03:02.760> stampin<00:03:03.120> up<00:03:03.209> sells

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
sponge daubers and stampin up sells

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.649 
sponge daubers and stampin up sells
these<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:04.200> really<00:03:05.129> like<00:03:05.310> this<00:03:05.549> this<00:03:06.000> kind<00:03:06.510> of

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
these I really like this this kind of

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.119 
these I really like this this kind of
sponge<00:03:06.930> dauber<00:03:07.170> because<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.769> fits<00:03:07.950> on<00:03:08.099> your

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
sponge dauber because it fits on your

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.759 
sponge dauber because it fits on your
finger<00:03:08.519> and<00:03:08.700> it's<00:03:09.629> small<00:03:10.079> and<00:03:10.109> so<00:03:10.590> you<00:03:10.680> can

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
finger and it's small and so you can

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.429 
finger and it's small and so you can
really<00:03:10.950> control<00:03:11.400> where<00:03:11.609> the<00:03:11.700> ink<00:03:11.819> is<00:03:12.000> going<00:03:12.439> if

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:13.439 
really control where the ink is going if

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.500 
really control where the ink is going if
you<00:03:13.590> have<00:03:13.829> Stampin<00:03:14.700> sponge<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.180> could

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
you have Stampin sponge you could

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.809 
you have Stampin sponge you could
certainly<00:03:15.810> use<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:16.379> for<00:03:17.159> this<00:03:17.250> technique<00:03:17.670> as

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
certainly use that for this technique as

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.119 
certainly use that for this technique as
well<00:03:18.260> but<00:03:19.260> i'm<00:03:19.500> just<00:03:19.560> going<00:03:19.769> to<00:03:19.799> go<00:03:19.920> ahead<00:03:20.010> and

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
well but i'm just going to go ahead and

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.789 
well but i'm just going to go ahead and

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
get some ink on my sponge and then I

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.629 
get some ink on my sponge and then I
like<00:03:23.069> to<00:03:23.280> go<00:03:23.639> ahead<00:03:23.849> and<00:03:24.030> just<00:03:24.180> remove

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639 
like to go ahead and just remove

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.009 
like to go ahead and just remove
honestly<00:03:26.639> a<00:03:26.670> lot<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.209> ink<00:03:27.420> I<00:03:27.659> know<00:03:27.750> I<00:03:27.870> just

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
honestly a lot of the ink I know I just

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.990 
honestly a lot of the ink I know I just
like<00:03:28.260> work<00:03:28.769> to<00:03:28.799> get<00:03:29.099> that<00:03:29.280> ink<00:03:29.430> on<00:03:29.609> my<00:03:29.730> sponge

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
like work to get that ink on my sponge

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.640 
like work to get that ink on my sponge
but<00:03:31.700> it's<00:03:32.700> easier<00:03:33.090> for<00:03:33.120> me<00:03:33.420> to<00:03:33.840> try<00:03:34.590> to

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
but it's easier for me to try to

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.140 
but it's easier for me to try to
remember<00:03:34.920> that<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:35.519> can<00:03:35.639> always<00:03:35.879> add<00:03:36.120> more

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
remember that you can always add more

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.039 
remember that you can always add more
ink<00:03:36.780> but<00:03:37.079> you<00:03:37.170> can<00:03:37.349> never<00:03:37.530> take<00:03:38.489> it<00:03:38.639> away<00:03:39.019> so<00:03:40.019> I

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
ink but you can never take it away so I

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.660 
ink but you can never take it away so I
like<00:03:40.439> to<00:03:40.470> start<00:03:40.709> with<00:03:40.829> not<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.099> lot<00:03:41.280> of<00:03:41.340> ink<00:03:41.519> on

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
like to start with not a lot of ink on

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.250 
like to start with not a lot of ink on
my<00:03:41.790> sponge<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.329> then<00:03:42.510> I'm<00:03:42.629> going<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:42.780> start<00:03:43.079> in

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
my sponge and then I'm going to start in

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.460 
my sponge and then I'm going to start in
the<00:03:43.560> center<00:03:43.889> of<00:03:44.129> my<00:03:44.489> tree<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.030> I'm<00:03:46.019> just<00:03:46.290> going

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
the center of my tree and I'm just going

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.199 
the center of my tree and I'm just going
to<00:03:46.590> kind<00:03:47.040> of<00:03:47.099> work<00:03:47.220> in<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.459> circular<00:03:47.699> motion<00:03:48.060> and

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
to kind of work in a circular motion and

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:56.470 
to kind of work in a circular motion and
just<00:03:51.560> sponge<00:03:52.560> this<00:03:53.129> ink<00:03:53.430> so<00:03:54.209> that<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.989> darkest

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
just sponge this ink so that the darkest

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.740 
just sponge this ink so that the darkest
part<00:03:57.480> of<00:03:57.629> my<00:03:57.780> sponging<00:03:58.379> is<00:03:58.620> around<00:03:59.750> the

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
part of my sponging is around the

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.720 
part of my sponging is around the
outside<00:04:02.239> just<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.419> outside<00:04:03.569> edge<00:04:03.989> of<00:04:04.730> the

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
outside just the outside edge of the

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.369 
outside just the outside edge of the
tree<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.769> then<00:04:07.769> you<00:04:07.949> can<00:04:08.129> go<00:04:08.250> back<00:04:08.280> in<00:04:09.260> if<00:04:10.260> you

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
tree and then you can go back in if you

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:11.689 
tree and then you can go back in if you
want<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.650> make<00:04:10.769> it<00:04:10.889> just<00:04:10.919> a<00:04:11.159> little<00:04:11.190> bit<00:04:11.430> darker

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:11.699 
want to make it just a little bit darker

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:14.619 
want to make it just a little bit darker
remember<00:04:12.269> you<00:04:12.359> can<00:04:12.479> always<00:04:12.569> add<00:04:12.959> more<00:04:12.989> ink<00:04:13.739> and

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
remember you can always add more ink and

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.629 
remember you can always add more ink and
I<00:04:15.629> also<00:04:15.840> like<00:04:16.139> to<00:04:16.169> control<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.949> amount<00:04:17.190> of<00:04:17.400> ink

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
I also like to control the amount of ink

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.520 
I also like to control the amount of ink
that<00:04:17.880> I'm<00:04:18.060> laying<00:04:18.329> down<00:04:18.419> on<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:18.870> paper<00:04:19.019> with

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
that I'm laying down on the paper with

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:26.000 
that I'm laying down on the paper with
the<00:04:19.769> pressure<00:04:20.039> that<00:04:20.220> I'm<00:04:20.519> using<00:04:21.409> so<00:04:22.409> as<00:04:23.270> I<00:04:25.010> work

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
the pressure that I'm using so as I work

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.860 
the pressure that I'm using so as I work
my<00:04:26.039> way<00:04:26.580> out<00:04:26.820> here<00:04:27.419> I'm<00:04:27.510> going<00:04:27.630> to<00:04:27.720> keep

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
my way out here I'm going to keep

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.779 
my way out here I'm going to keep
sponging<00:04:28.139> starting<00:04:29.010> in<00:04:29.099> the<00:04:29.130> center<00:04:29.430> every

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
sponging starting in the center every

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:34.779 
sponging starting in the center every
time<00:04:30.349> and<00:04:31.349> I'm<00:04:32.099> going<00:04:32.250> to<00:04:32.310> work<00:04:32.400> my<00:04:32.460> way<00:04:32.610> out

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:40.159 

with<00:04:35.789> less<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:36.720> less<00:04:37.020> pressure<00:04:37.470> as<00:04:37.860> I<00:04:39.169> move

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
with less and less pressure as I move

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.159 
with less and less pressure as I move
towards<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.710> edges<00:04:41.599> so<00:04:42.599> that<00:04:42.630> you<00:04:42.870> get<00:04:42.990> this

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
towards the edges so that you get this

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.899 
towards the edges so that you get this
really<00:04:43.380> pretty<00:04:43.590> gradient<00:04:44.190> effect<00:04:44.310> where<00:04:44.789> its

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
really pretty gradient effect where its

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.730 
really pretty gradient effect where its
darkest<00:04:45.389> right<00:04:45.659> around<00:04:45.900> your<00:04:46.110> tree<00:04:46.380> and<00:04:46.650> then

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
darkest right around your tree and then

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.200 
darkest right around your tree and then
I<00:04:46.800> guess<00:04:47.039> lighter<00:04:47.280> and<00:04:47.490> lighter<00:04:47.610> as<00:04:47.880> it<00:04:48.030> moves

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
I guess lighter and lighter as it moves

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.010 
I guess lighter and lighter as it moves
towards<00:04:48.449> the<00:04:48.539> edges<00:04:49.820> just<00:04:50.820> keep<00:04:51.060> starting<00:04:51.900> in

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
towards the edges just keep starting in

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.780 
towards the edges just keep starting in
the<00:04:52.050> middle<00:04:52.289> of<00:04:52.409> my<00:04:52.469> train

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
the middle of my train

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:04.660 
the middle of my train
and<00:04:55.790> working<00:04:56.360> my<00:04:56.630> way<00:04:56.660> out

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.670 

and<00:05:05.180> then<00:05:05.690> you<00:05:05.840> don't<00:05:06.050> want<00:05:06.230> to<00:05:06.290> cover<00:05:06.500> this

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
and then you don't want to cover this

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.990 
and then you don't want to cover this
piece<00:05:06.950> completely<00:05:07.520> you<00:05:07.640> want<00:05:07.790> to<00:05:07.850> make<00:05:07.970> sure

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
piece completely you want to make sure

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.550 
piece completely you want to make sure
that<00:05:08.360> there<00:05:08.510> are<00:05:08.660> kind<00:05:08.900> of<00:05:08.960> some<00:05:09.230> splotchy

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
that there are kind of some splotchy

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.790 
that there are kind of some splotchy
part<00:05:09.950> so<00:05:10.280> that<00:05:10.460> your<00:05:10.640> image<00:05:10.910> has<00:05:11.590> some<00:05:12.590> highs

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
part so that your image has some highs

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.170 
part so that your image has some highs
and<00:05:12.830> lows<00:05:13.370> to<00:05:13.850> it<00:05:14.680> and<00:05:15.680> you<00:05:16.400> want<00:05:16.580> it<00:05:16.640> to<00:05:16.850> sort

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
and lows to it and you want it to sort

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.020 
and lows to it and you want it to sort
of<00:05:17.330> fade<00:05:17.690> out<00:05:17.930> and<00:05:18.200> be<00:05:18.350> brighter<00:05:18.910> around<00:05:19.910> the

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
of fade out and be brighter around the

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.440 
of fade out and be brighter around the
very<00:05:20.210> edges<00:05:21.280> every<00:05:22.280> time<00:05:22.460> I<00:05:22.520> reincke<00:05:23.240> my

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
very edges every time I reincke my

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.210 
very edges every time I reincke my
sponge<00:05:23.720> dauber<00:05:24.140> I'm<00:05:24.290> kind<00:05:24.530> of<00:05:24.650> dabbing<00:05:25.070> off

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
sponge dauber I'm kind of dabbing off

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:46.689 
sponge dauber I'm kind of dabbing off
the<00:05:25.430> excess

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:46.699 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:49.340 

and<00:05:47.699> then<00:05:47.850> once<00:05:48.030> I<00:05:48.150> get<00:05:48.300> it<00:05:48.419> to<00:05:48.720> where<00:05:49.139> it's

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
and then once I get it to where it's

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.499 
and then once I get it to where it's
close<00:05:49.620> to<00:05:49.650> how<00:05:49.979> I<00:05:50.009> like<00:05:50.310> it<00:05:50.340> to<00:05:50.639> look<00:05:50.820> I<00:05:51.090> like<00:05:51.360> to

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:51.509 
close to how I like it to look I like to

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:53.480 
close to how I like it to look I like to
just<00:05:51.690> kind<00:05:51.900> of<00:05:51.960> go<00:05:52.110> back<00:05:52.290> in<00:05:52.530> with<00:05:52.560> a<00:05:52.800> very<00:05:53.220> very

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
just kind of go back in with a very very

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.279 
just kind of go back in with a very very
very<00:05:53.639> light<00:05:54.060> touch<00:05:54.419> and<00:05:55.250> blend<00:05:56.900> the<00:05:57.900> ink<00:05:58.110> a

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
very light touch and blend the ink a

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:01.340 
very light touch and blend the ink a
little<00:05:58.650> bit<00:05:58.800> more<00:05:59.600> between<00:06:00.600> we're<00:06:00.930> sort<00:06:01.289> of

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
little bit more between we're sort of

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.260 
little bit more between we're sort of
the<00:06:01.500> medium<00:06:01.860> color<00:06:02.070> is<00:06:02.340> in<00:06:02.580> the<00:06:02.669> dirt<00:06:02.850> call<00:06:03.060> and

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
the medium color is in the dirt call and

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.330 
the medium color is in the dirt call and
then<00:06:03.449> the<00:06:03.810> very<00:06:03.930> last<00:06:04.050> step<00:06:04.470> I<00:06:04.650> like<00:06:04.889> to<00:06:05.100> just

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
then the very last step I like to just

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.090 
then the very last step I like to just
buff<00:06:05.880> over<00:06:06.449> the<00:06:06.720> embossed<00:06:07.169> image<00:06:07.560> with<00:06:08.070> a

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
buff over the embossed image with a

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.460 
buff over the embossed image with a
paper<00:06:08.370> towel<00:06:08.729> and<00:06:09.090> get<00:06:09.270> off<00:06:09.419> any<00:06:09.720> of<00:06:10.020> the<00:06:10.289> ink

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
paper towel and get off any of the ink

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.050 
paper towel and get off any of the ink
that's<00:06:10.800> sort<00:06:11.009> of<00:06:11.100> stuck<00:06:11.430> you<00:06:11.669> can<00:06:11.729> see<00:06:11.910> there's

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
that's sort of stuck you can see there's

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.200 
that's sort of stuck you can see there's
a<00:06:12.120> little<00:06:12.150> bit<00:06:12.360> ink<00:06:13.009> on<00:06:14.009> my<00:06:14.310> paper<00:06:14.490> towel<00:06:14.789> ink

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
a little bit ink on my paper towel ink

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.750 
a little bit ink on my paper towel ink
it<00:06:15.570> stuck<00:06:15.960> to<00:06:16.500> that<00:06:16.530> embossing<00:06:16.949> powder<00:06:17.990> and

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:19.760 
it stuck to that embossing powder and

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.520 
it stuck to that embossing powder and
there<00:06:20.760> you<00:06:20.910> can<00:06:20.940> see<00:06:21.090> you<00:06:21.449> have<00:06:21.630> a<00:06:21.660> very<00:06:22.380> pretty

card I'll bring my card back and now

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.320 
card I'll bring my card back and now
this<00:06:31.710> would<00:06:31.919> be<00:06:32.070> very<00:06:32.520> beautiful<00:06:33.150> and<00:06:33.300> very

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.330 
this would be very beautiful and very

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.590 
this would be very beautiful and very
effective<00:06:33.690> on<00:06:34.199> a<00:06:35.039> clean<00:06:35.699> and<00:06:35.880> simple<00:06:36.000> card<00:06:36.389> but

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 
effective on a clean and simple card but

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.930 
effective on a clean and simple card but
I<00:06:36.660> decided<00:06:37.110> to<00:06:37.380> make<00:06:37.800> my<00:06:37.830> little<00:06:38.430> bit<00:06:38.639> more<00:06:38.789> on

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 
I decided to make my little bit more on

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.760 
I decided to make my little bit more on
the<00:06:38.970> fancy<00:06:39.419> side<00:06:39.630> I<00:06:39.930> use<00:06:40.440> the<00:06:40.650> new

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
the fancy side I use the new

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.170 
the fancy side I use the new
coordinations<00:06:41.340> card<00:06:41.610> stock<00:06:41.820> with<00:06:41.849> the

coordinations card stock with the

coordinations card stock with the
embossing<00:06:42.479> folder<00:06:43.130> I<00:06:44.130> think<00:06:44.580> this<00:06:44.639> is<00:06:44.699> called

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:44.910 
embossing folder I think this is called

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.730 
embossing folder I think this is called
lacy<00:06:45.120> brocade<00:06:45.690> it's<00:06:45.960> in<00:06:46.080> the<00:06:46.169> holiday<00:06:46.500> catalog

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
lacy brocade it's in the holiday catalog

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:52.640
