00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:59.649
known for Guajarati thali, typical Guajarati
thali and we are serving best Guajarati thali

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:31.690
in Jamnagar.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:40.170
this is a complete Guajarati thali which looks
like a royal treat.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.780
in this we have 3 curries (sabji), one is
authentic potato curry or potato sabji, this

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:54.120
is masala bhindi or you can call it masala
ladyfinger, third one is val, we call it val

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.140

Guajarati kadhi which is made from the besan.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:08.330
here we have sweet dish the fruit salad. this
is a very unique thing which you can get in

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:18.780
only Gujarat. this is known as gota or fulavda,
this is made from besan flour, inside it have

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:28.940
green leaves like fenugreek leaves and green
chilies, here we have fulka roti, dal and

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:37.220
puri. here are the three different chutneys
one is typical Guajarati style garlik chutney,

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.480
second is date sweet chutney and third one
is very popular green chutney which is served

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.620
with many kinds of Indian fast foods.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:54.710
first a fall I am going to start with okra
or ladyfinger which is the fried curry it

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:03.980
is one of the delicious Guajarati curry made
from the okra and some ground spices. it has

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:12.600
a unique Guajarati flavor which you can get
only in Gujarat. when you put in mouth it

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:23.250
feels like chewee but ultimately it gives
good taste of all the masala and it is one

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.949
of the best dish in Guajarati thali.

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:36.949
now I am going to taste kadhi which is made
from the besan and buttermilk, it behaves

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:47.389
a very unique taste, it has a balanced taste
little bit sweet, salty and sour.

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:53.090
I think it is the real Guajarati food which
we are looking for.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:59.509
this is the fulka or you can call it roti.
this is the thing which you heaven't seen

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:06.919
yet this is called gota or fulavda, it is
a very unique Guajarati food, made from besan

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:14.229
and some leafy vegetables and then deep fried
it, it goes good with any other chutneys or

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.330
souses that you have.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:22.560
it is crunchy from outside and absolutely
spongy from inside and very much similar like

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.580
khaman dhokla.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.879
it have same structure but crispy at outside.

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:34.270
at the end of the meal Gujaratâ€™s like dal
and bhat (rice) almost every time.

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:40.830
it is typical Guajarati style dal bhat and
almost everybody in their house like to cook

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.410
dal bhat for the lunch.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:53.580
this is a very good dish, I recommend everybody
to eat this because it is light not spicy

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.919
and it has a balanced taste dish sweet, sour
and salty.

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:01.280
everybody in the world can eat this dish.
