00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.750
 so that's it everyone's 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.460
 today this video I you 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.460
 presentais madeira tickets 125 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:23.900
 so it's a 4-stroke 4-valve engine 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:25.460
 water cooled six speeds so she 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.019
 has very sharp lines I find 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.050
 really she looks a lot like a 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:37.129
 fifty to 50 derby but the front 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:46.129
 is not not identical so and at 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:48.530
 counter canter rather complete we go 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.440
 to say apart from the gasoline gauge 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.910
 it's rather annoying center you 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.530
 go see that we were doing almost 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:00.230
 more gas 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:01.609
 I see then here is 7,126 km that's 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.590
 the engine temperature we come from 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:08.420
 ride with him then a little bit 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:11.750
 hot then when we press there you 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.689
 have different information unless 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.350
 like for example the end it's the 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:21.740
 battery voltage 12 2 this is the 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.920
 speed reached at maximum speed 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.390
 expectations for now with 725 so 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.579
 100 km hour it was when I hated 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.630
 in fact that for now I'm not 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.670
 gone beyond so here's the cons 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.000
 tank that contains only 8 liters 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:42.170
 it may be a little weak but 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.860
 responsible sir while he is 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.880
 the world 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.219
 it is not hinged 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.860
 so that's good in the hands it's 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:55.369
 maybe a little black dot 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:02:03.290
 if not the scene 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:06.530
 she is waiting here 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.920
 so below you have the battery 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:14.600
 some tools the air filter I eat 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:29.360
 emulation a saddle of 80 can be 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:40.430
 changed here so it's a two 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:42.200
 places have a lot of motorbikes so well 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.940
 the next videos you'll see this 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.000
 will not be videos like this one this 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.400
 will be videos where I will be with a friend 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.459
 so rolling with a little 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.970
 background music you see so I tell you 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.970
 Hello everyone
