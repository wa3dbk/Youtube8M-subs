00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.779
 [Music] 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.630
 hello how are you gamers and good 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.400
 well welcome to lesson number 10 the 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.260
 penultimate episode of what it is to be a 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.930
 birthing generations and today 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.849
 we will deal with what is the use of ya and not 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.529
 it's not the ninja charge is the flash 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.630
 yellow added in this nato 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.790
 Do not expect the only north 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.100
 generations is what they add in this 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.710
 Naruto and well this helps you to 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.079
 continue or cancel a combo by 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.670
 Unfortunately this consuming farm and 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.020
 you have to know how to use it to perfection 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.239
 is one of the best techniques that is 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.999
 can you use here I'm with some 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.350
 online battles in a tournament with some 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:54.190
 friends from here or from kings that disgust me 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.559
 but well no I will not give more details and 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.030
 Well, what are we going to do then? 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.489
 here we will see a few examples 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.500
 of what is the use of it is a 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.449
 technique that allows us now yes that 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.189
 to learn the enemy after 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.170
 to continue the combo the good I know 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.640
 will wait but as I say it has 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.680
 to be used perfectly because 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.759
 they consume a lot of farm is not any 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.710
 movement 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.750
 unfortunately consumes twice or the 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.970
 triple chakra of a ninja career and 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.710
 Well this it affects us affects us 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.259
 a lot since we can not use it 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.909
 many times now he does have a 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.009
 limited number because it's going to end 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.190
 the farm at some time the best the 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.240
 very best use that you can give it is 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.740
 after the enemy no longer have 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.009
 trunks then to follow a combo 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.270
 make it longer and cause more damage not 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.190
 It also serves to move you away when 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.780
 when you think the enemy is going to recover 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.520
 transit and you do not have what 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.170
 you can occupy to move away we see about 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.289
 good examples to that with a few combos of 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.390
 degree since they are voting sean way and 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.459
 use what is the day for penn 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.490
 leave it no but as I tell you this has 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:55.719
 a limit precisely for your farm and 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.190
 well because the enemy in any 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.990
 can give you a moment 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.600
 since this movement is the one that 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.210
 can people do if the guy 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.920
 Now he is doing it and you are 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.560
 covering you will vote to be able to 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.790
 redo the plain then it's a 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.070
 technique that you have to master the 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.600
 perfection is the most you can say 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.190
 that of the most complex of what is born 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.360
 generations' or good rather in another 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.370
 they were because I'm sure that also 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.800
 for the 3 they will leave and well then 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.690
 here we are seeing 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.760
 one of the many techniques that we are going 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.810
 let's be able to use here we have another 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.790
 starting the most common and most frequent use 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.070
 is now yes you can say that 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.590
 admits a combo since if you give two 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.810
 blows and back is do you got to 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.400
 spend farm and then nothing is going to 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.960
 serve anything is going to be a waste 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.090
 of farm 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.950
 but on the other hand there is something very 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.100
 important thing that you have to deal with in this 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.140
 what is the use of it and therefore what 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.530
 what is done is that it is very useful for 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.690
 You can say that as I explained it to you 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.730
 lock people in a way as 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.640
 you will vote again and again if something 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.830
 it is not being covered and it is going to have 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.870
 as a movement in which he gets stuck 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.810
 and then this is going to serve you for 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.160
 to be able to continue to vote efe now yes that 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.930
 it's a very difficult movement to master 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.620
 Here I show you the most 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.260
 efficient what is this fire is a 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.150
 good naruto player so they can 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.250
 see a good gameplay from you and 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.470
 is sincerely friends arrives 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.500
 where those who surprise us the most 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.040
 few who are good and I have it if 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.180
 has a good technique to use the already 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.670
 originally used when 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.620
 implemented in the demo what would be 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.870
 the storm generations was very used 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.430
 for half the combo and winnow 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.370
 another full 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.109
 here the most common use they give is how 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.079
 to guess the use of the trunk of the 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:50.599
 enemy or are you hitting the 23 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.219
 blows and squeezes is already going to do 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.470
 quiet just when you arrive by 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:56.750
 where are you going to appear behind him 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.180
 and then it will have been a contempt of 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.710
 farm and now that in addition to the 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.720
 transit expense of it therefore 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.460
 overcome faint since he would then see if 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.220
 trunks take longer to regenerate 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.350
 and well that's the technique you can most 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.760
 be that most used 23 blow this 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.020
 management quito adjusted gloves make a 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.370
 quiet of the enemy this is already 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.890
 question as of perception in 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.630
 movement of the character would be rather 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.030
 issue in which you are getting to know 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.190
 the enemy in which you can give two 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.660
 three test shots and you're going to give 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.640
 count ex doing tronquito you're not going to 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.560
 do guide to adults or 23 and be 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.360
 calm in that way you're guessing 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.550
 the pattern what is the day in that 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.170
 meaning depends a lot on him now yes that 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.410
 of the enemy's movement pattern the 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:38.210
 most is very generic is 23 strokes and 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.790
 be quiet then you can 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.100
 overtake tele2 three blows strong removed 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.530
 you squeeze and it arrives and you're going to lift it 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.020
 also it serves to tronquito costumes and 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.940
 squeeze comes but unfortunately there 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.830
 you're spending a little bit and it 's now 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.570
 that yes that is an expense in a certain part 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.370
 Useless 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.460
 another of its utilities can be said 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.040
 which is now so cut a combo if 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.170
 you are about to finish it 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.700
 is in mode of trying to tell you very 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.010
 well since with this you can cut without 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.930
 no problem what the combo would be 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.390
 it also serves that seems that in combat 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.890
 aerial is not very efficient as such 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.240
 because you spend chacra and good for it 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.620
 you can use the race online and it's 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.050
 pretty easy to dodge this 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.760
 movement in the air and not the 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.410
 I recommend a lot, I recommend that you 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.750
 practice and protect it with 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:27.110
 computer because if it works against the 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:30.170
 computer on and super difficult since if 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.000
 it works because it covers a lot then 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.040
 at the moment that you are going to attack 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.930
 the purchase are already being covered then 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.580
 if you are going to be very very effective you are going to 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.650
 to practice with it then 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.780
 I'm going to pass a tip to be able to practice 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.460
 with the computer much better I almost 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.129
 not this magician case online precisely 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.129
 for this trick 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:50.739
 now yes that a last trick so 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:52.539
 is 15 to discover this trick to 

00:05:50.739 --> 00:05:54.550
 except he told me I do not know who 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:56.309
 will have actually discovered but this 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.349
 trick is very efficient since it allows you 

00:05:56.309 --> 00:06:01.029
 learn to play unfortunately when 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:03.639
 you are online because if it affects you a bit 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:05.769
 but good so I hope you have 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:06.759
 enjoyed this edition number 10 of 

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:09.129
 what it is to be a problem do not you 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:12.219
 you can use the day or the flash 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:13.569
 yellow and good and nothing else is left 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:14.949
 episode that is the episode that 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:17.110
 put many expected that is the 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:18.610
 cancer episode the combo this maybe 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.689
 It takes a little longer to leave after 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.759
 that this episode comes out I do not think 

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:23.909
 leave the following Monday as required 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:26.800
 a slightly more complex edition 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:29.069
 requires the use of multiple images 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.179
 to give examples and other things not 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:33.459
 so now I really hope that 

00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:37.349
 you liked this episode see you 

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:37.349
 in the last and baby 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:07:01.740
