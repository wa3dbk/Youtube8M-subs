00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
help the ones I bought I bought the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.600 
help the ones I bought I bought the
small<00:01:04.949> version<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:06.650> honestly<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:07.740> wish<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.369> had

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
small version and honestly I wish I had

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.480 
small version and honestly I wish I had
purchased<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.720> mediums<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.250> small

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
purchased the mediums the the small

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.820 
purchased the mediums the the small
version<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.330> little<00:01:12.689> bit<00:01:12.930> too<00:01:13.320> low<00:01:13.650> I

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
version is just a little bit too low I

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.770 
version is just a little bit too low I
think<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.159> mediums<00:01:14.490> instead<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.420> being<00:01:15.570> wider

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
think the mediums instead of being wider

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.679 
think the mediums instead of being wider
or<00:01:16.110> just<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.380> little<00:01:16.470> bit<00:01:16.680> higher<00:01:17.330> and<00:01:18.330> as<00:01:18.540> far

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
or just a little bit higher and as far

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.350 
or just a little bit higher and as far
back<00:01:18.960> as<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.259> sit<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.950> seat<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:21.000> an<00:01:21.060> upright

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
back as I sit on the seat in an upright

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.380 
back as I sit on the seat in an upright
position<00:01:21.860> they<00:01:22.860> do<00:01:22.920> help<00:01:23.310> even<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.180> small

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
position they do help even the small

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.240 
position they do help even the small
ones<00:01:24.540> do<00:01:24.689> help<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.290> think<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.650> medium<00:01:25.950> ones

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
ones do help but I think the medium ones

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.200 
ones do help but I think the medium ones
would<00:01:26.460> work<00:01:26.640> better<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:27.270> fact<00:01:28.080> one<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.470> my

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
would work better in fact one of my

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.749 
would work better in fact one of my
commenters<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.479> one<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.020> my<00:01:31.170> Dino<00:01:31.890> one<00:01:32.130> review

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759

commenters on one of my Dino one review
videos<00:01:33.439> asked<00:01:34.439> about<00:01:34.619> those<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.759> suggested

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
videos asked about those and I suggested

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.260 
videos asked about those and I suggested
they<00:01:36.360> get<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.570> mediums<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:38.009> believe<00:01:38.280> he

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
they get the mediums and I believe he

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.749 
they get the mediums and I believe he
did<00:01:39.509> buy<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.900> medium<00:01:40.290> size<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.530> his<00:01:41.369> response

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
did buy the medium size and his response

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.420 
did buy the medium size and his response
back<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.150> me<00:01:42.240> was<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.479> they<00:01:42.780> work<00:01:42.930> great<00:01:43.430> so

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
back to me was that they work great so

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.880 
back to me was that they work great so
if<00:01:44.520> those<00:01:44.670> ever<00:01:44.909> fail<00:01:45.180> me<00:01:45.420> or<00:01:45.750> get<00:01:45.960> broken<00:01:46.229> I

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
if those ever fail me or get broken I

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.190 
if those ever fail me or get broken I
will<00:01:47.670> replace<00:01:48.180> them<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.659> I'll<00:01:48.750> replace<00:01:49.020> them

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.450 
will replace them and I'll replace them

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.789 
this type of mirror on your bike you
could<00:03:06.120> probably<00:03:06.359> get<00:03:06.629> away<00:03:06.720> with<00:03:06.840> velcroing

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
could probably get away with velcroing

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.860 
could probably get away with velcroing
these<00:03:08.069> to<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.340> tops<00:03:08.549> using<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.389> heavy<00:03:09.599> duty

very<00:03:31.410> easy<00:03:32.840> very<00:03:33.840> happy<00:03:34.560> with<00:03:34.680> them<00:03:34.829> again<00:03:35.129> if

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
very easy very happy with them again if

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.250 
very easy very happy with them again if
I<00:03:35.669> were<00:03:35.819> to<00:03:35.970> do<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:36.090> over<00:03:36.299> again<00:03:36.449> I<00:03:36.810> would<00:03:36.870> get

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
I were to do it over again I would get

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.839 
I were to do it over again I would get
the<00:03:37.349> medium<00:03:37.680> size<00:03:37.889> instead<00:03:38.430> of<00:03:38.549> the<00:03:38.639> small

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
the medium size instead of the small

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.610 
the medium size instead of the small
originally<00:03:41.849> I<00:03:42.030> mounted<00:03:42.720> them<00:03:42.870> underneath<00:03:43.290> and

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
originally I mounted them underneath and

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.800 
originally I mounted them underneath and
they<00:03:44.430> actually<00:03:44.579> looked<00:03:45.030> better<00:03:45.209> mounted

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
they actually looked better mounted

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.710 
they actually looked better mounted
underneath<00:03:46.079> but<00:03:46.680> as<00:03:47.579> far<00:03:47.849> away<00:03:48.000> as<00:03:48.180> they<00:03:48.480> are

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
underneath but as far away as they are

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.580 
underneath but as far away as they are
from<00:03:49.530> my<00:03:49.650> line<00:03:49.889> of<00:03:50.069> eyesight<00:03:51.319> made<00:03:52.319> it<00:03:52.440> really

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
from my line of eyesight made it really

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.000 
from my line of eyesight made it really
difficult<00:03:52.980> to<00:03:53.549> adjust<00:03:54.419> them<00:03:54.900> and<00:03:55.139> to<00:03:55.859> really

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
difficult to adjust them and to really

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.759 
difficult to adjust them and to really
see<00:03:56.220> anything<00:03:56.780> again<00:03:57.780> maybe<00:03:57.930> if<00:03:58.109> I<00:03:58.199> bought<00:03:58.650> the
