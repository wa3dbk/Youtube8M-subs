00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
do is you're going to take some wire

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.380 
do is you're going to take some wire
cutters<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:17.220> you're<00:01:18.210> going<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.740> cut<00:01:19.740> along

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
cutters and you're going to cut along

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.030 
cutters and you're going to cut along
this<00:01:21.680> just<00:01:22.680> like<00:01:23.009> maybe<00:01:23.970> about<00:01:24.450> like<00:01:24.720> a

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
this just like maybe about like a

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
this just like maybe about like a
centimeter<00:01:26.040> after<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> gray<00:01:27.420> come<00:01:28.350> up<00:01:28.619> and

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
centimeter after the gray come up and

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.940 
centimeter after the gray come up and
then<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.329> cut<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.630> little<00:01:30.810> bit<00:01:31.380> before<00:01:31.560> this

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
then it cut a little bit before this

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.270 
then it cut a little bit before this
gray<00:01:32.280> ends<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.259> well<00:01:34.259> if<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.710> want<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.070> make

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
gray ends and well if you want to make

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.800 
gray ends and well if you want to make
it<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.460> little<00:01:35.579> bit<00:01:35.759> better<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:36.060> cut<00:01:36.570> out<00:01:36.750> all

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
it a little bit better just cut out all

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.270 
it a little bit better just cut out all
of<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.500> gray<00:01:38.119> basically<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.570> top<00:01:39.840> and

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
of the gray basically on the top and

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.980 
of the gray basically on the top and
that's<00:01:41.280> probably<00:01:41.670> about<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.659> an<00:01:42.840> inch

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
that's probably about I have an inch

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.620 
that's probably about I have an inch
deep<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.070> you're<00:01:44.880> going<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.210> do<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.479> on<00:01:45.600> both

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
deep and you're going to do that on both

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.819 
deep and you're going to do that on both
sides<00:01:46.290> try<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.829> make<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.040> as<00:01:47.250> even<00:01:47.790> as<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.180> can

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
sides try to make it as even as you can

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.960 
sides try to make it as even as you can
that<00:01:49.829> way<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.340> can<00:01:50.880> fit<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:52.280> this<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.610> like

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
that way it can fit this this is like

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.840 
that way it can fit this this is like
the<00:01:54.149> attachment<00:01:54.810> rail<00:01:54.990> for<00:01:55.350> like<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.740> laser<00:01:56.369> cuz

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
the attachment rail for like a laser cuz

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.520 
the attachment rail for like a laser cuz
my<00:01:56.969> legs<00:01:57.180> are<00:01:57.299> broke<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:58.009> so<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.390> just

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530
