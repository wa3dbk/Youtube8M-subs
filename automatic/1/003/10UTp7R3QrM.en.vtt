minutes to go over them today the first
and<00:00:25.170> foremost<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.769> what<00:00:25.949> type<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.160> camera<00:00:26.460> do

and foremost is what type of camera do
we<00:00:26.789> use<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.240> know<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.420> lot<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.720> people<00:00:27.990> who

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
we use and I know a lot of people who

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.830 
we use and I know a lot of people who
have<00:00:28.580> who<00:00:29.580> get<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.789> decent<00:00:30.179> amount<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.480> views<00:00:30.689> on

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840

have who get a decent amount of views on
their<00:00:30.990> profile<00:00:31.410> would<00:00:31.560> probably<00:00:31.890> get<00:00:32.009> that

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
their profile would probably get that

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.870 
their profile would probably get that
question<00:00:32.960> we<00:00:33.960> use<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> Canon<00:00:34.620> gl2<00:00:34.860> for<00:00:35.550> all<00:00:35.760> the

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
question we use a Canon gl2 for all the

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.729 
question we use a Canon gl2 for all the
reviews<00:00:36.210> right<00:00:36.450> now<00:00:36.630> I'm<00:00:36.690> using<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:37.020> webcam<00:00:37.200> so

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
reviews right now I'm using a webcam so

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.709 
reviews right now I'm using a webcam so
the<00:00:37.829> quality<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.309> not<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.640> good<00:00:38.790> but<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.420> gl2

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
the quality is not that good but the gl2

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.020 
the quality is not that good but the gl2
is<00:00:40.110> we<00:00:40.469> used<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.739> have<00:00:40.980> an<00:00:41.100> excel<00:00:41.430> one<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
is we used to have an excel one of the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.819 
is we used to have an excel one of the
GL<00:00:42.270> -<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> pretty<00:00:43.110> good<00:00:43.320> upgrade<00:00:43.469> over<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
GL - is a pretty good upgrade over the

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.610 
GL - is a pretty good upgrade over the
excellent<00:00:44.190> one<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.309> would<00:00:44.550> say<00:00:45.110> it<00:00:46.110> costs<00:00:46.469> about

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
excellent one I would say it costs about

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.040 
excellent one I would say it costs about
$2,000<00:00:47.489> but<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.420> can<00:00:48.539> probably<00:00:48.690> get<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.020> for

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
$2,000 but you can probably get it for

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.350 
$2,000 but you can probably get it for
half<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:50.160> eBay<00:00:52.850> another<00:00:53.850> question

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
half of that on eBay another question

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.099 
half of that on eBay another question
was<00:00:54.539> what<00:00:55.230> kind<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.500> sound<00:00:55.739> do<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:55.980> have<00:00:56.129> and

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
was what kind of sound do we have and

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.450 
was what kind of sound do we have and
usually<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:58.230> pretty<00:00:58.530> straightforward<00:00:58.859> we

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
usually it's pretty straightforward we

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.540 
usually it's pretty straightforward we
usually<00:00:59.730> just<00:00:59.760> use<00:01:00.770> the<00:01:01.770> onboard<00:01:02.129> sound<00:01:02.340> of

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
usually just use the onboard sound of

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.299 
usually just use the onboard sound of
the<00:01:02.609> camera<00:01:02.969> but<00:01:03.809> when<00:01:03.840> we<00:01:04.350> shot<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.830> short

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
the camera but when we shot the short

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.130 
the camera but when we shot the short
films<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.000> innocence<00:01:06.360> which<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:07.020> my

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
films like the innocence which is on my

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.289 
films like the innocence which is on my
profile<00:01:07.530> we<00:01:07.770> did<00:01:08.159> use<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.580> blue<00:01:08.700> mic<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.210> we

editing<00:01:53.520> program<00:01:53.670> do<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.090> use<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.689> if<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.409> can

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
editing program do we use and if I can

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.270 
editing program do we use and if I can
find<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.509> for<00:01:57.509> most<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.200> my<00:01:58.229> projects<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.070> use

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
find it for most of my projects I use

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.300 
find it for most of my projects I use
the<00:01:59.579> iMovie<00:02:00.540> which<00:02:00.899> is<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.079> very<00:02:01.320> basic<00:02:01.619> program

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
the iMovie which is a very basic program

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.090 
the iMovie which is a very basic program
that<00:02:03.210> comes<00:02:03.420> with<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.719> mat<00:02:03.899> but<00:02:04.560> on<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> really

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
that comes with the mat but on a really

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.560 
that comes with the mat but on a really
large<00:02:05.310> project<00:02:05.520> I'll<00:02:05.939> use<00:02:06.090> Final<00:02:06.390> Cut<00:02:06.420> Pro

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
large project I'll use Final Cut Pro

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.380 
large project I'll use Final Cut Pro
Express<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.290> that's<00:02:08.069> just<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.489> more<00:02:08.849> toned

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
Express and that's just a more toned

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.230 
Express and that's just a more toned
version<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.810> final<00:02:10.080> cut<00:02:10.289> because<00:02:11.120> in<00:02:12.120> my

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
version the final cut because in my

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.540 
version the final cut because in my
opinion<00:02:12.600> in<00:02:12.690> Final<00:02:12.960> Cut<00:02:12.990> Pro<00:02:13.350> kinda<00:02:13.980> has<00:02:14.130> some

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
opinion in Final Cut Pro kinda has some

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.949 
opinion in Final Cut Pro kinda has some
things<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:14.940> aren't<00:02:15.209> necessary<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:15.870> it

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
things that aren't necessary and it

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.020 
things that aren't necessary and it
costs<00:02:16.230> hundreds<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.340> hundreds<00:02:17.610> more<00:02:17.640> dollars

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
costs hundreds and hundreds more dollars

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.880 
costs hundreds and hundreds more dollars

in Final Cut Express and Final Cut
Express<00:02:19.980> has<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.459> same<00:02:20.640> kind<00:02:20.850> of<00:02:20.880> tools<00:02:21.030> you

Express has the same kind of tools you

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.270 
Express has the same kind of tools you
just<00:02:22.020> don't<00:02:22.319> get<00:02:22.380> some<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.800> extra<00:02:22.980> stuff

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
that probably don't need other than that
