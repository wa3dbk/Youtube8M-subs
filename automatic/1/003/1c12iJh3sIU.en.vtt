00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 have people and welcome to one 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.370
 worker gta 4 dull notions yes 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.910
 I finally decide what to do 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.290
 he have for max and yes today i have 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.590
 I thought I'd make it 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:18.990
 police bus and today we have the web 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.250
 police cruiser out gta 5 gta 4 yes one 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.570
 small gang around 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.689
 the rating is meaningless 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.490
 because you do not model but the 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.859
 rockstar games rated is the question 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.079
 from which version that is I think 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.000
 times from Munich 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:39.149
 I would say that the boys so 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.710
 so xbox 360 and ps3 version of that 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:47.850
 textures inside times has that is always the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.100
 worst gta4 so we are looking 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.050
 first of all more accurate so the engine is 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.940
 but it does not work that well 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.559
 well textured here that's okay for nothing 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.690
 be free here andreas license plate 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:06.770
 of course and here the sign city of 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.500
 law centers and where two cents 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:14.220
 Of course, her ex is a professional 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.460
 spaghetti on it by the way the police 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.630
 Cruiser from the first trailer 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.110
 there they were in the first trailer 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.439
 the ideas are there he is right that is 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.200
 the idea then the yeti was this even 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.400
 then here yes that are here there must 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.000
 you want to shit the gates 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:40.049
 textures and here also yes 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:44.620
 hard winter went on the people here 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:47.830
 a black black trunk and 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.090
 the picture continues here you have to 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.700
 not really that many 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:57.310
 By the way, that's the way to lose it 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.140
 Giant thanks for 10,000 subscribers 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.700
 for yesterday I again video 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.860
 seen video made that you can then 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:07.800
 can you already on the different 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:11.580
 judge that can not do anything you can 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:30.700
 here friendly the stone plate here 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:32.590
 blinker light entrepreneur so good yes so 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.910
 I think the track is damn tired and 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.500
 At least I have against the normal 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.110
 police cruiser posed against the first 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.240
 So the cruiser of gta 4 1 set 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.570
 1 are not two generations police 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.390
 cruiser first exactly the same width 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.360
 what almost next bankruptcy acceleration 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.570
 test in any case in decent relative 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.680
 well have expected maybe a 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.030
 a bit too slow 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.040
 you have to say that's exactly the one 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.950
 first politician so it is exact 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.700
 the normal krautkrämer gates, so to speak 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.750
 from gta 4 only as another model so can 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.540
 you actually one thing i really do 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:15.820
 Rate here curve behavior is just 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:18.510
 gta4 moderately good so perfect is the 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.379
 texture does not suffer with it again 4 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.379
 so 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:32.700
 The Monty goal left 133 years is beautiful 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.019
 also not firm has yellow from the egg but 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:40.269
 what do you expect cheeky simply had 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.150
 take off from him to the coup rash 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:49.569
 to get in the plane again 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:51.549
 143 144 treasury against so sees 144 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.019
 car crash a picture of the five 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.640
 gta 4 vehicles 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.430
 Interestingly, the world is 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.790
 Pretty cool the bonnet sees it 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.790
 very good 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.290
 Naturally 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:09.130
 for which one is nice for now 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:12.870
 the school will now be the left 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.870
 broken selena blue light 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:19.760
 but it does not have maybe already 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:24.100
 to vote better left open what you too 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.100
 come up with the idea 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.960
 so 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:37.110
 280 km h crash a bit diagonally 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:42.830
 but yes crash okay I would say 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.830
 better and better 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.500
 so normal 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:55.009
 I can not break that police 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.720
 Surely not surprised here weeks 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.930
 such a flight time kruse from the she even 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.629
 do not know because that's without being off 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.569
 opened up interesting yes very crash 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:07.849
 okay so evaluation time so give that 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:09.229
 I then it 's pretty hard because 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:13.120
 actually i can give him the gta 5 motto 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.120
 can rate 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:21.830
 god times cool 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:24.919
 that was elegant to give the people after 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.780
 conversion is quite good 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:30.020
 In any case, there has not been a lot 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:33.949
 and I think so almost 11 that 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:36.009
 vehicle from gta 5 and yes definitely 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:39.349
 So it's an almost perfect case 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:43.960
 Unfortunately no conversion 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:45.530
 handling files or so you are the one 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.460
 Of course it will be your own 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.460
 I am getting harder at the vehicle 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.889
 would rate it differently but I am yes 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:56.620
 only seven out of ten of the mod are there 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:57.000
 still commenting so rent night from 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.360
 10 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.910
 it just does not have artificially high and it 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.919
 could not reach 10 out of 10 for that 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.610
 it has to change tomorrow and be casual 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.800
 marginal 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.539
 So as I said the mod you can 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.449
 Critics values ​​is therefore not a big one 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:15.360
 worth in any case swat download is 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:18.789
 of course in the video description 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.410
 so I hope that you will like as 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:22.300
 like an abo or a little one 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:25.690
 again believe that big has too 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.069
 lives and then I was already on that 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:36.039
 next time a little bit was still good 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:37.240
 yes and the longest picture why jump 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:39.840
 makes her always to a higher 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.840
 I came down 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:45.400
 for months is not completely provided 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:48.900
 the difference 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:52.290
 first the whole glass so until then so 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.290
 right in ride
