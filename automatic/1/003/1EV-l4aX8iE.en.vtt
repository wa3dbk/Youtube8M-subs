challenge<00:00:46.610> and<00:00:47.090> I'm<00:00:47.360> quite<00:00:47.570> good<00:00:48.410> at<00:00:48.530> solving

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
challenge and I'm quite good at solving

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.600 
challenge and I'm quite good at solving
you<00:00:49.100> obviously<00:00:49.400> fairly<00:00:49.880> good<00:00:50.240> and<00:00:51.250> so<00:00:52.250> I

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
you obviously fairly good and so I

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.250 
you obviously fairly good and so I
thought<00:00:52.880> let's<00:00:53.150> put<00:00:53.210> that<00:00:53.420> together<00:00:53.600> and<00:00:53.989> then

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
thought let's put that together and then

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.819 
thought let's put that together and then
raise<00:00:55.160> some<00:00:55.370> money<00:00:55.489> because<00:00:55.940> my<00:00:56.390> father

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
raise some money because my father

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:58.930 
raise some money because my father
suffered<00:00:57.829> for<00:00:57.980> prostate<00:00:58.280> cancer<00:00:58.340> last<00:00:58.790> year

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
suffered for prostate cancer last year

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.690 
suffered for prostate cancer last year
and<00:00:59.320> that's<00:01:00.320> why<00:01:00.470> I<00:01:00.500> wanna<00:01:00.649> raise<00:01:00.950> money<00:01:01.220> that

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
and that's why I wanna raise money that

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.119 
and that's why I wanna raise money that
would<00:01:01.820> be<00:01:01.970> really<00:01:02.329> great<00:01:02.510> to<00:01:02.720> have<00:01:02.840> a<00:01:03.129> Guinness

two<00:02:26.280> million<00:02:26.550> three<00:02:27.420> hundred<00:02:27.450> thousand

two million three hundred thousand

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.160 
two million three hundred thousand
pounds<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.540> let's<00:02:30.540> think<00:02:30.660> it<00:02:30.810> was<00:02:30.930> still

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
pounds and let's think it was still

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.740 
pounds and let's think it was still
going<00:02:31.440> up<00:02:31.590> even<00:02:32.130> as<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:32.550> stood<00:02:32.910> waiting<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.570> run

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
going up even as I stood waiting to run

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.210 
going up even as I stood waiting to run
so<00:02:33.990> I'm<00:02:34.050> not<00:02:34.200> quite<00:02:34.320> sure<00:02:34.440> what<00:02:34.830> it's<00:02:34.980> reached

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
so I'm not quite sure what it's reached

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.610 
so I'm not quite sure what it's reached
but<00:02:35.400> that's<00:02:35.640> at<00:02:36.150> least<00:02:36.390> half<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.990> million<00:02:37.200> more

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
but that's at least half a million more

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.830 
but that's at least half a million more
than<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.430> previous<00:02:38.640> record<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.480> just<00:02:39.720> like
