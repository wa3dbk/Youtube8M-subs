your how come from you out you will have

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.160 
your how come from you out you will have
time<00:01:42.700> to<00:01:43.030> go<00:01:43.119> to<00:01:43.149> the<00:01:43.329> proper<00:01:43.630> way<00:01:43.749> if<00:01:43.929> you<00:01:44.049> want

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
time to go to the proper way if you want

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.899 
time to go to the proper way if you want
as<00:01:44.679> you<00:01:44.890> can<00:01:44.950> see<00:01:45.100> i<00:01:45.130> do<00:01:45.219> stop<00:01:45.490> a<00:01:45.520> couple<00:01:45.819> of

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
as you can see i do stop a couple of

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.239 
as you can see i do stop a couple of
times<00:01:46.060> and<00:01:46.359> i'm<00:01:47.049> still<00:01:47.319> ahead<00:01:47.409> of<00:01:47.560> it<00:01:47.740> so<00:01:48.130> this

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:48.249 
times and i'm still ahead of it so this

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:49.499 
times and i'm still ahead of it so this
is<00:01:48.280> your<00:01:48.399> first<00:01:48.579> little<00:01:48.729> waypoint<00:01:49.149> here<00:01:49.299> get

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
is your first little waypoint here get

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.179 
is your first little waypoint here get
there<00:01:49.749> and<00:01:49.960> it<00:01:50.560> will<00:01:50.649> give<00:01:50.710> you<00:01:50.799> about<00:01:50.890> second

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
there and it will give you about second

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:52.410 
there and it will give you about second
for<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.340> loads<00:01:51.789> again<00:01:51.909> you<00:01:52.030> can<00:01:52.210> stay<00:01:52.359> there

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
for the loads again you can stay there

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.700 
for the loads again you can stay there
for<00:01:52.569> long<00:01:52.600> as<00:01:52.780> one<00:01:52.929> there's<00:01:53.049> no<00:01:53.140> time<00:01:53.319> so<00:01:53.530> I

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
for long as one there's no time so I

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.719 
for long as one there's no time so I
went<00:01:53.890> straight<00:01:54.009> away<00:01:54.310> because<00:01:54.429> I<00:01:54.549> knew<00:01:54.640> the

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
went straight away because I knew the

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:55.859 
went straight away because I knew the
past<00:01:54.939> but<00:01:55.090> you<00:01:55.210> could<00:01:55.329> just<00:01:55.479> stay<00:01:55.600> there<00:01:55.749> and

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
past but you could just stay there and

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.550 
past but you could just stay there and
get<00:01:56.020> cozy<00:01:56.170> so

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
get cozy so

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.990 
get cozy so
you're<00:01:58.070> going<00:01:58.189> to<00:01:58.250> come<00:01:58.399> straight<00:01:58.549> across<00:01:58.759> the

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
you're going to come straight across the

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.370 
you're going to come straight across the
back<00:01:59.119> here<00:01:59.299> I<00:01:59.479> take<00:01:59.750> a<00:01:59.780> bit<00:01:59.960> of<00:02:00.020> a<00:02:00.110> look<00:02:00.229> round

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
back here I take a bit of a look round

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.840 
back here I take a bit of a look round
because<00:02:00.590> I'm<00:02:00.890> still<00:02:01.100> I'm<00:02:01.369> learning<00:02:01.759> this

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
because I'm still I'm learning this

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.550 
because I'm still I'm learning this
while<00:02:02.000> I<00:02:02.030> do<00:02:02.149> the<00:02:02.240> jump<00:02:02.420> puzzle<00:02:02.659> and<00:02:02.840> suddenly

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
while I do the jump puzzle and suddenly

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.620 
while I do the jump puzzle and suddenly
next<00:02:03.950> day<00:02:04.040> on<00:02:04.100> doing<00:02:04.610> about<00:02:04.640> half<00:02:04.880> an<00:02:05.000> hour<00:02:05.090> so

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
next day on doing about half an hour so

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.819 
next day on doing about half an hour so
you<00:02:05.720> come<00:02:05.840> around<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.079> back<00:02:06.200> here<00:02:06.470> and<00:02:06.680> as<00:02:06.770> you

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
you come around the back here and as you

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.229 
you come around the back here and as you
can<00:02:07.009> see<00:02:07.039> if<00:02:07.220> we<00:02:07.280> got<00:02:07.369> a<00:02:07.430> couple<00:02:07.520> of<00:02:07.759> people<00:02:08.090> who

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
can see if we got a couple of people who

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.559 
can see if we got a couple of people who
have<00:02:08.270> nice<00:02:08.509> to<00:02:08.599> get<00:02:08.660> as<00:02:08.780> far<00:02:09.310> I'm<00:02:10.310> screwed<00:02:10.550> I<00:02:10.670> as

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
have nice to get as far I'm screwed I as

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.030 
have nice to get as far I'm screwed I as
you<00:02:11.720> can<00:02:11.840> see<00:02:11.930> here<00:02:12.140> as<00:02:12.290> you<00:02:12.440> watch<00:02:12.590> it<00:02:12.800> along

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
you can see here as you watch it along

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.860 
you can see here as you watch it along
there's<00:02:13.970> never<00:02:14.209> a<00:02:14.330> little<00:02:14.540> way<00:02:14.630> of<00:02:14.660> pointing

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
there's never a little way of pointing

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.750 
there's never a little way of pointing
about<00:02:15.170> halfway<00:02:15.380> down<00:02:15.800> where<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.130> rocks<00:02:16.340> stop

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
about halfway down where the rocks stop

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.400 
about halfway down where the rocks stop
so<00:02:17.209> you<00:02:17.269> don't<00:02:17.630> have<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.780> do<00:02:17.840> all<00:02:17.870> this<00:02:18.200> in<00:02:18.349> one

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
so you don't have to do all this in one

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.940 
so you don't have to do all this in one
go<00:02:18.790> so<00:02:19.790> just<00:02:20.390> some<00:02:20.540> take<00:02:21.170> your<00:02:21.260> time<00:02:21.410> take<00:02:21.920> a

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
go so just some take your time take a

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.030 
go so just some take your time take a
deep<00:02:22.040> breath<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:22.430> just<00:02:22.790> go<00:02:22.970> for<00:02:23.120> it<00:02:23.890> there<00:02:24.890> is

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
deep breath and just go for it there is

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.610 
deep breath and just go for it there is
like<00:02:25.910> I<00:02:25.970> say<00:02:26.209> times<00:02:26.569> when<00:02:26.810> you<00:02:26.870> can't<00:02:27.110> stop<00:02:27.410> so

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
like I say times when you can't stop so

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.020 
like I say times when you can't stop so
you<00:02:27.680> don't<00:02:27.950> have<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.310> sprint<00:02:28.610> this<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:28.940> mean

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
you don't have to sprint this I mean

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.130 
you don't have to sprint this I mean
obviously<00:02:29.360> being<00:02:29.540> a<00:02:29.630> thief<00:02:29.750> I've<00:02:29.900> got<00:02:30.049> my

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
obviously being a thief I've got my

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.750 
obviously being a thief I've got my
passive<00:02:30.500> signature<00:02:30.890> shadows<00:02:31.069> which<00:02:31.190> 25<00:02:31.580> sep

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
passive signature shadows which 25 sep

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.190 
passive signature shadows which 25 sep
movement<00:02:32.060> speed<00:02:32.209> so<00:02:32.569> it<00:02:32.600> may<00:02:32.750> be<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.930> little<00:02:32.989> bit

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
movement speed so it may be a little bit

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.900 
movement speed so it may be a little bit
harder<00:02:33.470> if<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:33.830> don't<00:02:34.040> have<00:02:34.250> that<00:02:34.400> be

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
harder if you don't have that be

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.130 
harder if you don't have that be
interesting<00:02:35.239> to<00:02:35.360> know<00:02:35.450> how<00:02:35.600> you<00:02:35.660> got<00:02:35.780> on<00:02:35.900> with

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
interesting to know how you got on with

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.750 
interesting to know how you got on with
it<00:02:36.200> if<00:02:36.410> you<00:02:36.500> just<00:02:36.620> leave<00:02:36.709> with<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:36.890> comment<00:02:37.220> say

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
it if you just leave with a comment say

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.580 
it if you just leave with a comment say
know<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:37.970> do<00:02:38.120> but<00:02:38.360> some<00:02:39.019> people<00:02:39.260> obviously<00:02:39.350> do

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
know you do but some people obviously do

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.930 
know you do but some people obviously do
also<00:02:39.739> have<00:02:39.860> passive<00:02:40.220> speeds<00:02:40.459> that<00:02:40.640> could<00:02:40.819> help

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
also have passive speeds that could help

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.000 
also have passive speeds that could help
them<00:02:41.120> out<00:02:41.180> so<00:02:41.810> just<00:02:42.319> keep<00:02:42.410> going<00:02:42.620> along<00:02:42.830> is

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
them out so just keep going along is

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.710 
them out so just keep going along is
quite<00:02:43.549> some<00:02:43.700> spanish<00:02:44.030> you<00:02:44.120> really<00:02:44.390> just<00:02:44.540> keep

going on and jumping onto the rocks as

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.610 
going on and jumping onto the rocks as
they<00:02:46.700> come<00:02:46.880> up<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.239> here's<00:02:48.170> your<00:02:48.290> second

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
they come up and here's your second

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.690 
they come up and here's your second
little<00:02:48.799> point<00:02:48.950> here<00:02:49.069> don't<00:02:49.310> worry<00:02:49.400> this<00:02:49.549> will

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
little point here don't worry this will

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.309 
little point here don't worry this will
or<00:02:49.910> will<00:02:50.030> not<00:02:50.090> erupted<00:02:50.599> so<00:02:50.930> you<00:02:51.019> walk<00:02:51.170> it

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
or will not erupted so you walk it

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.580 
or will not erupted so you walk it
knocked<00:02:51.500> off<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:52.000> then<00:02:53.000> that<00:02:53.630> is<00:02:53.810> once<00:02:54.410> we<00:02:54.470> get

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
knocked off and then that is once we get

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.320 
knocked off and then that is once we get
there<00:02:54.799> that<00:02:55.010> is<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.280> end<00:02:55.459> of<00:02:55.700> all<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.910> of<00:02:56.209> all

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
there that is the end of all the of all

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.539 
there that is the end of all the of all
the<00:02:56.450> guises<00:02:56.810> I<00:02:56.989> hope<00:02:57.890> it's<00:02:58.040> in<00:02:58.130> that<00:02:58.250> right<00:02:58.400> and

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
the guises I hope it's in that right and

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.970 
the guises I hope it's in that right and
just<00:02:59.239> in<00:02:59.420> from<00:02:59.750> then<00:02:59.870> on<00:02:59.959> it's<00:03:00.110> in<00:03:00.319> a<00:03:00.500> basic

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
just in from then on it's in a basic

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.590 
just in from then on it's in a basic
platform<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.549> no<00:03:01.640> more<00:03:01.790> time<00:03:01.970> to<00:03:02.390> know<00:03:02.510> what

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
platform and no more time to know what

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.670 
platform and no more time to know what
time<00:03:02.780> trials<00:03:03.200> or<00:03:03.260> anything<00:03:03.470> like<00:03:03.500> that<00:03:03.590> just

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
time trials or anything like that just

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.580 
time trials or anything like that just
take<00:03:04.070> time<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:04.609> it's<00:03:04.850> quite<00:03:05.350> it's<00:03:06.350> just<00:03:06.560> a

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
take time and it's quite it's just a

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.479 
take time and it's quite it's just a
little<00:03:06.739> bit<00:03:06.829> looking<00:03:07.070> around<00:03:07.160> really

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
little bit looking around really

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:08.830 
little bit looking around really
sometimes<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:08.150> heights<00:03:08.329> they've<00:03:08.600> had<00:03:08.750> it

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
sometimes the heights they've had it

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.449 
sometimes the heights they've had it
hidden<00:03:08.989> some<00:03:09.230> stuff<00:03:09.380> been<00:03:09.530> bushes<00:03:09.829> so<00:03:10.040> just<00:03:10.310> in

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
hidden some stuff been bushes so just in

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:11.920 
hidden some stuff been bushes so just in
this<00:03:11.000> jump<00:03:11.209> here<00:03:11.329> by<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.540> way<00:03:11.630> there's<00:03:11.810> like<00:03:11.900> a

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
this jump here by the way there's like a

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.270 
this jump here by the way there's like a
little<00:03:12.049> bit<00:03:12.230> of<00:03:12.260> an<00:03:12.350> invisible<00:03:12.470> wall<00:03:12.680> so<00:03:13.130> just

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
little bit of an invisible wall so just

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.319 
little bit of an invisible wall so just
take<00:03:13.400> time<00:03:13.579> trim<00:03:13.790> for<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:13.940> fit<00:03:14.120> because<00:03:14.239> I

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
take time trim for the fit because I

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.030 
take time trim for the fit because I
almost<00:03:14.569> fell<00:03:14.750> off<00:03:14.780> right<00:03:15.140> there<00:03:15.380> as<00:03:15.590> you<00:03:15.920> jump

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
almost fell off right there as you jump

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.039 
almost fell off right there as you jump
up<00:03:16.160> from<00:03:16.220> one<00:03:16.489> boat<00:03:16.640> to<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:16.760> other<00:03:16.870> so<00:03:17.870> I'm

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
up from one boat to the other so I'm

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.050 
up from one boat to the other so I'm
just<00:03:18.500> a<00:03:18.620> little<00:03:18.709> one<00:03:19.190> in<00:03:19.310> there<00:03:19.430> make<00:03:19.670> sure<00:03:19.700> you

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
just a little one in there make sure you

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.930 
just a little one in there make sure you
take<00:03:20.299> time<00:03:20.329> and<00:03:21.130> as<00:03:22.130> you<00:03:22.250> can<00:03:22.370> see<00:03:22.400> just<00:03:22.519> scored

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
take time and as you can see just scored

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.130 
take time and as you can see just scored
a<00:03:22.970> new<00:03:23.060> area<00:03:23.209> but<00:03:23.390> this<00:03:23.510> isn't<00:03:23.750> quite<00:03:23.870> in<00:03:23.900> the

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
a new area but this isn't quite in the

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.539 
a new area but this isn't quite in the
drum<00:03:24.290> puzzle<00:03:24.590> this<00:03:25.010> is<00:03:25.160> where<00:03:25.310> we<00:03:25.370> at<00:03:25.459> the

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
drum puzzle this is where we at the

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.580 
drum puzzle this is where we at the
second<00:03:25.880> part<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.260> climbing<00:03:27.260> of<00:03:27.350> the<00:03:27.410> little

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
second part the climbing of the little

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.210 
second part the climbing of the little
shelves<00:03:27.940> see<00:03:28.940> it's<00:03:29.480> quite<00:03:29.630> I<00:03:30.019> don't<00:03:30.829> set<00:03:31.040> off<00:03:31.130> a

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
shelves see it's quite I don't set off a

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.650 
shelves see it's quite I don't set off a
planetary<00:03:31.519> again<00:03:31.670> but<00:03:31.790> it<00:03:31.910> and<00:03:32.120> you're<00:03:32.600> just

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
planetary again but it and you're just

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.870 
planetary again but it and you're just
going<00:03:32.810> to<00:03:32.900> be<00:03:32.989> climbing<00:03:33.319> off<00:03:33.410> the<00:03:33.500> Magica

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
going to be climbing off the Magica

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.400 
going to be climbing off the Magica
Stefan<00:03:34.880> up<00:03:35.000> and<00:03:35.329> up<00:03:35.750> and<00:03:35.930> up<00:03:36.230> and<00:03:36.530> up<00:03:36.739> and<00:03:37.150> oh<00:03:38.410> my

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
Stefan up and up and up and up and oh my

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.720 
Stefan up and up and up and up and oh my
gosh<00:03:39.560> this<00:03:39.709> is<00:03:39.799> actually<00:03:40.100> a<00:03:40.130> lot<00:03:40.220> harder<00:03:40.280> when

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
gosh this is actually a lot harder when

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.129 
gosh this is actually a lot harder when
there's<00:03:40.940> only<00:03:41.030> one<00:03:41.180> person<00:03:41.540> I've<00:03:41.750> never<00:03:41.930> tried

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
there's only one person I've never tried

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:43.479 
there's only one person I've never tried
to<00:03:42.350> do<00:03:42.440> a<00:03:42.470> commentary<00:03:42.769> about<00:03:42.950> some<00:03:43.190> new<00:03:43.220> phone

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
to do a commentary about some new phone

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.490 
to do a commentary about some new phone
and<00:03:44.500> so<00:03:45.500> now<00:03:45.940> it<00:03:46.940> looks<00:03:47.090> like<00:03:47.269> there's<00:03:47.780> it<00:03:48.109> can

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
and so now it looks like there's it can

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.479 
and so now it looks like there's it can
get<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:48.650> bit<00:03:48.680> tricky<00:03:49.040> because<00:03:49.190> you've<00:03:49.400> got

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
get a bit tricky because you've got

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:50.830 
get a bit tricky because you've got
quite<00:03:49.639> a<00:03:49.700> lot<00:03:49.819> of<00:03:49.850> place<00:03:50.030> you<00:03:50.180> can<00:03:50.299> go<00:03:50.420> but<00:03:50.630> just

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
quite a lot of place you can go but just

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.390 
quite a lot of place you can go but just
as<00:03:50.989> long<00:03:51.170> as<00:03:51.290> um<00:03:51.530> just<00:03:52.040> look<00:03:52.190> out<00:03:52.250> for<00:03:52.340> those

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
as long as um just look out for those

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.440 
as long as um just look out for those
little<00:03:52.609> edges<00:03:52.730> because<00:03:52.940> it's<00:03:53.120> sticking<00:03:53.299> out

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
little edges because it's sticking out

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.289 
little edges because it's sticking out
all<00:03:53.480> over<00:03:53.600> the<00:03:53.810> place<00:03:54.049> and<00:03:54.790> they<00:03:55.790> do<00:03:55.850> lead<00:03:56.180> the

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
all over the place and they do lead the

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:57.819 
all over the place and they do lead the
way<00:03:56.389> I<00:03:56.420> mean<00:03:56.630> whenever<00:03:56.959> gets<00:03:57.230> Tokyo<00:03:57.590> so<00:03:57.739> yeah

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
way I mean whenever gets Tokyo so yeah

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:58.900 
way I mean whenever gets Tokyo so yeah
just<00:03:57.980> have<00:03:58.069> a<00:03:58.100> look<00:03:58.190> around<00:03:58.310> see<00:03:58.609> if<00:03:58.639> I<00:03:58.790> can

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
just have a look around see if I can

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.520 
just have a look around see if I can
spot<00:03:58.940> any<00:03:59.239> of<00:03:59.299> those<00:03:59.359> ledges<00:03:59.750> and<00:04:00.260> I<00:04:00.350> get<00:04:00.470> to

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
spot any of those ledges and I get to

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.660 
spot any of those ledges and I get to
the<00:04:00.590> top<00:04:00.739> here<00:04:00.950> I<00:04:00.980> can't<00:04:01.280> really<00:04:01.459> see<00:04:01.609> where

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
the top here I can't really see where

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.830 
the top here I can't really see where
I'm<00:04:01.760> going<00:04:01.880> to<00:04:01.910> be<00:04:02.000> going<00:04:02.239> but<00:04:02.480> just<00:04:02.690> from<00:04:02.750> the
