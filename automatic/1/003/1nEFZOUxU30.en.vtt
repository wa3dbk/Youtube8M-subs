00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
hours of the game are very very boring

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.410 
hours of the game are very very boring
because<00:00:37.530> you're<00:00:37.739> basically<00:00:38.129> searching<00:00:38.489> for

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
because you're basically searching for

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.600 
because you're basically searching for
in<00:00:39.690> training<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.590> become<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.010> overlord

in training to become the overlord

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.119 
in training to become the overlord
rather<00:00:42.270> than<00:00:42.510> actually<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.379> know<00:00:43.500> playing<00:00:43.890> as

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
rather than actually you know playing as

him<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.539> first<00:00:45.719> mission<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.590> really

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
him it's the first mission is really

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.310 
him it's the first mission is really
just<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.280> tutorial<00:00:47.640> level<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.780> second

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
just a tutorial level and the second

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.680 
just a tutorial level and the second
mission<00:00:49.530> can<00:00:50.520> be<00:00:50.550> kind<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.940> tedious<00:00:51.180> and

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
mission can be kind of tedious and

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.139 
mission can be kind of tedious and
boring<00:00:52.050> but<00:00:52.920> after<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.520> game<00:00:53.910> gets

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
boring but after that the game gets

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.029 
boring but after that the game gets
really<00:00:54.690> fun<00:00:54.989> when<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:55.800> multiple

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
really fun when you have multiple

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.060 
really fun when you have multiple
classes<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:57.059> you're<00:00:57.149> organizing<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.289> you're

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
classes and you're organizing and you're

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.580 
classes and you're organizing and you're
throwing<00:00:59.640> different<00:01:00.030> types<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.989> classes<00:01:01.469> at

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
throwing different types of classes at

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.959 
throwing different types of classes at
different<00:01:01.890> types<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.160> enemies<00:01:02.309> as<00:01:02.670> well<00:01:02.850> as

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
different types of enemies as well as

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.960 
different types of enemies as well as
slashing<00:01:03.870> people<00:01:04.140> yourself<00:01:04.559> but<00:01:05.489> that

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
slashing people yourself but that

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.640 
slashing people yourself but that
doesn't<00:01:06.450> come<00:01:06.780> until<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.140> third<00:01:07.320> or<00:01:07.350> fourth

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
doesn't come until the third or fourth

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.130 
doesn't come until the third or fourth
mission<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.369> kind<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.640> starts<00:01:08.970> off<00:01:09.119> slow<00:01:09.390> so

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
mission so it kind of starts off slow so

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.480 
mission so it kind of starts off slow so
if<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.350> don't<00:01:10.470> like<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.860> game<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.220> first

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
if you don't like this game it first

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.679 
if you don't like this game it first
give<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> little<00:01:12.060> more<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.420> chance

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
give it a little more of a chance

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.260 
give it a little more of a chance
because<00:01:13.020> when<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.040> start<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.400> off<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:14.850> very

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
because when you start it off it's very

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.840 
because when you start it off it's very
very<00:01:15.570> slow<00:01:16.009> however<00:01:17.009> there<00:01:17.220> are<00:01:17.340> two<00:01:17.580> main

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
very slow however there are two main

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.300 
very slow however there are two main
flaws<00:01:18.330> with<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:18.869> game<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.590> first<00:01:19.860> one<00:01:20.070> being

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
flaws with this game the first one being

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.940 
flaws with this game the first one being
the<00:01:20.430> camera<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.479> camera<00:01:21.750> can<00:01:22.080> be<00:01:22.110> very<00:01:22.590> very

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the camera the camera can be very very

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.490 
the camera the camera can be very very
very<00:01:23.310> annoying<00:01:23.820> when<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:25.080> randomly

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
very annoying when it just randomly

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.050 
very annoying when it just randomly
zooms<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.220> out<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.700> for<00:01:26.939> no

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
zooms in and out on you for no

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.690 
zooms in and out on you for no
particular<00:01:27.330> reason<00:01:27.630> sometimes<00:01:28.259> also<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
particular reason sometimes also the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.149 
particular reason sometimes also the
cameras<00:01:30.180> controls<00:01:30.930> are<00:01:31.259> very<00:01:31.320> awkward

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
cameras controls are very awkward

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.730 
cameras controls are very awkward
because<00:01:32.450> one<00:01:33.450> way<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.689> direct<00:01:34.140> your<00:01:34.290> minions

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
because one way to direct your minions

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.740 
because one way to direct your minions
into<00:01:35.040> certain<00:01:35.369> places<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.119> use<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.540> right

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
into certain places is to use the right

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.380 
into certain places is to use the right
stick<00:01:37.110> but<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.590> right<00:01:37.770> stick<00:01:38.100> also<00:01:38.700> controls

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
stick but the right stick also controls

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.429 
stick but the right stick also controls
the<00:01:39.720> camera<00:01:40.350> now<00:01:40.950> codemasters<00:01:41.640> did<00:01:42.000> develop

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
the camera now codemasters did develop

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.289 
the camera now codemasters did develop
somewhat<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.619> workaround<00:01:44.009> or<00:01:44.640> if<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.000> press

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
somewhat of a workaround or if you press

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.960 
somewhat of a workaround or if you press
down<00:01:45.329> on<00:01:45.720> our<00:01:46.200> three<00:01:46.590> or<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.770> right<00:01:47.070> stick<00:01:47.460> you

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
down on our three or the right stick you

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.780 
down on our three or the right stick you
can<00:01:48.210> somewhat<00:01:48.840> change<00:01:49.320> camera<00:01:49.799> views<00:01:50.159> but<00:01:50.670> it

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
can somewhat change camera views but it

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.539 
can somewhat change camera views but it
doesn't<00:01:51.119> work<00:01:51.149> too<00:01:51.540> well<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:53.009> doesn't

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
doesn't work too well and it doesn't

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.639 
doesn't work too well and it doesn't
make<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.820> camera<00:01:54.180> any<00:01:54.390> really<00:01:54.869> less<00:01:55.079> awkward

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
make the camera any really less awkward

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.069 
make the camera any really less awkward
it<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:55.950> puts<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.280> another<00:01:56.430> awkward<00:01:57.180> position

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
it just puts in another awkward position

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.730 
it just puts in another awkward position
the<00:01:58.770> other<00:01:58.979> major<00:01:59.369> flaw<00:01:59.909> in<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.479> game<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
the other major flaw in the game is the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.910 
the other major flaw in the game is the
minion<00:02:02.640> AI<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.719> don't<00:02:04.290> know<00:02:04.380> what<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:04.799> about

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
minion AI I don't know what it is about

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.830 
minion AI I don't know what it is about
the<00:02:05.369> minions<00:02:05.790> but<00:02:06.000> they<00:02:06.149> just<00:02:06.329> can't<00:02:06.600> get

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
the minions but they just can't get

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.150 
the minions but they just can't get
through<00:02:07.079> their<00:02:07.229> head<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.530> maybe<00:02:07.950> you're

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
through their head that maybe you're

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.190 
through their head that maybe you're
running<00:02:08.580> directly<00:02:08.789> into<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.539> water<00:02:09.899> and

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
running directly into the water and

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.500 
running directly into the water and
drowning<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.950> good<00:02:11.250> idea

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
drowning is a good idea

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.899 
drowning is a good idea
and<00:02:12.629> it<00:02:13.170> can<00:02:13.500> be<00:02:13.650> very<00:02:13.680> annoying<00:02:14.159> where<00:02:14.610> and

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
and it can be very annoying where and

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.179 
and it can be very annoying where and
when<00:02:15.390> there's<00:02:15.540> an<00:02:15.659> Emmy<00:02:15.959> near<00:02:16.379> like<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.890> pit<00:02:17.159> of

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
when there's an Emmy near like a pit of

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.970 
when there's an Emmy near like a pit of
lava<00:02:17.489> or<00:02:17.970> water<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.079> you<00:02:19.470> direct<00:02:19.829> your

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
lava or water and you direct your

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.100 
lava or water and you direct your
minions<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.430> their<00:02:20.730> towards<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.510> area<00:02:21.720> and

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
minions to their towards that area and

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.160 
minions to their towards that area and
they<00:02:22.409> accidentally<00:02:23.069> kill<00:02:23.459> themselves<00:02:24.170> the

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
they accidentally kill themselves the

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.319 
they accidentally kill themselves the
game<00:02:25.379> is<00:02:25.530> around<00:02:25.769> six<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.400> seven<00:02:26.730> hours<00:02:26.849> long

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
game is around six to seven hours long

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.319 
game is around six to seven hours long
and<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:28.590> achievements<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.549> trophies<00:02:29.640> are

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
and the achievements and trophies are

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.869 
and the achievements and trophies are
actually<00:02:30.780> pretty<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:32.069> know<00:02:32.099> decently<00:02:32.640> hard

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
actually pretty you know decently hard

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.119 
actually pretty you know decently hard
to<00:02:33.000> get<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:33.480> are<00:02:34.140> actually<00:02:34.560> worth<00:02:34.769> going<00:02:35.099> back

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
to get and are actually worth going back

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.860 
to get and are actually worth going back
for<00:02:35.579> because<00:02:35.879> some<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.120> them<00:02:36.269> are<00:02:36.390> pretty<00:02:36.569> fun

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
for because some of them are pretty fun

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.849 
for because some of them are pretty fun
like<00:02:37.110> killing<00:02:37.470> 100<00:02:37.920> seals<00:02:38.329> but<00:02:39.470> there<00:02:40.470> is<00:02:40.650> not

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
like killing 100 seals but there is not

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.759 
like killing 100 seals but there is not
much<00:02:41.120> replayability<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:42.720> game<00:02:42.989> I<00:02:43.290> mean

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
much replayability to this game I mean

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.979 
much replayability to this game I mean
it<00:02:44.040> just<00:02:44.310> doesn't<00:02:44.700> feel<00:02:45.209> like<00:02:45.420> I'd<00:02:45.599> ever<00:02:45.629> go

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
it just doesn't feel like I'd ever go

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.860 
it just doesn't feel like I'd ever go
back<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.620> play<00:02:47.099> the<00:02:47.340> storyline<00:02:47.909> again<00:02:48.299> it

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
back and play the storyline again it

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.379 
back and play the storyline again it
just<00:02:49.049> doesn't<00:02:49.200> seem<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.560> much<00:02:50.069> fun<00:02:50.879> to<00:02:51.120> do<00:02:51.269> it

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
just doesn't seem that much fun to do it

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.869 
just doesn't seem that much fun to do it
again<00:02:51.659> now<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.650> differences<00:02:53.310> between<00:02:53.489> the

create<00:04:04.560> a<00:04:04.590> new<00:04:04.680> one<00:04:04.949> at<00:04:05.129> level<00:04:05.430> one<00:04:05.669> I<00:04:05.940> also

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
create a new one at level one I also

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.879 
create a new one at level one I also
haven't<00:04:06.930> noticed<00:04:07.349> that<00:04:07.530> much<00:04:07.680> of<00:04:07.829> a

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
haven't noticed that much of a

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:09.439 
haven't noticed that much of a
difference<00:04:07.919> between<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.790> weapons<00:04:09.239> they

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:09.449 
difference between the weapons they

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.050 
difference between the weapons they
would<00:04:09.930> actually<00:04:10.109> worn<00:04:10.769> to<00:04:11.040> using<00:04:11.790> Dark

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.800 
would actually worn to using Dark
Crystal<00:04:12.479> I<00:04:12.959> mean<00:04:13.620> for<00:04:13.859> the<00:04:14.400> armor<00:04:14.849> you<00:04:15.180> do<00:04:15.359> have

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
Crystal I mean for the armor you do have

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.529 
Crystal I mean for the armor you do have
a<00:04:15.870> lot<00:04:16.260> more<00:04:16.560> health<00:04:16.889> but<00:04:17.549> for<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:17.909> weapons<00:04:18.299> I

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
a lot more health but for the weapons I

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:21.140 
a lot more health but for the weapons I
just<00:04:18.900> don't<00:04:19.109> see<00:04:19.320> it<00:04:19.500> seems<00:04:19.949> Overlord<00:04:20.579> to<00:04:20.909> has

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
just don't see it seems Overlord to has

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.570 
just don't see it seems Overlord to has
a<00:04:21.180> lot<00:04:21.719> of<00:04:21.930> good<00:04:21.959> ideas<00:04:22.650> but<00:04:22.680> a<00:04:22.979> lot<00:04:23.310> of<00:04:23.340> them

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
a lot of good ideas but a lot of them

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.060 
a lot of good ideas but a lot of them
aren't<00:04:23.840> implemented<00:04:24.840> correctly

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
aren't implemented correctly

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.860 
aren't implemented correctly
I'm<00:04:26.340> think<00:04:26.730> that<00:04:27.030> they<00:04:27.510> should<00:04:27.540> have<00:04:27.840> focused

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
I'm think that they should have focused

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.350 
I'm think that they should have focused
more<00:04:28.350> on<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.830> leveling<00:04:29.280> of<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.550> minions<00:04:30.060> and

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
more on the leveling of the minions and

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.920 
more on the leveling of the minions and
improved<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.530> minion<00:04:31.860> AI<00:04:32.130> as<00:04:32.580> well<00:04:33.270> as<00:04:33.510> make

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
improved the minion AI as well as make

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.950 
improved the minion AI as well as make
buying<00:04:34.290> weapons<00:04:34.680> you<00:04:35.130> know<00:04:35.310> actually<00:04:36.180> worth

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
buying weapons you know actually worth

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.160 
buying weapons you know actually worth
it<00:04:37.700> another<00:04:38.700> problem<00:04:39.030> I<00:04:39.390> really<00:04:39.420> have<00:04:39.900> with

this game is that the enemies never

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.990 
this game is that the enemies never
really<00:04:42.360> seemed<00:04:42.630> to<00:04:42.780> get<00:04:42.900> tougher<00:04:43.470> I<00:04:43.650> mean<00:04:44.430> you
