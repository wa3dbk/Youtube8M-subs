00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.780
 hi girls how are you this is a video 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.490
 with ideas of outfits to dress them a 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.220
 little more serious to go to work 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.740
 but some will say good I do not work or 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.870
 uniform use when I go to work 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.759
 these are some ideas of how we can 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.890
 tell us more series does not have to be 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:21.980
 precisely for work in some 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.859
 opportunities we have to dress up a 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.899
 little more mature to the word is more 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.810
 appropriate for the place where we are going to 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:32.449
 go as for example the court to a 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.480
 job interview or church not 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:37.609
 I pretend to say that this is a pattern 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.440
 that they have to dress us but they are 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:42.050
 just some ideas that to me I 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.210
 happened and I wanted to share this I was 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.769
 came to mind to make this video 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.589
 because someone told me I was going to have 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:50.690
 an appointment with his lawyer and he wanted to go 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:53.059
 a little more serious thing not precisely 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.219
 to go to work but a little more 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.370
 of formality a little more mature and 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.589
 so these are some tips and 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.440
 some outfit ideas and I hope that 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:06.290
 like the first thing I recommend 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.799
 and achieving a pretty formal look is a 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.530
 skirt at the waist or above the 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.509
 pretty fitted waist these skirts 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.000
 they call it pencil styles because they're left 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.950
 carved and they look good to all 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.100
 people give a clock shape 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:26.090
 incredible even if we do not believe it and 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.520
 I'm adding this blazer 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.799
 in stripes that actually gives that touch 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.440
 funny to my point of view that touch 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.750
 modern and a bit of color for the part 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.450
 inside and I'm wearing this necklace in 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.149
 peach color that combines well with 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.569
 a blouse and I'm wearing this this 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.610
 little bag that is like this pretty square 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:48.050
 serious and from the bottom I'm 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.710
 using 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:54.380
 shoes completely very very close to 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.650
 tone of my skin and then this is a 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.780
 look pretty serious pretty formal to me 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.850
 point of view but without ceasing to be 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.850
 modern and having fun at the same time 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.850
 Y 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.509
 yes 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.110
 for me this look that is the basics of what 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.750
 basic black and white super simple is 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.270
 super simple is a white shirt a 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.760
 black skirt what makes this look a 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.640
 little different a little more fun are 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.860
 the accessories here I am using this 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.250
 necklace a little showy pretty 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.620
 striking and is I put this site here of 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.840
 a waist in a foreign tone so that 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.570
 stop the simple of white and black and 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.940
 this skirt has this detail here that is 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.420
 this produced here that makes it more 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.810
 female and I'm using this bag that 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.209
 it's a black bag that's that simple and also 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.600
 I'm using the bottom one 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.150
 leopard shoes that are not very tall 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.880
 They give that touch also different to the 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.730
 look and this is this quite outfit and 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.010
 very little flashy but I think that 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.480
 we all have a black and white in the 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.480
 closet and I hope you like it 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.959
 again this is a pretty look 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:28.260
 pretty series so to speak and 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.800
 I'm wearing a skirt in gray tone 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.050
 same notched this is taquito that the 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.590
 most times when we're like this in 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:40.410
 places like work or offices 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.390
 they have atmosphere then a setter quoted 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.760
 light does not go bad even if it's hot 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.390
 from the outside, something else 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.450
 the trick here are on the blouse the blouse 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.239
 it's a bright dish if it's that gives you that 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.360
 touch flashy but discreet at the same time and 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.070
 we are doing a color contrast 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.340
 quite pretty discreet and I'm 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:05.370
 wearing shoes on the bottom 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.860
 lathe that is opposite to that of the blouse 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.530
 to give that funny touch to not 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.739
 lose the fun and I'm using this 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.260
 square leopard bag very serious 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:19.260
 for my point of view 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.250
 is the complete look with this necklace 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.930
 long black see the long necklaces 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.630
 they thin the torso quite 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.330
 favor to look for one more figure 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.230
 thin and this is the complete look and 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.230
 hope you like 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:45.789
 this has been all girls and see you 

00:04:44.109 --> 00:04:47.909
