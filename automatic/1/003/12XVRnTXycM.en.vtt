it<00:01:20.720> wasn't<00:01:21.009> expecting<00:01:22.009> a<00:01:22.100> little<00:01:22.610> bit<00:01:22.759> you

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
it wasn't expecting a little bit you

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.730 
it wasn't expecting a little bit you
were<00:01:23.060> expecting<00:01:23.479> a<00:01:23.569> lot<00:01:23.720> dinner<00:01:23.990> no<00:01:24.289> it's<00:01:24.560> bad

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
were expecting a lot dinner no it's bad

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.469 
were expecting a lot dinner no it's bad
really<00:01:25.190> do<00:01:25.399> a<00:01:25.429> lot<00:01:25.520> more<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.970> hardcore<00:01:26.300> stuff

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
really do a lot more the hardcore stuff

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:27.730 
really do a lot more the hardcore stuff
but<00:01:26.600> when<00:01:26.720> you<00:01:26.810> have<00:01:26.960> like<00:01:27.110> a<00:01:27.319> three<00:01:27.530> hour<00:01:27.619> show

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
but when you have like a three hour show

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.149 
but when you have like a three hour show
of<00:01:28.039> cage<00:01:28.310> matches<00:01:28.580> and<00:01:28.940> table<00:01:29.240> matches<00:01:29.659> I

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
of cage matches and table matches I

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.919 
of cage matches and table matches I
guess<00:01:31.159> it's<00:01:31.520> difficult<00:01:31.940> to<00:01:32.119> do<00:01:32.240> that<00:01:32.420> we<00:01:32.810> know

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
guess it's difficult to do that we know

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:34.660 
guess it's difficult to do that we know
that<00:01:32.960> both<00:01:33.200> guys<00:01:33.409> are<00:01:33.440> limited<00:01:34.069> they<00:01:34.520> may<00:01:34.640> not

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
that both guys are limited they may not

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.760 
that both guys are limited they may not
have<00:01:34.850> been<00:01:34.880> able<00:01:35.030> to<00:01:35.179> work<00:01:35.420> a<00:01:35.569> typical<00:01:36.560> match
