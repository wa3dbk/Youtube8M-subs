00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.410
 author then I'll ask you to see 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.160
 and this book was launched by the new 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.960
 advice this book I love and suffered 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.329
 with this book because so the story 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.180
 very beautiful but it's very very very 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.730
 tragic and a story that never 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.550
 I would like to live and every time I read 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.010
 or comment on crying 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.820
 this book tells the story of the hole and 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.250
 dr 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.199
 they are married for some time they are 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.629
 completely in love the pilot did not 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.359
 I think they had been discussing such but 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.040
 they are so the twins were born to the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.950
 hotel is a very beautiful love 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.200
 Only then does he hate, he gets sick. 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.930
 dying is not our spoiler 's 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.610
 free trade and from that moment on 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.310
 the life of the cork 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.049
 for it no longer makes sense nothing 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.320
 meaning it is destroyed 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.140
 only there she receives some letters that 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.420
 the jar and left for it are letters to 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.030
 she can continue in life 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.070
 it then throughout the book orta 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.320
 south he died but he is extremely 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.329
 This then is one of the faces 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.390
 beautiful I've ever read one of the novels 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.479
 sad that I've read too every time 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.829
 I read, I keep thinking about my husband. 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.290
 what I would do so he then ours is and 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.479
 It's a very intense story for me. 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.790
 movie is also very beautiful has several 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.140
 differences the film but also a lot 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.340
 Beautiful, this is one of my novels. 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.920
 Preferred 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.259
 then I chose a passion's diary 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.850
 what a Sunday the two parties too 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.340
 launched by the new concept 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.180
 this book is my favorite included 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.770
 parents 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.770
 as much as I see here some other 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.590
 books in one more 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.900
 rita best so I think the history of this 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.090
 very beautiful book and I think we're going 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.830
 know the story is the story of the new 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.780
 and I will comment because sometimes 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.590
 someone read it will suddenly be some kind of 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.630
 spoiler 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.160
 but people make up a lot and the movie 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.590
 It's also very beautiful inside me. 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.060
 I preferred the book for a little change and 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.160
 I recommend very very very third 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.540
 book that I also chose park things 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.580
 it was the wedding 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.980
 I saw a lot of people who did not like this 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.140
 book that found your purse such 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.150
 My autographed book of the 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.820
 But other people look at this story. 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.770
 because man really because he has 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.840
 connection with the diary of a passion is a 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.620
 kind of continuation will now tell 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.110
 the story of the owner's daughter or him and 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.930
 married until she is older than one 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.030
 mature woman has the mall goes all 50 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.300
 years and her wedding is passing 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.650
 for a complicated moment they are in 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.760
 a sort of crisis in the 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.950
 child relationships are already created 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.440
 downpour and her husband want to do this 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.110
 relationship works and then it starts 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.140
 to ask for advice to his father-in-law 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.850
 Give it to the people and win back the woman. 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.780
 because I really liked the 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.150
 weddings 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.459
 first because I'm married, there's not 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.590
 as long as they sure do 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.050
 I can associate some situations 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.150
 with my life is not in 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.820
 crisis nothing but everyday things that go 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.740
 happening is in the marriage and this book 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.930
 report second because they are 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.120
 Mature characters I really like 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.180
 read books with teenage characters 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.340
 I do not read much, but I love it. 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.530
 reading books with mature characters with 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.570
 characters with life experience and 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.490
 that happened a lot this then 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.110
 I really like them so they are not anymore 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.220
 old is a couple who is already there 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.740
 long time 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.520
 and third because I think too much and just to 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.010
 you 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.810
 regain his wife and regain 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.110
 Your husband, then, this book for me is 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.730
 beautiful and I recommend you can read without 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.170
 have read the diary of a passion but how 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.340
 the diary of a passion is one of my 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.100
 favorite books 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.790
 logically I recommend 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.950
 read on the hour and a fourth book that I 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.770
 I'll tell you guys it 's my liberty. 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.860
 heart this book of mary kay boat but 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:23.350
 It's not a book and it 's a law. 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.900
 is an adult book and is written as if 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.910
 written by my teresopolis and the 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.410
 my you know she's the princess of 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.870
 princess diary 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.930
 so despite its author to become a 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.580
 young adult book character is not 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.670
 A young book is still a novel 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.770
 good story and this book is really cool 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.880

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.770
 for the dowry of her sister that Mandela is going to 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.270
 getting married needs to get married 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.030
 only they are from a simple family 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.370
 they do not have that much money and 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.140
 is a super girl ahead of time and 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.050
 she decides she has a strategy 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.960
 very cool then she finds a guy 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.150
 who has a lot of money is he in your 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.600
 horse along with her right there that she 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.510

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.790
 rescue because I have a day and there it is 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.320
 really does that and from there 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.970
 things are going on and how 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.660
 brand ie may provide but even if 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.520
 happens 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.920
 only the situations the books are very 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.170
 cool are very funny and a super 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.490
 fluffy and Indian, remember that the 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.920
 heart is one of my tournaments 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.170
 Preferred and finally will get to 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.210
 you book learning to seduce the 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:40.000
 Patricia Bond this book was released

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.160
 hertz reader who is a super rich man 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.110
 charming a figurehead of society and I think 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.050
 that all this until the day in a 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.250
 party she meets her fiance with 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.500
 another woman 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:11.110
 scandal she does not do anything i think 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:15.190
 she needs to restore this engagement and that 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.889
 if the marquis betrayed her because she has 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.889
 something wrong then you need 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:24.810
