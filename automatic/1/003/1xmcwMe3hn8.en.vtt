 It was not, but that desktop in this bottom left gone to the exclusion of there I properly 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.980
 There is something 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:03:01.170
 You can use it with the feeling like winter 7 which is normal for winter 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.790
 Because it is full touch type of the whole screen with a double click on the icon and double touch 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:09.600
 Properly be rewarded with 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:11.420
 I open a web browser, but it's wireless, but I think it's very fast. 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:18.620
 And then 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:22.290

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.549
 You can also make it look like this later 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.650
 You can be this kind of increased production in in this side 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.730
 Yes 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:44.040
 I guess looks like it is Well roughly or evaluation committee say 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:49.200
 Then I would like to introduce the next content 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:51.620
 Yes it is the current performance 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.620
 Victory 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.530
 Performance is 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.520
 Like this 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.520
 It has become 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.319
 Yes 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:10.760
 Then we think that we want to begin with introduction of 9 contents first 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.940
 Hey this model is a model called x202 e 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:19.350
 U 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:21.549
 811.6 wonder if inch ride one wheel monitor and Well led backlight 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:26.409
 It is a monitor of 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:31.230
 When the Nde cpu is core says intel core i 53317 I 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:32.320
 Say that the series consumes very little power 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.490
 Yup 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:41.300
 The hard disk is turned into a view 500 bytes 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:46.659
 The internal memory is 4 gb 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.659
 os is windows 764 bit 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:53.169
 When 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:54.350
 Well to introduce Do you about this 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:58.310
 Yes 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:01.889
 Well then defense good now 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:08.270
 I think that I want to introduce a score well 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:11.440
 It is this state without changing the setting at all, but the processor calculates per second 6.9 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:15.150
 Memory is 5.9 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:21.240
 Graphics are the lowest subscore in 4.4 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:23.500
 The graphics for the game are only strong 5 and I 'm working hard with 6.1 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:29.920
 Primary hard disk 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:35.280
 This is what it feels like about 5.9 elegance, so it's high that I've been there 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.280
 No I think, but that it is sufficient as Well laptop 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:42.500
 To the fact that 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:47.690
 It was a door Well simple introduction, but was introduced to be able to introduce it for the time being 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:52.320
 Naa-If you decide to start up, you have a brain here 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:53.880
 With built-in microphone and built-in speaker in long-term state 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.310
 Built-in camera 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:00.370
 I'll sell you, let's go 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:03.060
 Without using anything around to do 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.770
 You can skype 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:09.610
 Because it is attached to the other side of the speaker properly 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:12.729
 I think it's good and I would recommend it for myself 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:15.289
 I'm careful but here 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:20.749
 Because there is an ultra book 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:21.710
 I think I would like to carry an external dvd because there is no place to put dvd 

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:28.130
 I will 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:32.960
 Since it is so thin that I thought one more thing, I am anxious to say something awful 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:37.760
 Well, even if I'm doing light work, I'm putting myself because it gets so warm 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:40.250
 There is such a feeling uh Following aluminum pad like aluminum pad which heats up 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.700
 I like to generate power like this 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.600
 Put it in place 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.500
 I think that it is good for the PC and I think it is good 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:53.169
 so 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:58.650
 The one introduced this time is called as x2023317 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:58.650
