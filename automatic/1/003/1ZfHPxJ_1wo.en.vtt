00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.910 
nothing marked out that would tell me
there<00:02:04.140> was<00:02:04.290> an<00:02:04.439> eight

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
there was an eight

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.910 
there was an eight
because<00:02:05.580> nothing<00:02:06.119> was<00:02:06.270> marked<00:02:06.570> out<00:02:06.720> no<00:02:07.380> pedals

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
because nothing was marked out no pedals

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.370 
because nothing was marked out no pedals
were<00:02:08.130> marked<00:02:08.399> out<00:02:08.520> that's<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:09.119> nice<00:02:09.360> if<00:02:10.020> just

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
were marked out that's a nice if just

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.710 
were marked out that's a nice if just
the<00:02:10.590> top<00:02:10.830> one<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.489> marked<00:02:11.819> out<00:02:11.970> right<00:02:12.480> there

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.870 
the top one is marked out right there
that<00:02:13.470> would<00:02:13.590> tell<00:02:13.770> me<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.099> was<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.220> two<00:02:14.489> if

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
that would tell me that it was a two if

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.660 
that would tell me that it was a two if
the<00:02:15.720> second<00:02:16.110> one<00:02:16.200> was<00:02:16.230> marked<00:02:16.620> out<00:02:16.739> I<00:02:17.010> would

the second one was marked out I would

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.330 
the second one was marked out I would
tell<00:02:17.819> me<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:18.060> it's<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.270> three<00:02:18.599> four<00:02:19.349> five<00:02:19.890> six

seven eight nine all the way around 29

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.250 
seven eight nine all the way around 29
now<00:02:23.550> if<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:23.790> center<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.630> top<00:02:24.840> one<00:02:25.080> or

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
now if this center and the top one or

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.770 
now if this center and the top one or
marked<00:02:25.830> out<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.190> means<00:02:26.340> it's<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:26.580> 10<00:02:26.790> the

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
marked out that means it's a 10 the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.199 
marked out that means it's a 10 the
center<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.680> second<00:02:29.670> one<00:02:29.760> are<00:02:29.880> marked<00:02:30.060> out

center and the second one are marked out

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.339 
center and the second one are marked out
to<00:02:30.660> check<00:02:30.900> center<00:02:31.560> third<00:02:31.980> Queen<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.940> center

to check center third Queen and center

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.110 
to check center third Queen and center
4th<00:02:34.349> it's<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.920> king<00:02:35.130> so<00:02:35.760> it's<00:02:35.940> pretty

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
4th it's a king so it's pretty

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.890 
4th it's a king so it's pretty
self-explanatory<00:02:36.540> but<00:02:37.580> it's<00:02:38.580> it's<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.690> little

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
self-explanatory but it's it's a little

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.479 
self-explanatory but it's it's a little
difficult<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.290> learn<00:02:40.470> but<00:02:40.739> it's<00:02:41.310> like

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
difficult to learn but it's like

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:42.800 
difficult to learn but it's like
anything<00:02:41.700> else<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:42.060> just<00:02:42.150> need<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.450> memorize

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
anything else you just need to memorize

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.050 
anything else you just need to memorize
it<00:02:43.019> and<00:02:43.049> you'll<00:02:43.200> get<00:02:43.350> it<00:02:43.470> so<00:02:44.400> down<00:02:44.670> here<00:02:44.730> with

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
it and you'll get it so down here with

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.240 
it and you'll get it so down here with
the<00:02:45.150> triangles<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:46.170> got<00:02:46.350> for<00:02:46.920> that<00:02:47.160> we're

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
the triangles you got for that we're

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.309 
the triangles you got for that we're
going<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.430> be<00:02:47.489> using<00:02:47.870> first<00:02:48.870> one<00:02:49.110> is<00:02:49.230> two

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
going to be using first one is two

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.559 
going to be using first one is two
spades<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:50.250> if<00:02:50.310> that's<00:02:50.430> marked<00:02:50.819> out<00:02:50.970> you<00:02:51.450> know

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
spades so if that's marked out you know

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.570 
spades so if that's marked out you know
that<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.840> card<00:02:52.049> is<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.200> spade<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:53.100> second<00:02:53.489> one

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
that the card is a spade the second one

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.309 
that the card is a spade the second one
its<00:02:54.239> marked<00:02:54.510> out<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:54.780> know<00:02:54.870> it's<00:02:55.019> a<00:02:55.110> heart

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
its marked out you know it's a heart

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.759 
its marked out you know it's a heart
third<00:02:55.890> one<00:02:56.100> is<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:57.299> club<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.319> fourth<00:02:58.590> one

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
third one is a club and the fourth one

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.190 
third one is a club and the fourth one
is<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:58.950> diamond<00:02:59.360> so<00:03:00.360> if<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:00.569> memorize<00:03:00.720> those

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
is a diamond so if you memorize those

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.729 
is a diamond so if you memorize those
you'll<00:03:01.739> be<00:03:01.890> good<00:03:02.040> those<00:03:02.310> aren't<00:03:02.610> as<00:03:02.700> hard<00:03:02.850> so

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
you'll be good those aren't as hard so

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.809 
you'll be good those aren't as hard so
I'm<00:03:04.739> going<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.010> show<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.400> how<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:05.580> actually

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
I'm going to show you how to actually

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.699 
I'm going to show you how to actually
mark<00:03:06.060> them<00:03:06.209> now<00:03:06.299> now<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.660> actually<00:03:07.110> mark<00:03:07.530> the

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
mark them now now to actually mark the

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.789 
mark them now now to actually mark the
card<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.549> have<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.450> pile<00:03:09.810> of<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.260> cards<00:03:10.590> and

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
card you have the pile of the cards and

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.080 
card you have the pile of the cards and
if<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:11.070> take<00:03:11.250> off<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.519> top<00:03:11.670> card<00:03:11.910> it<00:03:12.060> should

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
if you take off the top card it should

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.690 
if you take off the top card it should
be<00:03:12.329> ace<00:03:12.720> of<00:03:12.959> spades<00:03:13.230> so<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.250> can<00:03:14.370> go<00:03:14.489> ahead<00:03:14.579> and

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
be ace of spades so you can go ahead and

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.180 
be ace of spades so you can go ahead and
flip<00:03:15.000> that<00:03:15.209> over<00:03:15.269> and<00:03:15.660> remember<00:03:16.650> since<00:03:17.010> it's

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
flip that over and remember since it's

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.039 
flip that over and remember since it's
an<00:03:17.310> ace<00:03:17.549> there's<00:03:18.060> not<00:03:18.510> going<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.720> be<00:03:18.810> any

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
an ace there's not going to be any

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.710 
an ace there's not going to be any
petals<00:03:19.680> that<00:03:19.739> are<00:03:19.890> marked<00:03:20.190> out<00:03:20.310> but<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.239> first

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
petals that are marked out but the first

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.720 
petals that are marked out but the first
little<00:03:21.989> triangle<00:03:22.470> is<00:03:22.650> because<00:03:23.190> it's<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.459> spade

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
little triangle is because it's a spade

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.210 
little triangle is because it's a spade
so<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.750> could<00:03:25.079> very<00:03:25.290> carefully<00:03:27.920> go<00:03:28.920> over<00:03:29.070> that

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
so you could very carefully go over that

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.039 
so you could very carefully go over that
with<00:03:30.200> your<00:03:31.200> Sharpie<00:03:31.410> so<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.820> first<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.810> first

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
with your Sharpie so the first the first

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.199 
with your Sharpie so the first the first
triangle<00:03:34.470> is<00:03:34.769> marked<00:03:35.070> out<00:03:35.190> so<00:03:35.820> right<00:03:36.000> away<00:03:36.030> I

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
triangle is marked out so right away I

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.479 
triangle is marked out so right away I
can<00:03:36.480> see<00:03:36.690> that<00:03:37.200> no<00:03:37.620> pebbles<00:03:37.859> are<00:03:38.130> marked<00:03:38.340> out

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
can see that no pebbles are marked out

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.180 
can see that no pebbles are marked out
but<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.239> first<00:03:39.570> triangle<00:03:40.109> is<00:03:40.380> so<00:03:40.859> the

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
but the first triangle is so the

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.949 
but the first triangle is so the
spectator<00:03:41.609> can't<00:03:41.790> see<00:03:41.940> this<00:03:42.060> but<00:03:42.269> I<00:03:42.660> can<00:03:42.840> tell

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
spectator can't see this but I can tell

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.349 
spectator can't see this but I can tell
that<00:03:43.230> it's<00:03:43.260> an<00:03:43.440> ace<00:03:43.530> of<00:03:43.680> spades<00:03:43.970> so<00:03:44.970> I'm<00:03:45.209> going

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
that it's an ace of spades so I'm going

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:50.050 
that it's an ace of spades so I'm going
to<00:03:45.450> do<00:03:46.109> another<00:03:46.320> example<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:47.900> i'll<00:03:48.900> use<00:03:48.930> the

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
to do another example and i'll use the

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.940 
to do another example and i'll use the
king<00:03:51.060> of<00:03:51.329> diamonds<00:03:52.370> so<00:03:53.370> flip<00:03:53.730> it<00:03:53.850> over<00:03:53.970> and

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
king of diamonds so flip it over and

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.880 
king of diamonds so flip it over and
i'll<00:03:55.950> start<00:03:56.670> with<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:57.000> diamond<00:03:57.569> since<00:03:58.560> it's<00:03:58.799> a

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
i'll start with the diamond since it's a

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.800 
i'll start with the diamond since it's a
diamond<00:03:59.280> that<00:03:59.549> is<00:03:59.609> last<00:04:00.510> so<00:04:01.019> the<00:04:01.170> fourth

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
diamond that is last so the fourth

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.170 
diamond that is last so the fourth
triangle<00:04:03.810> will<00:04:04.470> get<00:04:04.590> marked<00:04:04.859> out<00:04:05.010> and<00:04:05.389> then

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
triangle will get marked out and then

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.259 
triangle will get marked out and then
since<00:04:07.750> you<00:04:08.019> came<00:04:08.170> the<00:04:08.379> center<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:13.000> center

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
since you came the center the center

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.029 
since you came the center the center
pedal<00:04:13.810> gets<00:04:13.989> marked<00:04:14.260> out<00:04:14.439> and<00:04:14.650> then<00:04:15.430> the<00:04:17.039> worth

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
pedal gets marked out and then the worth

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.120 
pedal gets marked out and then the worth
on<00:04:18.190> right<00:04:18.370> here<00:04:19.470> so<00:04:20.470> am<00:04:20.530> I<00:04:20.590> looking<00:04:20.829> at<00:04:20.919> that<00:04:21.070> I

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
on right here so am I looking at that I

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.090 
on right here so am I looking at that I
can<00:04:21.430> tell<00:04:21.609> that<00:04:21.669> it<00:04:21.940> is<00:04:22.150> a<00:04:22.289> king<00:04:23.289> of<00:04:23.620> diamonds

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
can tell that it is a king of diamonds

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.939 
can tell that it is a king of diamonds
this<00:04:25.060> is<00:04:25.330> time<00:04:25.660> consuming<00:04:25.870> however<00:04:26.590> it<00:04:26.830> is

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:26.949 
this is time consuming however it is

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:29.879 
this is time consuming however it is
well<00:04:27.190> worth<00:04:27.400> it<00:04:27.639> because<00:04:28.300> it's<00:04:28.750> a<00:04:28.960> really
