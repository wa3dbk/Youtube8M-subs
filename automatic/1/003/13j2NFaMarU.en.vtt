in<00:02:42.870> your<00:02:43.200> home<00:02:43.410> entertainment<00:02:43.560> we<00:02:43.980> see

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
in your home entertainment we see

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.250 
in your home entertainment we see
chromecast<00:02:44.730> room<00:02:44.940> for<00:02:45.209> more<00:02:45.390> likely<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:46.110> see

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
chromecast room for more likely to see

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.080

something based around Apple in your car
we<00:02:48.330> see<00:02:48.480> iOS<00:02:48.900> in<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.290> car<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:49.980> thinking<00:02:50.340> you

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
we see iOS in the car so thinking you

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.059 
we see iOS in the car so thinking you
can<00:02:50.700> leverage<00:02:51.420> an<00:02:51.600> operating<00:02:52.080> system<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.920> get

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
can leverage an operating system to get

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.970 
can leverage an operating system to get
more<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:54.420> know<00:02:54.540> acceptance<00:02:55.049> is<00:02:55.200> just<00:02:55.890> a

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
more you know acceptance is just a

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.380 
more you know acceptance is just a
fallacy<00:02:56.370> because<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.640> has<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.970> start<00:02:57.150> with<00:02:57.239> the

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
fallacy because it has to start with the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.059 
fallacy because it has to start with the
smartphone<00:02:57.870> yeah<00:02:58.290> I<00:02:58.350> think<00:02:58.440> Samsung<00:02:58.950> has

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
smartphone yeah I think Samsung has

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.710 
smartphone yeah I think Samsung has
really<00:02:59.370> broadened<00:02:59.730> bishes<00:03:00.330> really<00:03:00.569> high

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
really broadened bishes really high

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.479 
really broadened bishes really high
hopes<00:03:00.870> but<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.440> ultimately<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.040> reality<00:03:02.370> is

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
hopes but the ultimately the reality is

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.640 
hopes but the ultimately the reality is
it's<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:03.209> it's<00:03:03.690> too<00:03:03.930> much<00:03:04.110> of<00:03:04.140> an<00:03:04.440> uphill

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
it's it it's too much of an uphill

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.410 
it's it it's too much of an uphill
battle<00:03:04.709> against<00:03:05.310> Android<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:05.850> iOS<00:03:05.940> at<00:03:06.299> this
