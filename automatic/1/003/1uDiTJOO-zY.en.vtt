 Hello, many of you asked 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.900
 about this guide and today we 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.810
 detailed analyze the priest of darkness in patch 5.4 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.349
 . 7 or 15th pvp season 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.750
 I hope you enjoy start with talents 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.450
 there have been small changes with them 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.520
 so their essence remains the same if 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.590
 in the arena you play top three or very 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.320
 often run to ranked battlefields 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.329
 then among the talents of level 15, I am very 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.129
 I recommend taking the tentacles of the abyss in 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.590
 basically you will be the target for 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.329
 killings in these battles so the priestesses of darkness 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.030
 it is very important to have as much as possible 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.010
 abilities for survival becomes 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.230
 It is obvious that additional ability 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.020
 for immobilization is best 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.300
 in this case also you can 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.339
 use a mental demon but him 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.990
 the main problem is that he 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.240
 deal diminished with the rest of your 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.490
 abilities apply effects 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.650
 fear personally i am among these two 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.810
 talents prefer tentacle abyss a 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.390
 domination over the mind is not worth it 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.369
 what about taking talents 30 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.619
 level you must take 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.659
 divine feather is just 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.619
 great ability which gives 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.000
 you acceleration 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.030
 so we r 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.690
 yes it is easier to kite from the enemy 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.340
 ability is very fast 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.920
 recovering and besides you can 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.960
 impose and and on allies main 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.420
 the plus is that she won't let your 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.090
 speeds sag below 80 percent 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.600
 the forty-fifth level talent selection will 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.920
 completely depend on the style of your game 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.500
 we will have to choose between talents 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.869
 light and darkness ng and talent comfort and 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.520
 madness i became anton light and dark 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.950
 intermittent damage spell 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.630
 touches of a vampire with a probability of 20 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.420
 percent will allow to use the spell 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.580
 mind piercing instantly and at no cost 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.070
 mana in general you can get 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.860
 up to two prophets who are very similar to 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.810
 the ice fingers of magicians this talent is very 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.880
 good for burst and how can you 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.660
 produce up to two instant prone for 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.730
 her mind 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.650
 but besides murz this talent also 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.180
 increases your and permanent damage 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.340
 because considering the fact that touch 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.680
 mind you can apply immediately to 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.050
 several goals then this proc you will 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.510
 getting pretty often i'm very 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.570
 I recommend this talent for him 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.850
 use many gladiators he became there 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.250
 same consolation madness your torture of reason 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.739
 will drive your opponent like 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.670
 armored train with this talent at 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.800
 application 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.870
 no torture of reason for which purpose 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.430
 the effect of the devouring plague 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.430
 mind torture spell damage 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.069
 increases by 33 percent each 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.560
 absorbed sphere that is this talent 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.680
 more will improve our burst than 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.930
 permanent damage from dogo I would say that 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.280
 this talent is more suitable for the world 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.280
 pvp or arenas 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.560
 20 bar among talents of level 60 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.660
 definitely need to take the ghostly 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.880
 appearance with this talent you are very easy 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.769
 can avoid various controls 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.660
 also excellent enemy kite 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.970
 let's say you run around the pillar 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.400
 use ghostly shape and then 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.380
 run the other way so you 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.870
 just confuse your opponent 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.890
 you can use the same 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.540
 ghostly appearance in combination with 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.360
 divine feather so as possible 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.330
 continue to run away from opponents among 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.860
 talents level 75 is absolutely necessary 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.019
 take divine wisdom 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.549
 periodic damage spell words of darkness 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.019
 boys probability of five percent 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.030
 complete recovery time 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.100
 spells have a blast of reason and will give 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.709
 the ability to pronounce it instantly and 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.049
 no mana cost for 12 seconds 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.690
 then it will be necessary to do the most difficult 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.450
 choose and choose we will between cascade 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.430
 divine star and radiance all these 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.680
 abilities give very good 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.900
 opportunities divine star gives 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.150
 very good self treatment like 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.940
 the possibility of treating their allies 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.910
 talent shine is very good for boost but 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.580
 to use it properly 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.530
 large amount of experience damage from this 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.540
 ability directly depends on 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.700
 distance is your 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.489
 opponent from you if you will 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.600
 be very close to the enemy 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.239
 use this ability she 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.010
 almost no damage but if 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.320
 the enemy is at the maximum 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.200
 the radius of her action she causes very 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.750
 a lot of damage for rating battlegrounds i 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.640
 most often I use talent cascade with 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.610
 using this talent you are great 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.170
 can cause damage to a whole group of people 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.060
 hitting this ability only one at a time 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.460
 enemy damage may 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.830
 spread to the next three so 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.900
 that among all the talents of level 90 for 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.240
 rating battlefield I certainly 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.700
 I prefer the cascade for rem already 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.740
 a divine star is coming or shining 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.140
 but for rating battlefields hundred 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.270
 percent cascade go to characters 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.830
 the first character you need 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.050
 must use this symbol 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.880
 internal fire symbol increases 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.220
 internal spell bonus 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.500
 fire at 50 percent that is in total 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.390
 your armor will increase by 90 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.630
 percent at the moment I have 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.490
 60 thousand armor is three times more than 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.070
 my hunter has this indicator 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.710
 very important for reducing physical 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.320
 damage then worth taking 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.120
 symbol of care in the shadow with him spell 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.330
 shadow care reduces all 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.460
 damage by ten percent for 10 seconds with 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.260
 a recovery time of 30 seconds is 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.660
 the ability is just great for 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.860
 reducing incoming damage next 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.980
 the character you should use 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.270
 it is a symbol of the prayer of restoration 1 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.669
 charge spell prayer recovery 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.280
 restores targets by 60 percent 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.570
 health but this spell becomes 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.640
 one less charge 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.560
 the fact is that it is this ability 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.030
 you will try to regain yourself 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.580
 healthy 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.590
 and if you are in the countryside but with opponents 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.220
 by this symbol it will be done much 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.350
 easier 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.210
 as an option this symbol can be replaced 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.220
 symbol of the inner sanctuary 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.200
 this symbol reduces the amount of damage 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.660
 from spells by 6 percent at 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.790
 use internal fire 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.470
 mass scattering symbol if you 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.070
 waiting for loot and ice block 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.450
 of the main characters on this all 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.430
 relative equipment is very important 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.690
 the moment is that the gloves are worth 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.910
 take out the moon with a cloth 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.070
 these gloves give a bigger bonus to 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.590
 speed indicator and besides you are not 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.870
 losing your set bonus now what 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.760
 regarding performance firstly to us 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.070
 will need 6 percent accuracy 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.710
 obtained by the spirit indicator a 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.720
 then we will need at least 25 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.640
 percent rate rating 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.400
 After all, this indicator gives 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.440
 additional tech our dotam then in 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.810
 priority in descending order go 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.510
 critical strike chance and rating 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.490
 skill now consider gems 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.470
 I will not specify their name about 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.720
 I will tell only what indicators they are 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:55.150
 should give us red gems 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.490
 should add on 180 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:00.490
 intellect among yellow use two 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:03.550
 which give 80 to intelligence and 160 to 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:05.950
 speeds and two more which give 320 k 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.590
 speed performance as strong 

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.400
 use gems that give 80 kg 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.950
 have asked 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.380

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:16.960
 gems choose either gem on pvp

 resilience and asked u either gem 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.250
 by 3 percent critical damage and 3 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:23.610
 percent of intelligence itself that's all 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:26.850
 things you should know about the priestess
