an<00:00:00.060> ergonomic<00:00:01.020> split<00:00:01.350> keyboard<00:00:01.620> is<00:00:02.100> supposed

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
an ergonomic split keyboard is supposed

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.240 
an ergonomic split keyboard is supposed
to<00:00:02.760> prevent<00:00:03.120> your<00:00:03.389> hands<00:00:03.689> from<00:00:03.810> twisting<00:00:04.380> the

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
to prevent your hands from twisting the

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.610 
to prevent your hands from twisting the
problem<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:05.940> that<00:00:06.299> it<00:00:06.450> forces<00:00:06.960> you<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.109> do<00:00:07.410> one

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
problem is that it forces you to do one

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.980 
problem is that it forces you to do one
of<00:00:07.649> two<00:00:07.950> things<00:00:08.220> that<00:00:08.429> can<00:00:08.670> cause<00:00:08.940> injury<00:00:09.420> the

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
of two things that can cause injury the

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.440 
of two things that can cause injury the
first<00:00:10.290> possibility<00:00:10.800> is<00:00:11.340> that<00:00:11.849> your<00:00:12.059> elbows

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
first possibility is that your elbows

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.839 
first possibility is that your elbows
and<00:00:12.660> upper<00:00:12.960> arms<00:00:13.440> will<00:00:13.830> hold<00:00:14.040> themselves<00:00:14.280> out

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
and upper arms will hold themselves out

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.849 
and upper arms will hold themselves out
and<00:00:15.120> away<00:00:15.330> from<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.570> body<00:00:15.809> resulting<00:00:16.410> in

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
and away from the body resulting in

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.609 
and away from the body resulting in
fatigue<00:00:17.300> fatigue<00:00:18.300> can<00:00:18.750> lead<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.050> tension<00:00:19.500> and

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
fatigue fatigue can lead to tension and

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.519 
fatigue fatigue can lead to tension and
pain<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.310> edit<00:00:21.270> problem<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.900> that<00:00:22.170> in<00:00:22.320> order

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
pain and edit problem is that in order

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.590 
pain and edit problem is that in order
to<00:00:22.800> move<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.279> function<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.000> number<00:00:24.300> keys

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
and preserve the untwisted position you

and preserve the untwisted position you
upper<00:00:27.840> arm<00:00:28.109> has<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.800> move<00:00:28.949> away<00:00:29.099> even<00:00:29.910> more<00:00:30.170> the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
upper arm has to move away even more the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
speed the forearm by contrast can move

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.560 
speed the forearm by contrast can move
quickly<00:00:40.680> left<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.340> right<00:00:41.579> from<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.000> elbow

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
quickly left and right from the elbow

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.910 
quickly left and right from the elbow
without<00:00:43.170> tiring<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:45.600> second<00:00:45.989> possibility<00:00:46.440> is

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
without tiring the second possibility is

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.400 
without tiring the second possibility is
that<00:00:47.250> if<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.550> elbows<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.360> upper<00:00:48.690> arms<00:00:49.050> don't

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
that if you elbows and upper arms don't

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.010 
that if you elbows and upper arms don't
hold<00:00:49.739> themselves<00:00:49.980> out<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:51.420> will<00:00:51.570> have<00:00:51.600> to

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
hold themselves out you will have to

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.139 
hold themselves out you will have to
move<00:00:52.199> your<00:00:52.379> hands<00:00:52.800> alone<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.640> right<00:00:53.850> and

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
move your hands alone to the right and

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.779 
move your hands alone to the right and
left<00:00:54.440> causing<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.620> very<00:00:55.920> twist<00:00:56.460> you're

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
left causing the very twist you're

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.389 
left causing the very twist you're
trying<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.239> avoid<00:00:59.270> on<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> standard<00:01:00.899> keyboard

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
trying to avoid on a standard keyboard

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.759 
trying to avoid on a standard keyboard
I'm<00:01:02.399> able<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.090> position<00:01:03.480> myself<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.559> way

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
I'm able to position myself in a way

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.460 
I'm able to position myself in a way
where<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.640> hand<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.090> form<00:01:06.450> are<00:01:06.810> lined<00:01:07.170> up

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
where the hand and the form are lined up

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.270 
where the hand and the form are lined up
and<00:01:07.770> can<00:01:08.369> move<00:01:08.549> as<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:09.030> unit<00:01:09.530> from<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.770> elbow

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
and can move as a unit from the elbow

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.679 
and can move as a unit from the elbow
without<00:01:12.439> holding<00:01:13.439> out<00:01:13.650> or<00:01:14.340> moving<00:01:14.850> from<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
without holding out or moving from the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.960 
without holding out or moving from the
upper<00:01:15.990> arm<00:01:16.200> rather<00:01:16.890> initiating<00:01:17.700> from<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
upper arm rather initiating from the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.630 
upper arm rather initiating from the
upper<00:01:18.270> arm<00:01:18.479> which<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.590> very<00:01:19.890> fatiguing<00:01:20.310> and

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
upper arm which is very fatiguing and

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.300 
upper arm which is very fatiguing and
slows<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.689> down<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:22.340> can<00:01:23.340> move<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:23.939> one<00:01:24.450> piece

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
slows you down I can move in one piece

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.730 
slows you down I can move in one piece
here<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.430> an<00:01:26.549> example<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.990> form<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.409> moving

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
here is an example the form is moving

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.359 
here is an example the form is moving
with<00:01:28.890> me<00:01:29.750> without<00:01:30.750> any<00:01:31.229> twisting<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.070> can<00:01:32.250> move

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
with me without any twisting I can move

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.600 
with me without any twisting I can move
to<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> function<00:01:33.540> keys<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:34.290> one<00:01:34.619> piece<00:01:34.979> with

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
to the function keys in one piece with

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.819 
to the function keys in one piece with
again<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:35.939> forearm<00:01:36.420> initiating<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.350> motion

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
again the forearm initiating the motion

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.330 
again the forearm initiating the motion
in<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.220> upper<00:01:38.490> arm<00:01:38.700> following<00:01:39.390> in<00:01:39.570> minimal

turned here at the wrist but this is not
twisting<00:01:49.280> twisting<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.460> when<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.970> hand<00:01:51.299> moves

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
twisting twisting is when the hand moves

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.110 
twisting twisting is when the hand moves
