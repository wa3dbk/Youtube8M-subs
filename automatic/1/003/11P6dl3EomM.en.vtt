00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
all right hey it's a turtle farm 429

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.249 
all right hey it's a turtle farm 429
here<00:00:10.580> we<00:00:11.580> are<00:00:11.610> in<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.300> process<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.840> building<00:00:13.019> a

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
here we are in the process of building a

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.470 
here we are in the process of building a
new<00:00:13.290> pond<00:00:15.230> actually<00:00:16.230> moving<00:00:16.890> locations<00:00:17.480> so

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
new pond actually moving locations so

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.769 
new pond actually moving locations so
turtles<00:00:19.140> get<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.320> new<00:00:19.470> home<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:20.600> because<00:00:21.600> they

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
turtles get a new home and because they

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.000 
turtles get a new home and because they
get<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.050> new<00:00:22.199> home<00:00:22.320> they<00:00:22.529> get<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.710> little<00:00:22.890> bigger

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
get a new home they get a little bigger

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.670 
get a new home they get a little bigger
pond<00:00:23.840> actually<00:00:24.840> their<00:00:25.019> enclosure<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.529> going

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
pond actually their enclosure is going

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.339 
pond actually their enclosure is going
to<00:00:25.740> be<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.949> same<00:00:26.189> but<00:00:26.750> I'm<00:00:27.750> just<00:00:28.019> making<00:00:28.320> one

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
to be the same but I'm just making one

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.999 
to be the same but I'm just making one
big<00:00:28.710> pond<00:00:28.949> now<00:00:29.330> instead<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.390> having<00:00:31.009> two

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
big pond now instead of having two

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.530 
big pond now instead of having two
separate<00:00:32.430> ponds<00:00:32.669> like<00:00:32.910> you've<00:00:33.090> seen<00:00:33.270> in<00:00:33.329> my

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
separate ponds like you've seen in my

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.979 
separate ponds like you've seen in my
other<00:00:33.660> videos<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.760> this<00:00:35.760> ponds<00:00:36.059> pretty<00:00:36.719> large

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
other videos so this ponds pretty large

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.010 
other videos so this ponds pretty large
took<00:00:37.700> about<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.760> half<00:00:38.820> hour<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.239> fill<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.570> up<00:00:39.719> so

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
took about a half hour to fill it up so

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.690 
took about a half hour to fill it up so
deep<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.070> spot<00:00:41.399> there<00:00:41.700> right<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.270> middle<00:00:42.510> is

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
deep a spot there right in the middle is

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.479 
deep a spot there right in the middle is
probably<00:00:44.899> about<00:00:45.899> two<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.829> half<00:00:46.950> foot<00:00:47.219> deep

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
probably about two and a half foot deep

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.209 
probably about two and a half foot deep
I'd<00:00:47.700> say<00:00:49.129> maybe<00:00:50.129> three<00:00:50.399> foot<00:00:51.199> a<00:00:52.199> couple<00:00:52.949> of

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
I'd say maybe three foot a couple of

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.590 
I'd say maybe three foot a couple of
ledges<00:00:53.550> along<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.910> side<00:00:54.120> there<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.420> might<00:00:54.570> be

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
ledges along the side there you might be

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.430 
ledges along the side there you might be
able<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.890> see<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.280> got<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.460> Ledge<00:00:56.699> here<00:00:57.440> ledge

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
able to see we got a Ledge here ledge

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.930 
able to see we got a Ledge here ledge
here<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.629> then<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.750> kind<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:00.989> sloped

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
here and then it kind of sloped

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.590 
here and then it kind of sloped
gradually<00:01:02.940> slopes<00:01:03.510> upward<00:01:03.989> here<00:01:05.600> probably

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
gradually slopes upward here probably

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.340 
gradually slopes upward here probably
less<00:01:06.810> than<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.020> foot<00:01:07.229> deep<00:01:07.409> towards<00:01:08.010> here<00:01:08.220> so

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
less than a foot deep towards here so

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.870 
less than a foot deep towards here so
have<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.470> water<00:01:10.680> flow<00:01:11.040> coming<00:01:11.310> out<00:01:11.490> up<00:01:11.670> here

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
have the water flow coming out up here

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.450 
have the water flow coming out up here
towards<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.270> end<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.740> pump<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.100> filter

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
towards the end I pump and filter

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.710 
towards the end I pump and filter
anything<00:01:14.790> will<00:01:14.880> be<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> deep<00:01:15.299> end<00:01:15.450> there

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
anything will be in the deep end there

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.640 
anything will be in the deep end there
so<00:01:17.180> anyway<00:01:18.180> I've<00:01:18.299> been<00:01:18.390> working<00:01:18.689> on<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:19.049> got

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
so anyway I've been working on this got

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.840 
so anyway I've been working on this got
the<00:01:19.770> liner<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.780> it's<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.900> nine<00:01:22.170> foot<00:01:22.830> wide<00:01:23.820> by

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
the liner in it's a nine foot wide by

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.530 
the liner in it's a nine foot wide by
seventeen<00:01:24.659> foot<00:01:24.960> liner<00:01:25.340> so<00:01:26.340> took<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.330> long<00:01:27.509> time

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
seventeen foot liner so took a long time

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.359 
seventeen foot liner so took a long time
to<00:01:27.780> dig<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.080> hole<00:01:28.320> out<00:01:28.530> but<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.770> got<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.009> hole<00:01:29.159> dug

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
to dig a hole out but I got the hole dug

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.859 
to dig a hole out but I got the hole dug
out<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:30.290> I<00:01:31.939> lined<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.119> hole<00:01:33.270> actually<00:01:33.750> with

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
out and I lined the hole actually with

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.530 
out and I lined the hole actually with
some<00:01:34.020> old<00:01:34.170> carpet<00:01:34.650> from<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.159> house<00:01:35.310> we<00:01:36.299> tore

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
some old carpet from the house we tore

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.590 
some old carpet from the house we tore
out<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.350> got<00:01:38.280> carpet<00:01:39.030> there<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.450> see

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
out so I got carpet there you can see

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.340 
out so I got carpet there you can see
some<00:01:39.750> pieces<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.380> there<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:42.049> nine<00:01:43.049> foot

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
some pieces of it there and nine foot

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.880 
some pieces of it there and nine foot
wide<00:01:43.560> was<00:01:43.799> just<00:01:44.189> enough<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.560> just<00:01:46.560> one<00:01:46.710> thing

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
wide was just enough so just one thing

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.899 
wide was just enough so just one thing
when<00:01:47.009> you're<00:01:47.130> building<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.369> pond<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.549> got<00:01:47.820> to

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
when you're building a pond you got to

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.789 
when you're building a pond you got to
make<00:01:48.000> sure<00:01:48.149> your<00:01:48.299> liner<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.689> wide<00:01:49.140> enough<00:01:49.380> you

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
make sure your liner is wide enough you

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.460 
make sure your liner is wide enough you
got<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> count<00:01:50.399> for<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.790> depth<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.540> don't<00:01:52.320> buy

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
got a count for the depth so don't buy

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.690 
got a count for the depth so don't buy
liners<00:01:52.890> too<00:01:53.100> small<00:01:53.570> doesn't<00:01:54.570> work<00:01:55.670> have<00:01:56.670> to

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
liners too small doesn't work have to

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.209 
liners too small doesn't work have to
either<00:01:57.000> fill<00:01:57.210> your<00:01:57.329> pond<00:01:57.509> back<00:01:57.750> in<00:01:58.049> or<00:01:58.259> go<00:01:59.040> get

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
either fill your pond back in or go get

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.270 
either fill your pond back in or go get
another<00:01:59.399> liner<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.530> but<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.740> one<00:02:01.920> just<00:02:02.100> made

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
another liner so but this one just made

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.310 
another liner so but this one just made
it<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:02.729> we'll<00:02:03.270> have<00:02:03.299> rocks<00:02:03.689> there<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.140> cover

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
it so we'll have rocks there to cover

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.080 
it so we'll have rocks there to cover
all<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:07.220> so<00:02:08.220> anyway<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.550> takes<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:08.940> while

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
all that so so anyway it takes a while

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.050 
all that so so anyway it takes a while
but<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.319> end<00:02:10.470> will<00:02:10.739> all<00:02:10.830> be<00:02:11.009> worth<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.340> and

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
but in the end will all be worth it and

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.860 
but in the end will all be worth it and
we'll<00:02:12.870> get<00:02:13.040> as<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.129> can<00:02:14.280> see<00:02:14.430> we've<00:02:14.640> got<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:15.000> lot

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
we'll get as you can see we've got a lot

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.000 
we'll get as you can see we've got a lot
of<00:02:15.900> rocks<00:02:16.260> over<00:02:16.620> here<00:02:18.379> these<00:02:19.379> all<00:02:19.590> come<00:02:19.860> from

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
of rocks over here these all come from
