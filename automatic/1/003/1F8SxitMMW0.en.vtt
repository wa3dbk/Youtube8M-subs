00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.479 

so<00:04:17.180> I<00:04:17.239> really<00:04:17.540> should<00:04:17.750> not<00:04:17.989> ever<00:04:18.290> pick<00:04:19.250> up<00:04:19.370> the

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
so I really should not ever pick up the

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.130 
so I really should not ever pick up the
sniper<00:04:19.820> but<00:04:20.000> I<00:04:20.030> did<00:04:20.359> just<00:04:20.630> because<00:04:20.720> you<00:04:21.019> know<00:04:21.109> I

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
sniper but I did just because you know I

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.020 
sniper but I did just because you know I
you<00:04:21.350> never<00:04:21.769> know<00:04:22.010> I<00:04:22.040> might<00:04:22.190> get<00:04:22.520> lucky

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
you never know I might get lucky

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.930 
you never know I might get lucky

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
so I think I saw with that wall right

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.360 
so I think I saw with that wall right
there<00:04:26.210> I<00:04:26.570> always<00:04:27.230> whenever<00:04:27.560> I<00:04:27.680> do<00:04:27.830> try<00:04:28.010> to<00:04:28.220> be

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370

are<00:04:28.520> someone<00:04:28.820> I<00:04:28.850> try<00:04:29.120> to<00:04:29.180> incorporate<00:04:29.890> objects

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
are someone I try to incorporate objects

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.920 
are someone I try to incorporate objects
with<00:04:31.160> my<00:04:31.340> straight<00:04:31.610> like<00:04:32.270> I<00:04:32.390> went<00:04:32.600> through<00:04:32.780> the

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
with my straight like I went through the

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.300 
with my straight like I went through the
wall<00:04:33.140> and<00:04:33.170> I<00:04:33.470> was<00:04:33.590> trying<00:04:33.740> to<00:04:33.800> like<00:04:33.950> make<00:04:34.130> me

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
shoot the wall I think because I was

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.620
