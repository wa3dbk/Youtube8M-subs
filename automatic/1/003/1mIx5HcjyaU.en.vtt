00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:20.000
 hello guys here etchart 18 and good you 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.189
 I bring in a new video tutorial this 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.210
 How to make a smoke machine 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:28.430
 a chimney is something that brings out one is very 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.519
 easy but the truth and christina's 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:35.150
 to have the same I think but well you see something 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.710
 through the bars of both and we're going to 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.660
 start what I'm going to do now has the 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.870
 air so it looks good to see first 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.130
 everything we have to give them options adjustments 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.340
 of video and particles all 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:51.100
 once we have it, we are going to start 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.410
 see let's do like this like this we're going to 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.490
 do for a tip in the air god I am 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.490
 so I do not know 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.130
 ok we do this once we have it 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.960
 below we make a hole so that 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.119
 because we are going to throw lava 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.630
 for when it falls now you will have 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:17.630
 to put a repeater here and the other 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.390
 here and water that is going to do this is going to 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.610
 hold the water and as you can see it can go 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.130
 pouring a little water but for 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.659
 do it well although it 's the only way 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.390
 what is done 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.850
 we do this and now I'm going to make a 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.789
 redstone technique that I use a lot 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.920
 it's called the mobile clock I call him 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.920
 the clock that is like that 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.200
 and upload a reston video tutorial that 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.120
 it will explain it better and once I have 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.320
 we put a torch of that they have 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.360
 meaning and quickly we have to 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.130
 change a lesson to dry 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.350
 this way and this would be something of 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.170
 store and it turned off very fast once 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.100
 more and we connect it once connected 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.100
 will start to take out the smoke 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.060
 and well guys, this is all now 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.899
 I teach you 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:14.050
 how would that be if the particles 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.050
 reduced as it comes 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.080
 ah 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:32.459
 you do not see minimal either, you do not see something like that 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.780
 and then I'm not going to teach you now a 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:39.799
 little as you have done the soil that 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.799
 it's the same as the fence why 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.640
 and as you can see, it's the same 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.520
 only that below I see that it is quite 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.400
 easy but and well good guys again 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.130
 roll up a lot like favorites 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.780

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.780
