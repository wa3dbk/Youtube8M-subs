 today for our new lesson from 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:23.110
 square brackets we will approach the 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.720
 realization of the pico that allows to do 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.699
 a very nice finish is very 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.039
 simple you will see so you do 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.800
 first a mesh in the air to turn 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:36.640
 since the point of picot come true 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:40.839
 on a loosely tightened basis then three 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:45.420
 mayans in the air 1 2 3 and you make a 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:45.420
 trunk shot a stitch cast at the base 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:54.160
 three knits in the air to throw I 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:57.070
 pull the thread and I pull through the 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:02.859
 last hurts then I make a mesh 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:09.759
 tight a second tight fault 3 mesh 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:12.310
 in the air 1 2 3 and there I sting in the 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:18.940

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:22.869
 two strands I pass my son and I pass 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.660
