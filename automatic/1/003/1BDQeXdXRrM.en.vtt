00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.280
 I will start with a master potato dish 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.120
 British fries 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:16.880
 How many times have you entered the bar to get a pile of soft fries 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.560
 This one is particularly depressed 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.280
 For me, this is the reverse of a good French fries 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.360
 It should have a delicate, fluffy interior 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.840
 With a thick, glassy skin 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.880
 After years of experience and tons of potatoes 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.160
 I discovered a secret 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.120
 Fry not once, not two, but THREE times 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.120
 I promise, it's worth it! 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.000
 I proudly present my recipe: triple fried fries 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.760
 The best French fries are maris piper 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.520
 peel and cut them into thick stripes 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.560
 if they are too thin 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.360
 there is a danger that the skin will be on its own 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.680
 This one is huge, I would dump a guest who cut them 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.920
 rinse the potatoes to get rid of starch for 5 minutes 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:21.480
 now the first phase - heating on a low heat 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.800
 that's why they are so different, crunchy and fluffy 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.920
 place the potatoes in cold, unsalted water 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.080
 and leave them on a small gas 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.000
 for 20 minutes until they start to fall apart 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.200
 this crumbling coating will allow 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.560
 oil to make them a golden skin 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.760
 small cracks form, there will be a beautiful skin 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.680
 a soft fries will never take on fragility 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.320
 this couple is the humidity escaping from fries 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.760
 I have tried many techniques over the years 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.320
 getting rid of moisture from potatoes 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.400
 I put them in the microwave, dried them with a hairdryer 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:11.880
 I used a vacuum, I even punctured it 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.480
 in the end I came up with something quite normal 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.120
 put them in the freezer 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.560
 fries are drying beautifully, an hour is enough 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.600
 when they dry, you can take care of the wonderful skin 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.640
 the second phase is light frying 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.600
 I heated the oil to 130 degrees Celsius, not too much 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.360
 this creates the first layer of the skin 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.440
 after 5 minutes they are ready 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.880
 the skin was formed before it started to take on color 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.920
 they are ready for the last phase of hot oil 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.640
 when it will become golden 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.680
 third phase - hot oil 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.200
 heat oil to 180 degrees Celsius 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.240
 and fry French fries until they are golden brown 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.720
 now they are changing into something magical 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.800
 are ready 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.240
 double frying makes them crispy 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.680
 and finally one more spell 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.960
 immediate impact of nostalgia 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.800
 malty vinegar in the atomizer 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.360
 wonderful bar aroma with fries 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.200
 without pouring fries with gallons of vinegar
