00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:35.469 
these for fallible yes so I thought I'd

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:40.050 
these for fallible yes so I thought I'd
take<00:01:35.709> the<00:01:35.920> plunge<00:01:36.159> and<00:01:36.459> I<00:01:37.950> spend<00:01:38.950> three<00:01:39.579> pounds

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
take the plunge and I spend three pounds

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.419 
take the plunge and I spend three pounds
on<00:01:40.209> this<00:01:40.590> I'll<00:01:41.590> show<00:01:41.859> you<00:01:41.920> it<00:01:42.100> now<00:01:42.310> on<00:01:42.549> this<00:01:42.759> XD

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
on this I'll show you it now on this XD

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:48.239 
on this I'll show you it now on this XD
so<00:01:45.429> obviously<00:01:45.819> it<00:01:46.090> just<00:01:46.299> goes<00:01:46.560> goes<00:01:47.560> both<00:01:48.099> of

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:48.249 
so obviously it just goes goes both of

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:53.099 
so obviously it just goes goes both of
the<00:01:48.340> top<00:01:48.520> of<00:01:48.700> it<00:01:48.819> and<00:01:51.479> then<00:01:52.479> you<00:01:52.630> were<00:01:52.719> taking

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:53.109 
the top of it and then you were taking

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:55.010 
the top of it and then you were taking
it<00:01:53.200> onto<00:01:53.469> the<00:01:53.590> focus<00:01:53.979> ring

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
it onto the focus ring

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.719 
it onto the focus ring
so<00:01:56.020> slide<00:01:56.349> that<00:01:56.649> just<00:01:56.950> like<00:01:57.880> that<00:01:58.060> we<00:01:58.240> wet<00:01:58.420> down

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
so slide that just like that we wet down

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.440 
so slide that just like that we wet down
aren't<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.090> their<00:02:00.210> focus<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:02.240> can't<00:02:03.240> really

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
aren't in their focus you can't really

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.819 
aren't in their focus you can't really
do<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.659> snot<00:02:05.780> okay<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.110> it's<00:02:07.680> not

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
do that snot okay so that it's not

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.660 
do that snot okay so that it's not
really<00:02:08.039> going<00:02:08.190> any<00:02:08.369> tear<00:02:10.009> there<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.099> go<00:02:11.280> how's

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
really going any tear there you go how's

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.190 
really going any tear there you go how's
the<00:02:11.819> bit<00:02:11.970> state<00:02:12.239> is<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.480> can<00:02:12.660> get<00:02:12.780> it<00:02:12.870> starts

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
the bit state is I can get it starts

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.110 
the bit state is I can get it starts
with<00:02:13.319> it<00:02:13.440> looks<00:02:13.590> like<00:02:13.800> once<00:02:14.040> it's<00:02:14.250> fine<00:02:14.489> and

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
with it looks like once it's fine and

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.120 
with it looks like once it's fine and

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
then when you start to use it I mean

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.120 
then when you start to use it I mean
it's<00:02:20.130> bending<00:02:21.110> its<00:02:22.110> Bend<00:02:22.349> and<00:02:22.560> ridiculously

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
it's bending its Bend and ridiculously

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.360 
it's bending its Bend and ridiculously
yeah<00:02:23.569> and<00:02:24.569> as<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.380> as<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.830> actually<00:02:26.010> use<00:02:26.340> it

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
yeah and as you as you actually use it

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.360 
yeah and as you as you actually use it
as<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.640> follow<00:02:26.940> focus<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:28.500> gets<00:02:28.739> looser<00:02:29.069> and

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
as a follow focus it gets looser and

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.250 
as a follow focus it gets looser and
there's<00:02:29.760> no<00:02:29.940> no<00:02:30.150> longer<00:02:30.450> meditate<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.170> it's

pointless<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:35.150> mean<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.569> be<00:02:36.599> fair<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:37.080> could

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
pointless I mean to be fair you could

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.240 
pointless I mean to be fair you could
probably<00:02:38.150> get<00:02:39.150> some<00:02:39.360> kind<00:02:39.569> of<00:02:39.660> clamp<00:02:40.099> to<00:02:41.099> clamp

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
probably get some kind of clamp to clamp

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.789 
probably get some kind of clamp to clamp
that<00:02:41.430> in<00:02:41.670> place<00:02:41.970> but<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:43.110> defeats<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.620> point

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
that in place but it defeats the point

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.640 
that in place but it defeats the point
it<00:02:44.010> doesn't<00:02:44.190> work<00:02:44.489> as<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.510> follow<00:02:45.870> focus<00:02:46.110> it's<00:02:46.530> a

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
it doesn't work as a follow focus it's a

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.920 
it doesn't work as a follow focus it's a
better<00:02:46.829> day<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.099> us<00:02:48.319> yeah<00:02:49.970> so<00:02:50.970> yeah<00:02:51.209> I'll<00:02:51.480> stick

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
to using my hands yeah hopefully this

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.160 
to using my hands yeah hopefully this
video<00:02:56.310> will<00:02:56.730> save<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.150> three<00:02:57.390> bones<00:02:57.660> unless

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
video will save you three bones unless

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.050 
video will save you three bones unless
you<00:02:58.349> are<00:02:58.470> quite<00:02:58.799> frail<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.700> can<00:02:59.880> hold

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
you are quite frail and you can hold

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.030 
you are quite frail and you can hold
Josh<00:03:00.420> then<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:01.049> would<00:03:01.200> come<00:03:01.410> in<00:03:01.530> handy<00:03:01.650> but

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
Josh then that would come in handy but

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.620 
Josh then that would come in handy but
as<00:03:02.130> a<00:03:02.160> former<00:03:02.519> focus<00:03:03.440> no<00:03:04.970> obviously<00:03:05.970> -<00:03:06.239> useful

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
as a former focus no obviously - useful

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.079 
as a former focus no obviously - useful
