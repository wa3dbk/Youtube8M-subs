00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.440
 Hello, my name is Alex, in this tutorial I'm going to explain to you 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.900
 How can you make it 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.430
 Your stuff 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.150
 Depending on your physical username. So here I have a simple box 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.689
 I converted it to 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.410
 Poly-editable and set 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.600
 Different materials for different polygons. 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.160
 I put different material IDs for each polygon. 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.690
 Press M on the keyboard to open the material editor 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.690
 And click on Standard and 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.920
 Select Multisub objects 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.030
 Under the diffuse above where she showed her 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.409
 Select the bitmap. 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:25.960
 Submission / submission of the preparation program 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.549
 Or press F10 on the keyboard. 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.909
 This window pops up and under loading elements you have to add 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.330
 And select MaterialID. 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.210
 if I were 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.610
 Now made by MaterialIDs wont show. 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.480
 It's not enough to select only polygons 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.320
 In articles editor 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.940
 Select materials 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.300
 I'm here physical and 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.000
 You can see the ID channel material you have to change these numbers. 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.640
 Now it should work. Submitted by. 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.269
