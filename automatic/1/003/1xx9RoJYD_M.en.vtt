going<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.690> use<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.140> first<00:00:43.350> test<00:00:43.739> log<00:00:45.469> and<00:00:46.469> pick

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
going to use the first test log and pick

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.790 
going to use the first test log and pick
up<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.940> chicken<00:00:48.149> residue<00:00:51.140> move<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.230> into<00:00:52.440> here

up the chicken residue move it into here

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.029 
up the chicken residue move it into here
clip<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.879> top<00:00:54.149> or<00:00:54.539> snuck<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.989> top<00:00:55.230> as<00:00:55.530> we<00:00:55.739> slip

nobody<00:01:07.110> for<00:01:07.350> us<00:01:07.410> to<00:01:07.560> do<00:01:07.790> so<00:01:08.790> protein<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.540> is

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
nobody for us to do so protein this is

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.830 
nobody for us to do so protein this is
testing<00:01:10.200> for<00:01:10.230> protein<00:01:11.150> protein<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.450> present

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
testing for protein protein is present

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.230 
testing for protein protein is present
in<00:01:13.260> anything<00:01:13.620> that<00:01:14.010> was<00:01:14.160> ever<00:01:14.370> alive<00:01:14.940> or

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
in anything that was ever alive or

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.890 
in anything that was ever alive or
growing<00:01:15.480> so<00:01:15.990> chicken<00:01:16.530> beef<00:01:17.360> fish<00:01:18.360> everything

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
growing so chicken beef fish everything

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.280 
growing so chicken beef fish everything
that<00:01:19.140> has<00:01:19.260> protein<00:01:19.560> even<00:01:19.920> an<00:01:20.130> apple<00:01:20.760> milk<00:01:21.690> has

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
that has protein even an apple milk has

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.880 
that has protein even an apple milk has
protein<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.420> bacteria<00:01:24.420> needs<00:01:24.930> protein<00:01:25.680> to

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
protein in it bacteria needs protein to

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.130 
protein in it bacteria needs protein to
grow<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.700> without<00:01:27.180> protein<00:01:27.810> on<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.020> surface

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
grow so without protein on the surface

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.680 
grow so without protein on the surface
bacteria<00:01:28.860> can't<00:01:29.430> grow<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.910> your<00:01:30.060> surface<00:01:30.480> is

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
bacteria can't grow so your surface is

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.730 
bacteria can't grow so your surface is
totally<00:01:31.320> clean<00:01:33.410> that<00:01:34.790> gonna<00:01:35.790> take<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.740> enviro

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
totally clean that gonna take the enviro

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.920 
totally clean that gonna take the enviro
cloth<00:01:37.979> just<00:01:38.820> right<00:01:39.090> as<00:01:39.360> water<00:01:44.119> this<00:01:45.119> actually

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
cloth just right as water this actually

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.910 
cloth just right as water this actually
holds<00:01:50.750> then<00:01:51.750> I'm<00:01:51.869> going<00:01:52.050> to<00:01:52.080> flat<00:01:52.380> fold<00:01:52.710> it

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
holds then I'm going to flat fold it

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.300 
holds then I'm going to flat fold it
fold<00:01:53.910> it<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.210> half<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.840> then<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.650> fold<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.160> in

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
fold it in half and then I fold it in

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.090 
fold it in half and then I fold it in

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
chicken residue now I'm going to wipe up

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.750 
chicken residue now I'm going to wipe up
be<00:02:09.000> for<00:02:09.270> us<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.479> do<00:02:12.500> I'm<00:02:13.500> taking<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.130> third<00:02:14.370> test

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
be for us to do I'm taking a third test

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.380 
be for us to do I'm taking a third test
swab<00:02:15.830> so<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.130> surface<00:02:17.370> for<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:17.910> chicken<00:02:18.239> was

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
swab so the surface for the chicken was

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.310 
swab so the surface for the chicken was
and<00:02:18.780> swap<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.890> surface<00:02:20.250> where<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.550> beat<00:02:20.700> was

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
and swap the surface where the beat was

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.310 
and swap the surface where the beat was
so<00:02:22.320> when<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.530> actually<00:02:23.400> picked<00:02:24.300> up<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.750> first

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
so when I actually picked up the first

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.960 
so when I actually picked up the first
surface<00:02:25.650> here<00:02:25.980> with<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.280> chicken<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:26.760> have

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
surface here with the chicken and have

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.790 
surface here with the chicken and have
now<00:02:27.120> gone<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.660> beef<00:02:27.870> I've<00:02:28.170> used<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.500> exact

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
now gone to the beef I've used the exact

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.340 
now gone to the beef I've used the exact
same<00:02:28.830> cloth<00:02:29.400> exact<00:02:29.850> same<00:02:30.120> surface<00:02:30.690> showing

same cloth exact same surface showing

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.900 
same cloth exact same surface showing
that<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.800> didn't<00:02:32.040> actually<00:02:32.130> carry<00:02:32.640> anything

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
that it didn't actually carry anything

these are highly sensitive slugs and you

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.789 
these are highly sensitive slugs and you

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
can see the green on the bottom is there

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.610 
can see the green on the bottom is there
now<00:03:07.610> number<00:03:08.030> one<00:03:08.209> and<00:03:08.390> two<00:03:08.480> are<00:03:08.959> showing

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
now number one and two are showing
