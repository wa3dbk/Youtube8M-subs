that new weapon so we get the shrink ray

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.030 
that new weapon so we get the shrink ray
here<00:00:30.470> and<00:00:31.780> we're<00:00:32.780> off<00:00:32.900> to<00:00:32.930> shrink<00:00:33.860> some

run-of-the-mill Walker run our crawlers

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.350 
run-of-the-mill Walker run our crawlers
whatever<00:00:44.930> and<00:00:45.800> I've<00:00:46.580> slowed<00:00:46.820> down<00:00:46.970> the<00:00:47.120> video

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
whatever and I've slowed down the video

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.510 
whatever and I've slowed down the video
here<00:00:50.050> ok<00:00:51.050> so<00:00:51.110> we've<00:00:51.530> shrunk<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:52.100> regular

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.970 
here ok so we've shrunk the regular
zombies<00:00:52.760> so<00:00:53.330> up<00:00:53.750> next<00:00:53.810> we<00:00:54.260> have<00:00:54.410> a<00:00:54.470> napalm

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
zombies so up next we have a napalm

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:03.750 
zombies so up next we have a napalm
zombie

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.969 

so<00:01:04.360> we<00:01:04.479> shrink<00:01:04.689> from<00:01:04.809> a<00:01:04.989> farms<00:01:05.379> on<00:01:05.560> me<00:01:05.740> give

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
so we shrink from a farms on me give

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.460 
so we shrink from a farms on me give
them<00:01:06.100> a<00:01:06.159> bit<00:01:06.310> of<00:01:06.430> a<00:01:06.490> boot<00:01:06.729> here<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:10.320> tick<00:01:11.320> him

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
them a bit of a boot here and tick him

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.520 
them a bit of a boot here and tick him
off<00:01:11.619> the<00:01:11.770> list<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:13.390> up<00:01:13.450> next<00:01:13.540> what<00:01:13.960> we<00:01:14.080> need<00:01:14.290> is

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
off the list so up next what we need is

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.730 
off the list so up next what we need is
a<00:01:15.299> Shrieker<00:01:16.299> zombie<00:01:16.810> now<00:01:17.140> it<00:01:17.259> doesn't<00:01:17.590> need<00:01:17.680> to

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
a Shrieker zombie now it doesn't need to

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.219 
a Shrieker zombie now it doesn't need to
be<00:01:17.860> done<00:01:18.070> in<00:01:18.310> any<00:01:18.549> particular<00:01:18.820> order<00:01:19.360> this<00:01:20.049> is

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
be done in any particular order this is

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.450 
be done in any particular order this is
just<00:01:20.500> how<00:01:20.649> it<00:01:20.680> happened<00:01:21.159> in<00:01:21.250> this<00:01:21.340> video<00:01:23.460> so

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
just how it happened in this video so

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.070 
just how it happened in this video so
will<00:01:24.610> speed<00:01:24.850> up<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.119> video<00:01:25.210> a<00:01:25.659> little<00:01:25.840> bit

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
will speed up the video a little bit

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.800 
will speed up the video a little bit
here<00:01:26.320> until<00:01:26.590> we<00:01:26.680> get<00:01:26.799> a<00:01:26.860> Shrieker<00:01:30.509> but<00:01:31.509> once

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
here until we get a Shrieker but once

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.100 
here until we get a Shrieker but once
you've<00:01:31.990> got<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.500> shrink<00:01:33.399> ray<00:01:34.110> eventually

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
you've got the shrink ray eventually

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.260 
you've got the shrink ray eventually
you'll<00:01:35.320> end<00:01:36.310> up<00:01:36.429> with<00:01:36.490> this<00:01:36.700> achievement<00:01:37.060> if

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
you'll end up with this achievement if

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.639 
you'll end up with this achievement if
you<00:01:37.390> just<00:01:37.659> shrink<00:01:37.840> everything<00:01:38.050> in<00:01:38.440> sight

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
you just shrink everything in sight

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:48.090 
you just shrink everything in sight
basically<00:01:45.869> now<00:01:46.869> in<00:01:47.050> solar<00:01:47.380> you<00:01:47.590> do<00:01:47.710> get<00:01:47.890> a<00:01:47.920> lot

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
basically now in solar you do get a lot

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.859 
basically now in solar you do get a lot
more<00:01:48.159> napalm<00:01:48.700> and<00:01:48.729> shrieking<00:01:49.179> zombies<00:01:49.569> so<00:01:49.750> you

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
more napalm and shrieking zombies so you

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.370 
more napalm and shrieking zombies so you
shouldn't<00:01:50.110> have<00:01:50.170> any<00:01:50.259> trouble<00:01:50.759> finding<00:01:51.759> one

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
shouldn't have any trouble finding one

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.059 
shouldn't have any trouble finding one
and<00:01:53.380> we<00:01:53.710> go<00:01:53.830> to<00:01:53.890> Shrieker<00:01:54.159> here<00:01:54.690> so<00:01:55.690> we<00:01:56.380> shrink

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
and we go to Shrieker here so we shrink

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:02.969 
and we go to Shrieker here so we shrink
his<00:01:57.310> ass<00:01:57.539> and<00:01:59.729> he's<00:02:00.729> done<00:02:01.530> now<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.619> next<00:02:02.830> part

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
his ass and he's done now the next part

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.889 
his ass and he's done now the next part
of<00:02:03.250> this<00:02:03.369> achievement<00:02:03.819> is<00:02:04.149> where<00:02:04.420> people<00:02:04.630> get

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
of this achievement is where people get

we<00:02:11.620> need<00:02:11.800> to<00:02:11.920> shrink<00:02:12.540> but<00:02:13.540> you<00:02:13.780> can't<00:02:13.989> just

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
we need to shrink but you can't just

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.240 
we need to shrink but you can't just
shrink<00:02:14.410> them<00:02:14.560> while<00:02:14.709> they're<00:02:14.890> sitting<00:02:15.069> around

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
shrink them while they're sitting around

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.339 
shrink them while they're sitting around
you<00:02:15.970> need<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.330> shrink<00:02:16.540> them<00:02:16.750> while<00:02:17.140> they're

power<00:02:20.319> up<00:02:20.530> here<00:02:20.860> first<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.580> we<00:02:22.390> do<00:02:22.569> get<00:02:22.810> one

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
power up here first and we do get one

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.790 
power up here first and we do get one
just<00:02:23.260> hear<00:02:23.800> about<00:02:24.760> we<00:02:24.879> get<00:02:25.000> two<00:02:25.269> of<00:02:25.300> them<00:02:25.569> and
