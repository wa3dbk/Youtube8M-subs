you going to solid viewport shading show
you<00:00:25.289> my<00:00:25.529> setup<00:00:25.830> I've<00:00:26.279> got<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:28.279> plane<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.550> is

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
you my setup I've got a plane that is

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.720 
you my setup I've got a plane that is
emitting<00:00:30.330> light<00:00:30.359> down<00:00:31.349> on<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:32.070> Suzanne

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
plane for my ground plane if I take off

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.569 
plane for my ground plane if I take off
my<00:00:45.500> background<00:00:47.210> environment<00:00:48.210> texture<00:00:49.579> remove

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
my background environment texture remove

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.709 
my background environment texture remove
and<00:00:51.500> I<00:00:52.500> was<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.510> render<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:56.329> you<00:00:57.329> will<00:00:57.449> see

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
and I was to render this you will see

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.529 
and I was to render this you will see
it's<00:00:58.079> it's<00:00:58.500> not<00:00:58.739> too<00:00:58.920> bad<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.250> an<00:00:59.399> OK<00:00:59.789> render

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
it's it's not too bad it's an OK render

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.139 
it's it's not too bad it's an OK render
there's<00:01:01.350> no<00:01:01.530> white<00:01:01.920> pixels<00:01:02.399> anywhere<00:01:02.879> and

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
there's no white pixels anywhere and

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.969 
there's no white pixels anywhere and
it's<00:01:03.780> quite<00:01:04.080> clean<00:01:05.150> however<00:01:06.150> as<00:01:06.479> soon<00:01:06.780> as<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.619> go

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
it's quite clean however as soon as I go

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.600 
it's quite clean however as soon as I go
into<00:01:08.780> my<00:01:09.780> backgrounds<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.950> add<00:01:11.460> an

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
into my backgrounds and add an

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.460 
into my backgrounds and add an
environment<00:01:12.270> texture<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:12.960> environment

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
environment texture and environment

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.890 
environment texture and environment
textures<00:01:13.860> are<00:01:14.100> great<00:01:14.159> for<00:01:14.880> applying<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
textures are great for applying the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.929 
textures are great for applying the
luminance<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.590> background<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.369> an<00:01:17.490> object

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
luminance of a background to an object

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.030 
luminance of a background to an object
so<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.210> really<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.409> really<00:01:19.680> sell<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
so it really you can really sell the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.070 
so it really you can really sell the
illusion<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.880> belongs<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.960> the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
illusion that it belongs to the to the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.530 
illusion that it belongs to the to the
live<00:01:22.290> plate<00:01:23.119> if<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.509> go<00:01:24.930> if<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.530> can<00:01:25.680> find<00:01:26.009> it

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
live plate if we go if I can find it

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.860 
live plate if we go if I can find it
got<00:01:27.540> an<00:01:27.630> HDR<00:01:28.049> map<00:01:29.930> for<00:01:30.930> my<00:01:31.049> background

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
got an HDR map for my background

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.560 
got an HDR map for my background
and<00:01:32.960> if<00:01:33.710> I<00:01:34.040> go<00:01:34.250> back<00:01:34.280> and<00:01:35.920> into<00:01:36.920> rendered<00:01:37.570> you

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
and if I go back and into rendered you

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.860 
and if I go back and into rendered you
can<00:01:38.750> see<00:01:38.960> all<00:01:39.200> of<00:01:39.350> a<00:01:39.440> sudden<00:01:39.860> it<00:01:40.540> just<00:01:41.540> looks

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
can see all of a sudden it just looks

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.620 
can see all of a sudden it just looks
disgusting<00:01:42.800> we've<00:01:42.950> got<00:01:43.190> lots<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:44.030> lots<00:01:44.330> and

disgusting we've got lots and lots and

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.800 
disgusting we've got lots and lots and
lots<00:01:44.690> of<00:01:45.230> fireflies<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:46.520> white<00:01:46.820> dots<00:01:47.150> this

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
lots of fireflies and white dots this

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.520 
lots of fireflies and white dots this
has<00:01:48.020> been<00:01:48.200> solved<00:01:48.710> in<00:01:48.890> version<00:01:49.840> 2.6<00:01:50.840> three<00:01:51.260> of
