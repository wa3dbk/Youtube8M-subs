00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
then grab a mallet and start Hamming

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.050 
then grab a mallet and start Hamming
hammering<00:02:20.920> away<00:02:21.099> at<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.580> old<00:02:21.730> piece<00:02:22.030> of

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
hammering away at the old piece of

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.960 
hammering away at the old piece of
exhaust<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.980> coupler<00:02:24.310> should<00:02:24.550> give<00:02:24.730> way

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
exhaust the coupler should give way

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:32.360 
exhaust the coupler should give way
after<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.510> few<00:02:25.690> blows

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.460 

once<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.150> coupler<00:02:33.450> gives<00:02:33.660> way<00:02:33.870> you're<00:02:34.290> now

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
once the coupler gives way you're now

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.420 
once the coupler gives way you're now
ready<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.890> remove<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.190> Galileo<00:02:35.760> murder

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.710 

next<00:03:04.250> replace<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:04.970> catalytic<00:03:05.630> converter

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
next replace the catalytic converter

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.140 
next replace the catalytic converter
gasket<00:03:06.440> be<00:03:06.710> sure<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.100> old<00:03:07.220> one<00:03:07.460> isn't<00:03:07.760> still

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150
