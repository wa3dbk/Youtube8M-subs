00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.529
 hello everyone in this video we'll talk about 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.589
 an issue that has been touched long before and 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.650
 after the exit of halo 4 it will leave g 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:14.570
 and 5 in 2013 due to the fact that 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.000
 the sequel a lot has been rumored and 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.580
 even 5 halo dates have been given 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.529
 besides a series of rumors how 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.679
 could leave for the new console and 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:28.220
 both in 2013 but how true are 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:31.849
 these rumors well we will start by seeing 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.240
 the halo 1 chronology came out in 2001 halo 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:39.590
 2 came out in 2004 that is passed three years 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:42.530
 then halo 3 in 2007 already on the xbox 360 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.860
 so they spent another 3 years then 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.350
 they came out halo 3 odst and halo wars both 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.140
 in 2009 and the sequel to the 3 was broken 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.270
 years of game in game in 2010 came out 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.120
 halo reach and start a new sequel 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.350
 now a year in 2011 left halo 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.210
 anniversary and finally in 2012 halo 4 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.879
 then it sounds coherent that halo 5 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.470
 leave in 2013 and halo 2 anniversary in 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.420
 2014 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.400
 the latter in addition to carrying the sequel 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.310
 of the game year in game would come out in its 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.200
 10 years anniversary some rumors 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.420
 truths are made as the 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.300
 time and others end up refuting 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.190
 but on the official side of 343 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.440

 towards the next generation of xbox this 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.300
 gives us to understand that hey the 5 is 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.130
 completely based on continuing the 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.729
 story in the bittersweet ending that we 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.680

 Exact due to the little information that 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.100

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.170
 that will make the campaign experience and 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.970
 multiplayer very good for the
