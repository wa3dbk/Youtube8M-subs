00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
children in the sense that they come

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.260

from<00:02:01.740> very<00:02:02.010> far<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.550> terms<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.970> what<00:02:03.150> they

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
from very far in terms of what they

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.880 
from very far in terms of what they
experience<00:02:03.840> during<00:02:04.050> their<00:02:04.200> recruitment<00:02:04.590> by

the<00:02:04.950> LTTE<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.990> I<00:02:06.990> would<00:02:07.229> say<00:02:07.440> is<00:02:07.710> a

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
the LTTE and I would say is a

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.889 
the LTTE and I would say is a
transitional<00:02:08.460> phase<00:02:08.729> we<00:02:09.090> cannot<00:02:09.360> say<00:02:09.630> that

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
transitional phase we cannot say that

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.050 
transitional phase we cannot say that
the<00:02:10.050> job<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.380> finished<00:02:10.649> all<00:02:11.040> the<00:02:11.370> opposite<00:02:11.820> I

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
the job is finished all the opposite I

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.060 
the job is finished all the opposite I
think<00:02:12.630> this<00:02:12.750> is<00:02:12.870> just<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.200> starting<00:02:13.650> point<00:02:13.830> of

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
think this is just a starting point of

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.290 
think this is just a starting point of
the<00:02:14.220> rehabilitation<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.120> reintegration

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
the rehabilitation and reintegration

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.680 
the rehabilitation and reintegration
process<00:02:15.900> we<00:02:16.590> do<00:02:16.950> not<00:02:17.100> know<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.760> exact<00:02:18.150> number

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
process we do not know the exact number

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.630 
process we do not know the exact number
of<00:02:18.720> children<00:02:19.350> who<00:02:19.380> were<00:02:19.530> recruited<00:02:20.010> during

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
really appropriate for them to walk

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.120 
really appropriate for them to walk

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.790 
and they know that in the end control
rests<00:03:42.760> with<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:42.940> military<00:03:43.360> I<00:03:43.690> would<00:03:44.410> say<00:03:44.620> is

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
rests with the military I would say is

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.250 
rests with the military I would say is
not<00:03:45.010> a<00:03:45.040> very<00:03:45.370> conventional<00:03:45.820> approach<00:03:46.750> if<00:03:47.110> you

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
not a very conventional approach if you

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.410 
not a very conventional approach if you
compared<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:47.770> other<00:03:47.890> countries<00:03:48.220> what<00:03:49.150> we<00:03:49.300> have

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
compared to other countries what we have

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.210 
compared to other countries what we have
observed<00:03:49.570> over<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.350> past<00:03:50.620> weeks<00:03:50.920> and<00:03:51.100> months

observed over the past weeks and months

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.060 
observed over the past weeks and months
is<00:03:51.670> that<00:03:51.820> there<00:03:52.300> is<00:03:52.420> a<00:03:52.600> transfer<00:03:53.350> relationship

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
is that there is a transfer relationship

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.310

expectation we have to be objective but

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.540 
expectation we have to be objective but
I<00:03:58.540> insist<00:03:58.990> on<00:03:59.080> the<00:03:59.170> fact<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.590> most<00:03:59.800> important

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
I insist on the fact the most important

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.760 
I insist on the fact the most important
at<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:00.940> end<00:04:01.150> of<00:04:01.270> this<00:04:01.450> process<00:04:01.780> is<00:04:02.380> that<00:04:02.650> the

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
at the end of this process is that the

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.650 
at the end of this process is that the
children<00:04:03.040> they<00:04:03.250> can<00:04:03.459> return<00:04:03.940> to<00:04:04.150> a<00:04:04.180> civilian

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
children they can return to a civilian

life and they are with their parents and
communities<00:04:07.660> again<00:04:08.050> you<00:04:08.530> say<00:04:08.860> that<00:04:09.070> the<00:04:09.220> most

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
communities again you say that the most

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.310 
communities again you say that the most
crucial<00:04:09.670> phase<00:04:10.030> is<00:04:10.270> yet<00:04:10.480> to<00:04:10.630> come<00:04:10.660> when<00:04:11.140> they
