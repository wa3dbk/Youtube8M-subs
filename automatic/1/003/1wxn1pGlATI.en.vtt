guitars<00:01:02.840> we<00:01:03.380> talked<00:01:03.559> about<00:01:03.710> some<00:01:03.980> of<00:01:04.070> the

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
guitars we talked about some of the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160 
guitars we talked about some of the
strumming<00:01:04.699> techniques<00:01:05.089> getting<00:01:06.050> those

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
strumming techniques getting those

strumming techniques getting those
couple<00:01:06.470> of<00:01:06.500> base<00:01:06.680> notes<00:01:06.950> muted<00:01:07.400> and<00:01:07.490> you<00:01:07.580> can

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
couple of base notes muted and you can

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.040 
couple of base notes muted and you can
work<00:01:07.820> on<00:01:07.940> that<00:01:08.000> even<00:01:08.390> right<00:01:08.540> now<00:01:08.750> what<00:01:08.960> I'm

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
work on that even right now what I'm

work on that even right now what I'm
doing<00:01:09.080> there<00:01:09.410> is<00:01:09.440> playing<00:01:09.740> a<00:01:09.830> G<00:01:10.040> chord<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:10.670> the

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
doing there is playing a G chord and the

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.480 
doing there is playing a G chord and the
first<00:01:11.780> two<00:01:12.020> strokes<00:01:12.410> of<00:01:12.650> this<00:01:12.770> chord<00:01:13.070> are<00:01:13.310> just

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
first two strokes of this chord are just

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.249 
first two strokes of this chord are just
going<00:01:13.610> on<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:14.240> bass<00:01:14.420> strings<00:01:14.690> really<00:01:15.050> the

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
going on the bass strings really the

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.230 
going on the bass strings really the

second the fifth and sixth strings just

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.600 
second the fifth and sixth strings just
two<00:01:17.420> strings<00:01:17.660> or<00:01:17.990> maybe<00:01:18.290> just<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.650> sixth<00:01:19.040> but

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
two strings or maybe just the sixth but

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.749 
two strings or maybe just the sixth but
the<00:01:19.729> sound<00:01:19.970> you're<00:01:20.180> looking<00:01:20.210> for<00:01:20.630> is<00:01:20.750> this

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
the sound you're looking for is this

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.850 
the sound you're looking for is this
done<00:01:22.759> by<00:01:23.030> kind<00:01:23.900> of<00:01:23.990> pounding<00:01:24.410> on<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.619> string

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
done by kind of pounding on the string

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.490 
done by kind of pounding on the string
but<00:01:24.979> also<00:01:25.390> pumping<00:01:26.390> it<00:01:26.479> with<00:01:26.570> my<00:01:26.720> left<00:01:26.930> hand<00:01:27.050> at

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
but also pumping it with my left hand at

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.460 
but also pumping it with my left hand at
the<00:01:27.590> same<00:01:27.740> time<00:01:28.009> you<00:01:28.130> don't<00:01:28.220> want<00:01:28.430> this<00:01:32.470> not

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
the same time you don't want this not

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.130 
the same time you don't want this not
enough<00:01:34.040> definition<00:01:34.729> to<00:01:35.240> that<00:01:35.420> so<00:01:35.810> what<00:01:35.899> you<00:01:35.960> do

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
enough definition to that so what you do

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.280 
enough definition to that so what you do
is<00:01:36.229> use<00:01:36.410> your<00:01:36.530> left<00:01:36.800> hand<00:01:36.890> to<00:01:37.850> push<00:01:38.090> down<00:01:38.390> right

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
is use your left hand to push down right

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.490 
is use your left hand to push down right
at<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:39.530> same<00:01:39.680> instant<00:01:40.100> you<00:01:40.160> hit<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.399> chord

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
at the same instant you hit the chord

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.200 
at the same instant you hit the chord
know<00:01:42.500> that<00:01:42.979> you<00:01:43.100> hit<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:43.310> strings<00:01:43.610> really

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
know that you hit the strings really

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.590 
know that you hit the strings really
really<00:01:44.690> useful<00:01:45.080> technique<00:01:45.259> in<00:01:46.090> all<00:01:47.090> kinds<00:01:47.540> of

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
really useful technique in all kinds of

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.649 
really useful technique in all kinds of
songs<00:01:47.780> is<00:01:48.760> muffling<00:01:49.760> the<00:01:49.820> bass<00:01:50.030> notes<00:01:50.299> or

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
songs is muffling the bass notes or

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.510 
songs is muffling the bass notes or
leaving<00:01:51.049> them<00:01:51.260> after<00:01:51.740> you<00:01:51.830> play<00:01:52.010> them<00:01:52.220> but<00:01:52.340> the

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
leaving them after you play them but the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.090 
leaving them after you play them but the
best<00:01:52.970> technique<00:01:53.390> that<00:01:53.659> is<00:01:53.750> think<00:01:53.930> of

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
best technique that is think of

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.320 
best technique that is think of
squeezing<00:01:55.100> them<00:01:55.280> while<00:01:55.610> you<00:01:55.820> play<00:01:56.000> them<00:01:56.150> don't

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
squeezing them while you play them don't

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.760 
squeezing them while you play them don't
think<00:01:56.510> about<00:01:56.720> playing<00:01:57.229> it<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:57.470> then<00:01:57.560> letting

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
think about playing it and then letting

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.250 
think about playing it and then letting
go<00:01:57.890> it's<00:01:58.190> kind<00:01:58.369> of<00:01:58.490> that's<00:01:58.670> a<00:01:58.909> wrong<00:01:59.630> mental

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
go it's kind of that's a wrong mental

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.109 
go it's kind of that's a wrong mental
approach<00:02:00.470> to<00:02:00.799> that<00:02:00.950> just<00:02:01.670> thinking<00:02:01.940> about

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
approach to that just thinking about

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.000 
approach to that just thinking about
putting<00:02:02.780> it<00:02:02.930> down<00:02:03.049> at<00:02:03.290> the<00:02:03.350> same<00:02:03.530> time<00:02:03.770> as

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
putting it down at the same time as

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.859 
putting it down at the same time as
you're<00:02:04.400> as<00:02:04.729> you're<00:02:04.790> playing<00:02:05.060> it<00:02:05.210> here<00:02:05.390> so

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
you're as you're playing it here so

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.570 
you're as you're playing it here so
that's<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.110> technique<00:02:06.470> that<00:02:06.500> we<00:02:06.799> work<00:02:07.010> on<00:02:07.190> in

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
that's the technique that we work on in

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.969 
that's the technique that we work on in
guitar<00:02:08.179> man<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.899> song<00:02:09.110> is<00:02:09.350> otherwise<00:02:09.709> it's<00:02:09.920> a

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
guitar man the song is otherwise it's a

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.380 
guitar man the song is otherwise it's a
very<00:02:10.160> simple<00:02:10.429> strumming<00:02:10.760> song<00:02:11.030> with<00:02:11.209> some

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
very simple strumming song with some

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.410 
very simple strumming song with some
mostly<00:02:12.140> normal<00:02:12.530> chords<00:02:12.799> in<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:12.950> key<00:02:12.980> of<00:02:13.420> in

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
mostly normal chords in the key of in

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.970 
mostly normal chords in the key of in
the<00:02:14.540> key<00:02:14.690> of<00:02:14.720> G<00:02:15.019> we<00:02:15.530> have<00:02:15.650> this<00:02:15.739> nice<00:02:15.950> little

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
the key of G we have this nice little

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.590 
the key of G we have this nice little
descending<00:02:16.730> happen

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.870 

and<00:02:20.600> what<00:02:20.720> that<00:02:20.840> is<00:02:20.990> is<00:02:21.110> a<00:02:21.290> miner<00:02:21.610> today<00:02:22.610> miner

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
and what that is is a miner today miner
