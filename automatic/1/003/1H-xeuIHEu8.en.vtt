00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.680
 tell you about those books which 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.200
 appeared in July 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.330
 leg late but better late than never 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.340
 previous month and i decided to return to 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.190
 to those who have been waiting for me for a long time 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.220

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.800

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.269
 be sure to read and and but exams me 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.580
 didn't let me do it so i 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.859
 got to this book just by this 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.109
 in summer this book may not be pleasant 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.040
 those who watched the movie Groundhog Day because 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.110
 that this book is just like a movie 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.809
 the girl's life seemed perfect before 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.329
 moment when one fine day 12 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.260
 February is not dead and it is not a spoiler 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.539
 it is written on abortion granted 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.239
 the possibility of the same poison but to let 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.510
 start and need to understand what's wrong with her 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.670
 life why happened what happened 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.199
 why she died that day 5 if it 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.930
 happened to you you would never 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.699
 thought that your life and ideal is good 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.250
 so that living your day and again and 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.380
 again she understands the real 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.909
 the value of life and the fact that it risks 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.920
 lose not like what he 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.080
 oliver does not draw poops the main character 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.479
 and her friends are absolutely perfect 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.540
 is that they also have flaws on 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.920
 which the author indicates 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.200
 probably it is correct because nobody 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.880
 of us is not perfect, but in Russia our Levi 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.090
 books i'm a very strange person or 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.310
 I read Harry Potter and did not consider 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.260
 bloom tomm saoyer and until recent 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.710
 time i could replenish 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.900
 the list also has chances for a mustache but after 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.600
 leaving school I decided it was time 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.430
 return the story of a brilliant detective 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.610
 which I made my first acquaintance 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.980
 Shellac Folsom 7 7 8 class I 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.780
 then we were asked to read to choose 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.160
 several his story is now 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.880
 I remember that I got caught 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:57.300
 story five grains of orange 5 songs 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.270
 Chernyshev and I was quite delighted with 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.670
 of this story I promised myself that 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.590
 someday I will not meet 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.510
 with fragments with a real detective grieve 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.580
 completely at least one compilation 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.400
 maybe the sherlock series inspired me to 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.680
 reading a book because I stayed 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.840
 wild thrilled and water him again you 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.670
 look plays new classics does not have 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.800
 sense in my opinion but when you 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.130
 watch serials when you read not well 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.680
 then you plunge into the world of London into the world 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.320
 detectives and receipts if first 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.050
 reading silks of holmes and watching a movie you 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.500
 think about my goodness who is the killer and how 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.890
 this is generally how detective works 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.560
 method and then at the end you understand who 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.430
 killer even tray than scarf and this 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.560
 great and the movie teaches you to think not get 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.840
 notice the details and 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.610
 you torment pleasure when you read 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.090
 the last to the crimson hues and 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.670
 Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, I realized that 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.200
 my brain and sinker so that cloaks 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.280
 I can’t master the books 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:08.489
 and I decided to return to books from the category 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.519
 brain and on diet from chewing gum for the mind and not 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.620
 got the arm of the book j-power away 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.330
 from you I have long wanted to lament 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.810
 but did not reach the hands because 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.090
 exams and 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.340
 and now I am familiar in the story of two 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.770
 sisters full of opposites friend 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.300
 The friend of this book describes the eternal 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.090
 confrontation of beauty and mind 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.890
 confrontations of two sisters who 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.349
 absolutely not all of them are like each 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.660
 friend from the stage of the destruction of their lives and 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.680
 the sisters came to that 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.420
 understanding that they were looking for 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.030
 make sure that the naturalness is strong 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.150
 love is not anything I do not think that this book 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:47.170
 I will like it because I usually don’t 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.510
 I read such books and only in the summer drank 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.010
 filmed featuring a team with and 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.959
 if you are unsure whether you should read 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.500
 this book you can watch a movie 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:04:00.819
 I also liked the movie, though 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.620
 in the book more openly disclosed 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.230
 the very history of these two girls them 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.670
 characters 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.950
 so the choice is yours very much I gave 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.549
 I read a book of the harbor 35 kilos 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.890
 of hope 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:14.790
 and now decided to return to that 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.560

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.200
 a sip of freedom this book is easy pleasant 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.709
 but not as much as 35 kilos 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.380
 of hope 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:25.570
