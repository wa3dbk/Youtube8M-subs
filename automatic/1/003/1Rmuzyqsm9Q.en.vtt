the<00:00:37.469> second<00:00:37.950> time<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.399> beyond<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.910> cost<00:00:39.420> a

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
the second time and beyond that cost a

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.380 
the second time and beyond that cost a
little<00:00:39.870> bit<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.110> money<00:00:40.200> like<00:00:40.530> five<00:00:40.770> bucks<00:00:41.070> to

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
little bit of money like five bucks to

change your name a second time which is
still<00:00:44.040> better<00:00:44.309> than<00:00:44.460> having<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:45.539> buy<00:00:45.719> a

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750

people that say like oh there will be a

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.490 
people that say like oh there will be a
problem<00:01:17.340> with<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.939> but<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.869> don't<00:01:19.200> really<00:01:19.350> think

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
problem with it but I don't really think

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.280 
problem with it but I don't really think
so<00:01:19.979> because<00:01:20.189> there's<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.670> udid<00:01:21.450> they<00:01:21.840> can<00:01:22.049> kind

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
so because there's a udid they can kind

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.130 
so because there's a udid they can kind
of<00:01:22.470> make<00:01:22.979> your<00:01:23.430> like<00:01:23.729> hook<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.600> your<00:01:24.720> account
