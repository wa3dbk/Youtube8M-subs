fish tarpon pike muskie snook all of
that<00:00:24.189> type<00:00:24.430> of<00:00:24.460> really<00:00:25.000> big<00:00:25.240> heavy-duty<00:00:25.840> game

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.200 
that type of really big heavy-duty game

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.009 
that type of really big heavy-duty game
fish<00:00:26.500> so<00:00:27.279> they<00:00:27.430> make<00:00:27.640> this<00:00:27.880> in<00:00:28.119> a<00:00:28.210> six<00:00:28.600> through

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:29.019 
fish so they make this in a six through

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.950 
fish so they make this in a six through
fourteen<00:00:29.050> weight<00:00:29.769> options<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.660> they're

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
fourteen weight options and they're

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.780 
fourteen weight options and they're
typically<00:00:32.439> short<00:00:32.860> rods<00:00:33.250> from<00:00:33.550> like

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
typically short rods from like

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.509 
typically short rods from like
seven-foot<00:00:34.600> I<00:00:34.930> think<00:00:35.590> it's<00:00:35.680> seven<00:00:35.860> foot<00:00:36.190> ten

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:36.519 
seven-foot I think it's seven foot ten

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:38.280 
seven-foot I think it's seven foot ten
all<00:00:36.879> the<00:00:36.970> way<00:00:37.030> up<00:00:37.150> to<00:00:37.269> nine<00:00:37.449> foot<00:00:37.720> but<00:00:37.900> not<00:00:38.050> much

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
all the way up to nine foot but not much

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.060 
all the way up to nine foot but not much
longer<00:00:38.559> than<00:00:38.710> that

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
longer than that

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.280 
longer than that
so<00:00:39.970> they're<00:00:40.150> made<00:00:40.300> for<00:00:40.540> fighting<00:00:40.900> those<00:00:41.050> big

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
so they're made for fighting those big
