and<00:01:28.890> when<00:01:29.820> Clemson<00:01:30.150> came<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.450> mix<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.840> just

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
and when Clemson came in to mix I just

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.810 
and when Clemson came in to mix I just
kind<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.350> gave<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.799> chance<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.250> visited<00:01:32.640> and

whenever<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.180> visited<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.750> fell<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.799> love<00:01:34.979> and

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
whenever I visited I fell in love and

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.539 
whenever I visited I fell in love and
figured<00:01:35.610> why<00:01:35.970> not<00:01:36.000> try<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.079> out<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.590> planned

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549
