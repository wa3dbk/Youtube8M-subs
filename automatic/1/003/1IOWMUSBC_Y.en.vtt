00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
I'm gonna give you a closer look both of

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.960 
I'm gonna give you a closer look both of
my<00:00:31.350> cross-sections<00:00:32.130> are<00:00:32.250> made<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.460> water<00:00:32.669> oak

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
my cross-sections are made of water oak

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.000 
my cross-sections are made of water oak
and<00:00:33.240> I<00:00:33.750> throw<00:00:33.930> them<00:00:34.080> both<00:00:34.200> quite<00:00:34.470> a<00:00:34.500> bit<00:00:34.740> so

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
and I throw them both quite a bit so

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.100 
and I throw them both quite a bit so
they<00:00:35.100> have<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.250> very<00:00:35.430> grainy<00:00:35.790> texture<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.930> fact

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
they have a very grainy texture the fact

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.180 
they have a very grainy texture the fact
is<00:00:37.200> almost<00:00:37.290> like<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.500> dartboard

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
is almost like a dartboard

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.100 
is almost like a dartboard
basically<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.210> make<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.450> throw<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.780> had<00:00:40.020> to

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
basically to make this throw I had to

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.290 
basically to make this throw I had to
throw<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.470> so<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.680> came<00:00:40.830> in<00:00:41.270> perpendicular<00:00:42.270> to

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
throw it so it came in perpendicular to

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.170 
throw it so it came in perpendicular to
target<00:00:42.780> with<00:00:42.900> a<00:00:42.930> lot<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.260> power<00:00:43.940> but<00:00:44.940> even

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
target with a lot of power but even

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.460 
target with a lot of power but even
those<00:00:45.300> wood<00:00:45.570> on<00:00:45.660> wood<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.900> still<00:00:46.170> managed<00:00:46.440> to

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
those wood on wood it still managed to

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.150 
those wood on wood it still managed to
stick<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.860> about<00:00:47.129> an<00:00:48.120> inch<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.540> half<00:00:49.160> with

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
stick in about an inch and a half with

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.590 
stick in about an inch and a half with
the<00:00:50.250> spearhead<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.699> use<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.970> left<00:00:51.150> hand<00:00:51.239> throw

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
the spearhead I use the left hand throw

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.850 
the spearhead I use the left hand throw
and<00:00:51.870> despite<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.260> being<00:00:52.290> left-handed<00:00:52.620> I

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
and despite it being left-handed I

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.410 
and despite it being left-handed I
actually<00:00:52.949> hit<00:00:53.190> center<00:00:53.460> mass<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.120> was<00:00:54.270> very

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
actually hit center mass so I was very

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.619 
actually hit center mass so I was very
pleased<00:00:54.720> with<00:00:54.840> that

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
pleased with that

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.360 
pleased with that
okay<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.690> all<00:00:57.809> fairness<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.320> do<00:00:58.860> like<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.129> throw

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
okay in all fairness I do like to throw

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.460 
okay in all fairness I do like to throw
this<00:00:59.520> thing<00:00:59.760> like<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> traditional<00:01:00.510> spear<00:01:00.870> but

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
this thing like a traditional spear but

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.380 
this thing like a traditional spear but
the<00:01:01.559> shaft<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:01.949> very<00:01:02.190> small<00:01:02.519> so<00:01:03.150> you<00:01:03.180> don't

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
the shaft is very small so you don't

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.910 
the shaft is very small so you don't
have<00:01:03.479> that<00:01:03.540> counterbalance<00:01:04.080> as<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.769> would

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
have that counterbalance as you would

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.410 
have that counterbalance as you would
with<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.129> longer<00:01:05.339> shaft<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.120> don't<00:01:06.270> really

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
with a longer shaft so I don't really

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.240 
with a longer shaft so I don't really
like<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.780> throw<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.170> but<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.920> comes<00:01:08.130> with

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
like to throw this but it comes with

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.030 
like to throw this but it comes with
Lily<00:01:08.490> knife<00:01:08.640> sheath<00:01:09.290> and<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:10.409> perfect<00:01:10.979> for

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
Lily knife sheath and it's perfect for

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.480 
Lily knife sheath and it's perfect for
stay<00:01:11.940> strapped<00:01:12.240> into<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.479> go<00:01:12.659> bag<00:01:12.900> or<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.770> saddle

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
stay strapped into a go bag or a saddle

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.520 
stay strapped into a go bag or a saddle
or<00:01:14.520> something<00:01:14.820> small<00:01:14.909> like<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.530> because

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
or something small like that because

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.200 
or something small like that because
it's<00:01:16.680> very<00:01:16.710> portable<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.460> mean<00:01:17.729> if<00:01:17.850> he<00:01:17.909> wants<00:01:18.030> to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
it's very portable I mean if he wants to

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.899 
it's very portable I mean if he wants to
disconnect<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.690> shaft<00:01:19.370> got<00:01:20.370> a<00:01:20.400> really<00:01:20.549> six

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
disconnect the shaft got a really six

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.680 
disconnect the shaft got a really six
sheath<00:01:21.120> here<00:01:21.500> so<00:01:22.500> that's<00:01:22.860> really<00:01:23.190> a<00:01:23.520> very<00:01:24.150> slim

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
sheath here so that's really a very slim

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.370 
sheath here so that's really a very slim
profile<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:25.830> fit<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.250> in<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> bag<00:01:26.640> or

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
profile and you can fit that in a bag or

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.330 
profile and you can fit that in a bag or
a<00:01:28.549> truck<00:01:29.549> much<00:01:30.180> easier<00:01:30.600> than<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.350> full-length

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
a truck much easier than a full-length

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.970 
a truck much easier than a full-length
shaft<00:01:32.810> so<00:01:33.810> I'm<00:01:33.870> gonna<00:01:33.990> take<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.200> throw<00:01:34.470> with<00:01:34.620> it

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
shaft so I'm gonna take it throw with it

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.680 
shaft so I'm gonna take it throw with it
I'm<00:01:35.550> not<00:01:35.700> very<00:01:35.880> good<00:01:35.970> at<00:01:36.150> spear<00:01:36.330> throwing<00:01:36.600> in

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
I'm not very good at spear throwing in

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.860 
I'm not very good at spear throwing in
general<00:01:38.240> but<00:01:39.240> I'll<00:01:39.360> show<00:01:39.510> you<00:01:39.570> what<00:01:39.660> it<00:01:39.720> looks

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
general but I'll show you what it looks

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:51.190 
general but I'll show you what it looks
like

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.590 

I<00:01:51.369> cannot<00:01:52.369> only<00:01:52.579> care<00:01:52.820> for<00:01:52.850> it<00:01:53.119> for<00:01:53.270> throwing

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
I cannot only care for it for throwing

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.389 
I cannot only care for it for throwing
as<00:01:53.689> much<00:01:53.899> I<00:01:54.200> might<00:01:54.649> rather<00:01:54.860> take<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.159> head<00:01:55.369> off

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
as much I might rather take the head off

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.219 
as much I might rather take the head off
and<00:01:55.729> throw<00:01:55.850> it<00:01:55.880> by<00:01:56.119> itself<00:01:56.450> that's<00:01:56.840> pretty<00:01:57.020> fun

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
and throw it by itself that's pretty fun

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.679 
and throw it by itself that's pretty fun
but<00:01:58.189> I<00:01:58.219> could<00:01:58.430> see<00:01:58.640> this<00:01:58.759> being<00:01:59.299> a<00:01:59.420> very<00:01:59.600> good

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
but I could see this being a very good

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.169 
but I could see this being a very good
melee<00:02:00.110> a<00:02:00.140> close-range<00:02:00.649> weapon<00:02:00.799> but<00:02:01.789> not

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
melee a close-range weapon but not

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:03.069 
melee a close-range weapon but not
really<00:02:02.360> something<00:02:02.600> that<00:02:02.719> I<00:02:02.899> would

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
really something that I would

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.669 
really something that I would
immediately<00:02:04.070> go<00:02:04.340> for<00:02:04.490> throwing<00:02:05.469> but<00:02:06.469> again

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
immediately go for throwing but again

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:07.870 
immediately go for throwing but again
you<00:02:06.920> know<00:02:07.039> you<00:02:07.100> can<00:02:07.220> always<00:02:07.310> just<00:02:07.579> take<00:02:07.759> the

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
you know you can always just take the

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.219 
you know you can always just take the
head<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:08.209> then<00:02:08.840> if<00:02:08.959> you're<00:02:09.080> out<00:02:09.140> the

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
head and then if you're out the
