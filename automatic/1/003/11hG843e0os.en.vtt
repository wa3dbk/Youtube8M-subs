boards in the old box as you can see
right<00:02:07.510> here<00:02:07.570> we<00:02:08.110> have<00:02:08.140> some<00:02:08.350> of<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.770> window

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
right here we have some of the window

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.480 
right here we have some of the window
cutouts<00:02:09.729> that<00:02:10.000> are<00:02:10.090> going<00:02:10.240> back<00:02:10.479> in<00:02:11.400> some<00:02:12.400> of

cutouts that are going back in some of
the<00:02:13.380> plastic<00:02:14.380> trays<00:02:14.650> that<00:02:14.890> go<00:02:14.980> around<00:02:15.160> them

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
the plastic trays that go around them

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.610 
the plastic trays that go around them
and<00:02:15.910> over<00:02:16.180> here<00:02:16.390> you'll<00:02:16.600> see<00:02:16.690> a<00:02:16.870> unique<00:02:17.260> chart

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
and over here you'll see a unique chart

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.940 
and over here you'll see a unique chart
this<00:02:17.770> is<00:02:17.830> how<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.130> guys<00:02:18.490> are<00:02:19.120> identifying

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
this is how the guys are identifying

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.290 
this is how the guys are identifying
everything<00:02:20.950> on<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.160> aircraft<00:02:21.610> this<00:02:22.000> is<00:02:22.150> the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
everything on the aircraft this is the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.720 
everything on the aircraft this is the
entire<00:02:22.810> structure<00:02:23.500> of<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.950> interior<00:02:24.340> cabin

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
entire structure of the interior cabin

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.180 
entire structure of the interior cabin
and<00:02:25.420> as<00:02:25.630> you<00:02:25.750> can<00:02:25.870> see<00:02:25.930> all<00:02:26.410> these<00:02:26.860> little

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
and as you can see all these little

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.340 
and as you can see all these little
boxes<00:02:27.340> represent<00:02:28.120> a<00:02:28.180> floorboard<00:02:28.450> that

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
boxes represent a floorboard that

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.220 
boxes represent a floorboard that
correlates<00:02:29.830> to<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.010> floor<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:31.780> is<00:02:31.959> what<00:02:32.110> the

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
correlates to the floor this is what the

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.990 
correlates to the floor this is what the
inside<00:02:32.380> of<00:02:32.650> the<00:02:32.890> interior<00:02:33.190> looks<00:02:33.400> like<00:02:33.610> this

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
inside of the interior looks like this

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.460 
inside of the interior looks like this
is<00:02:34.120> something<00:02:34.269> the<00:02:34.450> public<00:02:34.750> never<00:02:34.930> sees<00:02:35.230> as

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
is something the public never sees as

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.509 
is something the public never sees as
you<00:02:36.340> can<00:02:36.489> see<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:36.820> see<00:02:37.000> insulation<00:02:38.519> right

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
you can see you see insulation right

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.540 
you can see you see insulation right
here<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:41.260> that's<00:02:41.380> meant<00:02:41.680> for<00:02:41.800> acoustical

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
here and that's meant for acoustical

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.479 
here and that's meant for acoustical
sound<00:02:42.850> and<00:02:43.120> for<00:02:43.630> perfect<00:02:44.380> temperature<00:02:44.680> the

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
sound and for perfect temperature the

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.060 
sound and for perfect temperature the
actual<00:02:45.940> windows<00:02:46.330> and<00:02:46.570> if<00:02:47.380> you<00:02:47.470> take<00:02:47.769> this

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
actual windows and if you take this

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.430 
actual windows and if you take this
apart<00:02:48.550> folks<00:02:48.850> all<00:02:49.060> this<00:02:49.180> insulation<00:02:49.540> you'll

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
apart folks all this insulation you'll

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.979 
apart folks all this insulation you'll
be<00:02:50.590> surprised<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.370> thin<00:02:51.760> this<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.660> thickness

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
be surprised the thin this the thickness

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.080 
be surprised the thin this the thickness
of<00:02:53.080> the<00:02:53.200> skin<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:53.530> protects<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.340> from<00:02:54.580> the

of the skin that protects you from the
outside<00:02:55.540> you<00:02:56.170> really<00:02:56.830> be<00:02:56.950> amazing<00:02:57.310> this<00:02:57.370> ice

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
outside you really be amazing this ice

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.000 
outside you really be amazing this ice
here<00:02:58.269> is<00:02:58.390> an<00:02:58.510> actually<00:02:58.959> one<00:02:59.200> entire<00:02:59.560> panel

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
here is an actually one entire panel

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.819 
here is an actually one entire panel
taken<00:03:00.340> off<00:03:00.810> this<00:03:01.810> one<00:03:02.049> will<00:03:02.170> Betts<00:03:02.320> eventually

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
taken off this one will Betts eventually

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.060 
taken off this one will Betts eventually
go<00:03:02.980> back<00:03:03.190> there<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.579> exploit<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:05.110> as<00:03:05.920> we're

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
go back there to exploit and as we're

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.590 
go back there to exploit and as we're
working<00:03:06.160> our<00:03:06.430> way<00:03:06.459> forward<00:03:06.880> again<00:03:07.420> another

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
working our way forward again another

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.050 
working our way forward again another
galley<00:03:07.959> this<00:03:08.440> would<00:03:08.680> be<00:03:08.860> what<00:03:09.130> would<00:03:09.850> be

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
galley this would be what would be

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.470 
galley this would be what would be
actually<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.930> business<00:03:11.140> class<00:03:11.680> section<00:03:12.480> you

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
actually the business class section you

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.150 
actually the business class section you
can<00:03:13.600> see<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.840> floor<00:03:14.170> ceilings<00:03:14.590> are<00:03:14.709> all<00:03:14.829> taken

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
can see the floor ceilings are all taken

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.030 
can see the floor ceilings are all taken
apart<00:03:15.519> you<00:03:16.510> can<00:03:16.660> see<00:03:16.690> ample<00:03:17.140> space<00:03:17.440> and<00:03:17.769> as<00:03:17.920> we

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
apart you can see ample space and as we

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.000 
apart you can see ample space and as we
work<00:03:18.190> our<00:03:18.370> way<00:03:18.400> forward<00:03:18.549> on<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:20.290> left<00:03:20.799> hand

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
work our way forward on the left hand

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.490 
work our way forward on the left hand
side<00:03:21.310> of<00:03:21.519> the<00:03:21.610> fuselage<00:03:22.090> we<00:03:22.720> come<00:03:22.930> into<00:03:23.110> a<00:03:23.260> yet

side of the fuselage we come into a yet
another<00:03:23.709> galley<00:03:24.040> and<00:03:24.280> then<00:03:24.850> right<00:03:25.060> here<00:03:25.269> folks

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
another galley and then right here folks

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.000 
another galley and then right here folks
is<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:26.650> stairwells<00:03:27.160> they<00:03:27.370> go<00:03:27.519> upstairs<00:03:29.010> for

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
is the stairwells they go upstairs for

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.650 
is the stairwells they go upstairs for
the<00:03:30.100> second<00:03:30.430> level<00:03:30.549> we'll<00:03:30.790> show<00:03:30.970> that<00:03:31.000> in<00:03:31.180> a

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
the second level we'll show that in a

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.050
