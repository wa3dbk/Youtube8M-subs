need are scissors elastic beading cord
and<00:00:25.470> 25<00:00:26.039> pony<00:00:26.369> beads<00:00:28.670> here<00:00:29.670> are<00:00:29.850> a<00:00:29.910> few

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
and 25 pony beads here are a few

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.729 
and 25 pony beads here are a few
examples<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.990> what<00:00:31.199> we're<00:00:31.320> going<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.560> make<00:00:33.739> now

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
examples of what we're going to make now

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.380 
examples of what we're going to make now
our<00:00:34.920> first<00:00:35.070> step<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.670> make<00:00:35.789> the<00:00:35.850> circle<00:00:36.329> on

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
our first step is to make the circle on

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.899 
our first step is to make the circle on
the<00:00:36.420> inside<00:00:36.749> which<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.229> 10<00:00:37.499> pony<00:00:37.829> beads<00:00:38.600> and

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:40.909 
the inside which is 10 pony beads and

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:44.119 
the inside which is 10 pony beads and
each<00:00:41.909> point<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.569> 3<00:00:43.019> so<00:00:43.260> that's<00:00:43.409> going<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.589> be<00:00:43.710> 15

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
each point is 3 so that's going to be 15

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:52.369 
each point is 3 so that's going to be 15
total<00:00:44.489> for<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.120> each<00:00:45.269> of<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.600> points

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.779 

now<00:00:53.280> we<00:00:53.370> need<00:00:53.519> to<00:00:53.640> take<00:00:53.789> our<00:00:54.000> string<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:55.789> add

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
now we need to take our string and add

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.520 
now we need to take our string and add
on<00:00:57.030> 10<00:00:57.449> pony<00:00:57.750> beads<00:00:58.050> I'm<00:00:58.829> using<00:00:59.190> pink<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.530> each

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
on 10 pony beads I'm using pink and each

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.810 
on 10 pony beads I'm using pink and each
point<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:01.980> going<00:01:02.159> to<00:01:02.280> be<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> different<00:01:02.699> color

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
point is going to be a different color

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.630 
point is going to be a different color
so<00:01:03.329> it'll<00:01:03.719> be<00:01:03.899> easier<00:01:04.170> for<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.440> to<00:01:04.470> see<00:01:04.739> each

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
so it'll be easier for you to see each

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:15.389 
so it'll be easier for you to see each
step

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:17.679 

once<00:01:16.399> you<00:01:16.549> have<00:01:16.640> added<00:01:16.789> on<00:01:17.060> your<00:01:17.270> 10<00:01:17.450> pony

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
once you have added on your 10 pony

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.990 
once you have added on your 10 pony
beats<00:01:17.960> we're<00:01:18.170> going<00:01:18.380> to<00:01:18.469> tie<00:01:18.649> a<00:01:18.680> square<00:01:19.009> knot

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.500 

and<00:01:22.800> tie<00:01:23.800> this<00:01:23.860> as<00:01:24.220> many<00:01:24.370> times<00:01:24.520> as<00:01:25.060> you<00:01:25.330> feel

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
and tie this as many times as you feel

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:36.780 
and tie this as many times as you feel
necessary<00:01:25.780> so<00:01:26.680> it<00:01:26.890> will<00:01:27.040> stay<00:01:27.250> secure

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.890 

once<00:01:37.790> you're<00:01:37.910> finished<00:01:37.940> we're<00:01:38.450> going<00:01:38.600> to<00:01:38.720> cut

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
once you're finished we're going to cut

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.500 
once you're finished we're going to cut
off<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.410> excess<00:01:39.590> end<00:01:40.070> only<00:01:40.580> on<00:01:40.730> one<00:01:41.000> end<00:01:41.210> we're

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
off the excess end only on one end we're

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.840 
off the excess end only on one end we're
going<00:01:41.720> to<00:01:41.840> maintain<00:01:42.050> that<00:01:42.350> long<00:01:42.920> tail<00:01:43.220> on<00:01:43.640> one

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
going to maintain that long tail on one

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.530 
going to maintain that long tail on one
side<00:01:44.060> of<00:01:44.090> them<00:01:44.560> like<00:01:45.560> so<00:01:45.790> and<00:01:46.790> now<00:01:47.000> we<00:01:47.180> need<00:01:47.450> to

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
side of them like so and now we need to

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.670 
side of them like so and now we need to
reshape<00:01:47.720> our<00:01:48.790> ten<00:01:49.790> beads<00:01:50.260> what<00:01:51.260> we're<00:01:51.410> going

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
reshape our ten beads what we're going

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.730 
reshape our ten beads what we're going
for<00:01:51.980> is<00:01:52.250> a<00:01:52.280> hexagon<00:01:53.090> shape<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:54.230> every

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
for is a hexagon shape and so every

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.880 
for is a hexagon shape and so every
third<00:01:55.400> bead<00:01:55.790> is<00:01:56.200> going<00:01:57.200> to<00:01:57.260> be<00:01:57.350> pointing<00:01:57.770> out

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
third bead is going to be pointing out

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.620 
third bead is going to be pointing out
like<00:01:58.130> that

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.500 

we<00:02:02.630> take<00:02:02.840> our<00:02:03.020> string<00:02:03.290> and<00:02:03.560> go<00:02:03.800> through<00:02:04.480> one<00:02:05.480> of

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
we take our string and go through one of

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:25.670 
we take our string and go through one of
the<00:02:05.750> points<00:02:09.399> we<00:02:10.399> add<00:02:10.580> on<00:02:10.930> three<00:02:11.930> beads

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.650 

then<00:02:26.680> when<00:02:26.890> we<00:02:26.980> go<00:02:27.100> to<00:02:27.160> string<00:02:27.490> on<00:02:27.640> we<00:02:28.000> skip<00:02:28.360> one

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
then when we go to string on we skip one

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.740 
then when we go to string on we skip one
bead<00:02:28.960> and<00:02:29.290> go<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.700> next<00:02:30.940> one<00:02:31.240> to<00:02:31.450> string

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
bead and go to the next one to string

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.610 
bead and go to the next one to string
through<00:02:32.640> like<00:02:33.640> so<00:02:33.880> so<00:02:34.600> if<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:35.050> have<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.440> in

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
through like so so if you have it in

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.770 
through like so so if you have it in
that<00:02:35.680> hexagon<00:02:36.340> shape<00:02:36.730> it's<00:02:36.970> gonna<00:02:37.150> be<00:02:37.390> your

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
that hexagon shape it's gonna be your

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.830 
that hexagon shape it's gonna be your
next<00:02:38.020> point<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:42.210> we<00:02:43.210> continue<00:02:43.600> this<00:02:43.720> process

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
next point and we continue this process

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.900 
next point and we continue this process
of<00:02:44.440> adding<00:02:44.680> on<00:02:44.890> three<00:02:45.160> beads<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.610> then

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
of adding on three beads and then

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:56.740 
of adding on three beads and then
stringing<00:02:46.390> through<00:02:46.600> our<00:02:46.780> next<00:02:47.080> one

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:09.010 

you

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.030 

when<00:03:10.020> you<00:03:10.140> have<00:03:10.230> finished<00:03:10.500> putting<00:03:10.650> on<00:03:10.890> your

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
when you have finished putting on your

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.460 
when you have finished putting on your
points<00:03:11.430> we're<00:03:12.090> going<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.480> string<00:03:12.840> through<00:03:13.170> our

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
points we're going to string through our

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.740 
points we're going to string through our
last<00:03:13.860> point<00:03:14.430> like<00:03:15.090> we<00:03:15.360> do<00:03:15.540> normally<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:17.750> now

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
last point like we do normally and now

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.050 
last point like we do normally and now
we<00:03:18.810> have<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.380> tie<00:03:19.560> or<00:03:19.620> not<00:03:22.819> we're<00:03:23.819> going<00:03:23.940> to

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
we have to tie or not we're going to

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.850 
we have to tie or not we're going to
take<00:03:24.270> the<00:03:24.450> tail<00:03:24.660> end<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.349> put<00:03:25.800> it<00:03:25.920> into<00:03:26.819> our

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
take the tail end and put it into our

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.380 
take the tail end and put it into our
point<00:03:28.860> right<00:03:29.280> there<00:03:29.310> so<00:03:29.790> it's<00:03:29.910> going<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.120> be<00:03:30.239> in

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
point right there so it's going to be in

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.780 
point right there so it's going to be in
the<00:03:30.540> middle<00:03:30.810> of<00:03:31.019> those<00:03:31.230> three<00:03:31.620> beads<00:03:31.830> now

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
the middle of those three beads now

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.710 
the middle of those three beads now
don't<00:03:32.970> pull<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.300> all<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.599> way<00:03:33.690> through

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
don't pull it all the way through

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.600 
don't pull it all the way through
because<00:03:34.260> you<00:03:34.290> want<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:34.590> have<00:03:34.769> a<00:03:34.830> loop<00:03:35.250> coming

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
because you want to have a loop coming

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.210 
because you want to have a loop coming
out<00:03:35.790> one<00:03:35.970> side<00:03:36.290> so<00:03:37.290> we<00:03:37.440> can<00:03:37.590> take<00:03:37.769> that<00:03:37.800> tail

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
out one side so we can take that tail

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.240 
out one side so we can take that tail
and<00:03:38.550> put<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.180> through<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.930> loop<00:03:40.380> so<00:03:40.920> this<00:03:41.040> is<00:03:41.220> a

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
and put it through the loop so this is a

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.440 
and put it through the loop so this is a
basic<00:03:41.489> half<00:03:41.880> hitch<00:03:42.150> knot<00:03:42.830> and<00:03:44.209> we're<00:03:45.209> going<00:03:45.390> to

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
basic half hitch knot and we're going to

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.240 
basic half hitch knot and we're going to
do<00:03:45.600> this<00:03:45.780> two<00:03:46.019> or<00:03:46.049> three<00:03:46.170> times<00:03:46.530> until<00:03:46.799> we<00:03:47.040> feel

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
do this two or three times until we feel

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:58.780 
do this two or three times until we feel
that<00:03:47.549> our<00:03:47.610> knot<00:03:47.910> is<00:03:48.120> secure

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790
