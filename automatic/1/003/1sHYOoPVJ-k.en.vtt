tablet<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.480> really<00:00:33.480> like<00:00:33.690> this<00:00:33.870> as<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> hybrid

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
tablet I really like this as a hybrid

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.830 
tablet I really like this as a hybrid
because<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.190> tablet<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.760> heavier<00:00:36.329> than<00:00:36.390> some

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
because the tablet is heavier than some

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.720 
because the tablet is heavier than some
of<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.020> slates<00:00:37.290> you've<00:00:37.500> seen<00:00:37.739> but<00:00:38.190> not<00:00:38.250> too

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
of the slates you've seen but not too

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.520 
of the slates you've seen but not too
heavy<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.210> still<00:00:39.480> feels<00:00:39.719> comfortable<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.350> hold

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
heavy it still feels comfortable to hold

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.250 
heavy it still feels comfortable to hold
and<00:00:41.000> with<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.210> full<00:00:42.390> keyboard<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:43.050> think

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
and with the full keyboard I think

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.490 
and with the full keyboard I think
that's<00:00:43.440> just<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.770> really<00:00:44.520> good<00:00:44.550> solution<00:00:45.239> it's

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
that's just a really good solution it's

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.680 
that's just a really good solution it's
it<00:00:46.500> works<00:00:46.800> well<00:00:47.070> as<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.219> laptop<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.879> works<00:00:48.510> well

pro<00:01:14.880> or<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:15.960> left<00:01:16.110> dangling<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.619> box<00:01:16.860> they

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
pro or just left dangling the box they

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.539 
pro or just left dangling the box they
thought<00:01:17.460> about<00:01:17.729> all<00:01:17.939> aspects<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> design

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
thought about all aspects of the design

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.740 
thought about all aspects of the design
yeah<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.850> definitely<00:01:21.180> looks<00:01:21.540> like<00:01:21.630> a

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
yeah it definitely looks like a

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.020 
yeah it definitely looks like a
