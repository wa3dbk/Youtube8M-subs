another awesome glitch and this one is

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.480 
another awesome glitch and this one is
on<00:00:08.790> strike<00:00:09.059> zone<00:00:09.330> so<00:00:10.170> let's<00:00:11.130> get<00:00:11.250> right<00:00:11.429> into

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
on strike zone so let's get right into

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.799 
on strike zone so let's get right into
it<00:00:11.700> so<00:00:11.960> you<00:00:12.960> want<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.880> have<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.910> friend<00:00:15.269> lay<00:00:15.599> down

right where my friend is Luther maniac

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.950 
right where my friend is Luther maniac
and<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:19.289> juggernaut<00:00:19.710> rate<00:00:20.070> buy<00:00:20.279> them

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.870 

then<00:00:26.960> once<00:00:27.470> they<00:00:27.710> land<00:00:27.980> you<00:00:28.340> want<00:00:28.490> to<00:00:28.580> jump<00:00:28.790> on

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
then once they land you want to jump on

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.390 
then once they land you want to jump on
them<00:00:29.030> exactly<00:00:29.330> like<00:00:29.480> stairs<00:00:29.870> oh<00:00:30.230> and<00:00:31.070> before<00:00:31.190> I

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
them exactly like stairs oh and before I

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.160 
them exactly like stairs oh and before I
go<00:00:31.760> any<00:00:31.790> further<00:00:32.150> this<00:00:32.690> has<00:00:32.960> to<00:00:33.110> be<00:00:33.260> on<00:00:33.500> the<00:00:34.190> Kem

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
go any further this has to be on the Kem

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.930 
go any further this has to be on the Kem
map<00:00:36.170> of<00:00:36.440> strike<00:00:36.770> zone<00:00:38.950> so<00:00:39.950> then<00:00:40.160> you<00:00:40.580> just<00:00:40.790> want

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
map of strike zone so then you just want

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.410 
map of strike zone so then you just want
to<00:00:41.000> jump<00:00:41.239> a<00:00:41.420> couple<00:00:41.570> times<00:00:41.930> until<00:00:42.170> you<00:00:42.890> reach<00:00:43.100> a

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
to jump a couple times until you reach a

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.160 
to jump a couple times until you reach a
higher<00:00:44.420> wedge<00:00:46.600> then<00:00:47.600> you're<00:00:47.840> gonna<00:00:47.930> walk

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
higher wedge then you're gonna walk

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.310 
higher wedge then you're gonna walk
along<00:00:48.710> this<00:00:48.830> wall<00:00:49.070> and<00:00:49.809> jump<00:00:50.809> over<00:00:50.900> this<00:00:51.140> huge

left<00:01:27.290> side<00:01:27.410> of<00:01:27.619> that<00:01:27.649> tree<00:01:28.009> do<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:28.940> same<00:01:29.150> thing

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
left side of that tree do the same thing

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.960 
left side of that tree do the same thing
with<00:01:29.479> this<00:01:29.600> tree<00:01:30.110> but<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:30.380> right<00:01:30.560> side<00:01:30.970> and

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
with this tree but the right side and

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.649 
with this tree but the right side and
you<00:01:32.060> want<00:01:32.210> to<00:01:32.270> sprint<00:01:32.510> to<00:01:32.630> this<00:01:32.750> corner<00:01:33.260> and

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
you want to sprint to this corner and

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.550 
you want to sprint to this corner and
this<00:01:35.659> is<00:01:35.810> this<00:01:36.080> is<00:01:36.229> the<00:01:36.380> plot<00:01:36.620> twist<00:01:36.920> of<00:01:37.130> it<00:01:37.250> so

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
this is this is the plot twist of it so

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.219 
this is this is the plot twist of it so
so<00:01:39.560> you<00:01:39.620> want<00:01:39.860> to<00:01:40.010> jump<00:01:41.000> into<00:01:41.210> this<00:01:41.330> wall<00:01:41.570> right

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
so you want to jump into this wall right

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.230 
so you want to jump into this wall right
about<00:01:42.950> to<00:01:43.040> do<00:01:43.130> but<00:01:43.280> this<00:01:43.400> is<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:43.670> plot<00:01:43.850> twist

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
about to do but this is the plot twist

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.990 
about to do but this is the plot twist
if<00:01:44.330> you<00:01:44.810> have<00:01:45.049> the<00:01:45.650> resilience<00:01:46.130> perf<00:01:46.670> you<00:01:46.880> will

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
if you have the resilience perf you will

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
if you have the resilience perf you will
not<00:01:47.150> die<00:01:47.600> but<00:01:48.320> you<00:01:48.890> land<00:01:49.220> in<00:01:49.549> the<00:01:49.760> non<00:01:50.030> Kem

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
not die but you land in the non Kem

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.990 
not die but you land in the non Kem
strike<00:01:51.560> zone<00:01:52.010> map<00:01:52.250> for<00:01:52.790> some<00:01:52.970> reason<00:01:54.130> so<00:01:55.130> I<00:01:55.460> was

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
strike zone map for some reason so I was

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.149 
strike zone map for some reason so I was
just<00:01:56.030> on<00:01:56.479> the<00:01:56.510> Kem<00:01:57.080> strikes<00:01:57.500> on<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:57.740> map<00:01:57.979> I

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
just on the Kem strikes on the map I

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.630 
just on the Kem strikes on the map I
just<00:01:58.400> got<00:01:58.549> out<00:01:58.729> of<00:01:58.760> that<00:01:58.909> and<00:01:59.270> now<00:01:59.840> I'm<00:02:00.140> in<00:02:00.350> this

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
just got out of that and now I'm in this

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.760 
just got out of that and now I'm in this
regular<00:02:01.640> strike<00:02:02.000> zone<00:02:02.180> map<00:02:02.390> so<00:02:03.140> that<00:02:03.170> doesn't

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
regular strike zone map so that doesn't

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.380 
regular strike zone map so that doesn't
make<00:02:03.830> any<00:02:03.979> sense<00:02:04.100> to<00:02:04.460> me<00:02:04.610> but<00:02:04.880> yeah<00:02:07.269> all<00:02:08.269> right

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
make any sense to me but yeah all right

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.570 
make any sense to me but yeah all right
so<00:02:08.540> from<00:02:08.720> here<00:02:08.959> on<00:02:09.140> I<00:02:09.649> don't<00:02:10.130> really<00:02:10.280> do<00:02:10.429> much

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
so from here on I don't really do much

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.100 
so from here on I don't really do much
but<00:02:10.759> explore<00:02:11.150> so<00:02:11.360> you<00:02:11.450> guys<00:02:11.600> can<00:02:11.750> watch<00:02:11.840> that

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
but explore so you guys can watch that

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.780 
but explore so you guys can watch that
