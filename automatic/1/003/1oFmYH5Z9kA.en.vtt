 two trucks hatched this morning the new Trofa contestation after 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.059
 coexistence in a nearby intersection of the building 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.670

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.070

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.150
 while the other one goes towards the station on the street at the end of last month 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.579
 everything the same and Bahia was one of the first people to pass the place 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.039
 Have you already heard that, love? 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.880

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.910

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.450

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.070

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.080
 the causes of the sale accident are father together by the signaling the 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.080

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.540

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.540
 crash in the station 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.140
