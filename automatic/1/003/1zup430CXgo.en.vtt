00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
in the home folder so we're gonna go

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.090 
in the home folder so we're gonna go
ahead<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.930> make<00:00:55.530> directory<00:00:56.780> home<00:00:58.100> your

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
call this one dot MC because I already

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.390 
call this one dot MC because I already
have<00:01:05.309> my<00:01:05.939> actual<00:01:06.479> minecraft<00:01:07.320> one<00:01:07.530> here<00:01:07.950> so

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
have my actual minecraft one here so

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.620 
have my actual minecraft one here so
which<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.670> dot<00:01:08.880> minecraft<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.540> can

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
which is dot minecraft so you can

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.910 
which is dot minecraft so you can
probably<00:01:09.750> put<00:01:09.930> dot<00:01:10.140> minecraft<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:10.680> probably

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
probably put dot minecraft it's probably

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.030 
probably put dot minecraft it's probably
the<00:01:11.010> easiest<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.549> want<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.909> put<00:01:12.030> MC<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:13.040> then

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
the easiest I want to put MC and then

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.649 
the easiest I want to put MC and then
we're<00:01:14.189> gonna<00:01:14.280> make<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.640> directory<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.270> then

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
we're gonna make that directory and then

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.929 
we're gonna make that directory and then
we're<00:01:15.810> going<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.020> navigate<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:17.369> that

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
we're going to navigate to that

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.140 
we're going to navigate to that
directory<00:01:18.860> so<00:01:19.860> now<00:01:20.040> we're<00:01:20.220> going<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.580> change

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
directory so now we're going to change

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.390 
directory so now we're going to change
directory<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.869> go<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.710> directory

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
directory and go in to that directory

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.630 
directory and go in to that directory
so<00:01:23.580> we're<00:01:23.729> there<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:25.350> at<00:01:25.439> this<00:01:25.619> point<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:26.130> your

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
so we're there so at this point in your

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.370 
so we're there so at this point in your
file<00:01:27.180> manager<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.689> should<00:01:27.840> see<00:01:28.049> your<00:01:28.170> hidden

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
file manager you should see your hidden

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.890 
file manager you should see your hidden
