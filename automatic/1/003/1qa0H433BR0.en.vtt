00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.990 

okay<00:00:01.170> let's<00:00:01.500> talk<00:00:01.740> about<00:00:01.800> the<00:00:02.310> edge<00:00:02.490> split

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
okay let's talk about the edge split

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.630 
okay let's talk about the edge split
modifier<00:00:03.600> I<00:00:03.810> think<00:00:04.259> that<00:00:04.529> one<00:00:04.770> is<00:00:04.980> new<00:00:05.400> to

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
modifier I think that one is new to

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.480 
modifier I think that one is new to
blender<00:00:06.120> but<00:00:06.870> I'm<00:00:06.960> not<00:00:07.109> entirely<00:00:07.470> sure<00:00:07.710> so

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
blender but I'm not entirely sure so

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.910 
blender but I'm not entirely sure so
what<00:00:08.670> you<00:00:08.790> see<00:00:08.970> here<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.780> figure<00:00:10.139> that<00:00:10.170> we

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
what you see here is the figure that we

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.509 
what you see here is the figure that we
created<00:00:11.429> in<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:12.300> subserve<00:00:12.870> part<00:00:13.830> all<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.190> did

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
created in the subserve part all I did

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.970 
created in the subserve part all I did
was<00:00:14.759> apply<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.150> subsurf<00:00:15.750> modifier<00:00:15.870> add<00:00:16.740> a

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
was apply a subsurf modifier add a

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.490 
was apply a subsurf modifier add a
subdivision<00:00:17.369> surface<00:00:18.240> modifier<00:00:18.720> or<00:00:18.900> four<00:00:19.289> and

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
subdivision surface modifier or four and

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.220 
subdivision surface modifier or four and
then<00:00:20.220> increase<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.699> crease<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.480> what

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
then increase the crease of the what

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.590 
then increase the crease of the what
used<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.619> be<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.859> base<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.250> now<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.460> top<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.480> if

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
used to be the base is now the top so if

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.589 
used to be the base is now the top so if
I<00:00:24.750> render<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.560> can<00:00:25.769> see<00:00:26.330> let's<00:00:27.330> add

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
I render this you can see let's add

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.010 
I render this you can see let's add
another<00:00:27.990> lamp<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.670> can<00:00:31.730> okay<00:00:32.730> this<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.270> still

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
another lamp so I can okay this is still

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.310 
another lamp so I can okay this is still
very<00:00:34.550> alright<00:00:35.550> alright<00:00:35.910> it's<00:00:36.149> only<00:00:36.840> rendering

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
very alright alright it's only rendering

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.979 
very alright alright it's only rendering
two<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.770> those<00:00:37.920> let's<00:00:38.250> render<00:00:38.460> four<00:00:38.930> okay<00:00:39.930> it

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
two of those let's render four okay it

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.010 
two of those let's render four okay it
looks<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.290> little<00:00:40.530> bit<00:00:40.860> better<00:00:41.070> but<00:00:41.840> you<00:00:42.840> can

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
looks a little bit better but you can

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.930 
looks a little bit better but you can
see<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.469> this<00:00:43.620> edge<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.129> behaving<00:00:44.550> very

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
see that this edge is behaving very

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.010 
see that this edge is behaving very
weird<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:46.320> should<00:00:46.739> be<00:00:47.450> if<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.570> put<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:48.870> too

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
weird it should be if I put this too

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.869 
weird it should be if I put this too
flat<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.410> should<00:00:49.649> be<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> perfect<00:00:50.340> straight

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
flat it should be a perfect straight

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.139 
flat it should be a perfect straight
edge<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:52.160> let's<00:00:53.160> actually<00:00:53.370> see<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.789> have<00:00:53.969> never

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
edge and let's actually see I have never

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.850 
edge and let's actually see I have never
used<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.690> let's<00:00:54.960> see<00:00:55.110> what<00:00:55.289> happens<00:00:55.620> if<00:00:55.739> I

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
used this let's see what happens if I

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.430 
used this let's see what happens if I
mark<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.340> sharp

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.270 

and<00:00:59.859> turn<00:01:00.160> respective<00:01:00.760> smooth<00:01:01.149> it<00:01:02.280> still

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
and turn respective smooth it still

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.950 
and turn respective smooth it still
doesn't<00:01:03.610> do<00:01:03.910> what<00:01:04.210> it's<00:01:04.360> supposed<00:01:04.449> to<00:01:04.839> it's

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
doesn't do what it's supposed to it's

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.499 
doesn't do what it's supposed to it's
still<00:01:05.080> rendering<00:01:05.770> this<00:01:06.009> weird<00:01:06.369> edge<00:01:06.759> so<00:01:07.450> I'm

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
still rendering this weird edge so I'm

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:10.789 
still rendering this weird edge so I'm
going<00:01:07.720> to<00:01:07.810> apply<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.140> subsurf<00:01:08.799> modifier<00:01:08.890> and

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
going to apply the subsurf modifier and

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.170 
going to apply the subsurf modifier and
let's<00:01:11.799> actually<00:01:13.259> try<00:01:14.259> that<00:01:14.560> again

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
let's actually try that again

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.230 
let's actually try that again
it's<00:01:16.380> still<00:01:17.380> seems<00:01:17.799> to<00:01:17.920> be<00:01:18.040> mark<00:01:18.520> sharp<00:01:18.970> so

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
it's still seems to be mark sharp so

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.440 
it's still seems to be mark sharp so
just<00:01:19.869> up<00:01:20.190> just<00:01:21.190> in<00:01:21.399> case<00:01:21.430> I'm<00:01:22.090> going<00:01:22.240> to<00:01:22.299> do

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
just up just in case I'm going to do

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.649 
just up just in case I'm going to do
that<00:01:22.600> again<00:01:22.899> oh<00:01:23.049> c'mon<00:01:23.590> ctrl<00:01:24.430> e<00:01:24.460> mark<00:01:25.330> sharp

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
that again oh c'mon ctrl e mark sharp

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.010 
that again oh c'mon ctrl e mark sharp
okay<00:01:26.399> but<00:01:27.399> it's<00:01:27.729> still<00:01:28.090> not<00:01:28.360> doing<00:01:28.600> what<00:01:28.869> it's

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
okay but it's still not doing what it's

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.399 
okay but it's still not doing what it's
supposed<00:01:29.350> to<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.880> in<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.450> old<00:01:31.659> blender<00:01:32.170> you

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
supposed to so in the old blender you

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.649 
supposed to so in the old blender you
could<00:01:32.590> just<00:01:32.830> say<00:01:33.190> if<00:01:33.460> you<00:01:33.640> said<00:01:34.030> shading<00:01:34.509> to

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
could just say if you said shading to

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.559 
could just say if you said shading to
smooth<00:01:34.990> you<00:01:35.710> could<00:01:35.950> just<00:01:36.159> say<00:01:36.490> a<00:01:36.759> limiting

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
smooth you could just say a limiting

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.590 
smooth you could just say a limiting
ankle<00:01:38.050> so<00:01:38.350> everything<00:01:38.890> above<00:01:39.340> 50<00:01:40.030> degrees<00:01:40.060> or

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
ankle so everything above 50 degrees or

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.040 
ankle so everything above 50 degrees or
something<00:01:40.990> gets<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.850> be<00:01:42.970> a<00:01:43.000> rounded<00:01:43.600> edge<00:01:43.780> and

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
something gets to be a rounded edge and

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.830 
something gets to be a rounded edge and
everything<00:01:44.380> above<00:01:44.619> 50<00:01:45.039> degrees<00:01:45.310> up<00:01:46.240> to<00:01:46.300> I

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
everything above 50 degrees up to I

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.809 
everything above 50 degrees up to I
guess<00:01:47.640> 179<00:01:48.750> will<00:01:49.750> be<00:01:49.960> a<00:01:49.990> sharp<00:01:50.530> angle<00:01:50.819> that

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
guess 179 will be a sharp angle that

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:53.910 
guess 179 will be a sharp angle that
doesn't<00:01:52.179> work<00:01:52.330> anymore<00:01:52.479> what<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:53.350> have<00:01:53.590> to<00:01:53.770> do

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
doesn't work anymore what you have to do

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.550 
doesn't work anymore what you have to do
is<00:01:54.159> add<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:55.149> edge<00:01:55.390> split<00:01:55.780> modifier<00:01:56.289> and<00:01:56.440> you

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
is add the edge split modifier and you

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.460 
is add the edge split modifier and you
can<00:01:56.710> immediately<00:01:56.920> see<00:01:57.280> this<00:01:58.149> add<00:01:58.450> this<00:01:59.170> edge

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
can immediately see this add this edge

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.980 
can immediately see this add this edge
gets<00:01:59.979> straightened<00:02:00.850> out<00:02:01.090> immediately<00:02:01.509> and

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
gets straightened out immediately and

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.080 
gets straightened out immediately and
now<00:02:02.470> you<00:02:02.530> can<00:02:02.860> see<00:02:03.039> you<00:02:03.190> have<00:02:03.220> a<00:02:03.399> nice<00:02:03.700> sharp

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
now you can see you have a nice sharp

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.710 
now you can see you have a nice sharp
edge<00:02:04.440> where<00:02:05.440> it's<00:02:06.039> supposed<00:02:06.220> to<00:02:06.520> be<00:02:06.580> again<00:02:07.509> you

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
edge where it's supposed to be again you

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.719 
edge where it's supposed to be again you
can<00:02:07.959> select<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.530> split<00:02:08.860> angle<00:02:09.280> like<00:02:09.459> in<00:02:09.610> the

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
can select the split angle like in the

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.449 
can select the split angle like in the
old<00:02:09.879> version<00:02:10.060> and<00:02:10.980> if<00:02:11.980> I

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
old version and if I

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.770 
old version and if I
let's<00:02:14.209> say<00:02:15.040> do<00:02:16.040> this<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.700> I<00:02:17.030> extrude<00:02:17.569> these

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
let's say do this and I extrude these

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.729 
let's say do this and I extrude these
out<00:02:18.019> and<00:02:18.849> I'll<00:02:20.409> move<00:02:21.409> these<00:02:21.680> down<00:02:23.590> scale<00:02:24.590> these

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
out and I'll move these down scale these

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.300 
out and I'll move these down scale these
out<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.040> little<00:02:25.189> okay<00:02:26.469> you<00:02:27.469> can<00:02:27.709> see<00:02:27.980> if<00:02:28.159> I

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
out a little okay you can see if I

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.259 
out a little okay you can see if I
increase<00:02:28.640> this<00:02:29.030> angle<00:02:29.569> you<00:02:29.810> can<00:02:30.019> see<00:02:30.290> those

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
increase this angle you can see those

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.539 
increase this angle you can see those
vanishing<00:02:32.269> so<00:02:32.750> when<00:02:33.739> crease<00:02:34.040> this<00:02:34.219> just<00:02:34.459> a

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
vanishing so when crease this just a

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.970 
vanishing so when crease this just a
little<00:02:34.790> bit<00:02:34.969> you<00:02:35.120> can<00:02:35.299> see<00:02:35.329> now<00:02:36.230> this<00:02:36.500> ankle

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
little bit you can see now this ankle

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.869 
little bit you can see now this ankle
even<00:02:37.639> though<00:02:37.819> it's<00:02:38.180> sharp<00:02:38.959> at<00:02:39.200> this<00:02:39.859> point<00:02:40.189> now

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
even though it's sharp at this point now

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.300 
even though it's sharp at this point now
this<00:02:41.150> ankle<00:02:41.629> gets<00:02:41.900> treated<00:02:42.319> as<00:02:42.620> smooth<00:02:42.920> again

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
this ankle gets treated as smooth again

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.509 
this ankle gets treated as smooth again
like<00:02:43.609> I<00:02:43.969> guess<00:02:44.389> in<00:02:44.599> this<00:02:44.780> one<00:02:44.989> it<00:02:45.260> should<00:02:45.620> be<00:02:45.769> so

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
like I guess in this one it should be so

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.159 
like I guess in this one it should be so
you<00:02:46.549> might<00:02:46.790> want<00:02:47.000> to<00:02:47.060> put<00:02:47.299> this<00:02:47.450> up<00:02:47.659> real<00:02:47.959> high

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:48.169 
you might want to put this up real high

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.699 
you might want to put this up real high
like<00:02:48.500> almost<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.459> 80<00:02:49.730> in<00:02:50.629> order<00:02:51.409> to<00:02:51.530> get

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
like almost to 80 in order to get

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.009 
like almost to 80 in order to get
realistic<00:02:51.980> results<00:02:52.639> and<00:02:52.819> yep<00:02:53.480> that's<00:02:53.780> the

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
realistic results and yep that's the

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.460 
realistic results and yep that's the
edge<00:02:54.169> split<00:02:54.590> modifier<00:02:55.159> for<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:56.079> I'm<00:02:57.079> not

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
edge split modifier for you I'm not

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.280 
edge split modifier for you I'm not
exactly<00:02:58.010> sure<00:02:58.219> with<00:02:58.639> the<00:02:58.790> sharp<00:02:59.120> edges<00:02:59.450> do

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
exactly sure with the sharp edges do

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:07.270 
exactly sure with the sharp edges do
let's<00:03:00.950> press<00:03:01.219> J<00:03:01.700> to<00:03:02.450> get<00:03:02.689> a<00:03:04.419> to<00:03:05.419> get<00:03:05.659> a<00:03:06.280> direct

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
let's press J to get a to get a direct

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.119 
let's press J to get a to get a direct
comparison<00:03:07.819> and<00:03:08.319> if<00:03:09.319> you<00:03:09.439> press<00:03:09.650> J<00:03:09.950> you<00:03:10.099> can

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
comparison and if you press J you can

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.550 
comparison and if you press J you can
toggle<00:03:10.609> through<00:03:11.000> those<00:03:11.269> slots<00:03:11.750> here<00:03:12.079> which<00:03:12.409> is

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
toggle through those slots here which is

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.629 
toggle through those slots here which is
really<00:03:12.769> great<00:03:13.129> if<00:03:13.459> you<00:03:13.730> want<00:03:14.719> to<00:03:15.310> compare<00:03:16.310> your

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
really great if you want to compare your

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.280 
really great if you want to compare your
different<00:03:17.000> render<00:03:17.299> settings<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:17.900> just<00:03:17.930> use

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
different render settings you just use

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.409 
different render settings you just use
slot<00:03:18.590> one<00:03:18.799> and<00:03:19.040> then<00:03:19.129> you<00:03:19.220> render<00:03:19.549> after<00:03:20.269> that

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
slot one and then you render after that

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:22.180 
slot one and then you render after that
you<00:03:20.599> select<00:03:20.930> an<00:03:21.019> empty<00:03:21.290> slot<00:03:21.500> render<00:03:21.859> again

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
you select an empty slot render again

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.710 
you select an empty slot render again
and<00:03:22.400> then<00:03:22.519> you<00:03:22.609> can<00:03:22.790> just<00:03:23.000> flip<00:03:23.299> through<00:03:23.569> those

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
and then you can just flip through those

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.039 
and then you can just flip through those
with<00:03:24.079> J<00:03:24.440> and<00:03:24.760> to<00:03:25.760> be<00:03:25.879> honest<00:03:26.269> I<00:03:26.449> don't<00:03:26.659> see<00:03:26.870> the

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
with J and to be honest I don't see the

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.770 
with J and to be honest I don't see the
slightest<00:03:27.620> bit<00:03:27.769> of<00:03:27.829> difference<00:03:28.209> so<00:03:29.209> I'm<00:03:29.479> sorry

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:33.379 
I do not know what sharp edges ah I'm

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.619 
I do not know what sharp edges ah I'm
sorry<00:03:33.709> I'm<00:03:33.979> sorry<00:03:34.189> there<00:03:35.000> I<00:03:35.030> should<00:03:35.540> have

sorry I'm sorry there I should have
hovered<00:03:35.989> over<00:03:36.229> this<00:03:36.379> okay<00:03:36.799> if<00:03:37.099> I<00:03:37.819> uncheck<00:03:38.299> edge

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:38.949 
hovered over this okay if I uncheck edge

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:41.690 
hovered over this okay if I uncheck edge
edge<00:03:39.949> angle

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
edge angle

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.900 
edge angle
you<00:03:42.300> can<00:03:42.569> see<00:03:42.870> that<00:03:43.260> it's<00:03:44.010> going<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.459> be<00:03:44.610> smooth

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
you can see that it's going to be smooth

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.190 
you can see that it's going to be smooth
again<00:03:45.239> but<00:03:45.720> if<00:03:46.019> I<00:03:46.640> alt<00:03:47.640> click<00:03:48.120> on<00:03:48.390> this<00:03:48.810> one<00:03:49.050> and

I<00:04:07.680> guess<00:04:08.040> you<00:04:08.220> only<00:04:08.459> need<00:04:08.790> that<00:04:09.000> in<00:04:09.180> mechanical

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
I guess you only need that in mechanical

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.350 
I guess you only need that in mechanical
modeling<00:04:10.319> where<00:04:10.950> you<00:04:11.099> have<00:04:11.400> parts<00:04:12.239> of

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
modeling where you have parts of

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.890 
modeling where you have parts of
machinery<00:04:12.840> that<00:04:13.260> you<00:04:13.760> that<00:04:14.760> have<00:04:15.330> rounded

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
machinery that you that have rounded

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.770 
machinery that you that have rounded
parts<00:04:16.290> and<00:04:16.530> sharp<00:04:16.769> parts<00:04:17.220> at<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.910> same<00:04:18.150> time<00:04:18.510> I

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
parts and sharp parts at the same time I

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.680 
parts and sharp parts at the same time I
haven't<00:04:19.769> used<00:04:20.040> it<00:04:20.220> for<00:04:20.250> anything<00:04:20.729> else<00:04:21.120> so<00:04:21.299> far

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
haven't used it for anything else so far

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.040 
haven't used it for anything else so far
but<00:04:22.729> I<00:04:23.729> don't<00:04:24.360> want<00:04:24.479> to<00:04:24.570> say<00:04:24.720> that's<00:04:24.900> a

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
but I don't want to say that's a

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.159 
but I don't want to say that's a
limitation<00:04:25.410> it's<00:04:26.160> very<00:04:26.910> necessary<00:04:27.180> modifier

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
limitation it's very necessary modifier

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.700 
limitation it's very necessary modifier
so<00:04:29.419> yeah<00:04:30.419> that's<00:04:30.720> it<00:04:30.840> about<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.200> edge<00:04:31.320> split

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
so yeah that's it about the edge split

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.570 
so yeah that's it about the edge split
stay<00:04:32.310> tuned<00:04:32.580> and<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:33.750> next<00:04:34.200> one<00:04:34.410> will<00:04:34.650> be<00:04:34.919> the

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
stay tuned and the next one will be the

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.479 
stay tuned and the next one will be the
mask<00:04:35.820> modifier
