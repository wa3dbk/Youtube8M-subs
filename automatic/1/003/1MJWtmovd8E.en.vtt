00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
think what happens at least in terms of

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.130 
think what happens at least in terms of
fitness<00:02:48.100> it's<00:02:48.550> for<00:02:49.180> myself<00:02:49.330> I<00:02:49.750> can't<00:02:49.930> speak

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
fitness it's for myself I can't speak

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.050 
fitness it's for myself I can't speak
for<00:02:50.260> myself<00:02:50.410> more<00:02:50.830> luxuries<00:02:51.340> or<00:02:51.610> what<00:02:51.880> just

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
for myself more luxuries or what just

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.550 
for myself more luxuries or what just
discourages<00:02:52.600> me<00:02:52.630> is<00:02:52.840> when<00:02:53.050> I<00:02:53.080> don't<00:02:53.260> see

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
discourages me is when I don't see

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.010 
discourages me is when I don't see

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
resolutions and I forgot it but that's

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.610 
resolutions and I forgot it but that's
the<00:03:49.840> thing<00:03:49.959> I<00:03:50.019> don't<00:03:50.380> hold<00:03:50.500> myself

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
the thing I don't hold myself

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.860 
the thing I don't hold myself
accountable<00:03:50.890> for<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.550> things<00:03:51.790> that<00:03:52.060> I<00:03:52.330> really

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
accountable for the things that I really

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.840 
accountable for the things that I really
wanted<00:03:53.170> and<00:03:53.320> I<00:03:53.380> think<00:03:53.650> that<00:03:53.830> when<00:03:54.580> you<00:03:54.700> don't

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.310 
wanted and I think that when you don't
keep<00:03:54.970> reminding<00:03:55.330> yourself<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:55.989> like<00:03:56.110> whether

keep reminding yourself and like whether

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.800 
keep reminding yourself and like whether
it's<00:03:56.470> visually<00:03:57.070> or<00:03:57.489> it<00:03:58.390> doesn't<00:03:58.660> matter

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
it's visually or it doesn't matter

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.449 
it's visually or it doesn't matter
something<00:03:59.380> that<00:03:59.560> you<00:03:59.680> want<00:03:59.890> like<00:04:00.040> you<00:04:00.190> have<00:04:00.370> to

something that you want like you have to

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.280 
something that you want like you have to
have<00:04:00.550> a<00:04:00.640> plan<00:04:00.850> and<00:04:01.180> to<00:04:01.660> tell<00:04:01.810> you<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:01.959> truth<00:04:02.140> I

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
have a plan and to tell you the truth I

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.390 
have a plan and to tell you the truth I
didn't<00:04:02.470> have<00:04:02.560> a<00:04:02.590> plan<00:04:02.800> before<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.220> bench

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
didn't have a plan before the bench

because<00:04:05.470> a<00:04:05.560> lot<00:04:05.620> of<00:04:05.800> times<00:04:06.100> I<00:04:06.220> think<00:04:06.280> people

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
because a lot of times I think people

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.510 
because a lot of times I think people
have<00:04:06.760> sizes<00:04:07.690> they're<00:04:08.350> just<00:04:08.590> wish<00:04:08.890> lists<00:04:09.310> yeah

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
have sizes they're just wish lists yeah

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.640 
have sizes they're just wish lists yeah
they're<00:04:09.910> not<00:04:10.090> really<00:04:10.150> resolutions<00:04:11.140> or<00:04:11.290> goals

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
they're not really resolutions or goals

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.100 
they're not really resolutions or goals
and<00:04:11.980> you<00:04:12.100> have<00:04:12.400> a<00:04:12.430> point<00:04:12.700> right<00:04:13.240> and<00:04:13.540> so<00:04:13.840> like

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
and you have a point right and so like

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.170 
and you have a point right and so like
that's<00:04:14.770> exactly<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.430> problem<00:04:15.580> is<00:04:15.819> just<00:04:16.030> like

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
that's exactly the problem is just like

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.360 
that's exactly the problem is just like
