for four days now even if that's not

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.670 
for four days now even if that's not
what<00:02:17.600> they<00:02:17.750> meant<00:02:17.990> I<00:02:18.080> know<00:02:18.140> rockstar<00:02:18.650> games

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.470 
give us a second chance of having snow
because<00:02:22.430> of<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.670> horrible<00:02:22.790> day<00:02:23.120> we<00:02:23.300> had

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480
