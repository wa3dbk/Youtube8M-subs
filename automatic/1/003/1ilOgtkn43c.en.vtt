00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:02.730
 Panama 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.850
 ansa 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.080
 Pine trees 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.939
 below 

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:11.549
 hello wind friends 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.250
 at this point they had already pointed out to him how to be a nation of laws like this 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:21.270
 they see that they are falling the card 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.150
 just like in chelsea 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.579
 when the lines are filled 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.269
 he 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.069
 they are automatically deleted 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:34.820
 certainly love uses it a lot inter seemed to go very well that 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.040
 Program 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.130
 well then we are going to receive new 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.130
 file is the actions that such a zero point 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.070
 and we are going to give two clicks here 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.090
 then frames per second 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.460
 but let's change the investments in height 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.260
 let's put 200 pixels and in height we leave it like this 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.560
 there will be almost 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.700
 good percent now 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.150
 I love you 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.550
 control key 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.340
 the coma 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.940
 for this is for the grid to come out 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.910
 now we do not want to sell adjustment 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.980
 will adjust grid this is so that the squares and the tab are thus 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.540
 they feared aquatic 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.150
 can we start doing the card the first thing we're going to do 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.880
 the base plate 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.280
 the l 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.290
 percent we do it with 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.600
 the rectangle tool 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.690
 and ela 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.440
 in catch really sends 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.090
 of the German national team 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.370
 the coming locti is made to believe to turn a throw on 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.610
 and we put 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.420
 movie valentine 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.360
 very easy 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.430
 per hundred flights since we have that is to say let's give 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.010
 to change the color of the bucket 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.510
 in the red good 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.510
 now we go more in the square 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.239
 na 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.199
 those selected 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:16.629
 we click on what has been done 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.029
 we have 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:21.029
 square 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.329
 then we are going to do the 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:29.839
 the study lines 

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:35.549
 set me 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.429
 exposed 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:39.709
 the trans-Andean 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.529
 we put him in it 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:45.529
 in his book 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:48.739
 in the conversation too 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.879
 vg 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.879
 I put the ine 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.390
 And finally we're going to be the sixth but we'll talk here up 

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:08.659
 nadal the central now the truck does not worry us 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.709
 the angels - the roman colo 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:16.919
 palermo 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:19.919
 that 8 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:26.279
 it was squeezed because we're going to make a new layer 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.339
 in this new stage the love selection 

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:31.479
 percent 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:34.359
 we drag the sixth 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.359
 to the time line 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.509
 the polanski area 

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:43.779
 can you let's start 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:46.159
 p now 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.409
 let's go to court 1 to name it 1 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.829
 i the work and the frame by frame 7 in the world layer 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.829
 I'm going to agree that 5 percent 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.989
 45 out there 

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:06.699
 that without counting well 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:09.699
 in the sixth in the area 

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:11.980
 i good let's start 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.980
 in love that would be the second your program 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.739
 i went down with the teachers 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:21.349
 The science 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:24.349
 We give it many times is to create anxiety anguish 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:28.050
 then it takes place 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.870
 pagadito 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.870
 then there is again going down 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.740
 that is the great love 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:40.749
 sd 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.639
 in a certain way to keep going down 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.379
 the cessation of the worker 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:49.830
 the csd 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.069
 do not 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:53.759
 sd 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.759
 mss of him 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:00.909
 in that common sense and now 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.210
 what we are going to do on tour 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.240
 in the same 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.749
 the woman who claims to be 

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:09.409
 0 more than once 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:11.189
 to the right again
