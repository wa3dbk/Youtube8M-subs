00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
but the six won't I mean both nodes are

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.810 
but the six won't I mean both nodes are
bigger<00:01:20.500> than<00:01:20.620> they<00:01:20.830> were<00:01:20.890> before<00:01:21.100> but

inches<00:01:24.340> is<00:01:24.580> the<00:01:24.610> screen<00:01:24.760> size<00:01:25.180> it<00:01:25.659> actually<00:01:25.840> is

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
inches is the screen size it actually is

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.560 
inches is the screen size it actually is
good<00:01:26.470> enough<00:01:26.650> to<00:01:26.860> use<00:01:26.979> landscape<00:01:27.490> for<00:01:27.729> 4.7

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
good enough to use landscape for 4.7

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:29.880 
good enough to use landscape for 4.7
inches<00:01:28.750> just<00:01:28.930> isn't<00:01:29.260> big<00:01:29.290> enough<00:01:29.530> to<00:01:29.770> take

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
inches just isn't big enough to take

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.039 
inches just isn't big enough to take

6<00:02:08.349> I<00:02:08.560> think<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:08.950> ex<00:02:09.099> extra<00:02:09.519> hundred<00:02:09.759> dollars

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
6 I think the ex extra hundred dollars

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.849 
6 I think the ex extra hundred dollars
is<00:02:10.239> justified<00:02:10.929> when<00:02:11.349> you're<00:02:11.499> trying<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:11.769> you

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:11.859 
is justified when you're trying to you

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:13.979 
is justified when you're trying to you
know<00:02:12.129> buy<00:02:12.400> one<00:02:12.669> of<00:02:12.700> apples<00:02:13.090> two<00:02:13.239> phones<00:02:13.510> but

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
know buy one of apples two phones but

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.050 
know buy one of apples two phones but
with<00:02:14.079> that<00:02:14.200> said<00:02:14.439> I<00:02:14.499> still<00:02:14.799> think

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
with that said I still think

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.490 
with that said I still think
android<00:02:15.360> is<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.569> better<00:02:15.840> deal<00:02:16.050> overall

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
android is the better deal overall

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.839 
android is the better deal overall
because<00:02:16.680> there's<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:16.920> lot<00:02:17.010> more<00:02:17.160> choices<00:02:17.580> to

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
because there's a lot more choices to

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.430 
because there's a lot more choices to
choose<00:02:17.910> from<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.480> do<00:02:18.810> think<00:02:19.020> there<00:02:19.230> are<00:02:19.319> some

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440
