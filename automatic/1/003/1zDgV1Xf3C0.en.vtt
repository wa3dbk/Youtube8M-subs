00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.190
 friends of the clan droid welcome today vi 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.560
 I will show the operation is 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.190
 setting the fingerprint reader 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.350
 digital of our samsung galaxy s 5 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.170
 then to set the fingerprints 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:30.220
 digital is enough to go into 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:33.010
 settings scroll and up to find 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.580
 the entry fingerprints plug up of 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:39.220
 it and select and fingerprint management 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:44.470
 if you have already registered otherwise 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:46.390
 there will be a new ok record 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.800
 the required imprint because in this 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:54.479
 case there was registered ok 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.100
 as you can see it is possible 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:59.350
 record a maximum of three fingerprints 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.510
 digital so you can't record 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.610
 more than three footprints 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.210
 ok let's go for example to change 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:11.080
 fingerprint number 3 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.970
 ok connect 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.600
 we take to eliminate fingerprint 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.770
 3 and let's add a new one 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.689
 Fingerprint 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:25.409
 since then just swipe your finger 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.409
 in this way 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.939
 just slide it from the screen up 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.770
 on the bass unlike that 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.509
 iPhone's 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.259
 no need to scroll instead 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:43.479
 hold your finger over the reader 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:47.740
 footprints ok imprint was registered 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:50.380
 I'll show you how it works 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.619
 ok we are on the unlock screen is 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.340
 just pass the back in this one 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:00.520
 way to make the device 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.049
 recognize and protect taunts come 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.079
 unlocked 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:08.140
 logically it can be unlocked with the three 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:12.360
 fingers we set up earlier 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.360
 for today, everything continues to be
