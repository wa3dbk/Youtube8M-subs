 ae 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.850

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:22.539
 the invitation today look and today I was 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:25.480
 for you three inspirational looks with 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:29.200
 pants and you have seen enough is false 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:32.200
 I speak skirts or shorts and listen on the spot. 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.110
 to inspire who uses the most on the day 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.420
 day and really people you are going to be well 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.760
 but on a daily basis I use very calm 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.680
 knowing how casual to sit and 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.140
 solve something because of chaos 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.380
 we are educated enough because 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.930
 it's more comfortable to collaborate a lot 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.730
 calm but not always the photographer I 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.940
 I can stay with the most 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.300
 Nearby is stylish or to give 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.070
 cut different model more cute 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.590

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.629
 basic looks she apologized in 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.790
 then there is a little 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.720
 more little style in the field 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.150
 so I chose three different cars 13 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.090
 Spain because of the distinct models 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.150
 little cocoa 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.840
 supports not hear of that complex 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:26.290
 the cause of this Justinho and boxing ability 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.570
 Do not know and my thunderstorm I chose the 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.310
 my night I have at night for this 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.740
 have a pity, I think but I feel 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.470
 I chose health because it is a more 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.470
 neutral with many more looks looks 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:42.430

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:45.220
 Of course, but it's the modern one in pants 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.960

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.610

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:48.769
 almost all other capri pants 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.959

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:54.200
 I thought it was super cute come 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.939
 yes, spring face, to leave the look 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.790
 a little more romantic and I opted for 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:01.129
 do a side hairstyle with your hair 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.400
 slightly wavy and became very 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:06.650
 It's pretty romantic, the shirt is 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.739
 so with prints of birds and flowers 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:15.139
 and the beautiful bag inspired by valentino 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:19.639
 super blue lovely pants with torn 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:22.219
 very delicate and the blue pump on high as well 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:24.439
 chic that makes the look look stylish 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:26.239
 so this is my first look I hope 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:28.370
 much that you have enjoyed 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.569
 remembering that gives to exchange the grasshopper by 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:35.409

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.409
 comfortable and everyday use 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:03.109

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.370
 sweep both day and night 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.590
 I loved that it's super basic to put a 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.930
 lipstick on the shirt I was tumbles 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.570
 glasses but I was made up just to 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.220
 record the same video but the look can be 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.259
 used during the day as I spoke then 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:43.789
 Can be worn with glasses I put 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:45.560

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.599
 this type of pants nothing more chic than 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.990

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.870
 matching the shirt print and the 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:05:00.080
 pants nude flyer that is very neutral and 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.030
 combines with many compositions beyond 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.020
 that she is high waist and super value 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.169
 the body is not 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.810
 the pump nude that does not actually appear 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:11.419
 in the clip and this is the second look you can 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.030
 You guys use an event at night, a party. 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:16.840
 more chic or even give to use 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.840
 daytime 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:35.250
 the look is one of the most basic of the day 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.960
 By day, however, there is a more fashionable footprint. 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.640
 so that kind of game you open 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.100
 the wardrobe and comes out taking several 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.130
 pieces and when you see that with a visual 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:47.190

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.750

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.240
