water

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:11.020 

and<00:02:02.180> if<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.960> camera<00:02:03.350> and<00:02:03.740> I<00:02:03.830> just<00:02:04.510> see<00:02:05.510> in<00:02:05.630> hair

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.150 

now<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.090> reason<00:02:12.420> why<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.570> wet<00:02:13.110> this<00:02:13.440> tray<00:02:13.920> down

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
now the reason why I wet this tray down

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.220 
now the reason why I wet this tray down
first<00:02:14.610> are<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:14.970> screen<00:02:15.270> down<00:02:15.450> first<00:02:15.750> is<00:02:16.080> so

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
first are the screen down first is so

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.930 
first are the screen down first is so
that<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.530> water<00:02:16.800> wouldn't<00:02:17.280> stick<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.820> the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
that the water wouldn't stick to the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.540 
that the water wouldn't stick to the
sides<00:02:18.180> here<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:19.230> it<00:02:19.590> just<00:02:19.770> makes<00:02:20.010> this<00:02:20.220> go<00:02:20.520> a

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
sides here so it just makes this go a

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.030 
sides here so it just makes this go a
lot<00:02:20.850> faster<00:02:21.150> here

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.619 

you<00:02:28.040> can<00:02:28.189> see<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.519> stuff<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:29.060> is<00:02:29.180> caught<00:02:29.420> in

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
you can see the stuff that is caught in

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:31.149 
you can see the stuff that is caught in
like<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.840> mill<00:02:30.019> there<00:02:30.200> so<00:02:30.379> now<00:02:30.560> with<00:02:30.739> my<00:02:30.920> hand
