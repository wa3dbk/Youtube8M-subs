00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
let me launch splendor and the next

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.890 
let me launch splendor and the next
thing<00:01:29.130> I'm<00:01:29.250> going<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.400> show<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:30.030> how<00:01:30.090> when

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
thing I'm going to show you is how when

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.450 
thing I'm going to show you is how when
you<00:01:30.990> put<00:01:31.170> objects<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.890> default<00:01:32.280> has

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
you put objects in the default has

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.660 
you put objects in the default has
changed<00:01:32.909> look<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.530> way<00:01:34.650> it's<00:01:34.770> been

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
changed look the way it's been

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.249 
changed look the way it's been
previously<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.360> when<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.570> put<00:01:36.689> an<00:01:36.780> object<00:01:36.930> in

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
previously is when you put an object in

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.580 
previously is when you put an object in
its<00:01:37.950> aligned<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.030> view<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.600> let<00:01:40.350> me<00:01:40.439> show

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
its aligned to that view and let me show

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.179 
its aligned to that view and let me show
you<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:42.210> difference<00:01:42.570> here<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:43.159> believe<00:01:44.159> that

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
you the difference here I believe that

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.450 
you the difference here I believe that
object<00:01:44.729> will<00:01:45.060> add<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> plane<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.460> everything

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
object will add a plane and everything

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.950 
object will add a plane and everything
looks<00:01:47.579> normal<00:01:47.729> right<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.420> let<00:01:48.509> me<00:01:48.540> delete<00:01:48.810> that

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
looks normal right so let me delete that

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.230 
looks normal right so let me delete that
object<00:01:49.439> look<00:01:50.369> at<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.579> from<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.790> front<00:01:50.939> view

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
object look at it from the front view

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.160 
object look at it from the front view
and<00:01:51.530> then<00:01:52.530> add<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.799> plane<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.430> notice<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.869> it

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
and then add a plane and notice that it

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.109 
and then add a plane and notice that it
didn't<00:01:55.530> come<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.369> way<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.579> might<00:01:57.000> have

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
didn't come in the way you might have

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.330 
didn't come in the way you might have
expected<00:01:57.270> from<00:01:57.770> earlier<00:01:58.770> versions<00:01:59.219> of

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
expected from earlier versions of

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.010 
expected from earlier versions of
blender<00:01:59.729> where<00:02:00.390> you're<00:02:00.540> looking<00:02:00.810> at<00:02:00.899> it

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
blender where you're looking at it

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.649 
blender where you're looking at it
straight<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.829> that's<00:02:02.520> aligned<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.450> view

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
straight on and that's aligned to view

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.570 
straight on and that's aligned to view
you'll<00:02:03.899> see<00:02:03.990> when<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.070> comes<00:02:05.340> in

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
you'll see when it comes in

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.330 
you'll see when it comes in
that<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:07.880> rotation<00:02:08.420> is<00:02:09.110> at<00:02:09.650> the<00:02:09.860> zero<00:02:10.070> zero

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
that the rotation is at the zero zero

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.600 
that the rotation is at the zero zero
point<00:02:10.670> in<00:02:11.500> previous<00:02:12.500> versions<00:02:12.680> it<00:02:13.250> would<00:02:13.520> have

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
point in previous versions it would have

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.550 
point in previous versions it would have
came<00:02:13.790> in<00:02:13.820> a<00:02:14.030> line<00:02:14.240> two<00:02:14.390> view<00:02:14.420> so<00:02:14.900> here<00:02:15.350> when<00:02:15.470> it

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
came in a line two view so here when it

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.990 
came in a line two view so here when it
came<00:02:15.740> in<00:02:15.890> it<00:02:16.070> would<00:02:16.190> have<00:02:16.280> been<00:02:16.400> at<00:02:16.550> like<00:02:16.730> 90

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
came in it would have been at like 90

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.270 
came in it would have been at like 90
degrees<00:02:17.240> and<00:02:18.110> if<00:02:18.380> you<00:02:18.470> didn't<00:02:18.710> know<00:02:18.860> that<00:02:19.130> you

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
degrees and if you didn't know that you

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.010 
degrees and if you didn't know that you
might<00:02:19.400> not<00:02:19.520> realize<00:02:19.820> that<00:02:20.300> you<00:02:20.390> already<00:02:20.660> have

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
might not realize that you already have

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.440 
might not realize that you already have
a<00:02:21.050> rotation<00:02:21.440> on<00:02:21.740> your<00:02:21.860> objects<00:02:22.340> so<00:02:22.940> here<00:02:23.360> it

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
a rotation on your objects so here it

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.960 
a rotation on your objects so here it
kind<00:02:23.660> of<00:02:23.690> makes<00:02:23.870> more<00:02:24.170> sense<00:02:24.500> but<00:02:24.710> if<00:02:24.830> you<00:02:25.010> that

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
kind of makes more sense but if you that

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.240 
kind of makes more sense but if you that
it<00:02:26.060> comes<00:02:26.240> in<00:02:26.390> at<00:02:26.480> 0-0<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:27.320> like<00:02:27.890> that<00:02:28.040> better

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
it comes in at 0-0 I like that better

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.660 
it comes in at 0-0 I like that better
but<00:02:29.060> if<00:02:29.390> you<00:02:29.540> prefer<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.380> previous<00:02:31.070> way<00:02:31.280> let's

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
but if you prefer the previous way let's

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.130 
but if you prefer the previous way let's
go<00:02:31.790> ahead<00:02:31.850> and<00:02:31.940> delete<00:02:32.150> that<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:32.600> I'll<00:02:32.990> show

I hit the spacebar add a plane and
you'll<00:02:55.070> see<00:02:55.310> that<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.550> plane<00:02:55.790> was<00:02:55.820> added<00:02:56.540> with

you'll see that the plane was added with

you<00:02:59.630> would<00:02:59.720> have<00:02:59.900> to<00:03:00.070> you<00:03:01.070> know<00:03:01.160> do<00:03:01.430> you<00:03:03.280> know

you would have to you know do you know
all<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.330> our<00:03:05.420> clear<00:03:05.870> rotation<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:07.250> you'd<00:03:07.550> be

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
all to our clear rotation and you'd be

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.310

at<00:03:42.079> this<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:42.439> render<00:03:42.859> it<00:03:44.769> let's<00:03:45.769> see<00:03:46.040> let's<00:03:46.400> go

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
at this and render it let's see let's go

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:52.360 
at this and render it let's see let's go
ahead<00:03:46.579> and<00:03:46.700> do<00:03:46.819> a<00:03:46.849> quick<00:03:47.090> render<00:03:51.159> I'm<00:03:52.159> going<00:03:52.310> to

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
ahead and do a quick render I'm going to

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.440 
ahead and do a quick render I'm going to
render<00:03:52.939> it<00:03:53.090> at<00:03:53.299> like<00:03:53.420> fifty<00:03:53.810> percent<00:03:55.329> so<00:03:56.329> it

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
render it at like fifty percent so it

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.360 
render it at like fifty percent so it
renders<00:03:56.719> quickly<00:03:57.049> I<00:03:57.260> probably<00:03:58.159> could<00:03:58.340> have

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
renders quickly I probably could have

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.979 
renders quickly I probably could have
turned<00:03:58.519> over<00:03:58.790> sampling<00:03:59.150> off

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.540 

you'll<00:04:04.989> see<00:04:05.170> something<00:04:05.410> funky<00:04:05.920> going<00:04:05.950> on<00:04:06.310> here

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
you'll see something funky going on here

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.660 
you'll see something funky going on here
with<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.879> texture<00:04:07.690> map<00:04:08.310> so<00:04:09.310> let's<00:04:09.430> close<00:04:09.640> that

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
with the texture map so let's close that

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.440 
with the texture map so let's close that
and<00:04:10.410> what's<00:04:11.410> changed<00:04:12.069> is<00:04:12.280> ok<00:04:12.849> so<00:04:12.910> right<00:04:13.209> click

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
and what's changed is ok so right click

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.550 
and what's changed is ok so right click
on<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:14.170> object<00:04:14.670> going<00:04:15.670> to<00:04:15.819> materials<00:04:16.810> go<00:04:17.470> to

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
on the object going to materials go to

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.860 
on the object going to materials go to
texture<00:04:18.160> I'm<00:04:18.940> going<00:04:19.090> to<00:04:19.150> select<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:19.510> logo

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
texture I'm going to select the logo

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.879 
texture I'm going to select the logo
because<00:04:20.109> that's<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.350> one<00:04:20.440> that's<00:04:20.560> actually

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
because that's the one that's actually

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.070 
because that's the one that's actually
having<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:21.100> problem<00:04:21.489> and<00:04:21.669> look<00:04:22.540> at<00:04:22.600> this<00:04:22.720> pre

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
having the problem and look at this pre

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.800 
having the problem and look at this pre
multiply<00:04:23.620> that<00:04:24.040> wasn't<00:04:24.340> there<00:04:24.490> before<00:04:24.720> but<00:04:25.720> it

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
multiply that wasn't there before but it

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.520 
multiply that wasn't there before but it
is<00:04:25.990> there<00:04:26.200> now<00:04:26.410> and<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:27.220> default<00:04:27.669> before<00:04:28.090> four

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
is there now and the default before four

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.120 
is there now and the default before four
objects<00:04:29.530> is<00:04:30.810> that<00:04:31.810> pre<00:04:32.020> multiply<00:04:32.440> is<00:04:32.500> on<00:04:32.800> so

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
objects is that pre multiply is on so

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:45.880 
objects is that pre multiply is on so
now<00:04:33.310> watch<00:04:33.610> when<00:04:34.419> I<00:04:34.479> give<00:04:34.630> it<00:04:34.720> a<00:04:34.750> quick<00:04:34.870> render

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.620 

there<00:04:46.890> it<00:04:47.010> looks<00:04:47.160> fine<00:04:47.340> again<00:04:47.700> so<00:04:48.180> the<00:04:48.390> three

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
there it looks fine again so the three

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.570 
there it looks fine again so the three
