00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.750
 hello youtuber os 'I am bea' house in 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.820
 this tutorial we are going to assemble a unit 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.240
 virtual to be able to hack a web network 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:19.119
 with the program 21 22 good the links are 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.400
 I leave them below in the description as 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.699
 download them install the virtual box of 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.699
 now col 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.689
 once installed we will assemble our 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.960
 virtual unit ok you have to click on 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.550
 new and wait for the window to open 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.340
 now where it says name you have to 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.400
 put 21 22 or as you want 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.020
 put your unit later in system 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.890
 operative you have to select the option 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:50.890
 linux that is up to down and in version 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.949
 we put the option hover linux and we give 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.930
 click on next in this window you have to 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:01:01.000
 write 512 mb and you already know click in next 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.250
 in the next window you have to activate 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.320
 the boot hard drive option and the 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.860
 option to create new virtual disk 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.860
 then click on next the next 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.020
 window we leave it as it is in the 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.290
 next activate reserved 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.080
 dynamically and we click on next and on 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.990
 the next window we put 4 gigas and 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.619
 we click on create and it was ready 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.619
 our unit 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.439
 once created, we right click on the 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.409
 name of the unit and then on 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.289
 configuration in the system window 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.360
 you have to disable the diskette option in 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.990
 the screen window must be changed 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.729
 the video memory at 64 megabytes in the 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.580
 Storage window must be given 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.429
 click where it says empty and then click 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.340
 on the disk then click on select 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:01.289
 Virtual disk file will open us 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.799
 the folder where we keep our 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:07.830
 file of 21 22 you just have to 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:11.069
 select file 21 22 in format 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.400
 zip as well as they got it down it's ready no 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.410
 they need to unzip now let's usb 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.750
 and there we click on the usb device 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.769
 on the right that has a + sign in 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.750
 green and we choose our wireless antenna 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:28.080
 this is very important since without that no 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.170
 our program will work ok it is already 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.910
 ready to use good now yes you have to 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.880
 click on the green arrow that says 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.990
 start as we open the window there 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.150
 to click on start baby 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.280
 will open a window for us 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.360
 wait for it to finish running 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.490
 commands this will take like 2 minutes 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.230
 then we open another window there we go to 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.020
 click on the icon that looks like a 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.910
 mamila later gives us a window in 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.980
 where he reminds us not to give him bad 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.830
 use to the program in that you have to give 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.960
 click yes then you have to activate 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.090
 our antenna I remind you that only 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.760
 it works with antennas external to our 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.470
 good equipment already selected there 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.690
 wait until the message says 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.860
 monitor mode in speak since this this 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.860
 we click on next 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.970
 good on this screen you have to activate 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.980
 ignore of item error and soul lapse in 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.709
 where it says encryption you have to put web 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.409
 in channel selected you have to activate the 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.170
 channel en scanner time is enough 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:33.290
 put 30 seconds and click on 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.030
 where it says it's good now you have to 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.010
 Wait until you finish scanning the 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.860
 networks that are close to see which one 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.840
 they want since I finish scanning us 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.629
 puts the networks on top of 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.519
 our screen I recommend you 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.569
 see on your computer the networks that 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.579
 have more signal 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.069
 once they detect one let's choose 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:55.310
 that in our program and we're going to give 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.290
 click on next ok in this screen we 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.940
 puts the name of the network that we choose and 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.590
 other data 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.530
 well here you have to change some 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.540
 parameters to succeed where 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.510
 says attacks parameters you have to put 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:11.720
 fragmentation force and attack now in 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.760
 where it says 600 pps we can leave it like this 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.699
 but it has worked very well for me 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.859
 800 pps that's all we owe 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:19.820
 change then you have to click on 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.890
 start 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.320
 will open a screen where 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.270
 we are going to see a lot of data there is already 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.580
 working the program to get the 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.980
 key of the network that we requested the 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.560
 speed is very variable this depends 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.660
 of your computers for example can 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.060
 take from 20 minutes to 2 hours 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.000
 but do not worry you can follow 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.950
 working on other good things when 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.410
 finish the program will close the window 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.240
 where I was generating data and in the 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.300
 another window at the bottom says 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.190
 that's where he will give you the key and 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.090
 it only remains that they enter it when 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.090
 connect and ready 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.620
 I suggest you write down your passwords in 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.330
 notebook or on your cell phone by 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.340
 anything 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.880
 Now we go to where our networks are 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.560
 and we look for the network that we chose in 20 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.830
 Once you click Connect demos 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.960
 will ask us for the key we write the 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.470
 key that gave us bein and ready we will be 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.750
 connected to that network 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.930
 well I'm already browsing with my network 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.630
 free you know if it worked for them or 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.000
 liked please subscribe if more 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:31.060
 forward raffle of an android tablet 4 of 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.980
 7 inches to my subscribers only 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.170
 They have to be aware of the 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.910
 later videos I'll say the mechanics to 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.910
 follow greetings
