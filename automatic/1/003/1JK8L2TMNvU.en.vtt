white garuda wizard ring yeah nothing

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.560 
white garuda wizard ring yeah nothing
too<00:00:47.219> wild<00:00:47.870> or<00:00:48.870> crazy<00:00:49.940> about<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.539> just

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
too wild or crazy about it it is just

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.459 
too wild or crazy about it it is just
simply<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:53.129> garuda<00:00:53.550> was<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.820> ring<00:00:54.149> cast<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.350> a

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
simply the garuda was a ring cast in a

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.240 
simply the garuda was a ring cast in a
clear<00:00:56.309> plastic<00:00:57.109> so<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.320> very<00:00:58.559> very<00:00:58.800> silver

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
clear plastic so it is very very silver

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.060 
clear plastic so it is very very silver
and<00:00:59.520> thus<00:00:59.940> very<00:01:00.239> very<00:01:00.480> white<00:01:00.719> i<00:01:01.050> guess<00:01:01.260> but

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
and thus very very white i guess but

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:43.550 
and thus very very white i guess but
let's<00:01:02.160> go<00:01:02.340> ahead<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.879> give<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.690> shot

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.370 

and<00:01:44.560> here<00:01:44.890> we<00:01:45.009> are<00:01:45.040> so<00:01:46.030> a<00:01:46.060> same<00:01:46.659> exact<00:01:47.080> tray

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
and here we are so a same exact tray

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.219 
and here we are so a same exact tray
same<00:01:47.710> exact<00:01:48.040> layout<00:01:48.220> same<00:01:48.610> exact<00:01:48.940> mold<00:01:49.330> as<00:01:49.750> the

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
same exact layout same exact mold as the

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.219 
same exact layout same exact mold as the
red<00:01:50.560> Garuda<00:01:50.890> just<00:01:51.220> done<00:01:51.460> in<00:01:51.700> a<00:01:51.940> white<00:01:52.899> color

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
scheme so here's an example of the

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.100 
scheme so here's an example of the
plastic<00:01:55.210> it<00:01:55.330> is<00:01:55.450> a<00:01:55.479> nice<00:01:55.869> glittery<00:01:58.110> frost

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.820 
one of my favorites it's hard to justify
paying<00:05:10.150> about<00:05:10.389> 25<00:05:10.870> bucks<00:05:11.169> for<00:05:11.349> a<00:05:11.530> toy<00:05:11.800> you

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
paying about 25 bucks for a toy you

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.010 
paying about 25 bucks for a toy you
technically<00:05:12.370> already<00:05:12.849> own<00:05:13.000> in<00:05:13.599> what's

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
technically already own in what's

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.020 
technically already own in what's
arguably<00:05:14.259> a<00:05:14.650> better<00:05:14.949> color<00:05:15.310> scheme<00:05:15.669> to<00:05:15.820> most

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
arguably a better color scheme to most

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.439 
arguably a better color scheme to most
people<00:05:16.449> so<00:05:17.259> it's<00:05:17.710> kind<00:05:17.949> of<00:05:18.009> a<00:05:18.159> hard<00:05:18.430> sell<00:05:18.789> now

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
people so it's kind of a hard sell now

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:21.420 
people so it's kind of a hard sell now
this<00:05:19.599> is<00:05:19.750> an<00:05:19.870> e<00:05:20.080> X<00:05:20.259> series<00:05:20.740> because<00:05:21.220> of<00:05:21.250> the

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
this is an e X series because of the

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.560 
this is an e X series because of the
fact<00:05:21.669> that<00:05:21.759> it's<00:05:21.970> just<00:05:22.060> a<00:05:22.270> straight-up

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
fact that it's just a straight-up

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.020 
fact that it's just a straight-up
repaint<00:05:23.139> so<00:05:23.800> it's<00:05:24.070> really<00:05:24.250> nothing<00:05:24.580> new<00:05:24.880> if

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
repaint so it's really nothing new if

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.029 
repaint so it's really nothing new if
you're<00:05:25.180> a<00:05:25.210> hardcore<00:05:25.539> plow<00:05:26.020> monster<00:05:26.500> fan<00:05:26.770> and
