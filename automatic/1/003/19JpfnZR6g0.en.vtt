00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
but obviously like they're they're all a

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.460 
but obviously like they're they're all a
lot<00:00:38.580> better<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.810> you<00:00:40.020> know<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.260> cahsee

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
lot better so that you know the cahsee

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.920 
lot better so that you know the cahsee
Anna's<00:00:40.860> are<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.220> the<00:00:41.310> 60s<00:00:41.700> rather<00:00:42.600> they're<00:00:42.840> in

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
Anna's are in the 60s rather they're in

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.400 
Anna's are in the 60s rather they're in
the<00:00:43.020> 80s<00:00:43.380> the<00:00:44.070> Jacksons<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.410> obviously

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
the 80s the Jacksons and I and obviously

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.770 
the 80s the Jacksons and I and obviously
I<00:00:46.620> think<00:00:46.800> Hobbiton<00:00:47.480> Reynolds<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.510> little<00:00:48.690> bit

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
I think Hobbiton Reynolds a little bit

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.140 
I think Hobbiton Reynolds a little bit
off<00:00:48.900> but<00:00:49.140> whatever<00:00:49.820> we're<00:00:50.820> not<00:00:50.940> going<00:00:51.090> to

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
off but whatever we're not going to

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.120 
off but whatever we're not going to
discuss<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.630> at<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.780> point<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:52.770> wanted

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
discuss that at this point I just wanted

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.979 
discuss that at this point I just wanted
to<00:00:53.160> point<00:00:53.340> out<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.940> think<00:00:54.660> another<00:00:54.780> one

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
to point out that I think another one

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.729 
to point out that I think another one
was<00:00:55.440> robo<00:00:56.310> just<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.880> show<00:00:57.090> Abby<00:00:57.739> comparison

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
was robo just to show Abby comparison

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.270 
was robo just to show Abby comparison
compared<00:00:59.040> to<00:00:59.130> what<00:00:59.280> they<00:00:59.400> originally<00:00:59.520> were<00:01:01.280> go

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
compared to what they originally were go

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.100 
compared to what they originally were go
through<00:01:02.579> George<00:01:02.910> Burgess<00:01:03.149> was<00:01:03.540> in<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.750> 60s

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
through George Burgess was in the 60s

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.510 
through George Burgess was in the 60s
beforehand<00:01:04.649> now<00:01:05.189> 75<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.830> there<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.920> go<00:01:07.950> I

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
beforehand now 75 so there you go I

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.920 
beforehand now 75 so there you go I
think<00:01:09.060> that's<00:01:09.210> that's<00:01:09.450> something<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> lot<00:01:09.900> of

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
think that's that's something a lot of

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.330 
think that's that's something a lot of
people<00:01:09.990> were<00:01:10.440> talking<00:01:10.620> about<00:01:10.830> including

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
people were talking about including

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.760 
people were talking about including
myself<00:01:11.550> and<00:01:12.290> doesn't<00:01:13.290> want<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.530> be<00:01:13.590> any

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
myself and doesn't want to be any

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.620 
myself and doesn't want to be any
updates<00:01:14.159> anywhere<00:01:14.640> else<00:01:14.820> really<00:01:15.060> had<00:01:15.390> look<00:01:15.540> at

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
updates anywhere else really had look at

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.940 
updates anywhere else really had look at
the<00:01:15.690> jerseys<00:01:16.110> they're<00:01:16.290> all<00:01:16.350> still<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.740> same

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
no sponsors not all that much of the

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.210 
no sponsors not all that much of the
exact<00:01:20.190> reason<00:01:20.340> why<00:01:20.870> no<00:01:21.870> sponsors<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:22.560> um<00:01:22.799> yeah

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
if they've got tattoos and that sort of

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:26.899 
if they've got tattoos and that sort of
stuff<00:01:25.979> because<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.250> seemed<00:01:26.400> like<00:01:26.520> such<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> big

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
stuff because it seemed like such a big

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.630 
stuff because it seemed like such a big
update<00:01:27.060> for<00:01:27.600> for<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.680> we'll<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.549> look

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
update for for that so we'll have a look

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.810 
update for for that so we'll have a look
what<00:01:30.030> else<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.570> actually<00:01:30.870> there<00:01:31.670> so<00:01:32.670> we'll

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
what else is actually there so we'll

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.320 
what else is actually there so we'll
find<00:01:33.030> out<00:01:33.240> our<00:01:33.690> own<00:01:33.930> guy<00:01:34.170> if<00:01:34.770> we<00:01:35.010> can<00:01:35.220> because<00:01:36.210> i

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
find out our own guy if we can because i

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.810 
find out our own guy if we can because i
think<00:01:36.390> i<00:01:36.750> think<00:01:36.990> i<00:01:37.229> saw<00:01:37.409> my<00:01:37.590> dude<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.010> i<00:01:38.460> made

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
think i think i saw my dude that i made

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.990 
think i think i saw my dude that i made
was<00:01:39.150> still<00:01:39.690> on<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.900> side<00:01:40.110> maybe<00:01:40.409> he's<00:01:40.590> not

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
was still on the side maybe he's not

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.910 
was still on the side maybe he's not
doesn't<00:01:42.000> look<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:42.360> he's<00:01:42.540> actually<00:01:42.690> there<00:01:42.990> so

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
doesn't look like he's actually there so

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.640 
doesn't look like he's actually there so
I'm<00:01:43.979> not<00:01:44.040> sure<00:01:44.250> what's<00:01:44.400> going<00:01:44.549> on<00:01:44.700> there<00:01:45.650> maybe

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
I'm not sure what's going on there maybe

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.410
