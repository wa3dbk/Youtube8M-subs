how good it did it we went and bought

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.170 
how good it did it we went and bought
her<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.620> larger<00:03:24.190> machine<00:03:24.340> for<00:03:24.790> certain

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
her a larger machine for certain

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.550 
her a larger machine for certain
applications<00:03:26.880> but<00:03:27.880> I<00:03:28.269> guess<00:03:28.630> horses<00:03:29.380> for

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
applications but I guess horses for

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.610 
applications but I guess horses for
courses<00:03:29.590> and<00:03:30.100> we've<00:03:30.300> we've<00:03:31.300> found<00:03:31.540> that<00:03:31.660> to

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
courses and we've we've found that to

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.500 
courses and we've we've found that to
get<00:03:32.769> closer<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.190> like<00:03:33.820> when<00:03:34.330> you're<00:03:34.420> working
