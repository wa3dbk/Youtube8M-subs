00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.740
 girls so here is today I 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:14.190
 come see you to do a little 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:17.710
 video about how I colorize may 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:24.130
 but buffering right now I'm doing my 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:25.630
 art therapy book there and I wanted 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.939
 show you how I color so 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:35.860
 you will see it's very healthy a little 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:39.510
 the culture to the so I use my 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.510
 brush with water reserves 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.270
 watercolor stadler crayons 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:59.060
 and I am everything 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:59.060
 so here we go the radius 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:10.990
 look at me I saw a technique but 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:14.420
 I admit I know I've never tried but 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.600
 I think I'll try it but not 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.600
 today 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:28.310
 today i will show you my 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:30.200
 technical to me because I saw on I 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:37.160
 went to join the bonfire on plowing 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:42.550
 one on a youtube site so here I am 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.550
 I take my pen has reserved water 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:56.560
 and in fact I come to take the color 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:03.430
 directly on my firewall 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:06.899
 and then I come to the break and after and 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.899
 I come here directly 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:18.970
 on my condition is not what I 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:24.720
 want mail and as and when 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.720
 I colorize game picks 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.780
 color 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.780
 you see 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:43.599
 it gives that then learned 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:47.470
 more or less you take the year to say 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:50.110
 to start on the pencil month you go 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:55.989
 m back so the color more 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:59.830
 intense so there suddenly I was you 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:02.220
 show taking whenever it 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.220
 It's me 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.570
 2 year 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.180
 so me that's how I do everything 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.940
 colorization and I think that's great then 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.360
 I know there is another technique that 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.200
 exist however tried but I think 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.290
 that I was hurt 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:33.180
 it is to color from close in 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:43.200
 1800 conso all the board on France O 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:45.709
 and so here must have happened to him 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.709
 no 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.260
 so here you go 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.450
 gold 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.180
 here 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.370
 so here 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:09.909
 I do them with several times in 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.909
 taking gold as you go 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:19.930
 here so here on the right I do them with 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:24.820
 novel a little bit of bread a little bit 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:28.690
 in and right and left rather I 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.890
 do with each time practically 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.050
 by taking two years 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:35.800
 so that's so it really is a 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:42.400
 test meaning not i find so i'm going 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:43.720
 to show you another color but me 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.990
 I know that I like her 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.970
 technique there so there is another 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.290
 technical as well that exist so I 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.510
 believe it was you until he 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:05:00.660
 had presented yes it's a sum 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:05:03.090
 poured mouth case is coloring 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:09.410
 directly 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:13.020
 the paper and after he must come 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:16.639
 blurred with the face to the disavowal of water or 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.639
 an ordinary brush 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:23.300
 I advise you if you ever have to 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:27.290
 bring a watercolor pencil to you 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.870
 after other crimes that do everything to 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.660
 done to the years between 10 drags everything 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.750
 that can be done in ways that these 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.160
 watercolors and ben I find it 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.370
 really good to take a brush to 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.770
 water 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:43.720
 because just like that it's him 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:45.800
 who automatically distributes the water and 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.639
 and then it's a lot better because at 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:51.889
 when everywhere it's handy 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:55.960
 so here I am the middle of the 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.960
 flower is here 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.250
 and it's true that I think it's great 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:10.560
 super nice so there as I go 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:14.920
 turn the page hop I'm just 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:19.050
 remove the excess finally a few matches 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.050
 on my page and so it's possible 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:26.140
 so this one is good it is 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.140
 same I used the same technique 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:34.610
 pretty butterflies and I love it I love 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:38.150
 really this notebook will be missing and by 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:42.520
 race I thought that since it's 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:45.380
 paper not treated I thought that series 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:48.140
 okra the mails between is it does it 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:50.390
 slightly but not much and 

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.740
 then at the other day of the blow so much to do 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:54.710
 outings in colonization 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:07:00.050
 I had fun doing a little me to 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:04.880
 so you always like it by using the 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:10.630
 pencil watercolor technique 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:10.630
 tunable and brush water supplies 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:18.050
 so that's how it was 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:20.510
 realized my colonization they were 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.590
 several to my English that made a 

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:24.800
 moment I wanted to do this 

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:28.430
 video that I have the same time so suddenly 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.060
 I said to myself go here it is laughing 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.870
 still 

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:35.090
 so here I did this video for 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.550
 to show you how I colorise and I 

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.050
 will try the technique and red case 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:41.300
 and at that moment there 

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:43.340
 I will tell you what I thought you 

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.319
 do not hesitate to do it because it is 

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:47.750
 true it's even my technique I 

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:52.240
 think it's really great 

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:56.770
 downright better I find at level 2 

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:58.210
 of colonization it's my guy here 

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.660
 I make you kisses then I tell you 

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.349
 see you soon 

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.349
 in vain
