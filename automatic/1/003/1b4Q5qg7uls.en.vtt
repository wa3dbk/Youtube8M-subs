pieces<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.420> inside<00:01:42.630> pieces<00:01:42.990> they<00:01:43.200> look<00:01:43.560> like

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
pieces the inside pieces they look like

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.380 
pieces the inside pieces they look like
they're<00:01:43.950> from<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.220> cheap<00:01:44.430> cube<00:01:44.729> if<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.000> look<00:01:45.270> at

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
they're from a cheap cube if you look at

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.760 
they're from a cheap cube if you look at
them<00:01:45.479> at<00:01:45.600> first<00:01:45.720> glance<00:01:45.960> but<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.380> quality<00:01:46.590> is

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
them at first glance but the quality is

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.069 
them at first glance but the quality is
actually<00:01:47.159> surprisingly<00:01:47.490> good<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.930> is

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
actually surprisingly good it is

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.139 
actually surprisingly good it is
extremely<00:01:49.500> smooth<00:01:50.009> it's<00:01:50.490> got<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> very<00:01:50.880> durable

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
extremely smooth it's got a very durable

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.069 
extremely smooth it's got a very durable
cord<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.659> cord<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.649> have<00:01:52.799> screwed<00:01:53.040> spring

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
cord the cord is have screwed spring

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.819 
cord the cord is have screwed spring
your<00:01:55.079> spring<00:01:55.290> structure<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:57.530> hey<00:01:58.530> go<00:01:58.710> get

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
your spring structure and hey go get

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.940 
your spring structure and hey go get
some<00:01:59.009> light<00:01:59.219> on<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.399> right<00:01:59.640> there<00:01:59.899> and<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.560> is

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
some light on it right there and it is

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.649 
some light on it right there and it is
very<00:02:02.130> good<00:02:02.549> quality<00:02:02.880> it's<00:02:03.180> kind<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.450> hard<00:02:03.630> to

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
very good quality it's kind of hard to

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.910 
very good quality it's kind of hard to
get<00:02:03.810> some<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.110> pieces<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.590> though<00:02:04.740> because

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
get some of the pieces in though because

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.800 
get some of the pieces in though because
like<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.520> can<00:02:05.700> see<00:02:05.880> that's<00:02:06.240> how<00:02:06.329> big<00:02:06.600> the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
like you can see that's how big the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.380 
like you can see that's how big the
opening<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.799> so<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.369> gotta<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.819> have<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.090> jam

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
opening is so you gotta you have to jam

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.480 
opening is so you gotta you have to jam
it<00:02:09.539> in<00:02:09.660> there

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
it in there

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.000 
it in there
you<00:02:10.550> know<00:02:10.610> I'm<00:02:10.760> talking<00:02:11.090> about<00:02:11.300> hey<00:02:14.470> but<00:02:15.470> the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
you know I'm talking about hey but the

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.890 
you know I'm talking about hey but the
quality<00:02:16.190> is<00:02:16.340> very<00:02:16.400> good<00:02:16.580> I'm<00:02:17.150> one<00:02:17.420> thing<00:02:17.600> I<00:02:17.690> did

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
quality is very good I'm one thing I did

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.600 
quality is very good I'm one thing I did
notice<00:02:17.930> about<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:18.530> edge<00:02:18.680> pieces<00:02:18.980> is<00:02:19.400> that

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
notice about the edge pieces is that

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.420 
notice about the edge pieces is that
this<00:02:19.760> edge<00:02:19.970> piece<00:02:20.420> actually<00:02:21.230> has<00:02:21.740> a<00:02:21.770> cap<00:02:22.160> on<00:02:22.370> it

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
this edge piece actually has a cap on it

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.730 
this edge piece actually has a cap on it
this<00:02:23.240> is<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.540> main<00:02:23.750> piece<00:02:24.020> right<00:02:24.230> here<00:02:24.260> and

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
this is the main piece right here and

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.590 
this is the main piece right here and
this<00:02:25.130> flat<00:02:25.490> part<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:25.820> actually<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:26.150> cat<00:02:26.390> that

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
this flat part is actually a cat that

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.750 
this flat part is actually a cat that
pops<00:02:26.840> all<00:02:27.050> in<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.320> off<00:02:27.520> unfortunately<00:02:28.520> it

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
pops all in and off unfortunately it

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.090 
pops all in and off unfortunately it
pops<00:02:29.120> off<00:02:29.330> more<00:02:29.870> than<00:02:29.990> it<00:02:30.050> pops<00:02:30.350> on<00:02:30.560> if<00:02:30.830> you<00:02:30.950> get

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
pops off more than it pops on if you get

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.100 
pops off more than it pops on if you get
what<00:02:31.190> I'm<00:02:31.250> saying<00:02:31.570> you<00:02:32.570> have<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:32.750> glue<00:02:33.020> them

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
what I'm saying you have to glue them

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.720 
what I'm saying you have to glue them
down<00:02:33.170> which<00:02:33.590> is<00:02:33.740> really<00:02:34.130> easy<00:02:34.340> actually

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
down which is really easy actually

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.750 
down which is really easy actually
because<00:02:35.300> there's<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.600> flat<00:02:35.900> surface<00:02:36.170> on<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.460> on

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
because there's a flat surface on the on

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.340 
because there's a flat surface on the on
the<00:02:37.910> shell<00:02:38.270> of<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.480> piece<00:02:38.840> which<00:02:39.050> is<00:02:39.080> this

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
the shell of the piece which is this

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.260 
the shell of the piece which is this
part<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.490> can<00:02:40.640> just<00:02:40.760> put<00:02:40.910> some<00:02:41.090> glue<00:02:41.240> on

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
part and you can just put some glue on

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.230 
part and you can just put some glue on
that<00:02:41.830> take<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:42.950> cap<00:02:43.160> smack<00:02:43.580> it<00:02:43.760> on<00:02:43.820> there<00:02:44.060> and

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
that take the cap smack it on there and

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.880 
that take the cap smack it on there and
it'll<00:02:44.360> glue<00:02:44.570> perfectly<00:02:45.140> I<00:02:45.170> mean<00:02:45.470> you're

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
it'll glue perfectly I mean you're

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.800 
it'll glue perfectly I mean you're
there's<00:02:46.280> no<00:02:46.400> awkward<00:02:46.880> gluing<00:02:47.300> to<00:02:47.450> it<00:02:47.570> I<00:02:47.660> mean

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
there's no awkward gluing to it I mean

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.390 
there's no awkward gluing to it I mean
it's<00:02:48.020> really<00:02:48.410> straightforward<00:02:48.770> you<00:02:49.160> just

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
it's really straightforward you just

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.000 
it's really straightforward you just
glue<00:02:50.210> it<00:02:50.240> on<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.660> side<00:02:51.410> that<00:02:51.440> it<00:02:51.710> sticks<00:02:51.920> to

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
glue it on the side that it sticks to

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.890 
glue it on the side that it sticks to
you<00:02:52.280> just<00:02:52.490> put<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.730> cap<00:02:52.880> on<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:53.210> that<00:02:53.630> solves

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
you just put the cap on and that solves

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.360 
you just put the cap on and that solves
your<00:02:53.960> problem<00:02:54.320> and<00:02:54.500> there's<00:02:54.890> only<00:02:55.010> four<00:02:55.340> of

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
your problem and there's only four of

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.760 
your problem and there's only four of
them<00:02:55.580> you<00:02:55.790> know<00:02:55.880> one<00:02:56.120> two<00:02:56.360> three<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:57.050> four<00:02:57.320> so

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
them you know one two three and four so

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.710 
them you know one two three and four so
I<00:02:57.800> mean<00:02:58.100> you<00:02:58.640> only<00:02:58.760> have<00:02:58.910> to<00:02:59.030> do<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.510> glowing

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
I mean you only have to do the glowing

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.070 
I mean you only have to do the glowing
like<00:03:00.140> four<00:03:00.380> times<00:03:00.550> um<00:03:01.550> all<00:03:02.000> these<00:03:02.270> pieces<00:03:02.540> like

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
like four times um all these pieces like

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.630 
like four times um all these pieces like
for<00:03:03.410> example<00:03:03.500> these<00:03:03.800> pieces<00:03:04.040> they<00:03:04.280> have<00:03:04.400> caps

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
for example these pieces they have caps

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.660 
for example these pieces they have caps
on<00:03:04.850> them<00:03:05.500> but<00:03:06.500> I<00:03:06.710> haven't<00:03:07.250> really<00:03:07.580> had

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
on them but I haven't really had

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.700 
on them but I haven't really had
problems<00:03:08.060> with<00:03:08.180> any<00:03:08.360> of<00:03:08.450> them<00:03:08.600> they've<00:03:09.560> been

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
problems with any of them they've been

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.530 
problems with any of them they've been
working<00:03:10.070> pretty<00:03:10.220> well<00:03:10.340> on<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:11.150> center<00:03:11.360> caps

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
working pretty well on the center caps

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.590 
working pretty well on the center caps
oh<00:03:12.730> yeah<00:03:13.730> so<00:03:13.970> let's<00:03:14.120> talk<00:03:14.180> about<00:03:14.300> us<00:03:14.420> talking

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
oh yeah so let's talk about us talking

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.390 
oh yeah so let's talk about us talking
about<00:03:14.630> these<00:03:14.840> sorry<00:03:15.440> not<00:03:15.590> these<00:03:15.770> these<00:03:16.340> are

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
about these sorry not these these are

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.040 
about these sorry not these these are
solid<00:03:16.700> pieces<00:03:16.910> these<00:03:17.120> have<00:03:17.420> center<00:03:17.630> caps<00:03:17.690> and

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
solid pieces these have center caps and

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.040 
solid pieces these have center caps and
of<00:03:18.710> course<00:03:18.890> these<00:03:19.070> do<00:03:19.280> also<00:03:19.490> but<00:03:19.760> they're<00:03:20.330> not

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
of course these do also but they're not
