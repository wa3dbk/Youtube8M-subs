00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.840
 I made a person with iphone 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.840
 ni 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:15.240
 The world of worms soft worms really 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:20.099
 I'm coming out thoughtless words such as various playback 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.730
 Of course the idea when it was put out in each one size 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.060
 Already 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:29.180
 For use 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:35.989
 The place and how to use were clear, but such a style is going to be 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:38.750
 When it comes down, it disappears and it has been repeated again even though it was born 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:43.050
 After all, it is unfailingly unfailingly unfailingly unfailingly unfailingly unrecognizable 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:47.840
 It seems that there is a strong type that doesn't change much about it 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:52.400
 It comes out of similar types from various manufacturers 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:57.110
 It's mighty mighty bubble of this form that has come out from the mountains 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:00.680
 313.75 Kana 3.754 points 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:06.020
 There are three sizes to say 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.650
 It already has a usage of the size of the nedo to use properly 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.450
 For example 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.170
 A Among the hard rice station to attack in the soft rice station aimed at Dekabasu 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.900
 blame 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:21.590
 Sometimes referred to as the cover beating the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:23.190
 From 1 of the other turbidity When was I there is another of water displacement is large large river 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.909
 When taking a picture 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.900
 The caves and caves 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:34.390
 On the contrary, artificial lake 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:38.430
 While wearing a child target of about 1 / 8oz to the jig head itself of the round head 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.860
 Drop it and it is a spinning tackle 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.200
 For example 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.659
 With that p 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:50.270
 If you say to propose when you say Tsuru , this production area is 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:54.440
 It's very easy to use 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.110
 What can be said in common is the time of evolution and life 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.850
 Tap acer 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.230
 I 'm changing the great and increasing the speed makes the displacement extremely big 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.110
 And can 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:10.720
 The reason is where you can but I was scissors to that this pincher 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.640
 It has made very thick 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.990
 One trick when choosing a worm is 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.130
 Thin tail 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.760
 Thick thin wie 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:25.090
 Pin chart is this kind of scissors how 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:28.209
 It moves well in response to the c flow even with a slight movement 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.890
 But it works well 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.280
 Pincher itself itself 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:40.040
 A force that displaces the water I'm very weak 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:45.060
 This in a bath which is been cut a little carried out Briefly Saran wrap in the kitchen 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:50.700
 It's running movement passenger white Hidahida of only a few of the water I thought 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:52.349
 However , I can feel the water moving by putting my hand on the swinging up motion 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.170
 I can not feel it 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:03:03.050
 If anything , water is only moving further 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:06.900
 However, when you are spreading out in the same 3 o'clock, it's just right and you move it like this 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:12.470
 I will me moved here in the water is properly 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:16.970
 I do not pushed things a certain thing and does not move water of the volume when using the water 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:21.130
 So make this worm thick 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.600
 The paddle is also structured to push water firmly 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.620
 that is 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:31.790
 Starting from a pincher, this leg is also made that way 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:36.590
 This foot is like that and when it sinks in this way , the foot 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:39.280
 One by one when you go in motion limp hairpin char Datte Belo to limp 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.800
 It's come displaced bought Gachanto water 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.880
 It is a fish in the obstacle 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:49.950
 You can tell me that you are moving and saying 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.950
 The problem is just as I said 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:58.790
 If it is Saran lap, it moves with only a slight speed change 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.390
 If it's just thick, it won't move easily 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.569
 So move it firmly 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.700
 Each bike can be used in a low transparency basket 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.440
 If you go fishing wear 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.010
 Upper and heavy 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:18.440
 The sinking speed will go up by making it heavy and above 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:23.510
 Increasing the evolution speed pinchers whether leg of the movement has become very well 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:25.630
 Then of course it tells us to push the water away and let the fish pass by now 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:29.620
 is not it 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:35.050
 Then the fish will pass the water movement password 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:36.350
 Come in from the sidelines and feel it when it responds to it Dawn and thanks bites 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.800
 It is hard to 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:43.080
 That 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:44.900
 Water is so good in feeling let not such a slowly Oh speed say fell without moving Te apparatus 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:50.620
 If you 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:58.390
 Fish Well or broke off without stick cares as long as not high activity 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:05:03.449
 It is one of the next measures of the vertical type that speed is increased only when activity is not good 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:09.470
 When every time you use especially this kind of lure even do not say that it hear 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:11.720
 It is one of the response methods when it is not possible to catch it to raise the sinking speed too 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.040
 Please try once 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.940
 At the same does this Ru 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:24.540
 What Naito's this I flipping Toka pitching of like a kind of cover 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:26.460
 And Tsu Is dedicated lure of you do is different, but in fact at all there are many people who seem to say on this form 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:32.200
 I ride cat Te is 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:37.030
 We use 5/4 this and 3.75 We use small child Chantengo This size 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:41.630
 Though I I this size do Te 331 but can be used even in this little bitty guy 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:45.050
 I also often use the Texas rig by casting 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:49.289
 In moderate weight because Texas rig 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:52.230
 Through Cass Tsu grunt and to do so even now response 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:54.320
 You can feel that you shake your hands hard 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:59.450
 I am from there 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:03.440
 Cho little lift If you sometimes use a type become something normal Noripon tail 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:05.120
 Help down to the mat north and trying to wait a little lift Chung I Chong Chong 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:09.650
 I will pull it and drop it again 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:14.840
 Us to take in the near text Roko short short 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:17.050
 If you do something like ribbon tail by doing so, you can visually make the movement of the tail 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:22.180
 I Tona that can show 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:25.710
 However, I'm talking a little bit earlier, but I have to increase my speed 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:29.730
 So the pincher is not pressed, the water moving 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:33.409
 Even if I do it in the short stoke, the effect is not so big. 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:37.120
 So conversely I when using this lure 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:40.420
 I do a patcher shop for a long stroke 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:45.670
 Pull it and drop it while winding the reel 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:51.550
 I 'm saying that Gyeonggi from there and I'm pulling the floor down. 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:54.830
 At once from one place to hit doing this this worm is there, for example, by doing so 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:58.820
 So when you call ba yo 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.780
 The lateral line is not only It is good to put out a pulse that Ikuyo moving visual 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.880
 bring the action 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.770
 It is because it is moving 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:08.750
 I think it is a teaching 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:11.900
 It is to say when the stop I Ston from there also and fluttering fluttering head down 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:16.699
 I think fish has been moving for some time 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:22.340
 Say in the mood to be Tteyuu What happened can eat if now and start facing the over there 

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:25.650
 It is made to strike a point of I say when this worm began to sink clogged 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:30.670
 Fish that can be caught increases one plus 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:33.240
 Strike is not something to wait vaguely, but to create an image by yourself 

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:35.310
 This is important 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:41.460
 This worm 

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:44.289
 Mighty Love such a thing and go with the image of a fun when you use the following 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:47.219
 I think that more fishing results will go up 

00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:47.219
 Please do your best
