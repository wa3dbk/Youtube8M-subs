00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.810 
that stuff that what you're saying was a

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.930 
that stuff that what you're saying was a
fear-based<00:00:49.290> cloud<00:00:49.920> over<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.370> text<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.850> you

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
fear-based cloud over the text and you

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.790 
fear-based cloud over the text and you
can't<00:00:51.210> even<00:00:51.510> see<00:00:51.780> what's<00:00:52.050> happening<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.560> scene
