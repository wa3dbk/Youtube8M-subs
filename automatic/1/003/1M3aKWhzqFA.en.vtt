00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
what it is you're just taking these

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.380 
what it is you're just taking these
three<00:00:16.320> fingers<00:00:16.529> pointer<00:00:17.039> middle<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.369> ring<00:00:17.580> on

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
three fingers pointer middle and ring on

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.760 
three fingers pointer middle and ring on
each<00:00:18.630> finger<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.170> you're<00:00:19.260> putting<00:00:19.470> them<00:00:19.650> in

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
each finger and you're putting them in

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.859 
each finger and you're putting them in
chromatic<00:00:20.310> positions<00:00:23.359> and<00:00:24.359> then<00:00:24.720> you're

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
chromatic positions and then you're

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.920 
chromatic positions and then you're
tapping<00:00:25.430> with<00:00:26.430> your<00:00:26.670> finger<00:00:27.060> closest<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.840> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
tapping with your finger closest to the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.269 
tapping with your finger closest to the
pickup<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.470> pulling<00:00:28.830> off<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.010> the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
pickup and pulling off to the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.009 
pickup and pulling off to the
corresponding<00:00:29.970> finger<00:00:30.269> so<00:00:30.420> your<00:00:30.570> ring<00:00:30.750> finger

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
corresponding finger so your ring finger

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.580 
corresponding finger so your ring finger
would<00:00:31.170> be<00:00:31.260> first<00:00:31.669> then<00:00:32.669> your<00:00:32.850> middle<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.590> your

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
would be first then your middle and your

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.660 
would be first then your middle and your
pointer

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.790 

and<00:00:40.149> you<00:00:40.750> can<00:00:40.899> do<00:00:41.020> it<00:00:41.050> at<00:00:41.200> any<00:00:41.290> position

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
and you can do it at any position

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.709 
and you can do it at any position
because<00:00:41.950> it's<00:00:42.070> all<00:00:42.190> chromatic

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.299 

we<00:00:47.410> can<00:00:47.530> do<00:00:47.620> it<00:00:47.649> anywhere<00:00:48.010> because<00:00:48.100> it's

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
we can do it anywhere because it's

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.400 
we can do it anywhere because it's
chromatic<00:00:48.789> and<00:00:48.910> what<00:00:49.719> you<00:00:49.840> do<00:00:49.989> just<00:00:50.260> pick<00:00:50.379> a

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
chromatic and what you do just pick a

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.689 
chromatic and what you do just pick a
position<00:00:51.010> I<00:00:51.250> would<00:00:51.370> suggest<00:00:51.760> 10<00:00:52.329> 11<00:00:52.719> 12<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:54.190> 15

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
position I would suggest 10 11 12 and 15

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:00.450 
position I would suggest 10 11 12 and 15
16<00:00:55.539> 17<00:00:55.570> and<00:00:56.879> just<00:00:57.879> do<00:00:58.030> that<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:59.460> corresponding

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
16 17 and just do that the corresponding

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:07.060 
16 17 and just do that the corresponding
finger<00:01:00.730> tapping<00:01:00.969> going<00:01:01.390> down

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.190 

and<00:01:07.610> once<00:01:08.000> you<00:01:08.090> have<00:01:08.270> it<00:01:08.300> up<00:01:08.510> to<00:01:08.540> a<00:01:08.690> speed<00:01:09.020> where

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
and once you have it up to a speed where

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:31.320 
and once you have it up to a speed where
you<00:01:09.350> like<00:01:09.500> it<00:01:09.680> just<00:01:09.920> move<00:01:10.100> it<00:01:10.250> up<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.490> strings

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.110 

and<00:01:32.330> quite<00:01:33.110> clean<00:01:33.500> not<00:01:34.250> sloppy<00:01:34.700> like<00:01:34.910> I'm

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
move that all over the neck there are

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.530 
move that all over the neck there are
when<00:01:43.040> the<00:01:43.160> two<00:01:43.310> tip<00:01:43.580> finger<00:01:43.910> tapping<00:01:44.150> in<00:01:44.450> the

you deal with hammer-ons and you just do

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:12.809 
you deal with hammer-ons and you just do
it<00:03:05.440> over<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:05.800> over<00:03:05.890> again<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:12.310> once<00:03:12.580> you<00:03:12.670> have

the riff in jails a pair of dowels
excuse<00:03:23.920> me<00:03:24.100> where<00:03:24.340> it's<00:03:24.459> a<00:03:40.950> when<00:03:41.950> I<00:03:42.070> was<00:03:42.160> just

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
excuse me where it's a when I was just

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:50.220 
excuse me where it's a when I was just
sliding<00:03:42.730> up<00:03:42.820> to<00:03:42.850> 18<00:03:48.660> even<00:03:49.660> I<00:03:49.810> need<00:03:49.900> a<00:03:50.019> little

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
sliding up to 18 even I need a little

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.800 
sliding up to 18 even I need a little
work<00:03:50.709> on<00:03:50.980> everything<00:03:51.459> it's<00:03:52.030> hard<00:03:52.090> stuff

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
work on everything it's hard stuff

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.809 
work on everything it's hard stuff
it's<00:03:53.019> Buckethead<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:54.790> then<00:03:55.030> I<00:03:56.670> don't<00:03:57.670> think

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
it's Buckethead and then I don't think

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.460 
it's Buckethead and then I don't think
Buckhead<00:03:58.150> does<00:03:58.390> this<00:03:58.630> but<00:03:58.840> it<00:03:58.930> sounds<00:03:59.290> Bach

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
Buckhead does this but it sounds Bach

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.490 
Buckhead does this but it sounds Bach
ahead<00:03:59.800> it's<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.250> same<00:04:00.660> pattern

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
ahead it's the same pattern

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.740 
ahead it's the same pattern
with<00:04:02.890> the<00:04:03.100> two<00:04:03.640> frets<00:04:03.940> in<00:04:04.090> between<00:04:04.420> but<00:04:04.600> we're

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
with the two frets in between but we're

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.809 
with the two frets in between but we're
moving<00:04:05.019> it<00:04:05.110> up<00:04:05.200> to<00:04:05.350> twelve<00:04:05.650> fifteen<00:04:06.579> eighteen

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.179 

we<00:04:09.599> start<00:04:09.870> on<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.049> bottom<00:04:10.260> string<00:04:10.769> or<00:04:10.920> just

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:11.189 
we start on the bottom string or just

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:22.589 
we start on the bottom string or just
hammering<00:04:11.730> on<00:04:12.469> then<00:04:13.469> going<00:04:13.769> up

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:25.450 

and<00:04:23.599> you're<00:04:23.930> just<00:04:24.020> going<00:04:24.229> off<00:04:24.500> and<00:04:24.800> I'm<00:04:24.919> dropsy

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
and you're just going off and I'm dropsy

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.189 
and you're just going off and I'm dropsy
so<00:04:25.759> if<00:04:25.910> I'm<00:04:26.060> not<00:04:26.330> tuned<00:04:26.569> to<00:04:26.750> what<00:04:26.870> you're<00:04:27.020> tuned

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
so if I'm not tuned to what you're tuned

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:40.670 
so if I'm not tuned to what you're tuned
in<00:04:27.410> that's<00:04:27.590> what

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.980 

that's<00:04:41.680> hard<00:04:41.890> to--<00:04:42.390> so<00:04:43.390> uh<00:04:43.420> I<00:04:44.220> guess<00:04:45.990> that's

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
that's hard to-- so uh I guess that's

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.680 
that's hard to-- so uh I guess that's
just<00:04:47.410> some

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.590 

look<00:04:52.260> at<00:04:52.410> his<00:04:52.530> stuff<00:04:52.740> to<00:04:52.860> work<00:04:53.010> on<00:04:53.600> whoops

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
look at his stuff to work on whoops

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.140 
look at his stuff to work on whoops
there<00:04:54.930> you<00:04:55.020> go
