had to do anything special or anything

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.329 
had to do anything special or anything
this<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.359> just<00:01:03.480> joining<00:01:04.110> into<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.619> game<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.250> you

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
this is just joining into a game so you

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.570 
this is just joining into a game so you
need<00:01:05.519> two<00:01:05.670> controllers<00:01:06.119> that's<00:01:06.450> all<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.720> need

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
need two controllers that's all you need

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.609 
need two controllers that's all you need
so<00:01:08.580> if<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.790> bring<00:01:08.970> player<00:01:09.240> 2<00:01:09.450> over<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.409> bear<00:01:10.590> in

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
so if I bring player 2 over but bear in

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.670 
so if I bring player 2 over but bear in
mind<00:01:10.909> wherever<00:01:11.909> whoever<00:01:12.780> opens<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.590> will

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
mind wherever whoever opens it it will

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.070 
mind wherever whoever opens it it will
be<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.640> level<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.299> guns<00:01:15.509> will<00:01:15.689> be<00:01:15.810> scaled

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
be the level of the guns will be scaled

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.830 
be the level of the guns will be scaled
to<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:17.310> character<00:01:19.640> so<00:01:20.640> we<00:01:20.970> just<00:01:21.150> go<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.450> yes

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
to that character so we just go to yes

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:30.399 
to that character so we just go to yes
and<00:01:24.860> that's<00:01:25.860> what<00:01:26.100> we<00:01:26.220> get<00:01:26.369> inside<00:01:28.520> level<00:01:29.520> 34

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
and that's what we get inside level 34

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.990 
and that's what we get inside level 34
because<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.829> character<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.310> opened<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.790> was

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
because the character that opened it was

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.350 
because the character that opened it was
level<00:01:33.180> 4<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.259> if<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.500> want<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.979> get<00:01:35.360> some
