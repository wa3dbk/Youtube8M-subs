00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
and then my switch is right here it's

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.789 
and then my switch is right here it's
not<00:01:47.250> really<00:01:47.549> attached<00:01:47.939> anything<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:49.049> was<00:01:49.350> but

you can see it's got a set on off and

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.710 
you can see it's got a set on off and
then<00:01:56.789> that<00:01:57.329> yellow<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.959> combined<00:01:58.579> so<00:01:59.579> on<00:02:00.239> means

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
then that yellow is combined so on means

the starter battery runs the starter the

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.830 
the starter battery runs the starter the
house<00:02:04.829> battery<00:02:05.310> runs<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.759> lights<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
stereo and the DC accessory plug and

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.039 
stereo and the DC accessory plug and
then<00:02:13.670> they're<00:02:14.670> separate<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.329> then<00:02:15.900> this

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
then they're separate and then this

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.140 
then they're separate and then this
additional<00:02:16.739> device<00:02:17.099> which<00:02:17.489> is<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.819> little<00:02:18.000> hard

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
additional device which is a little hard

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:26.300 
additional device which is a little hard
to<00:02:18.239> see<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:25.230> thing<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.560> makes<00:02:25.829> it<00:02:25.950> all<00:02:26.040> work

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
to see the thing that makes it all work

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.030 
to see the thing that makes it all work
is<00:02:26.489> that<00:02:26.579> little<00:02:26.790> box<00:02:27.030> right<00:02:27.390> there<00:02:27.859> it's<00:02:28.859> hard

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
is that little box right there it's hard

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.539 
is that little box right there it's hard
to<00:02:29.130> see<00:02:29.450> zoom<00:02:30.450> in<00:02:30.920> that's<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.130> combiner

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
to see zoom in that's the combiner

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.039 
to see zoom in that's the combiner
that's<00:02:33.209> called<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.569> Yan<00:02:33.780> Dena<00:02:34.370> combiner<00:02:36.049> it's

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
that's called the Yan Dena combiner it's

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.590 
that's called the Yan Dena combiner it's
called<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.350> Yan<00:02:37.500> Dena<00:02:37.739> combiner<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.600> it

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
called the Yan Dena combiner and it

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.900 
called the Yan Dena combiner and it
keeps<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.620> two<00:02:40.829> charging<00:02:41.370> batteries

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
keeps the two charging batteries

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.759 
keeps the two charging batteries
separate<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:42.599> one<00:02:42.870> can't<00:02:43.200> bring<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.620> other

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
separate so one can't bring the other

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.030 
separate so one can't bring the other
down<00:02:44.069> and<00:02:44.489> allow<00:02:45.389> allows<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.620> charge<00:02:46.799> them

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
down and allow allows you to charge them

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.440 
down and allow allows you to charge them
both<00:02:47.069> this<00:02:48.000> again<00:02:48.389> is<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:49.040> it's<00:02:50.040> called<00:02:50.250> the
