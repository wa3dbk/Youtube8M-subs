what's<00:00:05.069> powering<00:00:05.520> this<00:00:05.759> whole<00:00:06.000> pedal<00:00:06.359> board

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
what's powering this whole pedal board

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.830 
what's powering this whole pedal board
is<00:00:06.660> an<00:00:06.779> ISO<00:00:06.930> prick<00:00:07.319> VM<00:00:07.589> 238<00:00:08.460> has<00:00:08.970> ten<00:00:09.269> outputs

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
is an ISO prick VM 238 has ten outputs

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.180 
is an ISO prick VM 238 has ten outputs
eight<00:00:10.620> nine<00:00:11.070> volts<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:12.450> 18<00:00:12.900> volts<00:00:13.320> two<00:00:14.040> of

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
eight nine volts and to 18 volts two of

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.010 
eight nine volts and to 18 volts two of
the<00:00:14.280> nine<00:00:14.429> volts<00:00:14.849> are<00:00:14.940> for<00:00:15.089> high<00:00:15.269> power<00:00:15.540> of

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
the nine volts are for high power of

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.710 
the nine volts are for high power of
digital<00:00:16.699> actually<00:00:17.699> supports<00:00:18.119> four<00:00:18.390> hundred

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
digital actually supports four hundred

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.050 
digital actually supports four hundred
and<00:00:18.810> fifty<00:00:19.140> mili<00:00:19.350> amps<00:00:19.800> it's<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.310> lotta<00:00:20.550> current

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
and fifty mili amps it's a lotta current

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.900 
and fifty mili amps it's a lotta current
so<00:00:21.539> all<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.930> new<00:00:22.080> digital<00:00:22.369> pedals<00:00:23.369> they're

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
so all the new digital pedals they're

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.500 
so all the new digital pedals they're
hungry

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
hungry

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.560 
hungry
so<00:00:24.779> we<00:00:24.960> now<00:00:25.410> supplied<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.640> enough<00:00:27.119> power<00:00:27.420> to

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
so we now supplied the enough power to

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.570 
so we now supplied the enough power to
power<00:00:27.869> those<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.800> other<00:00:28.890> thing<00:00:29.010> too<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.220> this

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
power those the other thing too is this

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.820 
power those the other thing too is this
is<00:00:29.789> completely<00:00:30.150> isolated<00:00:30.619> you<00:00:31.619> have<00:00:31.800> a

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
is completely isolated you have a

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.450 
is completely isolated you have a
two-way<00:00:32.130> 18<00:00:32.730> volt<00:00:32.969> power<00:00:33.180> adapter<00:00:34.140> we<00:00:34.980> convert

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
two-way 18 volt power adapter we convert

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.780 
two-way 18 volt power adapter we convert
it<00:00:35.640> all<00:00:35.850> into<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.989> signal<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.160> then<00:00:38.370> gets<00:00:38.610> all

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
it all into a signal that then gets all

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.970 
it all into a signal that then gets all
step-down<00:00:39.239> isolated<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.079> transformer<00:00:40.770> size

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
step-down isolated the transformer size

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.250 
step-down isolated the transformer size
so<00:00:41.579> all<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.180> these<00:00:42.300> outputs<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.840> can<00:00:42.870> think<00:00:43.170> of

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
so all of these outputs you can think of

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.380 
so all of these outputs you can think of
is<00:00:43.410> just<00:00:43.710> individual<00:00:44.309> batteries<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:45.360> can

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
is just individual batteries you can

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.619 
is just individual batteries you can
turn<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.960> polarities<00:00:46.410> around<00:00:46.770> ground<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.629> it

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
turn the polarities around ground and it

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.790 
turn the polarities around ground and it
doesn't<00:00:48.930> matter<00:00:49.079> because<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.530> can<00:00:49.590> even

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
doesn't matter because you can even

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.130 
doesn't matter because you can even
stack<00:00:50.160> them<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:51.059> nine<00:00:51.239> volts<00:00:51.600> can<00:00:51.750> turn<00:00:51.960> into

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
stack them to nine volts can turn into

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.799 
stack them to nine volts can turn into
18

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
18

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.470 
18
it<00:00:54.289> also<00:00:54.440> has<00:00:54.710> changed<00:00:55.219> sag<00:00:55.520> outcomes<00:00:56.090> we<00:00:56.329> can

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
it also has changed sag outcomes we can

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.950 
it also has changed sag outcomes we can
adjust<00:00:56.600> from<00:00:56.960> 15<00:00:57.500> to<00:00:58.190> only<00:00:58.820> that's<00:00:59.120> 6<00:00:59.390> :

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
adjust from 15 to only that's 6 :

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.490 
adjust from 15 to only that's 6 :
it<00:01:00.379> simulates<00:01:00.769> a<00:01:01.039> battery<00:01:01.399> so<00:01:01.610> when<00:01:01.760> it<00:01:01.850> dies

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
it simulates a battery so when it dies

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.920 
it simulates a battery so when it dies
store<00:01:03.500> shins<00:01:03.860> and<00:01:04.220> fusses<00:01:04.729> oh<00:01:04.940> you<00:01:05.630> can<00:01:05.780> get<00:01:05.900> a

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
store shins and fusses oh you can get a

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.410 
store shins and fusses oh you can get a
whole<00:01:06.290> different<00:01:06.710> sound<00:01:06.950> either<00:01:07.340> high-end<00:01:08.030> it

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
whole different sound either high-end it

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.630 
whole different sound either high-end it
kind<00:01:08.630> of<00:01:08.690> opens<00:01:09.020> it<00:01:09.140> up<00:01:09.290> bring<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.100> violet<00:01:10.460> of

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
kind of opens it up bring the violet of

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.420 
kind of opens it up bring the violet of
the<00:01:10.820> voltage<00:01:11.330> to<00:01:11.360> lower<00:01:11.750> sag<00:01:12.380> and<00:01:12.920> it<00:01:13.070> starts

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
the voltage to lower sag and it starts

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.200 
the voltage to lower sag and it starts
to<00:01:13.490> give<00:01:13.640> squishy<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:14.450> really<00:01:15.170> saturated

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
to give squishy and really saturated

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.420 
to give squishy and really saturated
making<00:01:17.210> it<00:01:17.450> your<00:01:17.899> your<00:01:18.530> pedal<00:01:18.890> can<00:01:19.070> come<00:01:19.250> out

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
making it your your pedal can come out

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.160 
making it your your pedal can come out
many<00:01:19.940> different<00:01:20.180> characters<00:01:20.780> just<00:01:21.020> with<00:01:21.140> that

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
many different characters just with that

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.290 
many different characters just with that
battery<00:01:21.619> control<00:01:22.070> so<00:01:22.909> this<00:01:23.869> is<00:01:24.049> all<00:01:25.300> packaged

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
battery control so this is all packaged

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.710 
battery control so this is all packaged
in<00:01:26.479> a<00:01:26.509> nice<00:01:26.750> little<00:01:27.020> tight<00:01:27.229> package<00:01:27.679> and<00:01:28.720> the
