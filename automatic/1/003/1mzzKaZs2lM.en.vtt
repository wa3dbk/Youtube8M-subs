00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
these occur on almost all of us as we

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.160 
these occur on almost all of us as we
get<00:01:05.519> older<00:01:05.910> we<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.270> start<00:01:06.509> making<00:01:06.630> these<00:01:06.990> in

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
get older we can start making these in

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.620 
get older we can start making these in
our<00:01:07.259> 40s<00:01:07.740> 30s<00:01:08.369> even<00:01:08.700> but<00:01:09.030> by<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.180> time<00:01:09.420> we<00:01:09.539> get

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
our 40s 30s even but by the time we get

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.690 
our 40s 30s even but by the time we get
into<00:01:09.780> our<00:01:09.899> 50s<00:01:10.320> most<00:01:11.009> human<00:01:11.340> beings<00:01:11.369> are<00:01:11.670> going

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
into our 50s most human beings are going

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.600 
into our 50s most human beings are going
to<00:01:11.850> grow<00:01:12.090> one<00:01:12.780> or<00:01:12.929> several<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.320> these<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.800> fact

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
to grow one or several of these in fact

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.790 
to grow one or several of these in fact
I<00:01:14.880> tell<00:01:15.119> people<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.450> separate<00:01:16.259> keratoses

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
I tell people that separate keratoses

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.370 
I tell people that separate keratoses
are<00:01:16.979> like<00:01:17.130> Lay's<00:01:17.399> potato<00:01:17.429> chips<00:01:17.990> we<00:01:18.990> all<00:01:19.140> get

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
are like Lay's potato chips we all get

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.210 
are like Lay's potato chips we all get
them<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.770> if<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.920> nobody<00:01:20.460> can<00:01:20.580> have<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:20.940> one

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
them and if you nobody can have just one

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.380 
them and if you nobody can have just one
they<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.490> grow<00:01:23.700> anywhere<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.149> the<00:01:24.240> body

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
they can grow anywhere in the body

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.669 
they can grow anywhere in the body
although<00:01:24.810> like<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.020> mentioned<00:01:25.440> earlier

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
although like I mentioned earlier

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:26.960 
although like I mentioned earlier
they're<00:01:25.860> most<00:01:26.039> common<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.550> trunk<00:01:26.850> and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
they're most common on the trunk and

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
they're most common on the trunk and
head<00:01:27.679> they<00:01:28.679> range<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.100> size<00:01:29.160> and<00:01:29.880> color<00:01:30.479> from

or 6 centimeters around and the color

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.930

even tan brown and all the way to black
again<00:01:44.580> their<00:01:44.940> textures<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:46.140> almost<00:01:46.410> like

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
again their textures is almost like

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.309 
again their textures is almost like
stuck<00:01:47.220> on<00:01:47.399> its<00:01:47.640> rough<00:01:47.940> scaly<00:01:48.569> waxy<00:01:49.080> you<00:01:49.200> can

stuck on its rough scaly waxy you can

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:51.199 
stuck on its rough scaly waxy you can
almost<00:01:49.470> looks<00:01:50.220> like<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.459> almost<00:01:50.610> peel<00:01:50.940> it<00:01:51.090> off

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:51.209 
almost looks like you almost peel it off

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:55.999 
almost looks like you almost peel it off
with<00:01:51.390> your<00:01:51.569> fingertip<00:01:53.119> they<00:01:54.119> there<00:01:55.009> everybody

with your fingertip they there everybody

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.710 
with your fingertip they there everybody
gets<00:01:56.220> some<00:01:56.459> the<00:01:56.610> number<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.330> we<00:01:57.420> get<00:01:57.569> is

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
gets some the number that we get is

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.630 
gets some the number that we get is
quite<00:01:57.989> variable<00:01:58.410> and<00:01:58.800> that<00:01:59.190> may<00:01:59.340> run<00:01:59.489> in

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
quite variable and that may run in

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.339 
quite variable and that may run in
families<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.209> some<00:02:00.420> instances<00:02:00.929> if<00:02:01.080> people

these<00:02:43.650> really<00:02:43.920> lies<00:02:44.130> only<00:02:44.430> two

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
these really lies only two

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.140 
these really lies only two
considerations

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
considerations

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.050 
considerations
one<00:02:46.810> is<00:02:47.080> they<00:02:47.620> may<00:02:47.830> mimic<00:02:48.099> skin<00:02:48.610> cancer

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
one is they may mimic skin cancer

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.430 
one is they may mimic skin cancer
sometimes<00:02:49.360> these<00:02:49.659> may<00:02:49.840> grow<00:02:50.170> very<00:02:50.379> quickly

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
sometimes these may grow very quickly

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.070 
sometimes these may grow very quickly
they<00:02:50.920> may<00:02:51.069> bleed<00:02:51.459> they<00:02:51.940> may<00:02:52.000> be<00:02:52.120> very<00:02:52.390> black<00:02:52.810> in

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
they may bleed they may be very black in

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.509 
they may bleed they may be very black in
color<00:02:53.319> again<00:02:53.980> these<00:02:54.099> are<00:02:54.250> some<00:02:54.400> of<00:02:54.430> the

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
color again these are some of the

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.059 
color again these are some of the
features<00:02:54.700> we<00:02:55.030> look<00:02:55.180> for<00:02:55.390> with<00:02:55.480> skin<00:02:55.780> cancer

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
features we look for with skin cancer

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.830 
features we look for with skin cancer
the<00:02:57.069> other<00:02:57.250> concern<00:02:57.700> with<00:02:57.909> these<00:02:58.120> is<00:02:58.450> again

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
the other concern with these is again

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.940 
the other concern with these is again
they<00:02:58.959> may<00:02:59.049> just<00:02:59.230> make<00:02:59.349> a<00:02:59.409> nuisance<00:02:59.799> of

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
they may just make a nuisance of

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.990 
they may just make a nuisance of
themselves<00:03:00.010> depending<00:03:00.549> where<00:03:00.879> they're

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
themselves depending where they're

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.369 
themselves depending where they're
growing<00:03:01.180> they<00:03:01.629> may<00:03:01.780> catch

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
growing they may catch

growths you only have two options if you
think<00:03:14.049> about<00:03:14.140> it<00:03:14.379> you<00:03:14.500> can<00:03:14.650> either<00:03:14.799> safely

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
think about it you can either safely

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.839 
think about it you can either safely
leave<00:03:15.909> it<00:03:16.060> there<00:03:16.329> or<00:03:16.840> take<00:03:17.170> it<00:03:17.349> off<00:03:17.579> if<00:03:18.579> you<00:03:18.640> do
