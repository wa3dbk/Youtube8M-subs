I'm here with another core map feature
in<00:00:30.759> halo<00:00:31.089> 2<00:00:31.269> anniversary<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:32.619> map<00:00:32.830> is<00:00:32.860> called

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
in halo 2 anniversary this map is called

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:34.979 
in halo 2 anniversary this map is called
complexion<00:00:34.089> and<00:00:34.239> it<00:00:34.390> was<00:00:34.510> created<00:00:34.839> by<00:00:34.960> a

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
complexion and it was created by a

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.979 
complexion and it was created by a
haunted<00:00:35.650> army<00:00:36.040> now<00:00:36.699> complexion<00:00:37.390> is<00:00:37.570> actually

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
haunted army now complexion is actually

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.569 
haunted army now complexion is actually
a<00:00:38.019> pretty<00:00:38.170> controversial<00:00:38.739> map<00:00:39.100> and<00:00:39.339> it's<00:00:39.430> been

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579 
a pretty controversial map and it's been

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.610 
a pretty controversial map and it's been
quite<00:00:39.850> polarizing<00:00:40.600> in<00:00:40.690> my<00:00:40.809> testing<00:00:41.290> lobbies

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
quite polarizing in my testing lobbies

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.310 
quite polarizing in my testing lobbies
so<00:00:41.829> far<00:00:42.270> some<00:00:43.270> people<00:00:43.539> really<00:00:43.750> love<00:00:44.020> it<00:00:44.140> and

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
so far some people really love it and

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.740 
so far some people really love it and
some<00:00:44.469> people<00:00:44.760> downright<00:00:45.760> hate<00:00:46.180> it<00:00:46.329> so<00:00:46.570> it's

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
some people downright hate it so it's

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.290 
some people downright hate it so it's
been<00:00:47.289> not<00:00:47.530> it's<00:00:48.340> been<00:00:48.550> a<00:00:48.579> really<00:00:48.789> exciting

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
been not it's been a really exciting

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.720 
been not it's been a really exciting
that<00:00:49.420> to<00:00:49.629> play<00:00:49.809> for<00:00:50.440> that<00:00:50.559> reason<00:00:50.739> but<00:00:51.340> the

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
that to play for that reason but the

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.700 
that to play for that reason but the
reason<00:00:51.850> why<00:00:52.120> it's<00:00:52.390> so<00:00:52.570> controversial<00:00:53.410> is

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
reason why it's so controversial is

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.889 
reason why it's so controversial is
because<00:00:53.739> this<00:00:54.129> map<00:00:54.340> is<00:00:54.370> extremely<00:00:55.329> vertical

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
because this map is extremely vertical

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.590 
because this map is extremely vertical
and<00:00:56.109> it's<00:00:56.890> kind<00:00:57.100> of<00:00:57.129> a<00:00:57.219> wonky<00:00:57.609> design<00:00:58.329> in

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
and it's kind of a wonky design in

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.369 
and it's kind of a wonky design in
general<00:00:58.660> so<00:00:59.500> this<00:01:00.100> map<00:01:00.250> is<00:01:00.280> symmetrical<00:01:00.969> and

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
general so this map is symmetrical and

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.869 
general so this map is symmetrical and
bases<00:01:02.379> are<00:01:02.530> laid<00:01:02.739> out<00:01:02.769> in<00:01:02.920> a<00:01:03.519> perpendicular

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
bases are laid out in a perpendicular

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.150 
bases are laid out in a perpendicular
fashion<00:01:04.629> and<00:01:05.019> the<00:01:05.289> rest<00:01:05.500> of<00:01:05.619> the<00:01:05.679> map<00:01:05.860> sort<00:01:06.100> of

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
fashion and the rest of the map sort of

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.719 
fashion and the rest of the map sort of
elbows<00:01:06.550> out<00:01:06.789> between<00:01:07.179> those<00:01:07.660> and<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:09.310> map<00:01:09.490> is

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
elbows out between those and the map is

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.400 
elbows out between those and the map is
actually<00:01:10.119> fairly<00:01:10.479> small<00:01:10.690> it's<00:01:11.110> going<00:01:11.229> to<00:01:11.289> play

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
actually fairly small it's going to play

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.400 
actually fairly small it's going to play
best<00:01:11.740> for<00:01:12.100> three<00:01:12.369> be<00:01:12.490> three<00:01:12.729> games<00:01:13.080> or<00:01:14.080> before

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
best for three be three games or before

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.710 
best for three be three games or before
I<00:01:14.440> can't<00:01:15.009> really<00:01:15.220> recommend<00:01:15.459> and<00:01:15.910> to<00:01:16.420> be<00:01:16.569> two

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
I can't really recommend and to be two

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.219 
I can't really recommend and to be two
works<00:01:16.959> just<00:01:17.289> fine<00:01:17.470> so<00:01:18.179> this<00:01:19.179> map<00:01:19.450> like<00:01:19.899> i<00:01:20.020> said

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
works just fine so this map like i said

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.040 
works just fine so this map like i said
though<00:01:20.380> it's<00:01:20.560> very<00:01:20.950> very<00:01:21.220> vertical<00:01:21.550> and

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
though it's very very vertical and

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.740 
though it's very very vertical and
unlike<00:01:23.050> most<00:01:23.289> maps<00:01:23.619> this<00:01:24.369> this<00:01:25.209> guy<00:01:25.420> doesn't

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
unlike most maps this this guy doesn't

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.650 
unlike most maps this this guy doesn't
really<00:01:26.080> rely<00:01:26.830> on<00:01:27.390> walls<00:01:28.390> and<00:01:28.869> big<00:01:29.709> chunky

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
really rely on walls and big chunky

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.300 
really rely on walls and big chunky
geometry<00:01:31.660> to<00:01:31.840> break<00:01:32.020> up<00:01:32.259> lines<00:01:32.709> of<00:01:32.890> sight<00:01:33.069> and

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
geometry to break up lines of sight and

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.070 
geometry to break up lines of sight and
segments<00:01:33.729> for<00:01:33.819> that<00:01:34.000> this<00:01:34.450> map<00:01:34.599> is<00:01:34.630> actually

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
segments for that this map is actually

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.949 
segments for that this map is actually
segmented<00:01:35.700> mostly<00:01:36.700> by<00:01:36.970> vertical

00:01:37.949 --> 00:01:37.959 
segmented mostly by vertical

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:40.770 
segmented mostly by vertical
differentiation<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:39.759> there<00:01:39.940> are<00:01:40.090> lots<00:01:40.390> and

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
differentiation so there are lots and

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.210 
differentiation so there are lots and
lots<00:01:40.959> of<00:01:41.080> different<00:01:41.380> levels<00:01:41.709> on<00:01:41.860> this<00:01:41.979> map

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
lots of different levels on this map

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.300 
lots of different levels on this map
bike<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:43.479> hard<00:01:43.810> to<00:01:44.020> really<00:01:44.170> count<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:45.130> get<00:01:45.280> a

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
bike it's hard to really count and get a

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.830 
bike it's hard to really count and get a
definitive<00:01:45.640> number<00:01:46.209> because<00:01:46.569> they're<00:01:46.720> all

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
definitive number because they're all

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.809 
definitive number because they're all
split<00:01:47.229> levels<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:47.679> whatnot<00:01:47.979> and<00:01:48.220> there's<00:01:48.610> so

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
split levels and whatnot and there's so

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:50.520 
split levels and whatnot and there's so
much<00:01:48.940> this<00:01:49.179> height<00:01:49.420> change<00:01:49.780> throughout<00:01:50.289> man

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
much this height change throughout man

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.729 
much this height change throughout man
and<00:01:50.830> it's<00:01:51.190> really<00:01:51.369> exciting<00:01:51.819> to<00:01:51.849> play<00:01:52.060> because

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:52.739 
and it's really exciting to play because

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:56.070 
and it's really exciting to play because
you<00:01:53.739> always<00:01:53.979> have<00:01:54.340> to<00:01:54.459> be<00:01:54.580> mindful<00:01:55.090> of<00:01:55.509> players

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
you always have to be mindful of players

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.990 
you always have to be mindful of players
not<00:01:56.470> only<00:01:56.560> on<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.009> same<00:01:57.220> vertical<00:01:57.459> level<00:01:57.910> as

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
not only on the same vertical level as

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.540 
not only on the same vertical level as
you<00:01:58.119> but<00:01:58.300> also<00:01:58.509> above<00:01:59.410> and<00:01:59.739> below<00:02:00.129> you<00:02:00.190> and

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
you but also above and below you and

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.760 
you but also above and below you and
there<00:02:00.910> are<00:02:01.030> lots<00:02:01.300> of<00:02:01.599> cool<00:02:01.989> ways<00:02:02.229> to<00:02:02.259> move

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
there are lots of cool ways to move

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.290 
there are lots of cool ways to move
between<00:02:03.009> those<00:02:03.429> vertical<00:02:03.819> levels<00:02:04.119> there's

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
between those vertical levels there's

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.270 
between those vertical levels there's
lifts<00:02:04.899> there's<00:02:05.140> some<00:02:05.319> jumps<00:02:05.709> some<00:02:06.129> of<00:02:06.220> the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
lifts there's some jumps some of the

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.389 
lifts there's some jumps some of the
jumps<00:02:06.520> are<00:02:06.610> freaking<00:02:07.060> hard<00:02:07.420> to<00:02:07.599> do

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
jumps are freaking hard to do

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.690 
jumps are freaking hard to do
for<00:02:08.610> me<00:02:08.729> at<00:02:08.879> least<00:02:08.909> back<00:02:09.269> and<00:02:10.400> you<00:02:11.400> know<00:02:11.489> it

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
for me at least back and you know it

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.190 
for me at least back and you know it
lots<00:02:11.939> of<00:02:12.090> interesting<00:02:12.510> ways<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.840> move<00:02:13.019> around

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
lots of interesting ways to move around

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.970 
lots of interesting ways to move around
so<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.970> top<00:02:15.269> of<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.689> map<00:02:15.870> is<00:02:16.110> definitely

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
so the top of the map is definitely

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.110 
so the top of the map is definitely
something<00:02:17.220> you're<00:02:17.489> going<00:02:17.579> to<00:02:17.640> want<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.879> hold

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
something you're going to want to hold

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.100 
something you're going to want to hold
and<00:02:19.049> that's<00:02:19.230> sort<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:20.480> deal<00:02:21.480> with<00:02:21.689> this

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
and that's sort of the deal with this

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.890 
and that's sort of the deal with this
sort<00:02:22.319> of<00:02:22.439> map<00:02:22.620> is<00:02:22.829> like<00:02:23.099> sometimes<00:02:23.549> you<00:02:23.879> get<00:02:24.659> a

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
sort of map is like sometimes you get a

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.410 
sort of map is like sometimes you get a
too<00:02:25.379> top-heavy<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:26.099> a<00:02:26.159> design<00:02:26.579> this<00:02:27.120> map<00:02:27.390> is

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
too top-heavy of a design this map is

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.270 
too top-heavy of a design this map is
like<00:02:27.780> teetering<00:02:28.140> on<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.530> edge<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:28.950> but

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
like teetering on the edge of that but

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.569 
like teetering on the edge of that but
it<00:02:29.489> works<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.689> holding<00:02:31.379> the<00:02:31.560> top<00:02:32.220> of<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.430> map

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
it works so holding the top of the map

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.490 
it works so holding the top of the map
is<00:02:32.760> really<00:02:33.150> important<00:02:33.629> though<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:34.230> can<00:02:34.379> get

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
is really important though you can get

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.649 
is really important though you can get
some<00:02:34.739> sight<00:02:35.189> lines<00:02:35.400> into<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.879> bases<00:02:36.329> from<00:02:36.450> up

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
some sight lines into the bases from up

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.410 
some sight lines into the bases from up
there<00:02:36.980> obviously<00:02:37.980> players<00:02:38.730> directly<00:02:39.269> below

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
there obviously players directly below

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.229 
there obviously players directly below
you<00:02:39.629> are<00:02:39.870> going<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.260> be<00:02:40.379> safe<00:02:40.829> from<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.609> but

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
you are going to be safe from you but

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.479 
you are going to be safe from you but
holding<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.290> top<00:02:43.470> of<00:02:43.590> maps<00:02:43.769> really<00:02:44.099> important

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
holding the top of maps really important

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:45.949 
holding the top of maps really important
but<00:02:44.970> there<00:02:45.150> are<00:02:45.239> lots<00:02:45.329> of<00:02:45.510> interesting<00:02:45.900> ways

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
but there are lots of interesting ways

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.170 
but there are lots of interesting ways
to<00:02:46.290> move<00:02:46.620> through<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.549> bottom<00:02:47.879> of<00:02:48.000> map

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
to move through the bottom of map

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.430 
to move through the bottom of map
through<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.569> center<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.079> there<00:02:49.290> are<00:02:49.349> also

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
through the center and there are also

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.830 
through the center and there are also
some<00:02:49.739> important<00:02:50.639> pickups<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.299> keep<00:02:51.510> in<00:02:51.629> mind

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
some important pickups to keep in mind

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.050 
some important pickups to keep in mind
so<00:02:53.299> there<00:02:54.299> is<00:02:54.569> the<00:02:54.840> rocket<00:02:55.230> launcher<00:02:55.560> and

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
so there is the rocket launcher and

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.369 
so there is the rocket launcher and
that's<00:02:57.060> obviously<00:02:57.359> going<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:58.019> be<00:02:58.109> really

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
that's obviously going to be really

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.949 
that's obviously going to be really
useful<00:02:58.470> if<00:02:59.310> you're<00:02:59.489> trying<00:02:59.790> to<00:02:59.939> push<00:03:00.180> top<00:03:00.540> but

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
useful if you're trying to push top but

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.780 
useful if you're trying to push top but
unfortunately<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.739> Rockets<00:03:02.159> if<00:03:02.549> you're

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
unfortunately the Rockets if you're

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.309 
unfortunately the Rockets if you're
looking<00:03:03.150> straight<00:03:03.450> up<00:03:03.569> trying<00:03:04.049> to<00:03:04.170> hit

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
looking straight up trying to hit

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.199 
looking straight up trying to hit
someone<00:03:04.530> well<00:03:05.129> above<00:03:05.459> you<00:03:05.639> they're<00:03:05.909> not<00:03:06.030> going

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
someone well above you they're not going

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.940 
someone well above you they're not going
to<00:03:06.299> be<00:03:06.389> super<00:03:06.569> effective<00:03:06.989> they're<00:03:07.650> actually

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
to be super effective they're actually

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.289 
to be super effective they're actually
much<00:03:08.099> more<00:03:08.310> effective<00:03:08.819> if<00:03:08.970> you're<00:03:09.090> shooting

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
much more effective if you're shooting

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.409 
much more effective if you're shooting
down<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.079> you<00:03:10.170> have<00:03:10.439> ground<00:03:11.189> to<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:12.060> splash

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:12.419 
down and you have ground to to splash

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:14.960 
down and you have ground to to splash
the<00:03:12.560> blast<00:03:13.560> off<00:03:13.829> of<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:14.519> getting<00:03:14.790> those

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
the blast off of so getting those

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.759 
the blast off of so getting those
rockets<00:03:15.449> and<00:03:15.599> pulling<00:03:15.870> them<00:03:15.900> up<00:03:16.109> top<00:03:16.440> and

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
rockets and pulling them up top and

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.699 
rockets and pulling them up top and
using<00:03:17.459> them<00:03:17.669> to<00:03:17.910> maintain<00:03:18.480> top<00:03:19.079> control<00:03:19.440> is

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
using them to maintain top control is

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.530 
using them to maintain top control is
definitely<00:03:19.739> really<00:03:20.549> important<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.090> that's

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
definitely really important and that's

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.780 
definitely really important and that's
it<00:03:21.930> again<00:03:22.410> going<00:03:22.709> back<00:03:22.829> to<00:03:23.010> why<00:03:23.250> some<00:03:23.519> people

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
it again going back to why some people

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.250 
it again going back to why some people
really<00:03:23.940> don't<00:03:24.150> like<00:03:24.329> this<00:03:24.540> map<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.930> can<00:03:25.109> be

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
really don't like this map it can be

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.610 
really don't like this map it can be
very<00:03:25.590> very<00:03:25.980> punishing<00:03:26.370> ah<00:03:27.199> in<00:03:28.199> addition<00:03:28.440> to

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
very very punishing ah in addition to

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.110 
very very punishing ah in addition to
the<00:03:28.799> Rockets<00:03:29.190> there's<00:03:29.400> also<00:03:29.609> a<00:03:29.730> suppressed

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
the Rockets there's also a suppressed

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.789 
the Rockets there's also a suppressed
SMG<00:03:30.599> down<00:03:30.780> there<00:03:30.959> those<00:03:31.290> are<00:03:31.440> always<00:03:31.650> worth

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
SMG down there those are always worth

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.129 
SMG down there those are always worth
keeping<00:03:32.159> in<00:03:32.220> mind<00:03:32.299> because<00:03:33.299> they're<00:03:33.599> pretty

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
keeping in mind because they're pretty

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.129 
keeping in mind because they're pretty
pretty<00:03:34.709> damn<00:03:35.099> good<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:36.269> there<00:03:36.599> is<00:03:36.690> also<00:03:36.900> an

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
pretty damn good and there is also an

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.319 
pretty damn good and there is also an
active<00:03:37.470> camo<00:03:37.859> pick<00:03:38.099> up<00:03:38.250> sort<00:03:38.489> of<00:03:38.519> in<00:03:38.669> top<00:03:39.030> mid

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
active camo pick up sort of in top mid

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.140 
active camo pick up sort of in top mid
and<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:40.560> active<00:03:40.889> camo<00:03:41.250> is<00:03:41.400> interesting

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
and the active camo is interesting

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.030 
and the active camo is interesting
because<00:03:42.299> it's<00:03:42.659> actually<00:03:42.780> placed<00:03:43.290> on<00:03:43.560> normal

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
because it's actually placed on normal

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.800 
because it's actually placed on normal
physics<00:03:44.430> which<00:03:45.000> means<00:03:45.209> you<00:03:45.329> can<00:03:45.479> shoot<00:03:45.659> it

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
physics which means you can shoot it

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.020 
physics which means you can shoot it
down<00:03:45.959> from<00:03:46.530> below<00:03:46.799> and<00:03:47.010> pick<00:03:47.400> it<00:03:47.489> up<00:03:47.579> on<00:03:47.819> the

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
down from below and pick it up on the

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.899 
down from below and pick it up on the
lower<00:03:48.510> level<00:03:49.010> sort<00:03:50.010> of<00:03:50.069> like<00:03:50.190> in<00:03:50.430> rat<00:03:50.699> race

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
lower level sort of like in rat race

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.180 
lower level sort of like in rat race
from<00:03:51.150> Halo<00:03:51.359> CE<00:03:51.629> and<00:03:52.530> that's<00:03:52.829> kind<00:03:53.069> of<00:03:53.099> an

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
from Halo CE and that's kind of an

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.410 
from Halo CE and that's kind of an
interesting<00:03:53.340> little<00:03:53.909> thing<00:03:54.479> you<00:03:54.629> can

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
interesting little thing you can

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.930 
interesting little thing you can
do<00:03:55.569> but<00:03:56.410> in<00:03:56.740> general<00:03:57.010> this<00:03:57.340> map<00:03:57.550> is<00:03:57.580> just

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
do but in general this map is just

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.150 
do but in general this map is just
really<00:03:58.240> exciting<00:03:58.690> a<00:03:58.870> really<00:03:59.739> fresh

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
really exciting a really fresh

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.910 
really exciting a really fresh
experience<00:04:00.760> some<00:04:01.720> people<00:04:02.020> are<00:04:02.110> bound<00:04:02.470> to

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
experience some people are bound to
