00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.309 

let's<00:00:00.269> talk<00:00:00.420> about<00:00:00.570> the<00:00:00.719> science<00:00:01.140> of

00:00:01.309 --> 00:00:01.319 
let's talk about the science of

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:03.679 
let's talk about the science of
interstellar<00:00:02.190> science<00:00:03.149> in<00:00:03.210> this<00:00:03.330> movie<00:00:03.570> is

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
interstellar science in this movie is

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.570 
interstellar science in this movie is
decidedly<00:00:04.200> mixed<00:00:04.529> from<00:00:04.980> some<00:00:05.190> pretty<00:00:05.370> good

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
decidedly mixed from some pretty good

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.369 
decidedly mixed from some pretty good
physics<00:00:06.060> and<00:00:06.210> relativity<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.960> some<00:00:07.170> pretty

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
physics and relativity to some pretty

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.919 
physics and relativity to some pretty
bad<00:00:07.620> orbital<00:00:08.130> mechanics<00:00:08.480> one<00:00:09.480> thing<00:00:09.660> it<00:00:09.780> does

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
bad orbital mechanics one thing it does

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.749 
bad orbital mechanics one thing it does
really<00:00:10.139> well<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.800> time<00:00:11.010> dilation<00:00:11.400> close

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
really well is the time dilation close

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.759 
really well is the time dilation close
to<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.030> black<00:00:12.240> hole<00:00:12.290> experiencing<00:00:13.290> seven

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.070 
to the black hole experiencing seven
years<00:00:14.070> for<00:00:14.400> every<00:00:14.639> hour<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:15.509> also<00:00:15.660> does<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.929> good

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
years for every hour it also does a good

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.689 
years for every hour it also does a good
job<00:00:16.139> at<00:00:16.410> representing<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.039> time<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.400> takes<00:00:17.520> to

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
back to earth and then they end up

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.310 
back to earth and then they end up
stopping<00:00:31.830> right<00:00:32.279> at<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.790> moon<00:00:33.320> interstellar

also<00:00:34.710> does<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.890> really<00:00:35.070> good<00:00:35.219> job<00:00:35.280> of

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
also does a really good job of

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.340 
also does a really good job of
representing<00:00:36.030> gravity<00:00:36.480> both<00:00:36.719> on<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:36.989> planet

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
and in space where they have to spin

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.430 
and in space where they have to spin
their<00:00:38.969> spacecraft<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.629> generate<00:00:39.989> artificial

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
killing the crops on earth this is not

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.790 
killing the crops on earth this is not
necessarily<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:49.110> reason<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.559> leave<00:00:49.649> your

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
necessarily a reason to leave your

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.830 
necessarily a reason to leave your
planet<00:00:50.010> it'd<00:00:50.489> be<00:00:50.670> much<00:00:50.820> easier<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.510> find<00:00:51.690> a

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
planet it'd be much easier to find a

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.510 
planet it'd be much easier to find a
cure<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.350> even<00:00:52.980> if<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.160> problem<00:00:53.370> is

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
cure and even if the problem is

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.369 
cure and even if the problem is
completely<00:00:54.030> insoluble<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:54.780> much<00:00:54.989> easier<00:00:55.020> to

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
completely insoluble it's much easier to

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.529 
completely insoluble it's much easier to
create<00:00:55.980> an<00:00:56.129> artificial<00:00:56.610> structure<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.390> your

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
create an artificial structure on your

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.700 
create an artificial structure on your
own<00:00:57.629> planet<00:00:57.989> than<00:00:58.140> leave<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.469> for<00:00:58.649> another

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
own planet than leave it for another

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.560 
own planet than leave it for another
even<00:00:59.609> if<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.789> have<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.180> leave<00:01:00.210> your<00:01:00.420> planet

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
even if you have to leave your planet

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.869 
even if you have to leave your planet
why<00:01:00.899> not<00:01:01.050> go<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.350> closer<00:01:01.620> one<00:01:01.829> like<00:01:02.129> Mars<00:01:02.520> and

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
why not go to a closer one like Mars and

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.579 
why not go to a closer one like Mars and
if<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.420> absolutely<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.260> leave<00:01:04.470> the
