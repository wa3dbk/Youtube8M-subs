00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.920
 the heart 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:37.210

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.329
 one of my few friends 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.949
 I have known him a long time ago 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.590

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.810
 opportunities 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.120

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:52.750
 my heart to max on the other hand there not

 He is a person that I appreciate very much 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:04.509
 I also consider 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.030
 and I think he has a lot to do here in 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:10.049
 follow but actually I think that 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.049
 I would prefer to eliminate to eliminate 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.970
 then this world we give to the 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.020
 cobras but if you can not answer and 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.020
 that answer a smell 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.940
 michelle 3 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.300
 so that he stays 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.300

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.220
 good is very difficult but 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.430
 this decision do taking with a 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.830
 my friend 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.980
 no it is not a decision only from me and 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:58.530
 I go out to do 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.530
 and the answer is 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:02.829
 true 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.430
 all there do not do this before 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.750

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.870

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.670

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:18.710
 with a heavy metal 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.040
 put a heavy metal then 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.040

 in the face of such detachment 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:23.110
 michelle being var his friend however 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.350

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:40.629
 of respect for that misery michelle esteem 

00:04:37.359 --> 00:04:44.639

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:16.180

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:19.349
 moment that we have shared so many 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.349
