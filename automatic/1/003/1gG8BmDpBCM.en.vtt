bit<00:01:25.179> more<00:01:25.329> or<00:01:25.479> less<00:01:25.659> than<00:01:25.840> that<00:01:26.079> but<00:01:26.439> yeah<00:01:26.770> it's

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
bit more or less than that but yeah it's

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.300 
bit more or less than that but yeah it's
a<00:01:27.070> big<00:01:27.609> rip<00:01:27.820> off<00:01:28.079> and<00:01:29.079> gamestop<00:01:29.560> but<00:01:30.009> I<00:01:30.069> decide

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
a big rip off and gamestop but I decide

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.190 
a big rip off and gamestop but I decide
to<00:01:30.340> throw<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.759> money<00:01:30.880> in<00:01:30.999> any<00:01:31.210> way<00:01:31.420> I<00:01:31.689> figured

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
to throw the money in any way I figured

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.590 
to throw the money in any way I figured
maybe<00:01:32.399> if<00:01:33.399> their<00:01:33.640> return<00:01:33.969> policy<00:01:33.999> is<00:01:34.539> good

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
maybe if their return policy is good

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.630 
maybe if their return policy is good
enough<00:01:34.960> it<00:01:35.469> wouldn't<00:01:35.740> really<00:01:35.799> matter<00:01:35.950> i<00:01:36.159> could

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
enough it wouldn't really matter i could

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.980 
enough it wouldn't really matter i could
just<00:01:36.700> return<00:01:36.880> it<00:01:37.090> right<00:01:37.149> there<00:01:37.420> and<00:01:37.539> then<00:01:37.689> and

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
just return it right there and then and

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.389 
just return it right there and then and
i<00:01:38.109> even<00:01:38.259> asked<00:01:38.619> about<00:01:38.740> it<00:01:38.859> right<00:01:39.069> before<00:01:39.189> i
