00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
necessary it's not so simple to just

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.910 
necessary it's not so simple to just
imitate<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.209> point<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.840> is<00:02:22.230> effective<00:02:22.890> to

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
imitate the point it is effective to

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.540

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
then there's no point to keep on

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
then there's no point to keep on
agitating<00:02:36.150> all<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.690> brainwashed<00:02:37.260> people

if<00:05:29.490> you<00:05:29.640> grasp<00:05:30.030> this<00:05:30.950> obviously<00:05:31.950> the<00:05:32.220> one

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
if you grasp this obviously the one

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.680 
if you grasp this obviously the one

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
fascinating thing is that those that are

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.380 
fascinating thing is that those that are
consumed<00:05:37.350> with<00:05:37.650> ego<00:05:38.160> cannot<00:05:38.729> stand<00:05:39.060> for

what's<00:05:39.600> best<00:05:39.840> for<00:05:40.229> all<00:05:40.550> because<00:05:41.550> it<00:05:41.790> is<00:05:41.940> simply

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
what's best for all because it is simply

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.420 
what's best for all because it is simply
impossible<00:05:42.390> and<00:05:43.290> therefore<00:05:43.320> they<00:05:43.950> will<00:05:43.979> try

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
impossible and therefore they will try

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.500 
impossible and therefore they will try
and<00:05:44.460> divide<00:05:44.970> you<00:05:45.360> they<00:05:46.350> must<00:05:46.669> because<00:05:47.669> they

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
and divide you they must because they

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.150 
and divide you they must because they
want<00:05:48.690> to<00:05:48.750> be<00:05:48.930> self-righteous<00:05:49.710> that's<00:05:49.979> the
