00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
description what I like about this combo

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.560 
description what I like about this combo
is<00:00:59.470> that<00:00:59.830> it<00:00:59.949> kind<00:01:00.309> of<00:01:00.460> bugs<00:01:00.759> your<00:01:00.970> opponent's

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
is that it kind of bugs your opponent's

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.630 
is that it kind of bugs your opponent's
defender<00:01:02.080> so<00:01:02.290> if<00:01:02.559> you<00:01:02.739> combine<00:01:03.159> the<00:01:03.369> skill

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
defender so if you combine the skill

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.520 
defender so if you combine the skill
moves<00:01:03.879> with<00:01:04.150> a<00:01:04.180> cross<00:01:04.540> it's<00:01:04.839> much<00:01:05.170> more

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
moves with a cross it's much more

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.830 
moves with a cross it's much more
effective<00:01:06.009> then<00:01:06.729> if<00:01:06.939> you<00:01:07.060> just<00:01:07.330> cross<00:01:07.659> the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
effective then if you just cross the

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.460 
effective then if you just cross the
ball<00:01:08.020> without<00:01:08.229> doing<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.040> move<00:01:09.280> before<00:01:10.470> this

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
ball without doing the move before this

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.920 
ball without doing the move before this
combo<00:01:11.829> works<00:01:12.009> best<00:01:12.579> when<00:01:12.909> you<00:01:13.090> do<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.570> move<00:01:13.750> at

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
combo works best when you do the move at

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.249 
combo works best when you do the move at
a<00:01:13.990> 90<00:01:14.530> degrees<00:01:14.890> angle<00:01:14.920> so<00:01:15.520> try<00:01:15.880> to<00:01:15.909> do<00:01:16.150> that

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
a 90 degrees angle so try to do that

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.080 
a 90 degrees angle so try to do that
mainly<00:01:17.259> the<00:01:17.560> clear<00:01:17.860> advantage<00:01:18.040> is<00:01:18.729> that<00:01:18.939> you

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
mainly the clear advantage is that you

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.179

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
efficient but what is the point in being

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.529 
efficient but what is the point in being
angry<00:01:26.499> when<00:01:26.740> you<00:01:26.770> can<00:01:27.009> just<00:01:27.280> use<00:01:27.909> this<00:01:28.240> to<00:01:28.450> your
