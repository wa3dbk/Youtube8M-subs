00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
on this is still wood constructed but it

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.130 
on this is still wood constructed but it
features<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> same<00:01:13.970> style<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.210> truss<00:01:15.630> rafters

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
in her own home the roof on this will

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.390 
in her own home the roof on this will
probably<00:01:18.479> hold<00:01:18.720> over<00:01:19.020> 4500<00:01:19.770> pounds<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.340> it

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
probably hold over 4500 pounds so it

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.130 
probably hold over 4500 pounds so it
might<00:01:20.520> be<00:01:20.580> wood<00:01:21.270> constructed<00:01:21.900> but<00:01:22.020> that

might be wood constructed but that

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.859 
might be wood constructed but that
doesn't<00:01:22.439> mean<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.560> it's<00:01:22.860> lesser<00:01:23.250> quality

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
doesn't mean that it's lesser quality
