00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.380 
199 I think it came out to like two
hundred<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.470> nine<00:01:10.619> dollars<00:01:10.950> or<00:01:11.130> something<00:01:11.430> as

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
hundred and nine dollars or something as

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.350 
hundred and nine dollars or something as
you<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:12.960> tell<00:01:13.020> they<00:01:13.500> have<00:01:13.799> cut<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.970> ends<00:01:15.270> or

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
you can tell they have cut the ends or

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.570 
you can tell they have cut the ends or
trim<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.840> ends<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:18.869> they're<00:01:19.409> not<00:01:20.189> very

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
trim the ends and so they're not very

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.380 
trim the ends and so they're not very
even<00:01:21.270> which<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.720> like<00:01:22.080> but<00:01:22.470> it's<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.920> same

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
even which I like but it's the same

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.179

thickness<00:01:24.390> all<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.229> way<00:01:25.320> down<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.619> little<00:01:26.040> bit

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
thickness all the way down a little bit

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.039
