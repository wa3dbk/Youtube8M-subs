 Hello everyone, Dmitry, and today 

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:08.639
 I would like to show you a review of the game 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:14.860
 assassins creed 2 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:20.199
 The first part 3 was ported 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:26.619
 and revolution 3 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:37.059
 the release of blood by her 312 so for this us 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:39.489
 I need a java boxing program and I need it 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:43.829
 assassin's creed I downloaded the same file with 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:46.809
 internet for touch phones 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:52.210
 not for android just look at the phone 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:01:02.160
 just throw in the map all we go in 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:01:09.810
 click on the program sit all found here 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.810
 went all di carta di carta 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:28.070
 I have already checked this game is not English 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:31.049
 language and another defect is not over and could 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:35.310
 scheduled maybe no descent hour 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:38.570
 see with assassin's creed 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.570
 but war 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.750
 so easy 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.909
 the tap is a little bit trimmed we play can 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.760
 English gram participate 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:19.930
 You see, without these key sanctions, well 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.930
 so play 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.459
 preferably sound off 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.710
 I think the top five is when you click 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:43.590
 on player 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.590
 up from up laptops 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.750
 you him 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.750
 by him 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.820
 everything 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.360
 still like this 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.079
 be 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:21.980
 and you can download another version of it does not 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:26.140
 sensory but it comes with 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:35.200
 kiba game programs 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:37.910
 so there it is necessary to configure the key is empty 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.530
 help joystick us set up joystick 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:53.860
 forward this two to the left 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:56.840
 This 44 about ears there is let's say a button is 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:00.160
 x it is 55 five 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.160
 to kill 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:33.290
 that's the principle and still with us to pass 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.290
