pattern actually works on any size

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.850 
pattern actually works on any size
t-shirt<00:00:48.210> because<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:50.690> reason<00:00:51.690> why<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.260> does

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
t-shirt because the reason why it does

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.170 
t-shirt because the reason why it does
work<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.370> because<00:00:54.890> you<00:00:55.890> poke<00:00:56.250> holes<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
work is because you poke holes in the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.510 
work is because you poke holes in the
bottom<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.719> any<00:00:57.989> t-shirt<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.920> have<00:00:59.160> and

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
bottom of any t-shirt that you have and

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.900 
bottom of any t-shirt that you have and
the<00:01:00.090> holes<00:01:00.329> are<00:01:00.750> poked<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.520> quarter<00:01:02.520> inch<00:01:02.699> apart

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
the holes are poked a quarter inch apart

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.740 
the holes are poked a quarter inch apart
from<00:01:03.359> each<00:01:03.510> other<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.589> if<00:01:05.070> your<00:01:05.600> t-shirt<00:01:06.600> is

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
from each other so if your t-shirt is

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.570 
from each other so if your t-shirt is
really<00:01:07.049> wide<00:01:07.290> you're<00:01:08.010> going<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.220> have<00:01:08.369> more

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
really wide you're going to have more

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.620 
really wide you're going to have more
holes<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.360> then<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:09.990> just<00:01:10.439> have<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:11.510> you<00:01:12.510> know

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
holes and then you just have in you know

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.620 
holes and then you just have in you know
like<00:01:12.810> it'll<00:01:13.049> say<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.700> quantity<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.729> two<00:01:14.850> or

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
increments of two or like like it if the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.929 
increments of two or like like it if the
repeat<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.810> based<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.830> two<00:01:23.220> or<00:01:23.430> three<00:01:23.700> whatever

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
repeat is based on two or three whatever

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.179 
repeat is based on two or three whatever
that's<00:01:24.869> what<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.170> will<00:01:25.350> tell<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:25.950> this

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
one is every other so you just have to

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.890 
one is every other so you just have to
have<00:01:29.159> an<00:01:29.340> even<00:01:29.670> number<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.000> holes<00:01:30.329> going<00:01:30.750> all

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900
