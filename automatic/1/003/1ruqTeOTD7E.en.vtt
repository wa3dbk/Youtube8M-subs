00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:04.500
 Sor motto Monster gave here just before leaving in Stendal and on the weekend 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.380
 it's one of the bike and driver but sometimes that's the name of the six races 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.539
 has also denied purchase 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:14.379
 except in the s1 class in the c1 urns there's a row 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.990
 The training has denied that is even room itself from Austria and 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:23.899
 those who know something audible now that organs know why Obrestad times 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.499
 Iran for Austria Franz Hofmann 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:33.190
 and 4 6 4 you actually and Belize actually I had to break down 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.760
 European champion percent 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.530
 at the same time 3 2 50 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.590
 and shows them 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.220
 not included 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.830
 many of you were so say you have because there is 3 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.520
 zie since then beaten with good distance to the top to the pursuers watchmaker 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.020
 say both races won 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.540
 in the c1 percent with a 4 50 he thus hazard card to my knowledge 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.170
 was 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.040
 and so it is clever you beaten to the s1 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.490
 until the first race at 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.870
 with tailor 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.100
 Hannes Maier 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.509
 got in the way of this he then made more common exit 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:13.680
 the countryside 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.960
 Percent of these will probably that I have now unfortunately with the memory 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.830
 Fifth then in the second race the s1 and mild need 16 years 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.340
 was sitting quite well 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.800
 only refers to the races 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.890
 per share dropped before FC Moers 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.120
 yes actually Hubble is to see us from Aurich unfortunately league newcomer Liegl 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.740
 is 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.090
 and Dr in the race until 1 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.720
 first run was old 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.090
 Orkut cranes or entrepreneurs support everything done 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.390
 second run not quite happy because that arises around mass 2 image worldwide 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.590
 want Ikea 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.060
 both clubs can us 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.250
 Horrido just under 20 percent 10 5 surfaced 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.150
 Well then I assume that you are on the 10 because here in Germany 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.330
 the World Cup 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.860
 ATI every race 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.040
 at the Kasseler last possibility in the s1 to start because by that she does 1 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.000
 Pilot up to you anyway because you're up front but Kixor licenses honestly that 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.189
 is in control 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:22.909
 Dec the saying over the lips a damaged the co2 has emitted this 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.159
 is 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.510
 m it can not be so many points oblivious Morsum own easily 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.480
 So we want to see something more here, too 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:35.240
 Nahles that once with malformations because 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.670
 we do not want to scare anyone 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.419
 under 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:41.559
 look forward to Lichtenberg to the next I am also happy Tanker
