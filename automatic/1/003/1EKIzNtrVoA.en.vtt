00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.620
 hello everyone I want to talk about today 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.030
 yours about your primus gasoline vampire 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.040
 Mosin dare 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:17.730
 I will show him here now the flask where he is 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.800
 we are actually organizing today 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:25.380
 we will do it in his water time 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:29.310
 now I will set the camera more comfortable 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:50.160
 just water it now 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:53.670
 for a second did you sound like that in painting bye 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:01:02.850
 set who to talk about really 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:07.770
 hike very few gasoline places very 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:15.180
 there is little rubber consumption small somewhere 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.979
 150 grams will burn within an hour 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.720
 one and a half 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:24.390
 but now right now my time is 1 by 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.970
 whether we have it here like that stick because 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.229
 that how would gasoline have 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.340
 heat this head right now 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.340
 try to soar 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.900
 it's just water once for kebabs and on 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:54.060
 Kebabs take mostly wood 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:56.450
 alcohol so here to see or he 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.450
 caught fire 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:17.220
 yes it burns now we put on this flask 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.850
 bumblebee this again this is bumblebee one not 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:25.590
 bold 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:28.890
 2 just a bumblebee than different to differ 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.290
 he as far as I know spaciousness 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.900
 tank and everything like bumblebee 2 a little bit 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.590
 more tank and so basically everything 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.590
 equally 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:44.780
 now it is a little on the red it is already possible 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.780
 pump up 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:05.690
 just the only minus of course is 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:05.690
 What are we doing in the afternoon? 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:24.420
 Well, he already works there is fat now 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:30.660
 bedroom or burned up now even better 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:34.590
 let him down with a blue flame 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:39.320
 I do not know how the day will be all blue 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:42.980
 the flame can be seen well try to achieve 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:48.680
 strong was on the floor and in fact it was visible 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:55.800
 flame in principle here I just would 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:58.760
 the camera succeeded best of all here 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.760
 I'll show you now 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.780
 principle is seen here 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.080
 don't know now 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.080
 we wait 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:20.370
 Here and our world works quietly as 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.370
 as if quietly not at all 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.380
 I'm just at home still have kerosene 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:31.980
 period of opportunity I will review 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.980
 kerosene will now I'm here and 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:43.800
 seconds now I'll put it like this 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.800
 legs try to just melt the snow 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:54.960
 mugs desirable was something mug 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.480
 cover well but that's okay 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.400
 principle can even so that faster 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.400
 was cover 

00:05:05.829 --> 00:05:10.599
 there is such a logo 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.270
 this 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.460
 made in ussr like a bottle you break 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.520
 principle 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:27.550
 dare nothing is what is needed 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:29.470
 these are different laying me there and all and 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:34.080
 so in principle, the reliability is made 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:38.700
 very good i also have some 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.700
 additional repair kit show you 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.270
 here 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:59.360
 here and repair kit here laying of 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:04.820
 spare head pump well how was 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:08.720
 is such a small reviewer like you 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:12.040
 hear that it works very quietly this 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:16.760
 shock I really like because how would 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:21.040
 comparable to and will take the kerosene myself 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.940
 record one primus 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:27.710
 he is very noisy 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:28.730
 noise still can give you a little heated 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:33.380
 Give Weiss 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:35.500
 show you my where I am at 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:40.580
 to nature 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:47.560
 the weather is cool he is people he is far away 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:54.890
 will feel and today celebrates February 23 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:07:03.290
 Here's a review of the prius will be the whole thing 

00:06:54.890 --> 00:07:05.810
 to be done in well for some minutes to 

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.760
 melted and boiled in 10 minutes 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:10.460
 In principle, there is no sense to shoot minutes 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:13.520
 ten more slightly lower on the camera hooked 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:18.770
 battery within 10 minutes it boils 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:23.810
 already kushka it boils under a million all 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:26.330
 thank you for watching and like 

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:30.380
