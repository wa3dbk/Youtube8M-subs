 even when we put pictures in 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.269
 instagram these are some people like 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.250
 you really look like and at some point 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.230
 temotka came to me a year and let's a little 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.360
 write down together to make a very place 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.470
 like me 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.450

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.880
 design education studio even 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.990
 we have a need to realize 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.580
 somewhere our desire 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.380
 experiment and we are here conceived 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.060
 we began to listen to such a story 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.460
 a huge amount of my various damage and 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.550
 found the song chorus who wrote there 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.320
 on a special occasion for one girl 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.560
 gta let's go straight ahead and do what 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.539
 she is slow she is beautiful she is just 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.539
 we could open our voices well 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.130
 prerequisite for this whole story 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.130
 It was that everyone writes their own 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.990
 bought songs are written by two people usually 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.509
 brush each other one way or another 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.189
 we have our burgers did not touch anyone 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.840
 way we did and every 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.869
 arranged in his own way as he saw fit 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.740
 how they started to try anything 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.610
 suck in 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.659
 everything turned out very nice and I think 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.659
 what will be good results 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.450
 and by you 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.470
 and how not forgot 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.590
 she's so kind of ephemeral and here 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.950
 night 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.780
 This song turned out well, but right away 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.580
 emerged in both the association with the cradle 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.120
 the fact is that the public of the storm is not 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.250
 fool you 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.940
 sincere songs and i think she will 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.340
 Successfully agree friends that it is very 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.620
 an unusual idea to write a song where both 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.050
 duo member doesn't know what happens in 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.900
 in the end, because everyone writes his own verse 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.569
 two countries two talented musicians 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.790
 participation of live band strings and mastering 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.220
 made in the west what else to add 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.200
 it only remains to wish them good luck to us 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.830
 look forward to the release of this 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.830
 compositions
