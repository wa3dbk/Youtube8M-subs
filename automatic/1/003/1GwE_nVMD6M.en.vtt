00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:12.459 
well we have an interesting segment

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:14.310 
well we have an interesting segment
today<00:00:12.580> on<00:00:12.969> with<00:00:13.120> Chris<00:00:13.450> from<00:00:13.809> the<00:00:13.929> regional

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.320 
today on with Chris from the regional

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.869 
today on with Chris from the regional
water<00:00:14.349> providers<00:00:14.980> consortium<00:00:15.639> and<00:00:15.789> we're

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:15.879 
water providers consortium and we're

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:17.430 
water providers consortium and we're
going<00:00:15.999> to<00:00:16.030> be<00:00:16.150> talking<00:00:16.420> about<00:00:16.450> backflow<00:00:17.140> and

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:17.440 
going to be talking about backflow and

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.769 
going to be talking about backflow and
really<00:00:17.800> a<00:00:17.830> lot<00:00:18.070> of<00:00:18.189> us<00:00:18.310> as<00:00:18.550> homeowners<00:00:19.119> or<00:00:19.510> just

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
really a lot of us as homeowners or just

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:21.060 
really a lot of us as homeowners or just
people<00:00:20.050> in<00:00:20.199> the<00:00:20.349> neighborhood<00:00:20.769> we<00:00:20.890> really

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
people in the neighborhood we really

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.679 
people in the neighborhood we really
don't<00:00:21.189> know<00:00:21.369> about<00:00:21.490> backflow<00:00:22.150> so<00:00:22.390> if<00:00:22.449> you<00:00:22.539> can

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689 
don't know about backflow so if you can

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.259 
don't know about backflow so if you can
explain<00:00:23.140> exactly<00:00:23.500> what<00:00:23.800> that<00:00:23.830> is<00:00:24.150> just<00:00:25.150> I

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:25.269 
explain exactly what that is just I

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:26.939 
explain exactly what that is just I
think<00:00:25.570> it<00:00:25.660> a<00:00:25.689> nutshell<00:00:26.050> the<00:00:26.500> best<00:00:26.710> thing<00:00:26.920> that

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949 
think it a nutshell the best thing that

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.599 
think it a nutshell the best thing that
you<00:00:27.099> could<00:00:27.369> say<00:00:27.669> is<00:00:28.000> that<00:00:29.429> backflow<00:00:30.429> is<00:00:30.580> a

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
you could say is that backflow is a

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.120 
you could say is that backflow is a
program<00:00:31.210> it's<00:00:31.660> a<00:00:31.839> state<00:00:32.080> regulated<00:00:32.710> program

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130 
program it's a state regulated program

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.160 
program it's a state regulated program
for<00:00:33.340> public<00:00:33.490> water<00:00:33.910> systems<00:00:34.420> a<00:00:34.719> cross

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
for public water systems a cross

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.810 
for public water systems a cross
connection<00:00:35.379> program<00:00:35.890> and<00:00:36.340> when<00:00:36.550> we<00:00:36.640> say

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
connection program and when we say

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.880 
connection program and when we say
backflow<00:00:37.270> we're<00:00:37.420> talking<00:00:37.750> about<00:00:37.870> water<00:00:38.590> has

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
backflow we're talking about water has

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.770 
backflow we're talking about water has
an<00:00:39.010> intended<00:00:39.489> Direction<00:00:40.030> supposed<00:00:40.539> to<00:00:40.660> go

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
an intended Direction supposed to go

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.260 
an intended Direction supposed to go
that<00:00:41.110> way<00:00:41.379> well<00:00:41.829> the<00:00:41.980> backflow<00:00:42.610> is<00:00:42.940> that

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
that way well the backflow is that

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.090 
that way well the backflow is that
through<00:00:43.510> water<00:00:43.660> hydraulics<00:00:44.379> for<00:00:44.649> some<00:00:44.829> reason

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
through water hydraulics for some reason

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.549 
through water hydraulics for some reason
the<00:00:45.190> water<00:00:45.340> is<00:00:45.550> coming<00:00:45.940> back<00:00:46.180> to<00:00:46.600> us<00:00:46.629> and<00:00:47.140> we

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
the water is coming back to us and we

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.470 
the water is coming back to us and we
don't<00:00:47.739> want<00:00:48.010> that<00:00:48.160> so<00:00:48.609> the<00:00:48.730> backflow<00:00:49.210> or<00:00:49.359> the

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
don't want that so the backflow or the

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.900 
don't want that so the backflow or the
cross<00:00:49.690> connection<00:00:50.199> program<00:00:50.500> that<00:00:51.100> the<00:00:51.399> public

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
cross connection program that the public

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.569 
cross connection program that the public
water<00:00:52.120> system<00:00:52.629> has<00:00:53.100> used<00:00:54.100> as<00:00:54.280> plumbing

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
water system has used as plumbing

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.720 
water system has used as plumbing
devices<00:00:55.239> to<00:00:55.899> keep<00:00:56.530> the<00:00:56.710> water<00:00:56.890> going<00:00:57.250> one

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
devices to keep the water going one

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.090 
devices to keep the water going one
direction<00:00:58.390> and<00:00:58.570> not<00:00:59.050> allowing<00:00:59.469> it<00:00:59.710> to<00:00:59.769> come

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
direction and not allowing it to come

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.639 
direction and not allowing it to come
back<00:01:00.340> and<00:01:00.550> bringing<00:01:01.120> anything<00:01:01.480> with<00:01:01.929> it<00:01:02.140> we

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
back and bringing anything with it we

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.259 
back and bringing anything with it we
wouldn't<00:01:02.980> want<00:01:03.309> in<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.670> water<00:01:03.910> so<00:01:04.180> it

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
wouldn't want in the water so it

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.210 
wouldn't want in the water so it
maintains<00:01:04.480> water<00:01:05.080> quality<00:01:05.619> excellent

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
maintains water quality excellent

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.160 
maintains water quality excellent
excellent<00:01:06.580> so<00:01:06.939> we're<00:01:07.390> right<00:01:07.630> at<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:07.780> street

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
excellent so we're right at the street

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.950 
excellent so we're right at the street
and<00:01:08.439> this<00:01:08.560> is<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:09.159> water<00:01:09.369> meter<00:01:09.640> yep<00:01:10.150> and<00:01:10.360> so

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
and this is the water meter yep and so

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.390 
and this is the water meter yep and so
really<00:01:11.170> everybody<00:01:11.470> has<00:01:11.770> one<00:01:11.979> you<00:01:12.070> should<00:01:12.280> know

really everybody has one you should know

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.520 
really everybody has one you should know
where<00:01:12.580> that<00:01:12.759> is<00:01:12.939> for<00:01:13.210> yes<00:01:13.360> in<00:01:13.810> case<00:01:14.229> you<00:01:14.380> ever

where that is for yes in case you ever
need<00:01:14.710> to<00:01:14.920> shut<00:01:15.070> off<00:01:15.159> the<00:01:15.189> water<00:01:15.490> because

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
need to shut off the water because

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.490 
need to shut off the water because
there's<00:01:16.030> some<00:01:16.180> kind<00:01:16.360> of<00:01:16.420> problem<00:01:16.540> yeah<00:01:17.079> that's

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
there's some kind of problem yeah that's

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.560 
there's some kind of problem yeah that's
a<00:01:17.619> handy<00:01:17.950> thing<00:01:17.979> to<00:01:18.280> always<00:01:18.909> know<00:01:19.210> where<00:01:19.450> your

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
a handy thing to always know where your

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.450 
a handy thing to always know where your
main<00:01:19.750> shutoff<00:01:20.079> valve<00:01:20.470> is<00:01:20.650> and<00:01:20.890> sometimes<00:01:21.100> it's

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
main shutoff valve is and sometimes it's

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.800 
main shutoff valve is and sometimes it's
here<00:01:21.670> in<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:21.820> box<00:01:22.030> you<00:01:22.150> might<00:01:22.270> even<00:01:22.390> have<00:01:22.600> one

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
here in the box you might even have one

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.289 
here in the box you might even have one
next<00:01:23.020> to<00:01:23.110> your<00:01:23.229> house<00:01:23.409> too<00:01:23.950> but<00:01:24.250> yeah<00:01:24.520> so<00:01:25.119> this

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
next to your house too but yeah so this

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:26.789 
next to your house too but yeah so this
is<00:01:25.360> where<00:01:25.659> your<00:01:25.840> meter<00:01:26.079> is<00:01:26.290> now<00:01:26.470> when<00:01:26.650> we're

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
is where your meter is now when we're

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.980 
is where your meter is now when we're
talking<00:01:26.979> about<00:01:27.340> cross<00:01:28.299> connection<00:01:28.840> and

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
talking about cross connection and

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.679 
talking about cross connection and
backflow<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:29.979> protecting<00:01:30.820> against<00:01:31.210> backflow

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
backflow and protecting against backflow

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:34.260 
backflow and protecting against backflow
two<00:01:32.409> most<00:01:32.649> common<00:01:33.280> places<00:01:33.579> that<00:01:34.000> you're<00:01:34.119> going

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
two most common places that you're going

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.940 
two most common places that you're going
to<00:01:34.299> find<00:01:34.570> a<00:01:34.659> backflow<00:01:35.229> assembly<00:01:35.350> which<00:01:35.920> is

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
to find a backflow assembly which is

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.889 
to find a backflow assembly which is
that<00:01:36.189> plumbing<00:01:36.670> device<00:01:37.060> that<00:01:37.479> keeps<00:01:37.659> the

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
that plumbing device that keeps the

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:39.480 
that plumbing device that keeps the
water<00:01:38.020> from<00:01:38.350> coming<00:01:38.380> back<00:01:38.860> you're<00:01:39.310> either

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
water from coming back you're either

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.969 
water from coming back you're either
going<00:01:39.729> to<00:01:39.820> find<00:01:40.119> it<00:01:40.270> near<00:01:40.630> your<00:01:40.810> meter<00:01:41.020> box<00:01:41.380> now

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
going to find it near your meter box now

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.139 
going to find it near your meter box now
in<00:01:42.130> this<00:01:42.280> case<00:01:42.549> because<00:01:42.729> we<00:01:42.970> have<00:01:43.000> the

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
in this case because we have the

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.600 
in this case because we have the
sidewalk<00:01:43.600> right<00:01:43.630> here<00:01:44.170> it<00:01:44.350> would<00:01:44.770> probably<00:01:45.040> be

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
sidewalk right here it would probably be

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:46.830 
sidewalk right here it would probably be
on<00:01:45.729> the<00:01:45.790> water<00:01:46.060> line<00:01:46.329> right<00:01:46.570> on<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.810> other

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840

irrigation<00:02:20.540> box<00:02:20.780> right<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.350> I<00:02:21.410> think<00:02:21.620> a<00:02:21.680> lot

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
irrigation box right and I think a lot

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.560 
irrigation box right and I think a lot
of<00:02:21.980> us<00:02:22.100> because<00:02:22.310> we<00:02:22.490> want<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:22.760> save<00:02:22.940> water<00:02:23.150> we

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
of us because we want to save water we

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.840 
of us because we want to save water we
want<00:02:23.750> a<00:02:23.810> water<00:02:24.110> efficient<00:02:24.620> Li<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.520> we<00:02:25.670> also

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
want a water efficient Li and we also

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.330 
want a water efficient Li and we also
want<00:02:26.270> to<00:02:26.360> make<00:02:26.810> it<00:02:26.840> easier<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.350> water<00:02:27.530> we<00:02:28.160> get

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
want to make it easier to water we get

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.800 
want to make it easier to water we get
irrigation<00:02:28.910> systems<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.480> if<00:02:29.540> you're<00:02:29.660> doing

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
irrigation systems and if you're doing

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.690 
irrigation systems and if you're doing
it<00:02:29.990> by<00:02:30.020> yourself<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.800> really<00:02:31.040> want<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.340> maybe

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
it by yourself you really want to maybe

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.160 
it by yourself you really want to maybe
do<00:02:31.910> all<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.180> trenching<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:32.720> everything<00:02:33.020> but

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
do all the trenching and everything but

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.830 
do all the trenching and everything but
call<00:02:33.500> professionals<00:02:34.130> in<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.910> establish<00:02:35.630> and

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
call professionals in to establish and

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.870 
call professionals in to establish and
to<00:02:35.990> install<00:02:36.440> all<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:36.920> backflow<00:02:37.250> devices<00:02:37.670> yeah

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
to install all the backflow devices yeah

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.820 
to install all the backflow devices yeah
most<00:02:38.390> definitely<00:02:39.110> and<00:02:39.260> then<00:02:39.440> that<00:02:39.650> way

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
most definitely and then that way

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.190 
most definitely and then that way
they'll<00:02:40.100> get<00:02:40.340> tested<00:02:40.910> too<00:02:41.240> you<00:02:41.570> know<00:02:41.720> I<00:02:41.750> mean

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
they'll get tested too you know I mean

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.430 
they'll get tested too you know I mean
you<00:02:43.000> people<00:02:44.000> do<00:02:44.239> install<00:02:44.780> them<00:02:45.080> on<00:02:45.230> their<00:02:45.410> own

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
you people do install them on their own

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.650 
you people do install them on their own
but<00:02:45.709> they<00:02:45.860> don't<00:02:46.070> understand<00:02:46.790> what<00:02:47.450> they're

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
but they don't understand what they're

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.110 
but they don't understand what they're
for<00:02:47.989> and<00:02:48.500> then<00:02:48.830> and<00:02:49.070> then<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.520> fact<00:02:49.730> again<00:02:50.030> it

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
for and then and then the fact again it

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.910 
for and then and then the fact again it
goes<00:02:50.209> back<00:02:50.270> to<00:02:50.480> that<00:02:50.750> regulated<00:02:51.320> program<00:02:51.709> that

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
goes back to that regulated program that

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.310 
goes back to that regulated program that
that<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.459> public<00:02:52.820> water<00:02:53.030> systems<00:02:53.570> have<00:02:53.870> and

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
that the public water systems have and

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.760 
that the public water systems have and
they<00:02:54.830> have<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:55.970> be<00:02:56.090> tested<00:02:56.690> on<00:02:56.900> an<00:02:57.350> annual

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
they have to be tested on an annual

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.910 
they have to be tested on an annual
basis<00:02:58.220> once<00:02:58.550> annually<00:02:59.239> and<00:02:59.510> so<00:03:00.110> if<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:00.590> do

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
basis once annually and so if you do

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.680 
basis once annually and so if you do
have<00:03:01.160> an<00:03:01.280> irrigation<00:03:01.520> installed<00:03:02.239> whether<00:03:02.540> you

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
have an irrigation installed whether you

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.600 
have an irrigation installed whether you
had<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:02.900> professional<00:03:03.560> do<00:03:03.739> it<00:03:03.770> for<00:03:04.220> you<00:03:04.340> or<00:03:04.370> you

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
had a professional do it for you or you

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.699 
had a professional do it for you or you
did<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:04.910> yourself<00:03:05.030> you<00:03:05.840> need<00:03:05.989> to<00:03:06.170> contact<00:03:06.380> your

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
did it yourself you need to contact your

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.770 
did it yourself you need to contact your
water<00:03:06.770> provider<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:07.610> let<00:03:07.760> them<00:03:08.000> know<00:03:08.300> that

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
water provider and let them know that

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.020 
water provider and let them know that
this<00:03:09.320> is<00:03:09.500> what<00:03:09.680> you've<00:03:09.830> done<00:03:10.010> and<00:03:10.370> you<00:03:10.910> know

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
this is what you've done and you know

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.759 
this is what you've done and you know
now<00:03:11.269> where<00:03:11.480> do<00:03:11.600> I<00:03:11.630> go<00:03:11.870> with<00:03:12.080> this<00:03:12.260> backflow

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
now where do I go with this backflow

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.370 
now where do I go with this backflow
assembly<00:03:12.890> well<00:03:13.700> you<00:03:13.790> do<00:03:13.910> have<00:03:13.940> another<00:03:14.380> system

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
assembly well you do have another system

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.930 
assembly well you do have another system
there<00:03:15.560> too<00:03:15.799> so<00:03:16.070> in<00:03:16.250> case<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.580> don't<00:03:16.700> have<00:03:16.820> one

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
there too so in case you don't have one

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.850 
there too so in case you don't have one
underground<00:03:17.720> there<00:03:17.959> is<00:03:18.049> an<00:03:18.200> above<00:03:18.500> ground

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
underground there is an above ground

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.370 
underground there is an above ground
yeah<00:03:19.070> there's<00:03:19.600> you<00:03:20.600> would<00:03:20.780> see<00:03:20.959> these<00:03:21.200> are

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
yeah there's you would see these are

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.020 
yeah there's you would see these are
above-ground<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.100> application<00:03:22.700> for<00:03:22.880> that

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
above-ground the application for that

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.400 
above-ground the application for that
one<00:03:23.269> is<00:03:23.420> that<00:03:23.570> they<00:03:23.750> are<00:03:23.780> installed<00:03:24.230> below

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
one is that they are installed below

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.500 
one is that they are installed below
ground<00:03:24.799> most<00:03:25.010> commonly<00:03:25.640> this<00:03:25.880> one<00:03:26.090> right<00:03:26.239> here

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
ground most commonly this one right here

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.970 
ground most commonly this one right here
it's<00:03:26.780> application<00:03:27.440> is<00:03:27.560> most<00:03:27.769> definitely

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
it's application is most definitely

below<00:03:30.320> ground<00:03:30.709> we<00:03:30.830> have<00:03:30.950> a<00:03:30.980> big<00:03:31.220> problem<00:03:31.489> not

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
below ground we have a big problem not

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.030 
below ground we have a big problem not
to<00:03:32.150> be<00:03:32.450> below<00:03:32.660> ground<00:03:32.930> but<00:03:33.110> this<00:03:33.680> one<00:03:33.860> right

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
to be below ground but this one right

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.740 
to be below ground but this one right
here<00:03:34.280> is<00:03:34.370> a<00:03:34.400> pressure<00:03:34.730> vacuum<00:03:35.209> breaker<00:03:35.480> now

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
here is a pressure vacuum breaker now

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.050 
here is a pressure vacuum breaker now
there's<00:03:35.959> this<00:03:36.170> one<00:03:36.410> and<00:03:36.440> one<00:03:36.830> very<00:03:37.040> similar<00:03:37.489> to

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
there's this one and one very similar to

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.410 
there's this one and one very similar to
it<00:03:38.560> this<00:03:39.560> is<00:03:39.769> a<00:03:39.799> testable<00:03:40.430> assembly<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.269> other

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
it this is a testable assembly the other

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.960 
it this is a testable assembly the other
one<00:03:41.660> is<00:03:41.810> actually<00:03:42.019> a<00:03:42.290> backflow<00:03:42.980> device<00:03:43.190> it's

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
one is actually a backflow device it's

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.479 
one is actually a backflow device it's
not<00:03:44.209> testable<00:03:44.840> but<00:03:45.080> it<00:03:45.200> can<00:03:45.410> be<00:03:45.590> inspected<00:03:46.010> and

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
not testable but it can be inspected and

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.539 
not testable but it can be inspected and
these<00:03:47.420> like<00:03:48.080> that<00:03:48.350> one<00:03:48.620> they<00:03:48.830> prevent<00:03:49.280> water

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
these like that one they prevent water

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.970 
these like that one they prevent water
from<00:03:49.700> flowing<00:03:50.299> backwards<00:03:51.110> but<00:03:51.410> these<00:03:51.620> two<00:03:51.830> are

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
from flowing backwards but these two are

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.490 
from flowing backwards but these two are
most<00:03:52.220> definitely<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.880> common<00:03:53.870> common<00:03:54.320> you'll

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
most definitely the common common you'll

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.870 
most definitely the common common you'll
see<00:03:54.709> them<00:03:54.920> out<00:03:55.100> there<00:03:55.130> and<00:03:55.430> if<00:03:55.519> you<00:03:55.640> have<00:03:55.850> a
