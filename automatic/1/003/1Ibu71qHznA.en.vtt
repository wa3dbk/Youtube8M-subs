these blood vessels you appear to have

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.929 
these blood vessels you appear to have

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
like an encephalitis like you see

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.490 
like an encephalitis like you see
classically<00:01:17.790> with<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.150> viral<00:01:18.630> encephalitis

in<00:01:20.369> addition<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.570> could<00:01:22.259> see<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.650> part<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.040> a

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
in addition you could see in part of a

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.520 
in addition you could see in part of a
ventricle<00:01:23.729> here<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.180> assume<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.930> ventricle

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
ventricle here I assume it's a ventricle

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.160 
ventricle here I assume it's a ventricle
because<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.460> land<00:01:26.759> by<00:01:29.540> ependymal<00:01:30.540> cells<00:01:30.570> and

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
because it's land by ependymal cells and

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.770 
because it's land by ependymal cells and
there's<00:01:31.740> portion<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.549> choroid<00:01:32.939> plexus<00:01:32.970> in

there's portion of a choroid plexus in

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.200 
there's portion of a choroid plexus in
it<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.530> can<00:01:34.740> see<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.490> there<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.790> some

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
it you can see that there is some

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.289 
it you can see that there is some
inflammation<00:01:36.829> so<00:01:37.829> inflammatory<00:01:38.729> cells

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
inflammation so inflammatory cells
