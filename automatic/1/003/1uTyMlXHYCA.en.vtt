so<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.420> lot<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.809> what's<00:00:10.170> common<00:00:10.530> in<00:00:10.620> rockabilly

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
so a lot of what's common in rockabilly

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.860 
so a lot of what's common in rockabilly
music<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.969> lot<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.120> early<00:00:12.450> music<00:00:12.540> like<00:00:12.840> that

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
music and a lot of early music like that

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.749 
music and a lot of early music like that
a<00:00:13.170> lot<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.469> western<00:00:13.860> music<00:00:13.980> country-western

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
a lot of western music country-western

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.849 
a lot of western music country-western
music<00:00:14.790> early<00:00:15.330> country<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.960> was<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.199> use<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.379> a

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
music early country it was the use of a

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.779 
music early country it was the use of a
large<00:00:17.130> reverb<00:00:17.990> but<00:00:18.990> most<00:00:19.230> commonly<00:00:19.980> was<00:00:20.580> a

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
large reverb but most commonly was a

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.150 
large reverb but most commonly was a
slap<00:00:21.240> back<00:00:21.390> delay<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:22.170> that's<00:00:22.619> an<00:00:22.800> effect

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
slap back delay and that's an effect

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.179 
slap back delay and that's an effect
that<00:00:23.369> was<00:00:23.869> more<00:00:24.869> or<00:00:24.900> less<00:00:25.050> honed<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.710> on<00:00:25.830> over

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
that was more or less honed in on over

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.429 
that was more or less honed in on over
the<00:00:26.279> years<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:27.150> can<00:00:27.300> get<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:27.660> effect

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
the years and you can get that effect

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.410 
the years and you can get that effect
with<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.920> delay<00:00:29.220> pedal<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.970> achieve<00:00:30.269> that

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
with a delay pedal to achieve that

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.209 
with a delay pedal to achieve that
setting<00:00:30.869> what<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.380> want<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:31.800> want<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:32.009> very

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
setting what you want is you want a very

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.700 
setting what you want is you want a very
quick<00:00:32.399> response<00:00:33.120> from<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.320> note<00:00:34.530> or<00:00:34.680> chord

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
quick response from the note or chord

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.130 
quick response from the note or chord
that<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.100> played<00:00:35.370> it's<00:00:35.850> not<00:00:36.120> it's<00:00:36.960> not<00:00:37.079> a

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
that you played it's not it's not a

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.020 
that you played it's not it's not a
stereo<00:00:37.559> effect<00:00:37.800> but<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.219> direct<00:00:38.640> sample

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
stereo effect but it is a direct sample

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.420 
stereo effect but it is a direct sample
that<00:00:39.180> happens<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:40.500> know<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> millisecond

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
that happens you know a millisecond

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.130 
that happens you know a millisecond
later<00:00:41.610> you're<00:00:42.450> not<00:00:42.570> really<00:00:42.719> thinking<00:00:42.930> about

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
later you're not really thinking about

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.569 
later you're not really thinking about
milliseconds<00:00:43.890> you're<00:00:44.010> really<00:00:44.190> just<00:00:44.340> trying

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
milliseconds you're really just trying

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.639 
milliseconds you're really just trying
to<00:00:44.760> get<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.000> quickest<00:00:45.360> response<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.379> it

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
to get the quickest response so that it

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.170 
to get the quickest response so that it
so<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.129> sounds<00:00:47.430> like<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.789> note<00:00:48.000> or<00:00:48.149> chord

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
so that sounds like the note or chord

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.670 
so that sounds like the note or chord
you<00:00:48.450> played<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.750> bouncing<00:00:49.110> off<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> wall<00:00:49.469> right

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
you played is bouncing off a wall right

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.110 
you played is bouncing off a wall right
back<00:00:49.829> at<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.129> or<00:00:50.160> you're<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.610> cavernous

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120

that<00:00:54.539> effect<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.460> space<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:57.180> what<00:00:57.300> I've<00:00:57.420> done

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
that effect of space so what I've done

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.680 
that effect of space so what I've done
here<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.920> order<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.370> achieve<00:00:59.670> this<00:01:00.180> slap<00:01:00.480> back

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690

here in order to achieve this slap back
delay<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.949> have<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.489> let's<00:01:02.910> start<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629

delay is I have the let's start on the
right<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.049> have<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.320> blend<00:01:04.530> setting<00:01:04.920> right

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
right I have the blend setting right

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.300 
right I have the blend setting right
about<00:01:05.420> 12<00:01:06.420> o'clock<00:01:06.799> so<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.830> I'm<00:01:07.950> getting<00:01:08.220> an

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
about 12 o'clock so that I'm getting an

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.179 
about 12 o'clock so that I'm getting an
even<00:01:08.490> amount<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.810> clean<00:01:10.710> sound<00:01:10.950> from<00:01:11.100> my

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
even amount of clean sound from my

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.100 
even amount of clean sound from my
guitar<00:01:11.340> versus<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> effect<00:01:12.270> level<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
guitar versus the effect level the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.890 
guitar versus the effect level the
middle<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.650> feedback<00:01:14.420> which<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.450> is

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
middle is the feedback which is is

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.330 
middle is the feedback which is is
pretty<00:01:16.229> far<00:01:16.409> down<00:01:16.560> I'd<00:01:16.770> say<00:01:16.920> about<00:01:17.040> nine

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
pretty far down I'd say about nine

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.520 
pretty far down I'd say about nine
o'clock<00:01:17.490> if<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.390> if<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.780> listen

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.399 

what<00:01:24.530> ends<00:01:24.710> up<00:01:24.770> happening<00:01:24.829> is<00:01:25.369> is<00:01:26.240> um<00:01:26.840> it

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
what ends up happening is is um it

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.080 
what ends up happening is is um it
reacts<00:01:27.829> with<00:01:28.069> the<00:01:28.219> delay<00:01:28.490> setting<00:01:28.729> which<00:01:29.060> is

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
reacts with the delay setting which is

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.809 
reacts with the delay setting which is
next<00:01:29.359> to<00:01:29.509> it<00:01:29.689> the<00:01:30.469> delay<00:01:30.740> is<00:01:31.009> let's<00:01:31.429> go<00:01:31.609> over

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:31.819 
next to it the delay is let's go over

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:36.370 
next to it the delay is let's go over
here<00:01:31.969> to<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.270> knob<00:01:32.600> on<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:32.780> left<00:01:35.229> now<00:01:36.229> you're

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
here to the knob on the left now you're

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.630 
here to the knob on the left now you're
hearing<00:01:36.619> a<00:01:36.679> little<00:01:36.890> bit<00:01:36.979> of<00:01:37.069> a<00:01:37.130> pitch<00:01:37.310> shift

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
hearing a little bit of a pitch shift

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.169 
hearing a little bit of a pitch shift
and<00:01:37.909> that<00:01:37.969> is<00:01:38.840> is<00:01:39.140> very<00:01:40.009> common<00:01:40.340> in<00:01:40.429> the<00:01:40.520> analog

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
and that is is very common in the analog

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.029 
and that is is very common in the analog
delay<00:01:41.450> pedals<00:01:41.780> because<00:01:41.929> the<00:01:42.409> tape<00:01:42.649> delays

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
delay pedals because the tape delays

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:45.969 
delay pedals because the tape delays
that<00:01:43.640> they<00:01:43.819> had<00:01:44.000> such<00:01:44.299> as<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.569> Echoplex<00:01:44.979> when

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
that they had such as the Echoplex when

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.789 
that they had such as the Echoplex when
you<00:01:46.099> would<00:01:46.250> adjust<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.509> delay<00:01:48.109> setting<00:01:48.469> and

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
you would adjust the delay setting and

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.620 
you would adjust the delay setting and
the<00:01:48.890> speed<00:01:49.219> you<00:01:49.670> would<00:01:49.759> slow<00:01:50.090> down<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:50.420> tape

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
the speed you would slow down the tape

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.889 
the speed you would slow down the tape
and<00:01:50.840> you'd<00:01:50.929> get<00:01:51.109> almost<00:01:51.349> like<00:01:51.590> a<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:52.899> loop

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
and you'd get almost like a the loop

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:55.510 
and you'd get almost like a the loop
would<00:01:54.049> slow<00:01:54.349> down<00:01:54.379> so<00:01:54.860> fast<00:01:55.129> that<00:01:55.280> you<00:01:55.399> would

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
would slow down so fast that you would

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.249 
would slow down so fast that you would
get<00:01:55.670> almost<00:01:55.909> a<00:01:56.060> pitch<00:01:56.239> shift<00:01:56.569> that's<00:01:57.020> not

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
get almost a pitch shift that's not

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.440 
get almost a pitch shift that's not
intentional<00:01:57.860> but<00:01:57.890> it<00:01:58.099> is<00:01:58.280> not<00:01:58.399> it<00:01:58.579> is<00:01:58.610> it<00:01:58.909> is<00:01:59.090> in

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
intentional but it is not it is it is in

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.729 
intentional but it is not it is it is in
effect<00:01:59.659> that<00:02:00.049> you<00:02:00.110> can<00:02:00.319> use<00:02:00.469> with<00:02:00.649> these

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:00.739 
effect that you can use with these

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:05.050 
effect that you can use with these
pedals<00:02:01.099> that's<00:02:01.189> pretty<00:02:01.459> cool<00:02:03.819> so<00:02:04.819> as<00:02:04.939> I

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
pedals that's pretty cool so as I

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.650 
pedals that's pretty cool so as I
increase<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.390> delay<00:02:05.629> setting<00:02:10.329> you<00:02:11.329> hear<00:02:11.480> that

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
increase the delay setting you hear that

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.390 
increase the delay setting you hear that
that's<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:11.930> delay<00:02:12.200> time<00:02:12.440> so<00:02:13.129> what<00:02:13.250> you're

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
that's the delay time so what you're

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.170 
that's the delay time so what you're
hearing<00:02:13.640> is<00:02:13.760> you're<00:02:13.910> hearing<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.910> amount<00:02:17.090> of

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
hearing is you're hearing the amount of

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.569 
hearing is you're hearing the amount of
time<00:02:17.359> in<00:02:17.540> between<00:02:17.690> each<00:02:18.019> note<00:02:18.489> increasing<00:02:19.489> or

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
time in between each note increasing or

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:23.349 
time in between each note increasing or
decreasing<00:02:19.700> in<00:02:20.269> speed<00:02:21.040> as<00:02:22.040> I<00:02:22.790> decrease<00:02:23.180> the

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:23.359 
decreasing in speed as I decrease the

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:27.940 
decreasing in speed as I decrease the
knob<00:02:24.160> you<00:02:25.160> hear<00:02:25.370> it's<00:02:25.489> pretty<00:02:25.549> quick<00:02:26.739> now<00:02:27.739> if

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
knob you hear it's pretty quick now if

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.259 
knob you hear it's pretty quick now if
you<00:02:28.069> adjust<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.430> feedback<00:02:28.760> setting<00:02:29.090> let's

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
you adjust the feedback setting let's

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:35.949 
you adjust the feedback setting let's
let's<00:02:29.569> hear<00:02:29.720> how<00:02:29.810> that<00:02:29.870> is<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:35.540> now<00:02:35.690> what<00:02:35.840> we're

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
let's hear how that is so now what we're

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.259 
let's hear how that is so now what we're
doing<00:02:35.989> is<00:02:36.319> we're<00:02:36.620> increasing<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:37.730> a<00:02:37.760> minimum<00:02:38.180> a

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
doing is we're increasing to a minimum a

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.690 
doing is we're increasing to a minimum a
maximum<00:02:38.450> level<00:02:38.959> of<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:40.040> amount<00:02:40.340> of<00:02:40.489> the

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
maximum level of the amount of the

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.270 
maximum level of the amount of the
repeats<00:02:41.060> speed<00:02:41.810> of<00:02:41.900> repeat<00:02:42.200> with<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.069> delay

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
repeats speed of repeat with the delay

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.740 
repeats speed of repeat with the delay
setting<00:02:43.489> amount<00:02:44.150> of<00:02:44.239> repeats<00:02:44.510> with<00:02:44.660> the

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
setting amount of repeats with the

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.180 
setting amount of repeats with the
feedback<00:02:44.959> setting<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:46.329> as<00:02:47.329> far<00:02:47.540> as<00:02:47.599> the

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
feedback setting and as far as the

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.289 
feedback setting and as far as the
language<00:02:49.190> every<00:02:49.489> pedal<00:02:49.730> has<00:02:49.849> a<00:02:49.880> different<00:02:50.209> way

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
language every pedal has a different way

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.210 
language every pedal has a different way
of<00:02:50.329> a<00:02:50.630> different<00:02:51.410> name<00:02:51.530> they<00:02:51.620> may<00:02:51.739> call<00:02:51.950> it<00:02:52.069> but

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
of a different name they may call it but

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:00.690 
of a different name they may call it but
that's<00:02:52.370> basically<00:02:52.819> it

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.760
