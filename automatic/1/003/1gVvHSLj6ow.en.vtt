00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:12.259
 One of the most important problems in communicating with it is with location 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:16.800
 that a great deal of uncertainty remains 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.720
 we are on a big screen 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.539
 the second major problem is that you become a woman patient trucker in the conversation 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.739
 was very often treated as a child and a child comes unharmed 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.979
 you also make you scriba it is not so much that the ash cloud is out of you 

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:35.830
 as a child I am also not in conversations when you have my 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.020
 move that very quickly 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.180
 That 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.620
 that ratio that way 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.620
 and that is because the opening week 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.130
 the the specialists in principle as 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.420
 and who knows, in principle, he has already passed on in oudenaarde after his studies 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.570
 to 15 20 seconds has broken through I catch myself that I am five 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.610
 knows what I want to do in seconds than continued research 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.830
 alcohol work very quickly 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.740
 if you like 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.100
 don't watch the patient, you go directly to the doctor and that happens too 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.630
 always 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.170
 and it has always been that way 6 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.660
 if you become a better conversation partner 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.550
 and you can choose 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.000
 then you better choose the two of you for that road and then you take care of it 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 that your blinders remain open at the doctor 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.450
 as a patient 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.580
 can you 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.090
 anyway the villagers with questions 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.590
 unclear 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.590
 and not to direct those blinders 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.490
 on a certain road 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.550
 but 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.980
 by requesting this diagnosis 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.560
 for example, to ask the world top that there are other options 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.820
 and why 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.570
 why don't you think they are 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.310
 those are the most thankless places ending a short distance I say 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.280
 I think the debate is the most important 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.530
 some of them are only 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.000
 also gives you the opportunity to 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.070
 if you get the information from patients I am sorry I hear 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.940
 forget to say that 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.700
 so we only do the ad better 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.700
 for the process that means time 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:18.199
 as patients 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:21.039
 you also have a personal responsibility among the artists 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:24.829
 provide information that he needs so that you get together 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.780
 can come further in terms of both diagnosis and therapy
