know if I could solve eat a whole pot of
those<00:03:31.300> many<00:03:32.300> in<00:03:32.540> one<00:03:32.690> sitting<00:03:32.990> even<00:03:33.380> I<00:03:33.590> think

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
those many in one sitting even I think

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.320 
those many in one sitting even I think
it's<00:03:34.790> a<00:03:34.880> more<00:03:35.060> like<00:03:35.240> a<00:03:35.270> novelty<00:03:35.990> item<00:03:36.610> being<00:03:37.610> so

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
things like that again novelty is

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.470 
things like that again novelty is
probably<00:03:43.250> part<00:03:43.430> of<00:03:43.580> it<00:03:43.730> and<00:03:45.250> yeah<00:03:46.250> so<00:03:46.610> out<00:03:47.060> of<00:03:47.120> 5

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
probably part of it and yeah so out of 5

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.540 
probably part of it and yeah so out of 5
