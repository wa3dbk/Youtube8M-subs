00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 Hello dear viewers 

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:09.000
 most travelers commit 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.639
 set and typical mistakes of course this 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 goes sideways and spends both nerves and and 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.320
 often a considerable amount of money 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.390
 an example of one of these errors 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.730
 is mishandling 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.130
 baggage due to which many tourists 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.830
 quite often lose it in transit 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.960
 but for some reason luggage is lost 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.570
 first some travelers don't 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.480
 remove old tags and from their luggage 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.270
 if you do not take off the pawn with the luggage 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.000
 the machine can count for example the old 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:47.190
 tag and where will the luggage be sent later 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.239
 will be unknown 2 incorrectly specified 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.460
 the baggage claim happens so 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.829
 tourists planning to land not in 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.739
 the end point of borisu together 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.559
 transplants for example to save 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.609
 take a ticket bangkok cues that flies with 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.430
 Moscow transfer 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.360
 plan to go out not in Kiev but in Moscow 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:13.439
 and forget to make sure yes where flies 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.540
 luggage to the place of transfer or to the end in 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.729
 In this case, you should always check 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.009
 in which direction fly into the baggage and 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:25.490
 make sure you unload together 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:29.420
 transplants for example Moscow they are in Kiev 3 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.790
 luggage is poorly packed 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.740
 due to bad baggage 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.460
 some things may disappear 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.439
 either all baggage is lost therefore 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.070
 it is recommended to use a belt for 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.340
 luggage 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.229
 so you will be calmer for what 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.470
 with your things on the way nothing 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:54.540
 what happens is another recommendation 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.810
 before packing write on a piece of paper 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.140
 in capital letters your first name and 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.799
 phone flight number and direction to 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.380
 fly 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.580
 and attach this entry to your luggage 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.349
 can be stuck for example with scotch tape 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.400
 thanks to this your luggage will not be lost 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:18.159
 if he for example by chance 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:20.170
 the tag flies further the following typical 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:22.900
 an error occurs during the design 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.519
 insurance and concerns chronic 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.140
 diseases keep in mind that 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.870
 the overwhelming majority of the company does not consider 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.049
