going to talk to you about two concepts

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:09.470 
going to talk to you about two concepts
that<00:00:07.950> are<00:00:08.010> very<00:00:08.220> important<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.910> plainly

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
that are very important to plainly

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.290 
that are very important to plainly
guitar<00:00:09.900> which<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:10.800> after<00:00:11.400> you've<00:00:11.910> learned<00:00:12.120> all

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
guitar which is after you've learned all

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.210 
guitar which is after you've learned all
your<00:00:12.480> scale<00:00:12.720> patterns<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.530> learned<00:00:13.920> how<00:00:14.160> to

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:14.220 
your scale patterns and learned how to

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.650 
your scale patterns and learned how to
noodle<00:00:14.640> around<00:00:14.730> with<00:00:15.090> all<00:00:15.210> those<00:00:15.360> patterns

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
noodle around with all those patterns

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.259 
noodle around with all those patterns
and<00:00:15.990> found<00:00:16.199> some<00:00:16.410> common<00:00:16.619> rips<00:00:17.009> ok<00:00:17.400> but<00:00:18.029> these

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:18.269 
and found some common rips ok but these

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:20.419 
and found some common rips ok but these
are<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.830> patterns<00:00:19.830> or<00:00:20.009> these<00:00:20.160> are<00:00:20.339> the

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:20.429 
are the patterns or these are the

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.060 
are the patterns or these are the
concepts<00:00:20.939> that<00:00:21.119> come<00:00:21.359> after<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:22.199> that's<00:00:22.890> a

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
concepts that come after that that's a

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.560 
concepts that come after that that's a
given<00:00:23.490> you're<00:00:23.640> supposed<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.060> already<00:00:24.179> have

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
given you're supposed to already have

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.630 
given you're supposed to already have
learned<00:00:24.900> all<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.140> stuff<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.859> worked<00:00:26.490> on

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
learned all that stuff and worked on

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.819 
learned all that stuff and worked on
that<00:00:26.669> stuff<00:00:27.119> ok<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:28.140> course<00:00:28.169> it's<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.650> work

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:28.829 
that stuff ok and of course it's a work

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.560 
that stuff ok and of course it's a work
in<00:00:28.949> progress<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.550> really<00:00:29.880> master<00:00:30.089> all<00:00:30.419> your

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
in progress to really master all your

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.720 
in progress to really master all your
scale<00:00:30.810> patterns<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.380> all<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.650> but<00:00:32.190> so<00:00:32.490> then

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
scale patterns and all that but so then

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.600 
scale patterns and all that but so then
once<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.330> have<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.600> these<00:00:34.470> concepts<00:00:35.130> really

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
once you have that these concepts really

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.570 
once you have that these concepts really
become<00:00:36.090> important<00:00:36.720> the<00:00:37.290> first<00:00:37.680> concept<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.520> to

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:38.580 
become important the first concept is to

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.170 
become important the first concept is to
know<00:00:39.120> your<00:00:39.150> root<00:00:39.840> notes<00:00:40.170> ok<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.520> root<00:00:41.820> note<00:00:42.030> of

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
know your root notes ok the root note of

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.090 
know your root notes ok the root note of
a<00:00:42.300> chord<00:00:42.720> is<00:00:42.990> the<00:00:43.320> coke<00:00:43.560> as<00:00:43.740> the<00:00:43.770> note<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
a chord is the coke as the note the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.510 
a chord is the coke as the note the
court<00:00:44.580> is<00:00:44.700> named<00:00:45.030> after<00:00:45.300> or<00:00:45.720> a<00:00:45.950> scale<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.310> root

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
court is named after or a scale the root

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.120 
court is named after or a scale the root
note<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.910> scale<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.810> is<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.530> note<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
note of a scale is this is the note the

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.800 
note of a scale is this is the note the
scale<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.640> named<00:00:50.880> after<00:00:51.120> if<00:00:51.330> I'm<00:00:51.450> talking

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:51.810 
scale is named after if I'm talking

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.780 
scale is named after if I'm talking
about<00:00:51.870> an<00:00:52.080> a<00:00:52.260> chord<00:00:52.650> that<00:00:53.190> I'm<00:00:53.370> talking<00:00:53.520> about

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
an a note it's as simple as that all

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.920 
an a note it's as simple as that all
right<00:00:55.980> if<00:00:56.280> it's<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.640> D<00:00:56.880> chord<00:00:57.210> it's<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.480> denote

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
right if it's a D chord it's a denote

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.500 
right if it's a D chord it's a denote
all<00:00:58.320> right<00:00:58.500> I'm<00:00:59.430> going<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.850> take<00:01:00.000> my<00:01:00.240> main

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
in the 145 progression so if I were

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.630 
in the 145 progression so if I were
playing<00:01:15.929> chords<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.560> have<00:01:16.679> an<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.890> chord<00:01:17.280> a

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640

decoy and an E chord ok well so what are

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:24.319 
decoy and an E chord ok well so what are
my<00:01:21.090> root<00:01:21.299> notes<00:01:21.479> for<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:22.490> D<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.729> E<00:01:24.060> of

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.870 
my root notes for that a D and E of
course<00:01:24.659> okay<00:01:25.170> but<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.039> not<00:01:26.100> just<00:01:26.399> knowing

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
course okay but it's not just knowing

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.819 
course okay but it's not just knowing
them<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.299> knowing<00:01:27.689> where<00:01:27.899> they<00:01:28.079> are<00:01:28.109> that's

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
them it's knowing where they are that's

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.179 
them it's knowing where they are that's
important<00:01:29.429> to<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.609> lead<00:01:29.789> guitar<00:01:30.119> player<00:01:30.149> ok

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
at this I'm going to move up and down

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.190 
at this I'm going to move up and down
the<00:04:33.310> neck<00:04:33.490> basically<00:04:34.450> what<00:04:34.600> i'm<00:04:34.720> going<00:04:34.870> to<00:04:34.990> do

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
the neck basically what i'm going to do

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.300 
the neck basically what i'm going to do
is<00:04:35.230> take<00:04:35.740> my<00:04:36.150> main<00:04:37.150> pentatonic<00:04:37.900> pattern<00:04:38.310> and

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
is take my main pentatonic pattern and

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.610 
is take my main pentatonic pattern and
keep<00:04:40.210> in<00:04:40.330> mind<00:04:40.540> that<00:04:40.570> that<00:04:40.720> main<00:04:40.960> pentatonic

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
keep in mind that that main pentatonic

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.520 
keep in mind that that main pentatonic
pattern<00:04:41.700> fits<00:04:42.700> right<00:04:43.030> in<00:04:43.210> place<00:04:43.450> with<00:04:43.870> that

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
pattern fits right in place with that

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.710 
pattern fits right in place with that
that<00:04:45.160> cord<00:04:45.490> right<00:04:45.640> there<00:04:45.850> the<00:04:45.970> e<00:04:46.000> shaped<00:04:46.510> barre

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
that cord right there the e shaped barre

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.230 
that cord right there the e shaped barre
chord<00:04:47.080> the<00:04:47.470> main<00:04:47.740> pentatonic<00:04:48.490> pattern<00:04:48.580> gets

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
chord the main pentatonic pattern gets

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.120 
chord the main pentatonic pattern gets
in<00:04:49.390> room<00:04:49.750> note<00:04:50.020> from<00:04:50.380> the<00:04:50.560> same<00:04:50.800> place<00:04:51.010> that

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
in room note from the same place that

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.880 
in room note from the same place that
the<00:04:51.640> ink<00:04:52.180> bar<00:04:52.390> chord<00:04:52.690> does<00:04:52.870> well<00:04:53.530> so<00:04:53.680> there's

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
the ink bar chord does well so there's

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.190 
the ink bar chord does well so there's
an<00:04:54.070> a<00:04:54.190> chord<00:04:54.520> where<00:04:55.090> would<00:04:55.240> I<00:04:55.300> have<00:04:55.510> a<00:04:55.540> D<00:04:55.840> chord

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
an a chord where would I have a D chord

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.380 
an a chord where would I have a D chord
I'd<00:04:56.410> have<00:04:56.590> it<00:04:56.620> up<00:04:56.830> at<00:04:56.980> the<00:04:57.070> 10th<00:04:57.340> fret<00:04:57.670> so<00:04:58.240> I'm

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390
