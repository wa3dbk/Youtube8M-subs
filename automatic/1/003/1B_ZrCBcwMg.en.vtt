going to do is fly down here and shoot

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.189 
going to do is fly down here and shoot
another<00:00:29.820> portal<00:00:30.390> here<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.750> we're<00:00:30.900> gonna<00:00:31.019> fly

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
another portal here and we're gonna fly

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.330 
another portal here and we're gonna fly
all<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.439> way<00:00:31.470> across<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.890> get<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.099> cube

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
all the way across to get the cube

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.190 
all the way across to get the cube
really<00:00:32.579> really<00:00:32.759> fast<00:00:33.000> drop<00:00:33.780> down<00:00:33.960> even

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
really really fast drop down even

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.049 
really really fast drop down even
further<00:00:34.579> quickly<00:00:35.579> doing<00:00:35.760> everything

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
further quickly doing everything

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.150 
further quickly doing everything
shooting<00:00:36.480> another<00:00:36.660> portal<00:00:37.020> here<00:00:37.260> jump<00:00:37.800> on<00:00:38.040> top

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
shooting another portal here jump on top

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.310 
shooting another portal here jump on top
of<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.340> ramp<00:00:38.579> with<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.969> cube<00:00:39.300> put<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.110> cube

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
of this ramp with the cube put the cube

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.229 
of this ramp with the cube put the cube
on<00:00:40.410> top<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:40.800> laser<00:00:41.070> which<00:00:41.399> will<00:00:41.640> allow

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
on top of this laser which will allow

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.440 
on top of this laser which will allow
you<00:00:42.300> which<00:00:42.809> will<00:00:42.989> drop<00:00:43.440> down<00:00:44.000> now<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.059> ramp

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
you which will drop down now the ramp

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.240 
you which will drop down now the ramp
behind<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.559> can<00:00:46.680> go<00:00:46.950> on<00:00:47.070> this

this is a redirection akyuu catch the
Kuban<00:01:01.109> midair<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.440> might<00:01:01.770> have<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.039> jump<00:01:02.309> or

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
Kuban midair you might have to jump or

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.280 
Kuban midair you might have to jump or
you<00:01:02.609> might<00:01:02.789> miss<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.270> think<00:01:03.719> about<00:01:03.780> jumping

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
you might miss it so think about jumping

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.630 
you might miss it so think about jumping
or<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.710> might<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.100> fly<00:01:05.220> right<00:01:05.309> over<00:01:05.489> your

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
or you it might just fly right over your

that one shoot the portal re aim it a

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.539 
that one shoot the portal re aim it a
little<00:01:12.510> bit<00:01:12.630> if<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.810> have<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.460> but<00:01:14.460> remember

little bit if you have to but remember
this<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.119> 70<00:01:15.479> seconds<00:01:15.840> pick<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.710> secondly

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
this is 70 seconds pick up the secondly

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.969 
this is 70 seconds pick up the secondly
the<00:01:17.400> original<00:01:18.000> cube<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.420> regular<00:01:19.170> cube<00:01:19.470> fly

to the top all the way across and then

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.530 
to the top all the way across and then
drop<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.770> top<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.159> thing<00:01:26.369> fast<00:01:27.299> as<00:01:27.479> you

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
drop it on top of this thing fast as you

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.600 
drop it on top of this thing fast as you
possibly<00:01:27.900> can<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.380> right<00:01:28.829> here<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.340> where<00:01:29.520> you
