been<00:00:17.560> doing<00:00:17.800> this<00:00:17.919> a<00:00:18.100> lot<00:00:18.310> of<00:00:18.430> the<00:00:18.520> pieces<00:00:18.699> have

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:19.449 
been doing this a lot of the pieces have

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:21.960 
been doing this a lot of the pieces have
been<00:00:19.660> very<00:00:19.900> similar<00:00:20.199> with<00:00:20.529> folds<00:00:20.920> instead<00:00:21.880> of

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
been very similar with folds instead of

been very similar with folds instead of
folding<00:00:22.090> to<00:00:22.330> the<00:00:22.420> right<00:00:22.570> that<00:00:22.750> you<00:00:22.840> fold<00:00:23.050> to

folding to the right that you fold to
the<00:00:23.289> left<00:00:23.529> or<00:00:24.090> use<00:00:25.090> different<00:00:25.449> sides<00:00:25.720> for<00:00:25.960> the

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
the left or use different sides for the

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.830 
the left or use different sides for the
pockets<00:00:26.470> when<00:00:26.680> we<00:00:26.800> put<00:00:27.070> the<00:00:27.160> pieces<00:00:27.310> together

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
different pieces from the different

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.689 
different pieces from the different
styles<00:00:35.229> we've<00:00:35.379> already<00:00:35.530> done<00:00:35.799> so<00:00:36.040> far<00:00:36.220> today

styles we've already done so far today

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:39.180 
styles we've already done so far today
for<00:00:37.600> example<00:00:37.930> you<00:00:38.110> could<00:00:38.290> use<00:00:38.470> four<00:00:38.769> pieces

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
for example you could use four pieces

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.610 
for example you could use four pieces
from<00:00:39.460> the<00:00:39.640> pinwheel<00:00:40.030> and<00:00:40.239> four<00:00:40.989> pieces<00:00:41.350> from

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
from the pinwheel and four pieces from

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.469 
from the pinwheel and four pieces from
the<00:00:41.890> flowery<00:00:42.489> pinwheel<00:00:42.909> and<00:00:43.150> put<00:00:43.360> them

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:43.479 
the flowery pinwheel and put them

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:45.000 
the flowery pinwheel and put them
together<00:00:43.659> and<00:00:43.900> see<00:00:44.199> what<00:00:44.320> kind<00:00:44.530> of<00:00:44.589> result<00:00:44.949> you

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
together and see what kind of result you

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.340 
together and see what kind of result you
can<00:00:45.280> get<00:00:45.430> so<00:00:46.059> it's<00:00:46.420> a<00:00:46.570> lot<00:00:46.720> of<00:00:46.750> fun<00:00:46.960> to<00:00:47.110> kind<00:00:47.290> of

feel free to kind of play around with
different<00:02:36.700> results<00:02:37.150> here<00:02:37.480> I'm<00:02:38.140> going<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.380> fold

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
different results here I'm going to fold

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.970 
different results here I'm going to fold
turn<00:02:39.370> mine<00:02:39.580> around<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.420> fold<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.739> right

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
turn mine around and fold to the right

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.520 
turn mine around and fold to the right
then<00:02:42.430> this<00:02:42.640> way<00:02:42.850> and<00:02:43.600> then<00:02:43.930> I'm<00:02:43.989> going<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.260> use

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
then this way and then I'm going to use

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.580 
then this way and then I'm going to use
this<00:02:45.060> little<00:02:46.060> part<00:02:46.420> here<00:02:46.480> as<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.840> guideline<00:02:47.380> as

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
this little part here as a guideline as

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.210 
this little part here as a guideline as
I've<00:02:47.800> crease<00:02:48.450> from<00:02:49.450> this<00:02:49.690> edge<00:02:49.900> here<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:50.890> fold

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
I've crease from this edge here and fold

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.420 
I've crease from this edge here and fold
over<00:02:52.290> once<00:02:53.290> I<00:02:53.380> get<00:02:53.530> that<00:02:53.650> lined<00:02:53.920> up<00:02:54.070> I'm<00:02:54.280> going

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
over once I get that lined up I'm going

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.640 
over once I get that lined up I'm going
to<00:02:54.489> get<00:02:54.580> a<00:02:54.610> good<00:02:54.730> crease<00:02:54.970> in<00:02:55.209> there<00:02:55.470> I'm<00:02:56.470> going

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
to get a good crease in there I'm going

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.220 
to get a good crease in there I'm going
to<00:02:56.709> open<00:02:57.070> everything<00:02:57.280> up<00:02:57.549> and<00:02:58.450> then<00:02:59.049> I'm<00:02:59.140> gonna

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
to open everything up and then I'm gonna

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.590 
to open everything up and then I'm gonna
use<00:02:59.500> this<00:02:59.739> center<00:03:00.580> crease<00:03:00.880> here<00:03:01.330> that's

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
use this center crease here that's

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.479 
use this center crease here that's
already<00:03:01.750> going<00:03:02.019> inwards<00:03:02.650> I'm<00:03:02.950> gonna<00:03:03.160> make<00:03:03.340> it

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
already going inwards I'm gonna make it

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.710 
already going inwards I'm gonna make it
pop<00:03:03.940> outwards<00:03:04.540> as<00:03:04.870> I<00:03:05.140> push<00:03:05.560> over<00:03:05.920> to<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.190> right

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
pop outwards as I push over to the right

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.940 
pop outwards as I push over to the right
then<00:03:07.720> you<00:03:07.750> should<00:03:08.019> get<00:03:08.170> a<00:03:08.200> piece<00:03:08.470> that<00:03:08.739> looks

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
then you should get a piece that looks

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.680 
then you should get a piece that looks
like<00:03:09.130> this<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:11.760> I'm<00:03:12.760> going<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:13.000> go<00:03:13.150> ahead<00:03:13.209> then

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
like this and I'm going to go ahead then

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.210 
like this and I'm going to go ahead then
and<00:03:14.019> do<00:03:15.299> repeat<00:03:16.299> these<00:03:16.450> steps<00:03:16.660> on<00:03:17.170> seven<00:03:18.100> more

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
and do repeat these steps on seven more

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.820 
and do repeat these steps on seven more
pieces<00:03:18.459> of<00:03:18.640> paper<00:03:18.900> so<00:03:19.900> that<00:03:19.930> I<00:03:20.140> can<00:03:20.320> then<00:03:20.350> put

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
pieces of paper so that I can then put

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.520
