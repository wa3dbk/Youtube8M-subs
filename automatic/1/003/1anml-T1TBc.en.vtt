00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
put that away and we didn't get as many

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.279 
put that away and we didn't get as many
shots<00:00:44.700> off<00:00:45.000> as<00:00:45.239> we<00:00:45.360> typically<00:00:45.719> do<00:00:45.989> but<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
shots off as we typically do but the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.810 
shots off as we typically do but the
balls<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.649> we<00:00:46.770> were<00:00:46.890> serving<00:00:47.190> across<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
balls that we were serving across the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.369

face<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.300> goal<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.629> were<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.079> dangerous

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
face of the goal that were so dangerous

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.340

well<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.510> think<00:00:57.570> with<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:58.050> team<00:00:58.320> which<00:00:58.949> is

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
well I think with this team which is

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.650 
well I think with this team which is
different<00:00:59.430> from<00:00:59.520> teams<00:00:59.820> with<00:01:00.000> past<00:01:00.239> as<00:01:00.539> this

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
different from teams with past as this

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.900 
different from teams with past as this
team<00:01:00.899> believes<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.590> we<00:01:02.219> have<00:01:02.340> found<00:01:02.550> every

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
team believes and we have found every

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.820 
team believes and we have found every
every<00:01:03.390> way<00:01:03.629> possible<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:04.229> score<00:01:04.589> this<00:01:04.769> year

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
every way possible to score this year

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.920

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
and we've had different people step up

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.660 
and we've had different people step up
to<00:01:07.140> do<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.409> whether<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.740> was<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.890> defender<00:01:08.430> off<00:01:08.610> a

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
to do it whether it was a defender off a

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.260
