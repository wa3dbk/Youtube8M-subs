00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:08.880
 yes my people in this video today 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.889
 I want to show you what you do 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.380
 if your iphone is not anymore 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.240
 start as you see happening here now 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.130
 Somehow I can not do that 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.900
 homebutton let me know this device 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.600
 try to turn it on 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.189
 nothing that is here on my mac 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.550
 infected when I plug in the cable 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.609
 nothing happens and what can I do 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.489
 So there is the possibility 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.160
 that we say okay the device that hangs 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.750
 somewhere it could be now 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.730
 that the device only the whole time 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.920
 shows apple and keeps restarting 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.690
 that's analogous to what you can do here 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.270
 exactly the same solution on walls and indeed 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.649
 push her the power button and the home 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:58.440
 button for ten seconds even ten 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:01:00.000
 seconds 5 6 7 8 9 10 and now you can 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.980
 we turn it back on 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.890
 and it starts up again that should be it 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.570
 even without problems work like 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.549
 Even if the whole time here, that said 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.890
 Apple logo is no problem 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.560
 so you can without problems at any time new 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.240
 so start us here we are again 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.340
 can just unlock and ours 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.810
 use the device again now there is 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.159
 but also the possibility 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.229
 that our devices are here all the time 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.750
 such a wheel indicates and again 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.549
 and again the springboard restarts 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.650
 or our device just starts 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.960
 new again we realize it is so 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.400
 because of everything when everything vibrates if it 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.350
 infected if that is up 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.820
 but vibration alarm has stopped it 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.280
 always starts again one does not come 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.780
 back on the springboard and you have 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.350
 a jailbreak installs what can you do 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.150
 do 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.009
 Now you can start up the device and 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.100
 with the loud button on the side 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.170
 So the press here under the newsweek 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.390
 you see here loud and quiet and then 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.430
 pressed the top button until such time as 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.520
 The device is started all the time 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.070
 What are we doing with it? 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.590
 so that the so-called mobile sap straight 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.820
 that kind of backup if you 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.960
 Now you have something installed 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.549
 Look at the weather, for example 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.910
 up here is gone now I have here 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.690
 neither no icann and you see 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.550
 my folders 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.470
 I have here ago in horn demanded 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.360
 install somehow 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.890
 that's all gone and that's easy 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.900
 to justify that we have that now 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.490
 so-called mobile straight issued 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.170
 and with it we switch these, so to speak 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.010
 fuse function and that has the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.780
 see if any now 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.940
 have installed incompatible tweak 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.520
 then you can do it anytime if 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.810
 Something is quite simple, so to speak 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.210
 You can come back here now 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.970
 go in cydia and the tweet 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.350
 uninstall and so yes I can 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.160
 to use my iphone again 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.630
 but now it can be that too 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.860
 my iphone instead of all the time and the 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.990
 I'll give you both tips just now 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.120
 did not help then pushes 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.010
 No matter where you've been since 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.400
 But now it has to be infected 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.850
 his 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.110
 push her for ten seconds and power 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.060
 home button how we made it work 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.000
 So have power button and home button 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.750
 for about ten seconds to about 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.310
 the display of the device goes out 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.050
 and now we just leave that up here 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.730
 homebutton go and hold the power 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.840
 Button pressed further without him 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.840
 let go in between 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.430
 so he also tells me my own here 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.019
 itunes is open now 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.120
 still the program digital pictures with 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.130
 gone up and this program so 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.430
 itunes is likely to be iphone in one now 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:31.260
 seconds detect even been through 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.660
 small loading bar is there and now 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.090
 the iphone recognized the same in the so-called 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.040
 off mode here we already see 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.870
 wait and now we can do that 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.910
 simple device with a click on here 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.320
 restore restore iphone 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.000
 and we should use it again 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.860
 So if any of these can do so 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.480
 have problems write it in the 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.580
 Comment if I helped this 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.260
 stores as the video from a favorit 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.580
 if you are something at some point then 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.410
 you can do it again anytime 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.810
 Watch because that should be for everyone 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.519
 future generations of devices 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.650
 so also works for ipod 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:04.019
 touch and ipad as well as for the 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.970
 iphone yes and if that's what you're golfing for 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.950
 then please give a rating 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.420
 and a comment if you like that 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.310
 has or not we quite interesting 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.480
 then thanks for seeing and i hope 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.290
