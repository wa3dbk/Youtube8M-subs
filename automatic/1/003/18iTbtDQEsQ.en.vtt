what<00:00:47.550> I'm<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.969> do<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.510> I'm<00:00:48.690> going<00:00:48.899> to

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020

natural pinky color I think you want a
color<00:00:55.949> that's<00:00:56.070> fairly<00:00:56.520> similar<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.570> your<00:00:57.780> lips

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760

the<00:01:08.340> lips<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.860> just<00:01:10.860> use<00:01:11.040> your<00:01:11.220> finger<00:01:11.700> to
