 if we continue investigating my channel and 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.910
 it comes out a little cell but my 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.730
 aspirations is to have all the games 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.250

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.760
 I 'll start with skyward sword and 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.100
 possibly I continued with swing princeps
