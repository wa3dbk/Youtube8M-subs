20<00:00:00.359> years<00:00:00.510> ago<00:00:00.719> you<00:00:00.780> would<00:00:00.989> have<00:00:01.020> flashed<00:00:01.319> it

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
20 years ago you would have flashed it

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.320 
20 years ago you would have flashed it
and<00:00:02.220> it<00:00:02.340> would<00:00:02.429> have<00:00:02.520> found<00:00:02.669> it<00:00:02.909> three<00:00:03.090> or<00:00:03.179> four

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
and it would have found it three or four

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.390 
and it would have found it three or four
times<00:00:03.540> and<00:00:04.410> then<00:00:04.950> you<00:00:05.040> would<00:00:05.190> have<00:00:05.279> put<00:00:05.370> a

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
times and then you would have put a

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.920 
times and then you would have put a
conventional<00:00:06.000> layer<00:00:06.150> later<00:00:06.359> for<00:00:06.629> that

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
conventional layer later for that

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.540 
conventional layer later for that
machine<00:00:07.290> cuts<00:00:07.649> all<00:00:07.830> those<00:00:08.010> working<00:00:08.189> that's

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
machine cuts all those working that's

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.620 
machine cuts all those working that's
how<00:00:08.670> you<00:00:08.730> can<00:00:08.880> spray<00:00:09.150> it<00:00:09.179> and<00:00:09.330> conserve

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
how you can spray it and conserve

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.360 
how you can spray it and conserve
moisture<00:00:09.840> you<00:00:10.410> know<00:00:10.500> it's<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.740> less<00:00:10.889> fuel<00:00:11.160> right

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
moisture you know it's a less fuel right

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.610 
moisture you know it's a less fuel right

trash<00:00:39.540> ability<00:00:40.079> that's<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.559> go<00:00:40.680> through<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
trash ability that's to go through the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.139 
trash ability that's to go through the
the<00:00:42.180> trash<00:00:42.450> was<00:00:42.660> zero<00:00:42.840> till<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.920> also<00:00:44.879> it's

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
the trash was zero till and also it's

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.479 
the trash was zero till and also it's
flexibility<00:00:45.719> for<00:00:45.930> contour<00:00:46.379> banks<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.039> are<00:00:47.340> in

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
flexibility for contour banks and are in

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.000 
flexibility for contour banks and are in
this<00:00:47.610> undulating<00:00:48.030> country<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.710> speed

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
this undulating country and the speed

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.250 
this undulating country and the speed
that<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.280> can<00:00:50.520> plant<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.969> now<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.480> greater<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.020> we

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
that I can plant it now is greater so we

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.049 
that I can plant it now is greater so we
can<00:00:52.530> get<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> weed<00:00:52.980> in<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.370> better

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
can get the weed in it a better

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.330 
can get the weed in it a better
opportunity<00:00:54.539> time<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.680> get<00:00:55.829> try<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.190> get

opportunity time to get try to get

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.080 
opportunity time to get try to get
maximum<00:00:56.610> yield

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
maximum yield

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.229 
maximum yield
we<00:00:57.600> put<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.870> grain<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:58.289> about<00:00:58.500> 50<00:00:58.890> kgs<00:00:59.430> to<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
we put the grain on about 50 kgs to the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.460 
we put the grain on about 50 kgs to the
hectare<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:01.430> the<00:01:02.430> let's<00:01:02.850> start<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.359> zinc<00:01:03.660> is

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
hectare and the let's start a zinc is

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.840 
hectare and the let's start a zinc is
the<00:01:04.559> fertilizer<00:01:04.799> that's<00:01:05.250> going<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:05.580> with<00:01:05.729> it

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
the fertilizer that's going on with it

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.910 
the fertilizer that's going on with it
and<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.000> goes<00:01:06.150> on<00:01:06.390> about<00:01:06.479> fifty<00:01:07.080> machine<00:01:07.680> does

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
and it goes on about fifty machine does

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.160 
and it goes on about fifty machine does
20<00:01:08.220> hectares<00:01:08.549> an<00:01:08.729> air<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.450> that's<00:01:09.689> about<00:01:09.810> five

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
20 hectares an air so that's about five

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.560 
20 hectares an air so that's about five
hours<00:01:10.560> for<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.890> refill<00:01:11.280> because<00:01:11.909> yeah<00:01:12.210> we've

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
hours for a refill because yeah we've

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.340 
hours for a refill because yeah we've
gone<00:01:12.750> basically<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.939> zero<00:01:14.939> till<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:16.080> little

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
gone basically to zero till and a little

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.350 
gone basically to zero till and a little
bit<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.560> minimum<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.580> can<00:01:17.790> go<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:18.210> any

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
bit of minimum to it can go for any

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.870 
bit of minimum to it can go for any
trace<00:01:18.659> situation<00:01:19.350> 20<00:01:20.100> bags<00:01:20.250> are<00:01:20.520> called<00:01:20.729> wheat

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
trace situation 20 bags are called wheat

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.670 
trace situation 20 bags are called wheat
stubble<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.479> then<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.110> auger<00:01:22.439> minute

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
stubble and then so it's auger minute

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.380 
stubble and then so it's auger minute
and<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.130> went<00:01:23.310> for<00:01:23.490> time<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.939> hectare<00:01:24.210> this

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
and it went for time to the hectare this

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.420 
and it went for time to the hectare this
machine<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:24.840> said<00:01:25.049> straight<00:01:26.040> for<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.310> so
