00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
it really is an essential component and

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.610 
it really is an essential component and
there<00:00:49.079> are<00:00:49.200> over<00:00:50.120> 100<00:00:51.120> million<00:00:51.600> neurons<00:00:52.199> in

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
it's actually our second brain so it's

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.560 
it's actually our second brain so it's
really<00:00:58.949> vital<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.579> keep<00:00:59.789> this<00:00:59.940> healthy<00:01:00.359> and

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
really vital to keep this healthy and

foods are the healthier they are for you

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.210 
foods are the healthier they are for you
the<00:01:48.030> more<00:01:48.240> vitality<00:01:48.689> more<00:01:49.140> biophotons<00:01:50.070> are

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
the more vitality more biophotons are

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.580 
the more vitality more biophotons are
available<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.729> food<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.659> if<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.290> have

most commercial food stores and I like
natto<00:02:37.349> I<00:02:37.590> don't<00:02:37.830> necessarily<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.340> flavor<00:02:38.640> but

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
natto I don't necessarily the flavor but

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.850 
natto I don't necessarily the flavor but
I<00:02:38.970> messed<00:02:39.299> that<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.810> flavor<00:02:40.140> or<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.590> taste

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
I messed that the flavor or the taste

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.890 
I messed that the flavor or the taste
with<00:02:41.489> lots<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:41.880> good<00:02:42.150> Himalayan<00:02:42.630> sea<00:02:42.870> salt

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
cut up onions and that seems to work

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.580 
cut up onions and that seems to work
pretty<00:02:48.060> well<00:02:48.209> for<00:02:48.510> me<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:49.140> consume<00:02:49.470> it

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
pretty well for me and I consume it

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.809 
pretty well for me and I consume it
because<00:02:49.799> it's<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.069> highest<00:02:50.340> source<00:02:50.670> of

diarrhea and in some cases even terminal

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.210

diarrhea<00:03:15.569> so<00:03:15.780> that's<00:03:16.290> one<00:03:16.650> of<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.829> reasons<00:03:17.130> I

diarrhea so that's one of the reasons I
do<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.549> so<00:03:17.850> so<00:03:18.239> clearly<00:03:18.780> that's<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.769> strategy

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
do it so so clearly that's a strategy

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.190 
do it so so clearly that's a strategy
that<00:03:20.280> you<00:03:20.519> can<00:03:20.700> deploy<00:03:20.970> for<00:03:21.569> your<00:03:21.690> fit<00:03:21.900> your

for yourself now many of you are not
going<00:04:16.400> to<00:04:16.459> simply<00:04:16.790> be<00:04:16.910> able<00:04:17.060> to<00:04:17.120> do<00:04:17.209> it<00:04:17.330> because

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
going to simply be able to do it because

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.780 
going to simply be able to do it because
of<00:04:17.600> the<00:04:17.720> cost<00:04:18.080> or<00:04:18.410> the<00:04:18.470> inconvenience<00:04:19.310> if

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
of the cost or the inconvenience if

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.520 
of the cost or the inconvenience if
that's<00:04:20.000> the<00:04:20.180> case<00:04:20.359> I<00:04:20.570> would<00:04:20.690> encourage<00:04:20.810> you<00:04:21.440> to

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
of them out there so how do you go

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.150 
of them out there so how do you go
through<00:04:35.480> the<00:04:35.690> confusion<00:04:35.870> well<00:04:36.260> this<00:04:36.980> is<00:04:37.130> a

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
through the confusion well this is a

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.180 
through the confusion well this is a
problem<00:04:37.940> that<00:04:38.360> my<00:04:38.870> staff<00:04:39.140> addressed<00:04:39.920> over<00:04:40.040> the

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
problem that my staff addressed over the

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.440 
problem that my staff addressed over the
last<00:04:40.370> year<00:04:40.550> we've<00:04:40.580> looked<00:04:40.820> at<00:04:40.940> a<00:04:41.030> number<00:04:41.270> of

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
last year we've looked at a number of

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.000 
last year we've looked at a number of
different<00:04:41.600> products<00:04:42.110> out<00:04:42.290> there<00:04:42.320> and<00:04:42.920> we

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
different products out there and we

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.260 
different products out there and we
thought<00:04:43.190> that<00:04:43.250> we<00:04:43.580> could<00:04:43.610> come<00:04:43.850> up<00:04:43.880> with<00:04:44.060> one

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
thought that we could come up with one

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.120 
thought that we could come up with one
that<00:04:44.420> was<00:04:44.570> as<00:04:44.750> good<00:04:44.990> or<00:04:45.050> better<00:04:45.260> than<00:04:45.740> anyone

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
that was as good or better than anyone

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.310 
that was as good or better than anyone
out<00:04:46.460> there<00:04:46.490> and<00:04:46.940> you<00:04:47.360> can<00:04:47.510> see<00:04:47.750> the<00:04:47.870> results<00:04:48.260> of

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
out there and you can see the results of

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.020 
out there and you can see the results of
our<00:04:48.470> evaluation<00:04:48.980> on<00:04:49.070> this<00:04:49.190> Patriot<00:04:49.670> that's

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
our evaluation on this Patriot that's

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.340 
our evaluation on this Patriot that's
exactly<00:04:50.540> what<00:04:50.720> we<00:04:50.810> did<00:04:50.840> we<00:04:51.050> produced

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
exactly what we did we produced

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.320 
exactly what we did we produced
approximately<00:04:51.530> just<00:04:52.190> release<00:04:52.550> that<00:04:52.820> we

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
approximately just release that we

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.360 
approximately just release that we
believe<00:04:53.720> is<00:04:53.750> one<00:04:54.140> of<00:04:54.230> the<00:04:54.320> best<00:04:54.710> on<00:04:54.920> the<00:04:55.160> market

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
believe is one of the best on the market

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.750 
believe is one of the best on the market
so<00:04:56.180> if<00:04:56.690> you<00:04:57.080> and<00:04:57.410> it's<00:04:57.740> a<00:04:57.830> really<00:04:58.190> helpful

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
so if you and it's a really helpful

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.090 
so if you and it's a really helpful
resource<00:04:59.720> for<00:04:59.990> you<00:05:00.140> and<00:05:00.350> your<00:05:00.740> family<00:05:00.770> to

consider adopting into your optimal
health<00:05:03.680> program<00:05:04.210> so<00:05:05.210> really<00:05:06.169> the<00:05:06.320> keys<00:05:06.680> again

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
health program so really the keys again

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.640 
health program so really the keys again
are<00:05:07.310> to<00:05:07.580> be<00:05:07.760> making<00:05:08.419> sure<00:05:08.780> that<00:05:08.990> you<00:05:09.140> avoid<00:05:09.350> the
