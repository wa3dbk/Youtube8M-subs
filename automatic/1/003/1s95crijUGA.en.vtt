00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.589
 Well, no 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.800
 good guys welcome to my channel a 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.710
 again and as you can see the title and 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.060
 here today we are going to make the character of 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.950
 some characters that I like the most 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.200
 johnny depp and is jack sparrow the captain 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.300
 jack sparrow I love this character 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.060
 It has a lot of character makes me laugh 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.430
 that's great I like it very much it 's a 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.439
 easy-to-make character just takes a 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.420
 little bit of with tournament accentuation traits 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.489
 that resemble those of johnny depp and 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.860
 above all, it has as its mark the eyes 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.600
 very intense blacks and with the line of 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.130
 very intense water if you want to see how 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.470
 we make you see 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.430
 let's start that is very easy what 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.650
 first thing we're going to do is going to be 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.270
 mark different forms of our 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.330
 face let's accent the shadows 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.370
 also outlining the lights giving a 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.410
 little lighting we are going to outline 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.420
 especially under the cheekbones creating 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.250
 a jaw much more marked and 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.380
 we are also going to contaminate the nose to 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.750
 make it finer let's also give a 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.180
 touch of contour on the temple and above 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.190
 of the eyebrows before moving on 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.729
 the lighting that will be in the parts 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.560
 opposite under the cheekbones 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.240
 above the cheekbones in the arch of the 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.240
 nose and also on the forehead 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.680
 I'm also fixed that I applied a 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.149
 little in the area of ​​dark circles to give 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.579
 luminosity and also cover the dark circles 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.170
 and the next step is to give a little 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.579
 shape to my lips and I will create a 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.070
 little the way of johnny depp I'm going to 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.110
 define the lips by applying a little 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.700
 Corrector in the corners towards the 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.560
 half of the lower lip and the next 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.299
 step will be to give the effect as of 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.549
 burned from having been in a bar with 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.049
 lamar'll catch a red blush 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.060
 cream in start to apply it on top of 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.560
 the cheekbones above the bridge of the 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.660
 nose connecting these two parts 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.519
 also a little on the chin and also 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.840
 in the forehead and do not worry we're going 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.940
 to apply now the base of 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.980
 makeup and it's going to be very very 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.630
 very integrated I will apply a base of 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.340
 darker dark makeup of my tone 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.750
 of skin to give that effect more 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.430
 tanning the face I'm going to apply it to 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.530
 taps to not move the colors that 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.489
 have worked below and what this 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.410
 what he's going to do to us is create a 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.760
 uniformity across the face and give that 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.769
 effect that we have created below 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.160
 colors that is much more integral 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.160
 natural 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.569
 already with loose poles in just the area 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.430
 under the cheekbones and in 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.080
 the forehead the rest I want to leave it like this 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.650
 juicy because that's how the skin is 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.650
 character 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.070
 let's now give the contours more 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.630
 highlighted for that what to use a 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.850
 shadow and just at the end after having 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.350
 dusty everything I'll catch a shadow 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.210
 brown colored mole and start to mark 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.580
 especially the area below the cheekbones 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.440
 a more central area of ​​the face going down 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.510
 towards alhama the chin creating a 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.580
 very dramatic effect then I'm going to 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.020
 Blur first with a brush 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.550
 blur and then with my fingers remain 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.500
 very integrated and we do it with the 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.210
 fingers I will also mark the chin 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.220
 so that the jaw is left so that 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.350
 is much more square I will go back to 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.250
 touch up the outline that I made in the 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.250
 nose edges 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.190
 and we will retouch the corrector that 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.990
 We have applied in the area of ​​the lips 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.780
 before moving on to the eyes let's do 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.180
 the red characteristic of jack sparrow 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.800
 is to apply black shadow on the line of 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.930
 lashes towards the middle of the eyelid 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.030
 mobile and also on the bottom line of 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.530
 tabs let's blur the first one a 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.269
 little bit with a brush and then with the 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.700
 finger so that it is a bit like more 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.320
 month and as more in less we work less 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.790
 careful let's do the same thing the other 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.860
 eye and we will apply it on the line 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.450
 lower and upper water an eyeliner 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.960
 black that we will take to the area 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.960
 of the lacrimal 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.400
 a touch chose the eyebrows the way is 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.530
 ascending straight with a slight descent 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.539
 at the end and we will start to paste the 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.280
 facial hair I'm going to use more take that 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.409
 it's a post -cut glue I'm going to 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.000
 Apply a little in the mustache area and 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:03.460
 tap it to activate 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.370
 the hair that I'm going to apply I've taken it 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.569
 of the nape of my wig so it's the same 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.039
 the hair I'll use 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:12.909
 wig and I have not had to spend money 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:16.569
 in prostheses in different products nor 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:18.610
 mustaches or anything caught several strips like 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:20.229
 you see strands I have stuck them in the way 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.849
 that I wanted and once we have the 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.860
 way always following the growth 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:25.539
 of the hair let's cut the length and 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.270
 also the upper base so that it remains 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:30.610
 much more polished we will do the same 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.310
 with a kind of little girl who has 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.380
 under the lower lip and then 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.440
 we will do the same with the beard the bar 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.479
 is going to be a line that goes along the 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.460
 chin will not rise from the edge of the 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.710
 chin as you see now that I have a 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.120
 we can center a little more 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.979
 how are we going to make the lips or more 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.960
 even fill them a little bit more 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:51.729
 climbing the natural shadow I will apply 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.190
 the same red blush on the lip 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:54.870
 superior and a little shadow 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.320
 in the middle of the lower lip to give 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.320
 that volume 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.650
 the loss we are also going to cut the 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:11.750
 top to make it more polished 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.220
 in the braids that he wears are late 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.139
 of races of my wig that I have made 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.970
 braid and I'm sticking and I'm 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:18.830
 sticking with a more or less separation 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.840
 of a finger between them we go for the 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.599
 final details wear a shirt 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.340
 white and a black vest I'm going to put the 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:26.960
 wig that is a drag wig the 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.240
 I who have added the beads 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.430
 you can do it however you want and the last 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.800
 touch will be put a red scarf matte 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.440
 tied to the forehead leaving some 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.120
 strands of dreadlocks that come out 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.719
 back of the front and already 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.949
 is 

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:41.949
