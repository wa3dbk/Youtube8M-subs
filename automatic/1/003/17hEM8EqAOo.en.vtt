00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.989
 the website 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.099
 bring your hair after one side and put it 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.099
 fixed with an elastic band 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.890

 hair out your tail and fasten it with 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.610
 an elastic band 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.789
 divide the rest of your start into 3 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.039
 equal picking 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:14.080
 lay the slices so that the third picks 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:16.690
 it braids 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.740
 now start braiding start with 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.740
 the left one 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.289
 so put the inner pick over it 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.369
 second pick and really the third pick 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:27.090
 the braid 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.090
 over it again 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:38.510
 pick the right one so the outer one 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.510
 pluck and place it under the now third pluck 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.300
 bring the tuft over the braid 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:54.350
 and really pick the inside again 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.350
 second pick over 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.110
 below 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:13.940
 outer pick under the third block and 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.940
 again about the second 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.690
 what you always do is the inside 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.820
 Pick the two lay pruth and 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.630
 in the third place if you have it 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.580
 done 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.800
 Grab the outer pick and place it 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.070
 under the third pick and over the 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.150
 second when you're done with braids 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.150
 say you wash my rubber band 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.850
 Formula effect lets you braid a little 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.440
 pulling apart 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.860
 you do this by picking the outermost 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.860
 to pull 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.510
 and this is how you double the super fun 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.510
