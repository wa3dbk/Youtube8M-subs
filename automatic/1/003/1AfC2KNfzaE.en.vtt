00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
working out you have someone else

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.280 
working out you have someone else
depending<00:03:57.420> on<00:03:57.569> you<00:03:57.720> when<00:03:58.019> you<00:03:58.079> have<00:03:58.260> a

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
depending on you when you have a

don't really want to go to the gyms I'm
gonna<00:04:06.600> skip<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.959> workout<00:04:07.109> but<00:04:07.859> if<00:04:07.950> you<00:04:08.040> know

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220

you have somebody else who's gonna be at

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.930 
you have somebody else who's gonna be at
the<00:04:10.560> gym<00:04:10.799> you<00:04:11.280> know<00:04:11.370> they're<00:04:11.549> going<00:04:11.730> to<00:04:11.790> be

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
the gym you know they're going to be

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.759 
the gym you know they're going to be
there<00:04:12.180> at<00:04:12.360> a<00:04:12.390> certain<00:04:12.629> time<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:13.170> they<00:04:13.739> are

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
there at a certain time and they are

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.710 
there at a certain time and they are
depending<00:04:14.310> on<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.610> to<00:04:14.730> show<00:04:14.909> up<00:04:15.120> so<00:04:15.480> you<00:04:15.540> can

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
depending on you to show up so you can

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.360 
depending on you to show up so you can
do<00:04:15.810> your<00:04:15.930> training

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
do your training

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.229 
do your training
together<00:04:16.850> it's<00:04:17.750> a<00:04:17.959> lot<00:04:18.139> more<00:04:19.030> difficult<00:04:20.030> to

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
together it's a lot more difficult to

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.939 
together it's a lot more difficult to
say<00:04:20.600> no<00:04:20.630> when<00:04:21.260> you<00:04:21.380> have<00:04:21.530> somebody<00:04:21.889> else

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
say no when you have somebody else

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.070 
say no when you have somebody else
depending<00:04:22.610> on<00:04:22.729> you<00:04:22.820> I<00:04:23.030> mean<00:04:23.360> very<00:04:23.510> often<00:04:23.780> we

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
depending on you I mean very often we

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.780 
depending on you I mean very often we
will<00:04:24.229> go<00:04:24.410> out<00:04:24.620> of<00:04:24.650> our<00:04:24.860> way<00:04:25.010> for<00:04:25.040> someone<00:04:25.610> else

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
will go out of our way for someone else

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.719 
will go out of our way for someone else
when<00:04:26.389> we<00:04:26.540> can<00:04:26.720> kind<00:04:26.930> of<00:04:26.990> like<00:04:27.110> get<00:04:27.500> slack<00:04:27.800> when

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
when we can kind of like get slack when

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.909 
when we can kind of like get slack when
it's<00:04:28.880> just<00:04:29.090> ourselves<00:04:29.290> so<00:04:30.290> get<00:04:30.530> yourself<00:04:30.860> a

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
it's just ourselves so get yourself a

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:32.650 
it's just ourselves so get yourself a
training<00:04:31.160> partner<00:04:31.400> someone<00:04:32.060> that<00:04:32.210> you<00:04:32.389> can

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
training partner someone that you can

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.950 
training partner someone that you can
work<00:04:33.320> with<00:04:33.590> and<00:04:33.860> preferably<00:04:34.639> someone<00:04:35.570> who<00:04:35.630> is

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
work with and preferably someone who is

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.500 
work with and preferably someone who is
serious<00:04:36.560> and<00:04:36.770> motivated<00:04:37.610> themselves<00:04:38.180> about

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
serious and motivated themselves about

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.590 
serious and motivated themselves about
working<00:04:38.870> out<00:04:39.020> and<00:04:39.820> ideally<00:04:40.820> I<00:04:40.850> mean<00:04:41.060> I'm<00:04:41.180> if

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
working out and ideally I mean I'm if

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.689 
working out and ideally I mean I'm if
you<00:04:41.690> can<00:04:41.900> do<00:04:42.199> it<00:04:42.350> the<00:04:42.620> ideal<00:04:43.040> scenario<00:04:43.280> is<00:04:43.669> to

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 
you can do it the ideal scenario is to

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.340 
you can do it the ideal scenario is to
get<00:04:43.910> someone<00:04:44.180> who<00:04:44.270> is<00:04:44.419> bigger<00:04:44.720> and<00:04:45.020> stronger

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
get someone who is bigger and stronger

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.530 
get someone who is bigger and stronger
than<00:04:45.560> you<00:04:45.860> are<00:04:45.889> if<00:04:46.310> you're<00:04:46.880> working<00:04:47.120> out<00:04:47.330> with

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
than you are if you're working out with

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.240 
than you are if you're working out with
someone<00:04:47.810> who<00:04:47.930> is<00:04:48.080> better<00:04:48.350> than<00:04:48.470> you<00:04:48.650> bigger

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
someone who is better than you bigger

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.000 
someone who is better than you bigger
stronger<00:04:49.699> more<00:04:49.910> athletic<00:04:50.090> whatever<00:04:50.900> that<00:04:51.770> is

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
stronger more athletic whatever that is

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.890 
stronger more athletic whatever that is
going<00:04:52.220> to<00:04:52.280> help<00:04:52.370> to<00:04:52.550> pull<00:04:52.820> you<00:04:53.030> up<00:04:53.060> to<00:04:53.600> a<00:04:53.630> higher

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
going to help to pull you up to a higher

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.110 
going to help to pull you up to a higher
level<00:04:54.280> versus<00:04:55.280> if<00:04:55.400> you're<00:04:55.520> working<00:04:55.729> out<00:04:55.910> with

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
level versus if you're working out with

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.170 
level versus if you're working out with
someone<00:04:56.300> who<00:04:56.449> is<00:04:56.889> not<00:04:57.889> as<00:04:58.100> motivated<00:04:58.310> who<00:04:59.000> is

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
someone who is not as motivated who is

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.159 
someone who is not as motivated who is
not<00:04:59.570> as<00:04:59.810> strong<00:05:00.110> not<00:05:00.830> as<00:05:01.690> serious<00:05:02.690> about<00:05:03.020> their

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
not as strong not as serious about their

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.020 
not as strong not as serious about their
training<00:05:03.380> that's<00:05:03.770> going<00:05:04.039> to<00:05:04.190> pull<00:05:04.550> you<00:05:04.760> down

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
training that's going to pull you down

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.200 
training that's going to pull you down
so<00:05:05.960> the<00:05:06.710> best<00:05:07.010> scenario<00:05:07.280> is<00:05:07.699> obviously<00:05:08.060> to

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
so the best scenario is obviously to

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.670 
so the best scenario is obviously to
train<00:05:08.479> with<00:05:08.750> people<00:05:08.780> who<00:05:09.260> are<00:05:09.380> bigger

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
train with people who are bigger

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.400 
train with people who are bigger
stronger<00:05:10.160> more<00:05:10.580> athletic<00:05:11.030> and<00:05:11.600> to<00:05:11.960> feed<00:05:12.229> off

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
stronger more athletic and to feed off

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.840 
stronger more athletic and to feed off
their<00:05:12.620> energy<00:05:12.830> feed<00:05:13.280> off<00:05:13.430> their<00:05:13.639> knowledge

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
their energy feed off their knowledge

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.250 
their energy feed off their knowledge
because<00:05:14.270> obviously<00:05:14.389> if<00:05:14.780> they're<00:05:14.930> at<00:05:15.020> a<00:05:15.050> higher

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
because obviously if they're at a higher

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.050 
because obviously if they're at a higher
level<00:05:15.320> than<00:05:16.190> they're<00:05:16.490> doing<00:05:16.789> things

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
level than they're doing things

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.000 
level than they're doing things
differently<00:05:17.600> than<00:05:17.900> you<00:05:18.050> were<00:05:18.320> they<00:05:18.740> got<00:05:18.889> more

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
differently than you were they got more

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.070 
differently than you were they got more
experience<00:05:19.340> whatever<00:05:19.729> but<00:05:20.389> again<00:05:20.599> feed<00:05:20.870> off

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
experience whatever but again feed off

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.379 
experience whatever but again feed off
them<00:05:21.380> and<00:05:21.590> use<00:05:22.370> that<00:05:22.550> to<00:05:22.789> push<00:05:23.060> you<00:05:23.210> to<00:05:23.360> a

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
them and use that to push you to a

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.260 
them and use that to push you to a
higher<00:05:23.660> level<00:05:24.010> rather<00:05:25.010> than<00:05:25.220> getting<00:05:25.880> sucked

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
higher level rather than getting sucked

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.659 
higher level rather than getting sucked
down<00:05:26.450> by<00:05:26.690> people<00:05:26.900> who<00:05:27.139> are<00:05:27.550> demotivated<00:05:28.550> and

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
down by people who are demotivated and

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.969 
down by people who are demotivated and
not<00:05:29.150> really<00:05:29.419> serious<00:05:29.660> about<00:05:29.870> training<00:05:30.260> so

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
not really serious about training so

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:32.409 
not really serious about training so
again<00:05:31.220> those<00:05:31.490> are<00:05:31.550> two<00:05:31.820> tips<00:05:32.060> that<00:05:32.210> you<00:05:32.270> can
