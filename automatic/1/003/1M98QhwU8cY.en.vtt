this is what we're working on today
basically<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.510> machine<00:00:19.020> that's<00:00:19.439> gonna

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
basically it is a machine that's gonna

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.620 
basically it is a machine that's gonna
just<00:00:19.859> splatter<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:20.730> there's<00:00:21.029> like<00:00:21.420> that

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
just splatter you there's like that

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.220 
just splatter you there's like that
pretend<00:00:22.490> it's<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.609> lot<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.850> arrows<00:00:24.230> there's

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
pretend it's a lot of arrows there's

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.720 
pretend it's a lot of arrows there's
holes<00:00:25.470> over<00:00:25.650> there<00:00:25.859> for<00:00:26.130> reasoning<00:00:26.550> you'll

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
holes over there for reasoning you'll

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.089 
holes over there for reasoning you'll
see<00:00:26.939> why<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:27.390> this<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> rebuilt<00:00:28.529> from<00:00:28.740> an<00:00:28.890> old

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
see why so this is a rebuilt from an old

bill that habit back in the day we
didn't<00:00:30.689> have<00:00:30.779> sexy<00:00:31.320> comparator<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.340> had<00:00:32.520> at

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
didn't have sexy comparator so we had at

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.760 
didn't have sexy comparator so we had at
it<00:00:32.940> does<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.180> whole<00:00:33.420> string<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.870> crazy<00:00:34.170> redstone

least<00:01:40.259> two<00:01:40.560> blocks<00:01:40.860> if<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.189> go<00:01:41.310> here<00:01:41.579> for

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
least two blocks if you go here for

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.730 
least two blocks if you go here for
example<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.479> do<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.530> place

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
example and you do that and you place

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.139 
example and you do that and you place
your<00:01:43.860> dispenser<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.460> doesn't<00:01:44.790> work<00:01:44.909> it

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
your dispenser it doesn't work it

doesn't work it has to be at least two
lines<00:01:47.670> deep<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.450> we're<00:01:48.659> gonna<00:01:48.750> put<00:01:48.960> a

lines deep like so we're gonna put a

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.200 
lines deep like so we're gonna put a
solid<00:01:49.439> block<00:01:49.590> here<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.520> dispenser<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.090> then

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
solid block here the dispenser is then

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.990 
solid block here the dispenser is then
going<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.390> catch<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:52.140> over<00:01:52.470> here<00:01:52.909> and<00:01:53.909> we're

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
some of these be kind of lava II you

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.530 
some of these be kind of lava II you
know<00:02:32.840> fire<00:02:33.349> arrow<00:02:33.680> type<00:02:34.069> style<00:02:34.340> you're<00:02:35.239> able

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
know fire arrow type style you're able

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.990 
know fire arrow type style you're able
to<00:02:35.659> do<00:02:35.810> so<00:02:36.280> let's<00:02:37.280> just<00:02:37.459> come<00:02:37.639> up<00:02:37.760> here<00:02:37.790> a

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
to do so let's just come up here a

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.819 
to do so let's just come up here a
little<00:02:38.120> bit<00:02:38.359> and<00:02:38.810> we<00:02:38.930> got<00:02:39.079> to<00:02:39.170> kind<00:02:39.290> of<00:02:39.379> control

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
little bit and we got to kind of control

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.429 
little bit and we got to kind of control
the<00:02:39.859> flow<00:02:40.370> of<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.639> lava<00:02:40.879> so<00:02:41.389> keep<00:02:42.169> that<00:02:42.200> in

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:42.439 
the flow of the lava so keep that in

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.849 
the flow of the lava so keep that in
mind<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:44.000> let's<00:02:44.540> go<00:02:44.720> out<00:02:44.900> like<00:02:45.079> so<00:02:45.409> like<00:02:45.799> so

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
mind and let's go out like so like so

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.640 
mind and let's go out like so like so
let's<00:02:46.370> get<00:02:46.549> rid<00:02:46.669> of<00:02:46.760> that<00:02:46.819> and<00:02:47.480> at<00:02:48.290> that<00:02:48.409> point

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
let's get rid of that and at that point

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.710 
let's get rid of that and at that point
we're<00:02:48.980> basically<00:02:49.220> good<00:02:49.519> to<00:02:49.639> go<00:02:49.819> i<00:02:50.060> would<00:02:50.329> say

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
we're basically good to go i would say

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.610 
we're basically good to go i would say
for<00:02:51.639> safety<00:02:52.639> purposes<00:02:52.669> put<00:02:53.629> that<00:02:53.810> here<00:02:54.139> so<00:02:54.349> all

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
for safety purposes put that here so all

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.709 
for safety purposes put that here so all
of<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.889> lavas<00:02:55.250> caught<00:02:55.549> and<00:02:55.879> is<00:02:56.480> going

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:56.719 
of the lavas caught and is going

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:58.420 
of the lavas caught and is going
straight<00:02:57.109> down<00:02:57.139> it<00:02:57.859> might<00:02:58.069> get<00:02:58.189> a<00:02:58.250> little

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
straight down it might get a little

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.250 
straight down it might get a little
funky<00:02:58.849> for<00:02:59.030> me<00:02:59.120> because<00:02:59.389> all<00:02:59.419> of<00:02:59.599> this<00:02:59.810> is<00:02:59.989> wool

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
funky for me because all of this is wool

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.140 
funky for me because all of this is wool
so<00:03:00.919> might<00:03:01.099> just<00:03:01.250> start<00:03:01.370> catching<00:03:01.639> fire<00:03:02.120> i

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
so might just start catching fire i

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.270 
so might just start catching fire i
guess<00:03:02.569> now<00:03:03.019> this<00:03:03.200> one<00:03:03.469> doesn't<00:03:03.829> have<00:03:03.859> any<00:03:04.069> lava

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
guess now this one doesn't have any lava

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.069 
guess now this one doesn't have any lava
on<00:03:04.549> it<00:03:04.730> i<00:03:04.879> mean<00:03:05.000> if<00:03:05.180> you<00:03:05.269> wanted<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:05.689> you<00:03:05.840> could

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
on it i mean if you wanted to you could

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:07.750 
on it i mean if you wanted to you could
wire<00:03:06.439> it<00:03:06.469> weirdly<00:03:07.010> but<00:03:07.250> again<00:03:07.459> we<00:03:07.579> have<00:03:07.730> the

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
wire it weirdly but again we have the

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.209 
wire it weirdly but again we have the
redstone<00:03:08.239> going<00:03:08.450> directly<00:03:08.840> into<00:03:08.930> it<00:03:09.439> so<00:03:10.040> for

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:10.219 
redstone going directly into it so for

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:11.440 
redstone going directly into it so for
the<00:03:10.280> sake<00:03:10.400> of<00:03:10.459> this<00:03:10.609> example<00:03:11.030> we're<00:03:11.239> going<00:03:11.359> to

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
the sake of this example we're going to

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.990 
the sake of this example we're going to
keep<00:03:11.599> those<00:03:11.840> just<00:03:12.169> lava<00:03:12.470> free<00:03:13.010> but<00:03:13.699> just<00:03:13.909> to

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
keep those just lava free but just to

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.729 
keep those just lava free but just to
show<00:03:14.209> you<00:03:14.239> that<00:03:14.359> we're<00:03:14.599> able<00:03:14.780> to<00:03:14.989> lava<00:03:15.229> up<00:03:15.530> the

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
show you that we're able to lava up the

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.039 
show you that we're able to lava up the
arrows<00:03:16.069> which<00:03:17.030> I'm<00:03:17.180> sure<00:03:17.329> you<00:03:17.449> knew<00:03:17.599> also<00:03:17.989> you

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
arrows which I'm sure you knew also you

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.899 
arrows which I'm sure you knew also you
can<00:03:18.260> put<00:03:18.500> our<00:03:18.680> fire<00:03:18.859> charters<00:03:19.340> you<00:03:19.699> know<00:03:19.819> if

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:19.909 
can put our fire charters you know if
