00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
you know we've already looked at the

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.720 
you know we've already looked at the
quad-core<00:00:19.960> Tegra<00:00:20.710> 3<00:00:20.740> version<00:00:21.429> that's<00:00:21.640> in

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
quad-core Tegra 3 version that's in

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.759 
quad-core Tegra 3 version that's in
Europe<00:00:22.570> unlocked<00:00:23.050> you<00:00:23.259> can<00:00:23.409> import<00:00:23.679> it

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:23.769 
Europe unlocked you can import it

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:25.229 
Europe unlocked you can import it
yourself<00:00:24.130> you<00:00:24.249> want<00:00:24.429> but<00:00:24.939> this<00:00:25.029> is<00:00:25.150> the

00:00:25.229 --> 00:00:25.239 
yourself you want but this is the

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:26.640 
yourself you want but this is the
version<00:00:25.359> we<00:00:25.659> get<00:00:25.839> into<00:00:25.960> state<00:00:26.199> so<00:00:26.409> it's<00:00:26.560> going

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
version we get into state so it's going

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.639 
version we get into state so it's going
to<00:00:26.710> ett<00:00:26.980> its<00:00:27.579> LTE<00:00:27.849> but<00:00:28.720> since<00:00:28.900> its<00:00:29.079> LTE<00:00:29.230> it's

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:29.649 
to ett its LTE but since its LTE it's

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.200 
to ett its LTE but since its LTE it's
got<00:00:29.739> a<00:00:29.769> different<00:00:29.829> processor<00:00:30.669> k<00:00:30.819> so<00:00:30.880> it's<00:00:31.089> got

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
got a different processor k so it's got

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.260 
got a different processor k so it's got
to<00:00:31.300> do<00:00:31.419> a<00:00:31.449> core<00:00:31.720> Snapdragon<00:00:32.560> s4<00:00:33.030> which<00:00:34.030> is<00:00:34.149> no

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
to do a core Snapdragon s4 which is no

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.029 
to do a core Snapdragon s4 which is no
slouch<00:00:34.570> it's<00:00:34.899> a<00:00:34.989> great<00:00:35.200> processor<00:00:35.800> and<00:00:35.949> you

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:36.039 
slouch it's a great processor and you

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:37.470 
slouch it's a great processor and you
know<00:00:36.129> and<00:00:36.280> we'll<00:00:36.430> do<00:00:36.579> some<00:00:36.760> comparisons<00:00:37.329> with

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
know and we'll do some comparisons with

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.599 
know and we'll do some comparisons with
this<00:00:37.719> one<00:00:37.989> to<00:00:38.350> the<00:00:38.500> quad<00:00:38.800> core<00:00:39.070> version<00:00:39.250> later

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:39.609 
this one to the quad core version later

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:42.119 
this one to the quad core version later
we'll<00:00:40.180> get<00:00:40.329> into<00:00:40.480> that<00:00:40.859> otherwise<00:00:41.859> it's

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
we'll get into that otherwise it's

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:43.470 
we'll get into that otherwise it's
essentially<00:00:42.370> the<00:00:42.489> same<00:00:42.699> phone<00:00:43.000> I<00:00:43.239> believe

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
essentially the same phone I believe

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.229 
essentially the same phone I believe
it's<00:00:43.570> going<00:00:43.660> to<00:00:43.750> be<00:00:43.809> 199<00:00:44.289> when<00:00:44.769> it<00:00:44.859> comes<00:00:45.039> out

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
it's going to be 199 when it comes out

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.759 
it's going to be 199 when it comes out
the<00:00:46.239> only<00:00:46.570> other<00:00:46.600> real<00:00:47.019> difference<00:00:47.500> other

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:47.769 
the only other real difference other

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:50.279 
the only other real difference other
than<00:00:47.890> processors<00:00:48.579> this<00:00:48.789> only<00:00:48.940> has<00:00:49.120> 16<00:00:49.510> gig<00:00:49.960> of

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
than processors this only has 16 gig of

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.470 
than processors this only has 16 gig of
on-board<00:00:50.530> storage<00:00:50.829> and<00:00:51.489> the<00:00:52.059> unlocked

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
on-board storage and the unlocked

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.299 
on-board storage and the unlocked
version<00:00:52.600> is<00:00:52.870> 32<00:00:53.320> gig<00:00:53.500> so<00:00:53.710> that's<00:00:54.010> a<00:00:54.100> little

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
version is 32 gig so that's a little

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.630 
version is 32 gig so that's a little
unfortunate<00:00:54.699> just<00:00:55.300> because<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:57.309> doesn't<00:00:57.609> have

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
unfortunate just because it doesn't have

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.400 
unfortunate just because it doesn't have
expandable<00:00:58.179> storage<00:00:58.329> slot<00:00:58.749> so<00:00:58.929> you<00:00:58.989> can't<00:00:59.199> put

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
expandable storage slot so you can't put

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.130 
expandable storage slot so you can't put
a<00:00:59.440> microSD<00:01:00.010> card<00:01:00.309> in<00:01:00.429> here<00:01:00.640> 16<00:01:01.359> gig<00:01:01.570> is<00:01:01.749> all<00:01:01.960> you

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
a microSD card in here 16 gig is all you

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.110 
a microSD card in here 16 gig is all you
get<00:01:02.320> now<00:01:02.469> you<00:01:02.530> get<00:01:02.739> dropbox<00:01:03.010> like<00:01:03.550> I<00:01:03.760> think

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
get now you get dropbox like I think

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.750 
get now you get dropbox like I think
it's<00:01:04.210> 25<00:01:05.019> or<00:01:05.260> it's<00:01:05.440> 25<00:01:05.860> free<00:01:06.220> gigs<00:01:06.520> of<00:01:06.670> space

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
it's 25 or it's 25 free gigs of space

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.220 
it's 25 or it's 25 free gigs of space
and<00:01:07.060> Dropbox<00:01:07.480> so<00:01:07.630> they're<00:01:07.780> trying<00:01:07.990> to<00:01:08.020> get<00:01:08.140> you

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 
and Dropbox so they're trying to get you

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.110 
and Dropbox so they're trying to get you
to<00:01:08.350> go<00:01:08.470> to<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.680> cloud<00:01:08.980> but<00:01:09.730> a<00:01:09.790> lot<00:01:10.000> of<00:01:10.030> people

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
to go to the cloud but a lot of people

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.060 
to go to the cloud but a lot of people
will<00:01:10.540> be<00:01:10.570> sort<00:01:11.080> of<00:01:11.170> disappointed<00:01:11.860> in<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:12.040> fact

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
will be sort of disappointed in the fact

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.610 
will be sort of disappointed in the fact
that<00:01:12.400> this<00:01:12.700> only<00:01:13.300> a<00:01:13.420> 16<00:01:13.810> gig<00:01:14.080> of<00:01:14.200> storage<00:01:14.500> so

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
that this only a 16 gig of storage so

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.650 
that this only a 16 gig of storage so
anyway<00:01:15.160> let's<00:01:15.370> unbox<00:01:15.580> it<00:01:15.820> and<00:01:16.030> then<00:01:16.450> we'll<00:01:16.570> get

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
anyway let's unbox it and then we'll get

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.060 
anyway let's unbox it and then we'll get
into<00:01:16.720> benchmarks<00:01:17.380> will<00:01:17.500> start<00:01:17.680> comparing<00:01:17.890> it

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
into benchmarks will start comparing it

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.440 
into benchmarks will start comparing it
to<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.160> other<00:01:18.340> device<00:01:18.700> and<00:01:19.000> things<00:01:19.210> like<00:01:19.390> that

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
to the other device and things like that

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.010 
to the other device and things like that
so<00:01:19.900> in<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.350> box<00:01:21.060> here's<00:01:22.060> your<00:01:22.150> Quick<00:01:22.750> Start

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
guide here there's the device let's pull

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.100 
guide here there's the device let's pull
that<00:01:29.050> out<00:01:29.080> for<00:01:29.440> a<00:01:29.500> second<00:01:29.920> just<00:01:30.040> set<00:01:30.310> it<00:01:30.340> aside

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
that out for a second just set it aside

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.630 
that out for a second just set it aside
here<00:01:32.110> is<00:01:32.320> well<00:01:33.100> I'm<00:01:33.190> not<00:01:33.280> gonna<00:01:33.400> pull<00:01:33.580> out

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
here is well I'm not gonna pull out

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.510 
here is well I'm not gonna pull out
stuff<00:01:34.150> that<00:01:34.180> would<00:01:34.570> be<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:35.160> micro-sim<00:01:36.160> tool

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
stuff that would be the micro-sim tool

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.160 
stuff that would be the micro-sim tool
so<00:01:36.880> on<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.120> top<00:01:37.330> of<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:37.510> device<00:01:37.780> right<00:01:38.110> here

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
the 1's it had the same things you said

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.220 
the 1's it had the same things you said
HTC<00:04:02.820> One<00:04:03.000> and<00:04:03.180> say<00:04:03.300> 1s<00:04:03.660> and<00:04:03.900> this<00:04:03.989> one<00:04:04.110> doesn't

difference<00:04:07.769> I<00:04:08.070> guess<00:04:08.280> is<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.640> ATT<00:04:09.390> logo<00:04:09.720> up

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
difference I guess is the ATT logo up

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.810 
difference I guess is the ATT logo up
top<00:04:10.080> so<00:04:11.070> we<00:04:11.100> look<00:04:11.280> at<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.400> unlocked<00:04:11.730> version

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
top so we look at the unlocked version

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.610 
top so we look at the unlocked version
because<00:04:12.299> it's<00:04:12.480> not<00:04:12.570> tied<00:04:12.780> to<00:04:12.930> a<00:04:12.959> carrier<00:04:13.019> just

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
because it's not tied to a carrier just

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.099 
because it's not tied to a carrier just
as<00:04:13.769> AT&amp;T<00:04:14.209> you<00:04:15.209> can<00:04:15.360> see<00:04:15.480> there<00:04:15.630> really<00:04:15.840> is<00:04:15.930> no

guys<00:05:17.530> have<00:05:17.710> seen<00:05:17.889> this<00:05:18.039> before<00:05:18.220> because<00:05:18.550> we

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
guys have seen this before because we

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.290 
guys have seen this before because we
did<00:05:18.970> the<00:05:19.120> quad<00:05:19.660> core<00:05:19.900> version<00:05:20.110> so<00:05:20.710> we'll<00:05:20.860> do

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
did the quad core version so we'll do

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.159 
did the quad core version so we'll do
benchmarks<00:05:22.300> to<00:05:22.539> see<00:05:22.690> you<00:05:22.780> can<00:05:22.930> see<00:05:23.050> the

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
benchmarks to see you can see the

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.320 
benchmarks to see you can see the
differences<00:05:23.560> between<00:05:23.620> the<00:05:24.039> two<00:05:24.070> but<00:05:24.910> really

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
differences between the two but really

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.430 
differences between the two but really

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
it's going to come down to how it feels

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.290 
it's going to come down to how it feels
in<00:05:26.560> hand<00:05:26.800> how<00:05:26.979> it<00:05:27.100> performs<00:05:27.550> are<00:05:27.669> using<00:05:28.030> it<00:05:28.150> and

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
in hand how it performs are using it and

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.659 
in hand how it performs are using it and
you<00:05:29.050> know<00:05:29.139> we<00:05:29.260> had<00:05:29.350> an<00:05:29.470> HTC<00:05:29.950> One<00:05:30.190> S<00:05:30.370> with<00:05:30.639> a

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
you know we had an HTC One S with a

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.610 
you know we had an HTC One S with a
Snapdragon<00:05:31.539> s4<00:05:31.600> and<00:05:32.050> the<00:05:32.110> thing<00:05:32.260> was<00:05:32.350> crazy

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
a sudden going to be slow this processor

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.730 
a sudden going to be slow this processor
is<00:05:36.370> still<00:05:36.610> really<00:05:36.940> really<00:05:37.389> really<00:05:37.660> good<00:05:37.930> so
