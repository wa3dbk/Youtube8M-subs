00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.560 
point and I see if anybody's coming but
nobody's<00:01:47.280> coming<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.820> switched<00:01:48.180> around<00:01:48.300> my

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
nobody's coming so I switched around my

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.390 
nobody's coming so I switched around my
positioning<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.470> then<00:01:49.650> I<00:01:49.680> turn<00:01:49.920> around<00:01:49.950> and

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
positioning and then I turn around and

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.460 
positioning and then I turn around and
kill<00:01:50.550> that<00:01:50.730> guy<00:01:50.940> so<00:01:51.540> now<00:01:51.690> I'm<00:01:51.810> reaming<00:01:52.350> down

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
kill that guy so now I'm reaming down

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.050 
kill that guy so now I'm reaming down
the<00:01:52.620> spawn<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.100> sure<00:01:53.580> enough<00:01:53.820> somebody

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
the spawn and sure enough somebody

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.330 
the spawn and sure enough somebody
spawns<00:01:54.450> there<00:01:54.720> it's<00:01:54.900> all<00:01:55.110> about<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:56.160> rotation

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
spawns there it's all about the rotation

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.210 
spawns there it's all about the rotation
of<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.970> spawns<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.870> know<00:01:57.990> who's<00:01:58.260> dead<00:01:58.650> who's

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
of the spawns you know who's dead who's

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.190 
of the spawns you know who's dead who's
just<00:01:59.610> coming<00:01:59.910> off<00:02:00.030> spawn<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.750> things<00:02:00.960> such<00:02:01.140> as

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
just coming off spawn and things such as

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.170 
just coming off spawn and things such as
that<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.830> if<00:02:02.190> you<00:02:02.310> can<00:02:02.460> memorize<00:02:02.640> these

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
that and if you can memorize these

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.040 
that and if you can memorize these
little<00:02:03.540> spots

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
little spots

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.780 
little spots
it<00:02:04.560> just<00:02:04.770> makes<00:02:04.920> free-for-all<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:05.670> much

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
it just makes free-for-all so much

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.460 
it just makes free-for-all so much
easier<00:02:06.150> and<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.300> much<00:02:06.420> more<00:02:06.690> fast-paced<00:02:07.260> you

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
easier and so much more fast-paced you

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.050 
easier and so much more fast-paced you
know<00:02:07.590> there's<00:02:07.770> not<00:02:07.920> as<00:02:08.039> much<00:02:08.190> camping<00:02:08.670> for<00:02:08.819> you

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
know there's not as much camping for you

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.050 
know there's not as much camping for you
I<00:02:09.990> mean<00:02:10.440> it's<00:02:10.649> semi<00:02:11.160> camping<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.730> wouldn't

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
I mean it's semi camping I wouldn't

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.900 
I mean it's semi camping I wouldn't
consider<00:02:12.210> it<00:02:12.510> full<00:02:12.870> on<00:02:13.200> 100%<00:02:13.860> camping

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
consider it full on 100% camping

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.130 
consider it full on 100% camping
but<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:16.020> would<00:02:16.770> consider<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:17.250> more<00:02:17.520> of<00:02:17.850> you<00:02:17.970> know

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
but I would consider it more of you know

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.540 
but I would consider it more of you know
rotating<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.290> playing<00:02:19.560> smart<00:02:20.070> was<00:02:20.310> playing

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
rotating and playing smart was playing

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.680 
rotating and playing smart was playing
smarter<00:02:21.030> than<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.240> people<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.540> you're

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
smarter than the people that you're

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.600 
smarter than the people that you're
playing<00:02:21.930> against<00:02:22.260> so<00:02:22.950> as<00:02:23.070> you<00:02:23.190> can<00:02:23.310> see<00:02:23.370> again

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
playing against so as you can see again

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.460 
playing against so as you can see again
I'm<00:02:23.970> just<00:02:24.180> rotating<00:02:24.390> around<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:25.080> bottom

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
I'm just rotating around this bottom

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.230 
I'm just rotating around this bottom
dome<00:02:25.650> area<00:02:25.830> looking<00:02:26.280> bottom<00:02:26.580> zone<00:02:26.730> turning

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
dome area looking bottom zone turning

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.390 
dome area looking bottom zone turning
around<00:02:27.540> watching<00:02:28.410> my<00:02:28.530> back<00:02:28.740> getting<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.160> free

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
around watching my back getting a free

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.950 
around watching my back getting a free
kill<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.910> then<00:02:30.030> turning<00:02:30.390> around<00:02:30.450> again<00:02:30.630> to

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
kill and then turning around again to

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.220 
kill and then turning around again to

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
get another free kill bottom dome so now

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.800 
get another free kill bottom dome so now
what<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.770> significance<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:35.570> spots<00:02:36.570> like

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
what is the significance of spots like

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.480 
what is the significance of spots like
these<00:02:36.990> well<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.620> significance<00:02:38.130> of<00:02:38.220> spots

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
these well the significance of spots

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.260 
these well the significance of spots
like<00:02:38.730> these<00:02:38.940> is<00:02:39.950> that<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:41.310> lot<00:02:41.490> of<00:02:41.640> people<00:02:42.000> will

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
like these is that a lot of people will

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.240 
like these is that a lot of people will
not<00:02:42.450> expect<00:02:42.990> you<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.380> be<00:02:43.530> killing<00:02:43.890> them<00:02:44.010> off

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
not expect you to be killing them off

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.820 
not expect you to be killing them off
spawn<00:02:44.670> as<00:02:44.940> many<00:02:45.150> times<00:02:45.480> as<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:45.780> will<00:02:46.050> like

they'll<00:02:47.130> be<00:02:47.160> spawning<00:02:47.640> up<00:02:47.910> like<00:02:48.540> this<00:02:48.780> guy

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
they'll be spawning up like this guy

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.440 
they'll be spawning up like this guy
he's<00:02:49.290> completely<00:02:49.710> clueless<00:02:50.180> but<00:02:51.180> they'll<00:02:51.330> be

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
he's completely clueless but they'll be

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.880 
he's completely clueless but they'll be
spawning<00:02:51.750> up<00:02:51.960> and<00:02:52.110> they<00:02:52.170> won't<00:02:52.290> expect<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:52.800> to

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
be there again and again and again and

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.090 
be there again and again and again and
different<00:02:55.020> people<00:02:55.110> will<00:02:55.380> spawn<00:02:55.620> in<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.860> same

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
different people will spawn in the same

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.640

spots<00:02:56.430> over<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.000> over<00:02:57.330> so<00:02:57.900> you'll<00:02:58.080> be<00:02:58.230> able<00:02:58.380> to

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
spots over and over so you'll be able to

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.410 
spots over and over so you'll be able to
keep<00:02:58.770> you<00:02:58.950> know<00:02:59.100> killing<00:02:59.730> them<00:02:59.850> off<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.150> spawn

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420
