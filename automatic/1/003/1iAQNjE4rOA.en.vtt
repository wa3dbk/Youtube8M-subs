prospect<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.120> fear<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.629> they<00:01:01.079> will<00:01:01.289> find<00:01:01.590> that

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
prospect I fear that they will find that

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.399 
prospect I fear that they will find that
those<00:01:02.100> greater<00:01:02.480> expectations<00:01:03.480> will<00:01:03.750> not<00:01:04.049> be

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
those greater expectations will not be

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.690 
those greater expectations will not be
fulfilled<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:06.200> therefore<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.229> hope<00:01:07.770> they'll

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
fulfilled and therefore I hope they'll

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.570 
fulfilled and therefore I hope they'll
play<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.570> more<00:01:09.930> political<00:01:10.560> role<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:11.159> mean<00:01:11.460> the

that those people vote more regularly

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.780 
that those people vote more regularly
than<00:01:51.930> younger<00:01:52.410> people<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.430> thing<00:01:53.550> about<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
than younger people the thing about the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.730 
than younger people the thing about the
1997<00:01:54.420> election<00:01:54.690> is<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.200> really<00:01:55.470> older

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
1997 election is that really older

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.770 
1997 election is that really older
people<00:01:56.040> were<00:01:56.280> there<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.820> were<00:01:57.030> voting<00:01:57.540> but

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
people were there and were voting but

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.590 
people were there and were voting but
they<00:01:57.990> weren't<00:01:58.310> given<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.399> credit<00:01:59.580> I<00:01:59.940> don't

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
they weren't given the credit I don't

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.540 
they weren't given the credit I don't
think<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.050> government<00:02:01.500> has<00:02:01.560> been<00:02:02.009> listening

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
think the government has been listening

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.670 
think the government has been listening
to<00:02:02.820> us<00:02:03.000> it's<00:02:03.630> because<00:02:03.960> they<00:02:04.110> don't<00:02:04.320> wish<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.560> be

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
to us it's because they don't wish to be

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.980 
to us it's because they don't wish to be
associated<00:02:05.100> with<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.729> older<00:02:06.420> population

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
associated with this older population

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.719 
associated with this older population
it's<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.470> only<00:02:07.619> explanation<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:08.190> can<00:02:08.250> think<00:02:08.399> of

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
it's the only explanation I can think of

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.310 
it's the only explanation I can think of
they<00:02:08.970> have<00:02:09.149> been<00:02:09.330> campaigning<00:02:09.660> for<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.050> long

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
they have been campaigning for so long

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.920 
they have been campaigning for so long
and<00:02:10.619> yet<00:02:11.100> so<00:02:11.340> little<00:02:11.730> happens<00:02:12.150> as<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.420> result<00:02:12.630> of

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
and yet so little happens as a result of

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.930 
and yet so little happens as a result of
their<00:02:13.140> efforts<00:02:13.320> that<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.310> have<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.700> think

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
their efforts that you have to think

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.430 
their efforts that you have to think
that<00:02:15.030> there<00:02:15.180> might<00:02:15.390> be<00:02:15.420> an<00:02:15.750> element<00:02:15.989> of<00:02:16.110> ageism

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
that there might be an element of ageism

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.979 
that there might be an element of ageism
within<00:02:17.310> politicians<00:02:17.970> they're<00:02:18.450> denying

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
the tide is turning I think there's a

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
lot long way to go but undoubtedly the

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.559 
lot long way to go but undoubtedly the
politicians<00:02:56.520> have<00:02:56.730> woken<00:02:56.910> up<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.360> fact

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
politicians have woken up to the fact

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.390 
politicians have woken up to the fact
that<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.780> gray<00:02:57.959> vote<00:02:58.230> is<00:02:58.500> their<00:02:59.190> meal<00:02:59.370> ticket

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
that the gray vote is their meal ticket

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.760 
that the gray vote is their meal ticket
we<00:03:00.300> feel<00:03:00.630> that<00:03:00.900> we<00:03:01.140> should<00:03:01.170> be<00:03:01.680> sharing<00:03:02.580> in<00:03:02.790> the

all have this extraordinary prospect of
living<00:03:37.620> through<00:03:38.069> our<00:03:38.280> 70s<00:03:38.819> and<00:03:39.030> into<00:03:39.150> our<00:03:39.390> 80s

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
living through our 70s and into our 80s

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.750 
living through our 70s and into our 80s
and<00:03:40.050> some<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.319> us<00:03:40.410> into<00:03:40.680> our<00:03:40.800> 90s<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:41.400> into<00:03:41.640> our

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
and some of us into our 90s and into our

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.930 
and some of us into our 90s and into our
hundreds<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:42.360> so<00:03:43.050> we<00:03:43.470> will<00:03:44.100> be<00:03:44.220> old<00:03:44.370> one<00:03:44.700> day

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
hundreds and so we will be old one day

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.180 
hundreds and so we will be old one day
and<00:03:45.239> we<00:03:45.810> probably<00:03:46.319> got<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.620> organize<00:03:46.980> that

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
and we probably got to organize that

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.430 
and we probably got to organize that
world<00:03:47.459> so<00:03:47.610> that<00:03:47.819> it<00:03:47.940> works<00:03:48.090> for<00:03:48.480> us<00:03:48.540> by<00:03:49.380> the

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
world so that it works for us by the

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.440 
world so that it works for us by the
time<00:03:49.709> we<00:03:49.920> get<00:03:50.130> there<00:03:50.430> because<00:03:51.030> it<00:03:51.330> ain't

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
time we get there because it ain't

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.120 
time we get there because it ain't
working<00:03:51.870> that<00:03:52.019> well<00:03:52.230> for<00:03:52.560> today's<00:03:52.800> older

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
working that well for today's older
