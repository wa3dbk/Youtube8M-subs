that US was routed wide at all times

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:49.809 
that US was routed wide at all times
that<00:03:48.620> reduced<00:03:48.949> the<00:03:49.129> game<00:03:49.310> to<00:03:49.489> really<00:03:49.790> a

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
that reduced the game to really a

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.490 
that reduced the game to really a
midfield<00:03:50.449> battle<00:03:50.569> there<00:03:51.109> were<00:03:51.199> a<00:03:51.229> lot<00:03:51.470> of

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
midfield battle there were a lot of

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.129 
midfield battle there were a lot of
crosses<00:03:51.859> handled<00:03:52.729> easily<00:03:53.000> by<00:03:53.389> that<00:03:53.569> three-man

centre-back group of the Costa Ricans

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.509 
centre-back group of the Costa Ricans
but<00:03:57.019> I<00:03:57.049> think<00:03:57.259> the<00:03:57.349> US<00:03:57.650> were<00:03:57.889> a<00:03:57.919> bit<00:03:58.159> surprised

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
but I think the US were a bit surprised

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.580 
but I think the US were a bit surprised
the<00:03:58.699> reason<00:03:59.030> being<00:03:59.209> costa<00:03:59.900> rica<00:04:00.079> had<00:04:00.199> to<00:04:00.349> win

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
the reason being costa rica had to win

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.559 
the reason being costa rica had to win
this<00:04:00.829> match<00:04:01.129> to<00:04:01.430> move<00:04:01.609> on<00:04:01.790> and<00:04:01.819> be<00:04:02.120> first<00:04:02.389> in

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
this match to move on and be first in

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.270 
this match to move on and be first in
the<00:04:02.719> group<00:04:02.900> now<00:04:03.109> they<00:04:03.259> have<00:04:03.409> to<00:04:03.560> face<00:04:03.709> honduras

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
the group now they have to face honduras

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.550 
the group now they have to face honduras
those<00:04:04.699> conservative<00:04:05.269> tactics<00:04:05.719> may<00:04:06.169> have<00:04:06.349> cost

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
those conservative tactics may have cost

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.449 
those conservative tactics may have cost
them<00:04:06.799> a<00:04:06.859> place<00:04:07.099> in<00:04:07.370> the<00:04:07.519> semi-finals<00:04:07.729> it<00:04:08.599> was
