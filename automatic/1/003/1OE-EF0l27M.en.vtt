 the ice age is very bright 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.129
 characters we have to emphasize the character 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:20.420
 and the personality of the characters in the dialogues 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:21.980

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.360
 this show will seem familiar 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.220
 same time they will see something that does not 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.500
 expected to see something no one ever 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.230

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.970
 invented we both constantly remembered 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.420
 about past projects such as for me 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.580
