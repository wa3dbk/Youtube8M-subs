so what makes the JSA cross overpack
experience<00:00:57.300> different<00:00:57.870> from<00:00:58.019> the<00:00:58.140> base<00:00:58.320> games

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
experience different from the base games

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.709 
experience different from the base games
is<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.190> you'll<00:00:59.640> see<00:00:59.699> more<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.269> an<00:01:00.420> emphasis

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
is that you'll see more of an emphasis

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.959 
is that you'll see more of an emphasis
on<00:01:01.019> your<00:01:01.170> starter<00:01:01.559> cards<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.250> your<00:01:02.430> punches

on your starter cards so your punches
and<00:01:03.149> your<00:01:03.390> vulnerabilities<00:01:04.110> will<00:01:04.290> work<00:01:04.680> with

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
and your vulnerabilities will work with

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.760 
and your vulnerabilities will work with
mechanics<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.060> are<00:01:06.090> added<00:01:06.720> inside<00:01:07.259> the<00:01:07.380> JSA

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
can use a punch card to avoid an attack

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.020 
can use a punch card to avoid an attack
and<00:01:25.740> say<00:01:25.890> I'm<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.159> discarding<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.700> defense

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
and say I'm just discarding the defense

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.350

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
way your punch cards are going to be

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:33.889 
way your punch cards are going to be
more<00:01:32.759> valuable<00:01:33.030> throughout<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.690> game

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
more valuable throughout the game

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.559 
more valuable throughout the game
another<00:01:34.530> one<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.490> location<00:01:36.030> cards<00:01:36.479> if

highest cost discards an additional card
so<00:04:19.169> he's<00:04:19.380> making<00:04:19.680> me<00:04:19.739> get<00:04:20.040> rid<00:04:20.250> of<00:04:20.280> stuff<00:04:20.580> that

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
so he's making me get rid of stuff that

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.150 
so he's making me get rid of stuff that
is<00:04:21.150> painful<00:04:21.870> that's<00:04:22.200> gonna<00:04:22.410> really<00:04:22.770> split<00:04:23.010> up

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
is painful that's gonna really split up

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.590 
is painful that's gonna really split up
again<00:04:23.460> it<00:04:23.760> come<00:04:23.940> down<00:04:24.150> quickly<00:04:24.780> yeah<00:04:25.169> for<00:04:25.470> sure

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
again it come down quickly yeah for sure

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.670 
again it come down quickly yeah for sure
so<00:04:27.600> I<00:04:27.630> guess<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:27.930> last<00:04:28.080> thing<00:04:28.230> we<00:04:28.410> gotta<00:04:28.590> go

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
so I guess the last thing we gotta go

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.670 
so I guess the last thing we gotta go
over<00:04:28.800> is<00:04:29.220> the<00:04:29.700> bread<00:04:30.419> and<00:04:30.690> butter<00:04:30.930> of<00:04:31.110> any<00:04:31.530> of

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
over is the bread and butter of any of

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.950 
over is the bread and butter of any of
the<00:04:31.740> deck<00:04:32.130> building<00:04:32.430> games<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.820> Super<00:04:33.630> Heroes
