period and spotting first let's go over

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.169 
period and spotting first let's go over
what<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.540> normal<00:00:06.960> period<00:00:07.170> is<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.470> normal<00:00:07.799> period

what a normal period is a normal period
should<00:00:09.179> last<00:00:09.450> anywhere<00:00:09.870> between<00:00:10.320> two<00:00:11.219> and

which in practical terms is difficult to

which in practical terms is difficult to
measure<00:00:24.600> but<00:00:25.080> basically<00:00:26.750> you<00:00:27.750> should<00:00:28.050> be

first thing you should consider is what

part of the menstrual cycle you're
experiencing<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:06.000> bleeding<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.780> if<00:01:07.040> if

experiencing this bleeding and if if

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.630 
experiencing this bleeding and if if
it's<00:01:08.580> during<00:01:09.030> your<00:01:09.439> normal<00:01:10.439> expected<00:01:11.189> time<00:01:11.400> of

it's during your normal expected time of
your<00:01:12.030> period<00:01:13.340> then<00:01:14.810> it<00:01:15.810> might<00:01:16.080> just<00:01:16.290> be<00:01:16.380> a

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
your period then it might just be a

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.999 
your period then it might just be a
lighter<00:01:17.220> period<00:01:17.820> than<00:01:18.090> normal<00:01:18.479> if<00:01:19.009> you're

between you're normally expected times
when<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.909> would<00:01:27.060> have<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> menstrual<00:01:27.780> period

when you would have a menstrual period

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.810 
when you would have a menstrual period
then<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.570> also<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.350> also<00:01:32.040> can<00:01:32.400> mean<00:01:32.579> that

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
then that also that also can mean that

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.999 
then that also that also can mean that
there's<00:01:33.150> something<00:01:33.390> else<00:01:33.630> going<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.500> causing

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
there's something else going on causing

there's something else going on causing
that<00:01:35.159> bleeding<00:01:38.210> to<00:01:39.210> figure<00:01:39.840> out<00:01:39.990> what<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.290> is

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
that bleeding to figure out what that is

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.190 
that bleeding to figure out what that is
really<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.340> best<00:01:41.490> thing<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.939> do<00:01:42.329> would<00:01:42.930> be<00:01:43.170> to

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
really the best thing to do would be to

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.649 
really the best thing to do would be to
contact<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.430> physician<00:01:45.060> preferably<00:01:45.600> a

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
contact a physician preferably a

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.679 
contact a physician preferably a
gynecologist<00:01:46.820> that<00:01:47.820> can<00:01:47.970> help<00:01:48.180> figure<00:01:48.540> out

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
gynecologist that can help figure out

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.770 
gynecologist that can help figure out
the<00:01:48.810> source<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.829> abnormal<00:01:50.490> bleeding<00:01:50.780> but

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
the source of that abnormal bleeding but

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.319 
the source of that abnormal bleeding but
in<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.619> end<00:01:52.770> not<00:01:53.159> all<00:01:53.520> spotting<00:01:54.119> is

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
in the end not all spotting is

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:02.319 
in the end not all spotting is
necessarily<00:01:55.640> bad<00:01:57.020> it's<00:01:58.020> very<00:01:58.350> common<00:01:59.329> and<00:02:01.310> can

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
necessarily bad it's very common and can

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:07.850 
necessarily bad it's very common and can
usually<00:02:03.329> be<00:02:03.689> diagnosed<00:02:04.310> relatively<00:02:05.310> quickly
