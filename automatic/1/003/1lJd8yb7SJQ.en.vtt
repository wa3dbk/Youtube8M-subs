00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
thought was pretty interesting not sure

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.849 
thought was pretty interesting not sure
if<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.839> guys<00:00:48.960> have<00:00:49.140> seen<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.379> before<00:00:49.589> in<00:00:49.769> the

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859 
if you guys have seen this before in the

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.069 
if you guys have seen this before in the
layout<00:00:50.010> editor<00:00:50.249> but<00:00:51.149> because<00:00:51.659> the<00:00:51.870> tree

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
layout editor but because the tree

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.229 
layout editor but because the tree
spawned<00:00:52.440> my<00:00:52.920> layout<00:00:53.190> editor<00:00:53.370> has<00:00:53.760> sort<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.179> a

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
spawned my layout editor has sort of a

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.899 
spawned my layout editor has sort of a
read<00:00:54.780> error<00:00:55.050> looking<00:00:56.039> button<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.519> the<00:00:56.609> form<00:00:56.850> of

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
read error looking button in the form of

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:58.549 
read error looking button in the form of
a<00:00:57.030> tree<00:00:57.269> this<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.690> basically<00:00:58.079> saying<00:00:58.379> that

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
a tree this is basically saying that

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.770 
a tree this is basically saying that
since<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.100> tree<00:00:59.399> spawned<00:00:59.819> in<00:01:00.059> my<00:01:00.269> active

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
since the tree spawned in my active

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.500 
since the tree spawned in my active
layout<00:01:01.109> which<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.889> fine<00:01:02.249> but<00:01:02.819> that<00:01:02.999> inactive

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
layout which is fine but that inactive

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.090 
layout which is fine but that inactive
layout<00:01:03.719> there's<00:01:03.929> actually<00:01:04.350> some<00:01:04.530> decorations

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
layout there's actually some decorations

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.130 
layout there's actually some decorations
there<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.970> appears<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.780> torch<00:01:07.080> was

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
there so it appears that the torch was

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.050 
there so it appears that the torch was
the<00:01:07.710> decoration<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.400> was<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> way

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
the decoration that was in the way

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.940 
the decoration that was in the way
