pretty good nose I highly recommend it

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.230 
pretty good nose I highly recommend it
with<00:01:41.850> my<00:01:42.000> only<00:01:42.150> problem<00:01:42.479> with<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.259> far<00:01:44.240> so

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
with my only problem with it so far so

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.999 
with my only problem with it so far so
it<00:01:45.329> doesn't<00:01:45.720> exactly<00:01:45.930> work<00:01:46.409> too<00:01:46.799> well<00:01:46.829> on

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
it doesn't exactly work too well on

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.090 
it doesn't exactly work too well on
steam<00:01:47.700> well<00:01:48.570> for<00:01:49.229> others<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.890> works

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
steam well for others it works

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.010 
steam well for others it works
completely<00:01:50.490> while<00:01:50.820> but<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.600> far<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:51.960> not

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
completely while but so far it's not

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.870 
completely while but so far it's not
working<00:01:52.350> for<00:01:52.380> me<00:01:52.500> because<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.220> don't<00:01:53.700> seem<00:01:53.820> to

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
working for me because I don't seem to

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.700 
working for me because I don't seem to
have<00:01:54.030> program<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.659> sensitivity<00:01:55.290> right<00:01:55.470> and

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
have program the sensitivity right and

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.709 
have program the sensitivity right and
it's<00:01:55.890> not<00:01:56.090> cooperating<00:01:57.090> with<00:01:57.210> twisting<00:01:57.540> game

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
it's not cooperating with twisting game

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.539 
it's not cooperating with twisting game
so<00:01:58.409> I'm<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:58.680> going<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.920> fool<00:01:59.130> around<00:01:59.159> with

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
so I'm just going to fool around with

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.310 
so I'm just going to fool around with
the<00:01:59.700> settings<00:01:59.729> until<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.450> can<00:02:00.719> actually<00:02:00.899> get<00:02:01.200> it

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
the settings until I can actually get it

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.560 
the settings until I can actually get it
to<00:02:01.469> work<00:02:01.619> well<00:02:02.540> until<00:02:03.540> then<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:04.130> thing<00:02:05.570> this

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
to work well until then this thing this

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.359 
to work well until then this thing this
thing's<00:02:06.810> okay<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:07.200> for<00:02:07.619> right<00:02:07.799> now<00:02:07.860> it's

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
thing's okay so for right now it's

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.650 
thing's okay so for right now it's
better<00:02:08.670> than<00:02:08.819> any<00:02:09.000> other<00:02:09.179> mouse<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.569> how

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
better than any other mouse of how

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.750 
better than any other mouse of how
that's<00:02:09.899> for<00:02:10.050> sure<00:02:10.170> but<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:10.979> can<00:02:11.129> be<00:02:11.250> better<00:02:11.430> and

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
that's for sure but it can be better and

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.460 
that's for sure but it can be better and
I'm<00:02:11.970> sure<00:02:12.239> it<00:02:12.330> will<00:02:12.450> be

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
I'm sure it will be

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.380
