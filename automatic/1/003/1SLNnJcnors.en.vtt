00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
the air and on the cabbage to take over

that<00:03:25.220> attitude<00:03:25.819> in<00:03:26.000> chi<00:03:26.329> produce<00:03:26.750> lactic<00:03:27.650> acid

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:28.189 
that attitude in chi produce lactic acid

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:29.649 
that attitude in chi produce lactic acid
which<00:03:28.699> is<00:03:28.729> a<00:03:28.819> byproduct<00:03:29.209> of<00:03:29.510> fermentation

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659 
which is a byproduct of fermentation

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.009 
which is a byproduct of fermentation
antenna<00:03:30.560> so<00:03:31.329> let<00:03:32.329> me<00:03:32.419> send<00:03:32.599> me<00:03:32.720> over<00:03:32.900> the

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
antenna so let me send me over the

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.210 
antenna so let me send me over the
ingredients<00:03:33.139> there<00:03:33.709> were<00:03:33.799> just<00:03:34.010> two

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
ingredients there were just two

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.830 
ingredients there were just two
ingredients<00:03:34.430> and<00:03:35.060> what<00:03:35.479> I<00:03:35.540> think<00:03:35.780> a

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
ingredients and what I think a

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.599 
ingredients and what I think a
fermentation<00:03:36.169> I<00:03:36.560> think<00:03:36.799> of<00:03:36.889> like<00:03:37.040> a<00:03:37.099> starter

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
fermentation I think of like a starter

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.670 
fermentation I think of like a starter
culture<00:03:38.030> or<00:03:38.449> some<00:03:38.599> like<00:03:38.689> that<00:03:38.900> some<00:03:39.109> bacteria

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
culture or some like that some bacteria

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.499 
culture or some like that some bacteria
to<00:03:39.769> add<00:03:39.919> but<00:03:40.129> there<00:03:40.250> was<00:03:40.430> none<00:03:40.729> the<00:03:40.759> air<00:03:40.939> where

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:41.509 
to add but there was none the air where

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:43.869 
to add but there was none the air where
does<00:03:41.659> the<00:03:41.780> bacteria<00:03:42.259> come<00:03:42.530> from<00:03:42.739> the<00:03:43.669> bacteria

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
does the bacteria come from the bacteria

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.619 
does the bacteria come from the bacteria
it's<00:03:44.479> ever<00:03:44.810> felt<00:03:45.139> in<00:03:45.229> this<00:03:45.349> wild<00:03:45.859> method<00:03:46.629> from

we're<00:04:22.500> close<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:23.640> do<00:04:23.700> we<00:04:23.790> leave<00:04:23.910> it<00:04:24.000> open

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
we're close and do we leave it open

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.210 
we're close and do we leave it open
you're<00:04:25.050> going<00:04:25.200> to<00:04:25.260> leave<00:04:25.350> it<00:04:25.500> slightly

you're going to leave it slightly

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.090 
you're going to leave it slightly
slightly<00:04:27.150> open<00:04:27.690> so<00:04:27.900> that<00:04:27.930> you're<00:04:28.680> not<00:04:28.710> going

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
slightly open so that you're not going

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.400 
slightly open so that you're not going

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
to close it completely so that it's

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.100 
to close it completely so that it's
airtight<00:04:31.800> what<00:04:32.790> I<00:04:32.820> pregnant<00:04:33.480> with<00:04:33.630> this<00:04:33.840> drop

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
airtight what I pregnant with this drop

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.690 
airtight what I pregnant with this drop
in<00:04:34.230> particular<00:04:34.770> that<00:04:34.920> you're<00:04:35.040> using<00:04:35.250> is<00:04:35.550> that

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
in particular that you're using is that

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.210 
in particular that you're using is that
you<00:04:35.790> remove<00:04:36.120> that<00:04:36.150> rubber<00:04:36.690> band<00:04:36.990> I'm<00:04:37.800> wrap<00:04:38.070> the

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
you remove that rubber band I'm wrap the

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.810 
you remove that rubber band I'm wrap the
lid<00:04:38.510> and<00:04:39.510> then<00:04:39.570> you<00:04:39.840> just<00:04:40.080> press<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:41.370> lid<00:04:41.550> over

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
lid and then you just press the lid over

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.880 
lid and then you just press the lid over
the<00:04:42.210> top<00:04:42.360> of<00:04:42.390> the<00:04:42.630> jar<00:04:42.810> without<00:04:42.930> securing<00:04:43.800> it

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
the top of the jar without securing it

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.720 
the top of the jar without securing it
tightly<00:04:44.130> and<00:04:45.030> so<00:04:45.150> what<00:04:45.300> that<00:04:45.330> does<00:04:45.720> is<00:04:46.730> it

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
tightly and so what that does is it

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.020 
tightly and so what that does is it
allows<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:48.240> air<00:04:48.450> to<00:04:48.480> escape<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:49.320> carbon

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
allows the air to escape the carbon

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
allows the air to escape the carbon
monoxide<00:04:51.030> that's<00:04:51.210> produced<00:04:51.720> through

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
monoxide that's produced through

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.460 
monoxide that's produced through
fermentation<00:04:52.860> to<00:04:53.340> escape<00:04:53.670> if<00:04:54.360> you<00:04:54.570> don't<00:04:54.930> um

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
fermentation to escape if you don't um

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.770 
fermentation to escape if you don't um
if<00:04:55.740> you<00:04:55.860> do<00:04:56.040> put<00:04:56.400> a<00:04:56.460> lid<00:04:56.670> on<00:04:56.700> firm<00:04:57.420> it's<00:04:57.570> very

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
if you do put a lid on firm it's very

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.230 
if you do put a lid on firm it's very
very<00:04:58.020> tightly<00:04:58.320> what<00:04:58.620> happens<00:04:59.040> is<00:04:59.430> there's<00:05:00.150> a

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
very tightly what happens is there's a

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.640 
very tightly what happens is there's a
lot<00:05:00.420> of<00:05:00.450> gas<00:05:00.780> pretty<00:05:01.170> that<00:05:01.350> during<00:05:01.560> the

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
lot of gas pretty that during the

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.860 
lot of gas pretty that during the
fermentation<00:05:01.830> process<00:05:02.340> and<00:05:02.940> that<00:05:03.000> runs<00:05:03.690> the

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
fermentation process and that runs the

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.240 
fermentation process and that runs the
risk<00:05:04.020> of<00:05:04.260> making<00:05:05.010> your<00:05:05.250> jar<00:05:05.660> explode<00:05:07.190> so<00:05:08.190> you

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
risk of making your jar explode so you

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.360 
risk of making your jar explode so you
know<00:05:08.490> what's<00:05:08.700> our<00:05:08.970> growth<00:05:09.300> everywhere<00:05:09.840> Oh<00:05:10.370> and

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
know what's our growth everywhere Oh and

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.010 
know what's our growth everywhere Oh and
so<00:05:11.970> that's<00:05:12.060> why<00:05:12.330> you<00:05:12.390> want<00:05:12.600> to<00:05:12.660> keep<00:05:12.750> very

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
so that's why you want to keep very

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.700 
so that's why you want to keep very
loose<00:05:13.320> lid<00:05:13.620> on<00:05:14.780> jar<00:05:15.780> is<00:05:15.840> it<00:05:15.990> fermented<00:05:16.440> foods

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
loose lid on jar is it fermented foods

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.830 
loose lid on jar is it fermented foods
you<00:05:17.400> know<00:05:17.550> what<00:05:17.760> I'm<00:05:18.390> getting<00:05:18.570> a<00:05:18.720> little

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
you know what I'm getting a little

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.470 
you know what I'm getting a little
burned<00:05:19.170> in<00:05:19.470> my<00:05:19.590> guns<00:05:19.920> right<00:05:20.250> now<00:05:20.460> yes<00:05:21.090> ma'am

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480
