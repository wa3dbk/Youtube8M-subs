00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.350
 clark these are the good ingredients 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.270
 let's see then tell them the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.250
 ingredients that we will need to 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.920
 the garlic flan we need old parsley 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.260
 with the necessary amount at taste to 350 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.570
 grams of bread from the previous day 3 eggs 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.910
 salt and pepper to taste half a liter of 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.280
 milk and 100 grams of cheese to tear 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.430
 for the good trout for the sauce let's go 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.920
 to need 250 grams of shrimp 200 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.809
 grams of green onion 2 tomatoes 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.910
 preferably peeled broth in 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.789
 amount needed and a spoonful 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.129
 cream cheese tureen and finally for 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.649
 the grilled trout we need 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.110
 4 trout of approximately in total 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:12.780
 would be about a kilo of salt trout 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.759
 and pepper to taste and oil in quantity 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.610
 necessary the heron so we're 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.530
 exactly four small trout or 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.630
 may well be two great ones also the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.970
 idea that they have about one kilo 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.530
 so I can do the same recipe 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.329
 without trout and with chilies 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.280
 but of course yes and give everything for 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.679
 course for example they can prepare it 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.240
 with a hake fillet perfectly 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.860
 with any fillet of yesterday's part 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.530
 for the specialty for example and there was 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.439
 an offer of one kilo of filet at 15 p 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.810
 here is very cheap eye is never going to be 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.420
 very cool an offer of fish that 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.470
 type keep it in mind also to that if 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.450
 they want to buy a good fish 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.399
 Surely you have to pay a little more 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.649
 but what we want to say 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.020
 they need to save they can get 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.939
 Cheap fish can do it in the river 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.549
 virgin exactly lizard you have to 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.380
 eat it always in the day and you can by 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.030

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:09.020
