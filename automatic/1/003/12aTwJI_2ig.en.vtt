hi guys this Jonathan here from guitar
tips<00:00:16.039> weekly<00:00:16.219> comm<00:00:16.960> today<00:00:17.960> I<00:00:17.990> wanted<00:00:18.289> to<00:00:18.349> talk

tips weekly comm today I wanted to talk

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.670 
tips weekly comm today I wanted to talk
a<00:00:18.650> little<00:00:18.949> bit<00:00:19.189> about<00:00:20.079> dynamics<00:00:21.079> and<00:00:21.289> how<00:00:21.320> you

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
a little bit about dynamics and how you

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.970 
a little bit about dynamics and how you
can<00:00:21.919> use<00:00:22.509> different<00:00:23.509> styles<00:00:24.169> of<00:00:24.380> either

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
can use different styles of either

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.740 
can use different styles of either
picking<00:00:25.430> or<00:00:25.579> strumming<00:00:26.090> and<00:00:26.360> inter<00:00:26.630> mixing

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
picking or strumming and inter mixing

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.689 
picking or strumming and inter mixing
all<00:00:27.079> those<00:00:27.230> different<00:00:27.619> types<00:00:27.770> of<00:00:27.919> things<00:00:27.980> to

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
all those different types of things to

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:30.190 
all those different types of things to
really<00:00:28.969> affect<00:00:29.270> your<00:00:29.390> dynamics<00:00:29.899> and<00:00:30.050> how<00:00:30.140> you

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200 
really affect your dynamics and how you

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.780 
really affect your dynamics and how you
can<00:00:30.410> really<00:00:30.739> build<00:00:30.860> a<00:00:31.009> song<00:00:31.250> so<00:00:31.579> the

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
can really build a song so the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.240 
can really build a song so the
progression<00:00:32.780> that<00:00:32.809> I'm<00:00:32.989> using<00:00:33.590> is<00:00:33.860> basically

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
progression that I'm using is basically

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.330 
progression that I'm using is basically
just<00:00:34.370> variations<00:00:34.850> of<00:00:35.390> a<00:00:35.510> D<00:00:35.660> chord<00:00:35.899> and<00:00:36.860> open<00:00:37.160> D

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
just variations of a D chord and open D

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.510 
just variations of a D chord and open D
word<00:00:37.610> and<00:00:37.820> then<00:00:38.600> I'm<00:00:39.559> using<00:00:39.800> for<00:00:40.190> my<00:00:40.280> root<00:00:40.489> note

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
word and then I'm using for my root note

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.660 
word and then I'm using for my root note
I<00:00:40.789> go<00:00:40.910> to<00:00:40.969> an<00:00:41.149> e<00:00:41.329> on<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:42.500> 4th<00:00:42.770> string<00:00:43.160> 2nd<00:00:43.640> fret

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
I go to an e on the 4th string 2nd fret

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.069 
I go to an e on the 4th string 2nd fret
I<00:00:44.149> just<00:00:44.690> kind<00:00:44.870> of<00:00:45.970> hit<00:00:46.970> that<00:00:47.150> either<00:00:47.329> and<00:00:47.720> then

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
I just kind of hit that either and then

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.870 
I just kind of hit that either and then
I<00:00:48.110> go<00:00:48.320> to<00:00:48.350> a<00:00:48.470> B<00:00:49.180> on<00:00:50.180> the<00:00:50.300> 2nd<00:00:50.660> fret<00:00:51.460> yeah<00:00:52.460> 2nd

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
I go to a B on the 2nd fret yeah 2nd

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.110 
I go to a B on the 2nd fret yeah 2nd
fret<00:00:53.120> of<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:53.630> 5th<00:00:54.020> string<00:00:54.110> and<00:00:54.649> then<00:00:55.460> I<00:00:55.760> move

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
fret of the 5th string and then I move

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.930 
fret of the 5th string and then I move
up<00:00:56.180> to<00:00:56.360> the<00:00:56.480> seen<00:00:57.160> on<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:58.280> 3rd<00:00:58.520> fret<00:00:58.700> of<00:00:58.910> the

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
up to the seen on the 3rd fret of the

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.389 
up to the seen on the 3rd fret of the
5th<00:00:59.239> string<00:00:59.329> and<00:00:59.690> then<00:00:59.780> back<00:00:59.960> to<00:01:00.110> the<00:01:00.230> D<00:01:00.399> so

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
5th string and then back to the D so

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:02.740 
5th string and then back to the D so
just<00:01:01.610> if<00:01:01.730> you<00:01:01.820> want<00:01:02.000> to<00:01:02.059> follow<00:01:02.180> along<00:01:02.510> that's

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
just if you want to follow along that's

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.130 
just if you want to follow along that's
kind<00:01:02.989> of<00:01:03.020> what<00:01:03.200> I'm<00:01:03.320> I'm<00:01:03.860> using<00:01:04.570> but<00:01:05.570> my<00:01:05.930> goal

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
kind of what I'm I'm using but my goal

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.389 
kind of what I'm I'm using but my goal
here<00:01:06.290> today<00:01:06.530> is<00:01:06.680> not<00:01:06.710> to<00:01:06.950> teach<00:01:07.130> you<00:01:07.280> the

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:07.399 
here today is not to teach you the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.910 
here today is not to teach you the
progression<00:01:07.659> so<00:01:08.659> much<00:01:08.810> as<00:01:08.990> it<00:01:09.200> is<00:01:09.229> to<00:01:09.530> show<00:01:09.860> you

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
progression so much as it is to show you

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.280 
progression so much as it is to show you
how<00:01:10.159> you<00:01:10.219> can<00:01:10.460> use<00:01:10.840> different<00:01:11.840> picking

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
how you can use different picking

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.350 
how you can use different picking
patterns<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:12.979> strumming<00:01:13.280> patterns<00:01:13.790> and<00:01:14.060> just

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
patterns and strumming patterns and just

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.730 
patterns and strumming patterns and just
changing<00:01:14.780> things<00:01:15.020> up<00:01:15.170> to<00:01:15.320> really<00:01:15.500> kind<00:01:15.680> of

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
changing things up to really kind of

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.730 
changing things up to really kind of
build<00:01:16.040> a<00:01:16.159> song<00:01:16.689> to<00:01:17.689> you<00:01:17.990> know<00:01:18.079> bring<00:01:18.289> it<00:01:18.409> up<00:01:18.530> and

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
build a song to you know bring it up and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.760 
build a song to you know bring it up and
then<00:01:18.799> bring<00:01:18.889> it<00:01:19.069> down<00:01:19.159> cuz<00:01:19.600> nobody<00:01:20.600> likes<00:01:20.780> you

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
then bring it down cuz nobody likes you

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.260 
then bring it down cuz nobody likes you
know<00:01:21.859> it's<00:01:22.249> very<00:01:22.429> difficult<00:01:22.789> to<00:01:22.939> listen<00:01:23.090> to

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
know it's very difficult to listen to

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.999 
know it's very difficult to listen to
something<00:01:23.479> that's<00:01:23.719> always<00:01:23.869> in<00:01:24.079> a<00:01:24.139> monotone<00:01:24.530> if

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
something that's always in a monotone if

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.590 
something that's always in a monotone if
I<00:01:25.189> just<00:01:25.340> talk<00:01:25.549> to<00:01:25.670> you<00:01:25.759> like<00:01:25.880> this<00:01:26.090> for<00:01:26.509> the

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
I just talk to you like this for the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.809 
I just talk to you like this for the
entire<00:01:26.929> time<00:01:27.590> through<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:28.279> video<00:01:28.549> you

00:01:28.809 --> 00:01:28.819 
entire time through the video you

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:30.069 
entire time through the video you
probably<00:01:28.999> get<00:01:29.299> bored<00:01:29.539> and<00:01:29.689> turn<00:01:29.869> it<00:01:29.959> off

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
probably get bored and turn it off

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.739 
probably get bored and turn it off
immediately<00:01:30.729> but<00:01:31.729> if<00:01:31.819> I<00:01:31.939> start<00:01:32.209> varying<00:01:32.509> my

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:32.749 
immediately but if I start varying my

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:35.859 
immediately but if I start varying my
voice<00:01:33.939> it's<00:01:34.939> just<00:01:35.149> more<00:01:35.329> natural<00:01:35.450> right

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
voice it's just more natural right

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.090 
voice it's just more natural right
that's<00:01:36.049> what<00:01:36.200> people<00:01:36.350> expect<00:01:36.499> that's<00:01:36.979> what

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
that's what people expect that's what

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.129 
that's what people expect that's what
we're<00:01:37.219> used<00:01:37.429> to<00:01:37.549> and<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:38.569> same<00:01:38.779> thing<00:01:38.990> with

00:01:39.129 --> 00:01:39.139 
we're used to and the same thing with

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:42.760 
we're used to and the same thing with
music<00:01:39.289> you<00:01:39.679> know<00:01:39.829> if<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.399> entire<00:01:40.670> song<00:01:41.770> is

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
music you know if the entire song is

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.789 
music you know if the entire song is
just<00:01:42.829> this

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.970 

you<00:01:46.799> know<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:46.979> sounds<00:01:47.220> okay

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.580 

but<00:01:51.790> there's<00:01:51.970> not<00:01:52.090> a<00:01:52.150> lot<00:01:52.450> you<00:01:52.810> know<00:01:53.440> you're

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
but there's not a lot you know you're

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.720 
but there's not a lot you know you're
not<00:01:53.650> saying<00:01:53.950> a<00:01:54.040> lot<00:01:54.070> with<00:01:54.400> when<00:01:54.610> you're

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
not saying a lot with when you're

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.390 
not saying a lot with when you're
playing<00:01:54.970> a<00:01:55.060> song<00:01:55.240> like<00:01:55.510> that<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.950> so<00:01:57.220> much

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
playing a song like that and so much

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.660 
playing a song like that and so much
more<00:01:57.700> can<00:01:57.880> be<00:01:57.910> said<00:01:58.240> really<00:01:58.570> right<00:01:58.750> so<00:01:59.640> one<00:02:00.640> of

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
more can be said really right so one of

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.640 
more can be said really right so one of
the<00:02:00.790> things<00:02:01.000> that<00:02:01.150> I<00:02:01.240> like<00:02:01.420> to<00:02:01.450> do<00:02:01.690> is<00:02:01.990> I<00:02:02.620> just

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
the things that I like to do is I just

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.110 
the things that I like to do is I just
pluck<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.640> root<00:02:03.820> note<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:04.210> then<00:02:05.110> I<00:02:05.410> do<00:02:05.500> a

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
pluck the root note and then I do a

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.400 
pluck the root note and then I do a
simple<00:02:07.120> picking<00:02:07.420> pattern<00:02:07.780> and<00:02:07.990> oftentimes

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
simple picking pattern and oftentimes

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:15.210 
simple picking pattern and oftentimes
what<00:02:08.800> I'll<00:02:08.890> do<00:02:09.040> is<00:02:09.220> I<00:02:10.050> just<00:02:11.050> kind<00:02:11.470> of<00:02:13.890> I'll<00:02:14.890> hit

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
what I'll do is I just kind of I'll hit

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.470 
what I'll do is I just kind of I'll hit
the<00:02:15.340> root<00:02:15.520> note<00:02:15.700> then<00:02:15.940> I'll<00:02:16.060> come<00:02:16.270> back<00:02:16.420> down

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
the root note then I'll come back down

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.560 
the root note then I'll come back down
through<00:02:17.110> like<00:02:17.410> 1<00:02:17.650> 3<00:02:17.680> 2<00:02:18.220> through<00:02:18.580> there<00:02:18.850> 1<00:02:19.210> 2<00:02:19.240> 3

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
through like 1 3 2 through there 1 2 3

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.390 
through like 1 3 2 through there 1 2 3
through<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:19.990> strings<00:02:20.260> right<00:02:20.410> through

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
through the strings right through

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.580 
through the strings right through
strings<00:02:21.700> 1<00:02:21.940> 2<00:02:22.090> 3<00:02:24.240> and<00:02:25.240> kind<00:02:26.170> of<00:02:26.230> bounce<00:02:26.440> around

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
strings 1 2 3 and kind of bounce around

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.860 
strings 1 2 3 and kind of bounce around
in<00:02:26.890> there<00:02:27.070> and<00:02:27.100> honestly<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.030> don't<00:02:28.180> think<00:02:28.570> a

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
in there and honestly I don't think a

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.360 
in there and honestly I don't think a
lot<00:02:29.110> about<00:02:29.320> the<00:02:29.560> picking<00:02:29.830> pattern<00:02:30.190> about

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
lot about the picking pattern about

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.400 
lot about the picking pattern about
keeping<00:02:30.730> it<00:02:30.820> really<00:02:30.940> consistent<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:31.780> tend<00:02:32.350> to

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
keeping it really consistent I tend to

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.320 
keeping it really consistent I tend to
vary<00:02:32.650> it<00:02:32.890> quite<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.220> bit<00:02:33.280> I've<00:02:33.730> got<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:33.970> few<00:02:34.180> that

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
vary it quite a bit I've got a few that

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.940 
vary it quite a bit I've got a few that
I'm<00:02:34.450> comfortable<00:02:35.170> with<00:02:35.350> and<00:02:35.620> I'll<00:02:35.710> change

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
I'm comfortable with and I'll change

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.000 
I'm comfortable with and I'll change
them<00:02:36.250> up<00:02:36.870> as<00:02:37.870> we<00:02:38.110> go<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.410> main<00:02:38.530> thing<00:02:38.740> is<00:02:38.860> that

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
them up as we go the main thing is that

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.440 
them up as we go the main thing is that
the<00:02:39.100> beat<00:02:39.280> is<00:02:39.460> staying<00:02:39.730> consistent<00:02:39.970> that

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
the beat is staying consistent that

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.210 
the beat is staying consistent that
you're<00:02:40.570> hitting<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.930> root<00:02:41.140> note<00:02:41.350> in<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:42.010> same

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
you're hitting the root note in the same

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.910 
you're hitting the root note in the same
spot<00:02:42.610> every<00:02:42.790> time<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:44.110> know<00:02:44.230> usually<00:02:44.740> at<00:02:44.830> the

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
spot every time you know usually at the

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.450 
spot every time you know usually at the
beginning<00:02:45.010> of<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.400> bar<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:47.070> then<00:02:48.070> you<00:02:48.130> know

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
beginning of the bar and then you know

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.490 
beginning of the bar and then you know
if<00:02:48.550> you<00:02:48.640> want<00:02:48.820> to<00:02:48.850> change<00:02:49.450> up<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:50.110> actual

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
if you want to change up the the actual

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.020 
if you want to change up the the actual
strings<00:02:50.860> that<00:02:51.010> you're<00:02:51.160> plucking<00:02:51.400> that's<00:02:51.730> ok

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
strings that you're plucking that's ok

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.240 
strings that you're plucking that's ok
you<00:02:52.090> can<00:02:52.330> you<00:02:53.260> know<00:02:53.350> change<00:02:53.590> it<00:02:53.980> up<00:02:54.070> however

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
you can you know change it up however

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.110 
you can you know change it up however
you<00:02:54.490> see<00:02:54.700> fit

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
you see fit

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.090 
you see fit
I<00:02:55.150> like<00:02:55.630> using<00:02:55.810> a<00:02:56.020> pick<00:02:56.230> tube<00:02:56.500> in<00:02:56.680> this<00:02:56.860> case

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
I like using a pick tube in this case

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.890 
I like using a pick tube in this case
I'm<00:02:57.250> going<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.400> be<00:02:57.490> using<00:02:57.790> a<00:02:57.880> pick<00:02:58.090> but

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
I'm going to be using a pick but

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.170 
I'm going to be using a pick but
sometimes<00:02:59.500> I'll<00:02:59.680> use<00:03:00.310> my<00:03:00.910> fingers<00:03:00.940> instead

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
sometimes I'll use my fingers instead

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.460 
sometimes I'll use my fingers instead
feel<00:03:04.180> free<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.420> do<00:03:04.570> whatever<00:03:04.750> works<00:03:05.110> for<00:03:05.230> you

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
feel free to do whatever works for you

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.350 
feel free to do whatever works for you
right<00:03:05.500> um<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.700> main<00:03:06.820> thing<00:03:07.060> I<00:03:07.150> want<00:03:07.300> to

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
right um the main thing I want to

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.800 
right um the main thing I want to
demonstrate<00:03:07.480> here<00:03:08.020> is<00:03:08.080> how<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:08.320> can<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:09.370> know

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
demonstrate here is how you can you know

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.449 
demonstrate here is how you can you know
go<00:03:10.810> from<00:03:11.080> very<00:03:11.260> simple<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.890> a<00:03:11.920> little<00:03:12.220> bit<00:03:12.310> more

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
go from very simple to a little bit more

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.000 
go from very simple to a little bit more
complicated<00:03:12.820> perhaps<00:03:13.420> a<00:03:13.570> stronger<00:03:14.110> strumming

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
complicated perhaps a stronger strumming

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.560 
complicated perhaps a stronger strumming
pattern<00:03:15.370> etc<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.180> kind<00:03:16.840> of<00:03:16.930> use<00:03:17.140> that<00:03:17.170> to<00:03:18.570> to

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
pattern etc and kind of use that to to

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.000 
pattern etc and kind of use that to to
affect<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.170> dynamics<00:03:20.590> that<00:03:20.709> you're<00:03:20.800> playing

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
affect the dynamics that you're playing

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.620 
affect the dynamics that you're playing
so<00:03:21.520> I'm<00:03:21.610> just<00:03:21.730> gonna<00:03:21.820> demonstrate<00:03:22.150> a<00:03:22.450> little

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
so I'm just gonna demonstrate a little

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.570 
so I'm just gonna demonstrate a little
bigger<00:03:22.870> for<00:03:22.989> you<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:23.410> hopefully<00:03:23.680> you<00:03:23.800> can<00:03:23.830> you

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
bigger for you and hopefully you can you

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.550 
bigger for you and hopefully you can you
know<00:03:24.670> don't<00:03:25.150> know<00:03:25.420> try<00:03:25.600> to<00:03:25.630> learn<00:03:25.870> watch<00:03:26.290> so

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
know don't know try to learn watch so

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.050 
know don't know try to learn watch so
much<00:03:26.680> what<00:03:26.890> my<00:03:27.010> fingers<00:03:27.070> are<00:03:27.489> doing<00:03:27.520> just<00:03:27.910> try

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
much what my fingers are doing just try

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.080 
much what my fingers are doing just try
to<00:03:28.120> listen<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:28.950> more<00:03:29.950> to<00:03:30.160> the<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.550> concept<00:03:30.940> of

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
to listen and more to the the concept of

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.030 
to listen and more to the the concept of
what's<00:03:31.300> happening<00:03:31.750> here<00:03:31.810> so<00:03:32.500> you<00:03:32.560> can<00:03:32.800> try<00:03:32.980> to

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
what's happening here so you can try to

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.470 
what's happening here so you can try to
start<00:03:33.250> applying<00:03:33.550> that<00:03:33.700> to<00:03:33.940> your<00:03:34.060> own<00:03:34.209> playing

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
start applying that to your own playing

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.050 
start applying that to your own playing
right<00:03:34.750> you<00:03:34.959> probably<00:03:35.430> know<00:03:36.430> some<00:03:36.760> simple

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
right you probably know some simple

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.449 
right you probably know some simple
picking<00:03:37.750> pattern<00:03:38.080> and<00:03:38.950> you<00:03:39.040> probably<00:03:39.220> know

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
picking pattern and you probably know

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.010 
picking pattern and you probably know
some<00:03:39.700> simple<00:03:40.120> strumming<00:03:40.390> patterns<00:03:40.840> so<00:03:40.930> you

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
some simple strumming patterns so you

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.420 
some simple strumming patterns so you
can<00:03:41.170> start<00:03:41.440> with<00:03:41.620> those<00:03:41.770> two<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.190> start

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
can start with those two and start

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.640 
can start with those two and start
merging<00:03:42.640> them<00:03:42.940> together<00:03:43.090> right<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:44.470> if

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
merging them together right and if

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.520 
merging them together right and if
you're<00:03:44.770> more<00:03:44.890> advanced<00:03:45.450> then<00:03:46.450> you<00:03:47.170> start<00:03:47.440> off

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
you're more advanced then you start off

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.020 
you're more advanced then you start off
more<00:03:47.739> advanced<00:03:48.040> and<00:03:48.160> you<00:03:48.220> can<00:03:48.400> take<00:03:48.550> this<00:03:48.700> and

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
more advanced and you can take this and

00:03:49.030 --> 00:05:01.249 
more advanced and you can take this and
really<00:03:49.930> run<00:03:50.110> with<00:03:50.140> it<00:03:50.380> ok

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.320 

so<00:05:02.259> you<00:05:02.860> can<00:05:03.039> see<00:05:03.219> it<00:05:03.309> playing<00:05:03.819> there<00:05:04.029> isn't

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
so you can see it playing there isn't

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.469 
so you can see it playing there isn't
perfect<00:05:04.749> and<00:05:05.939> no<00:05:06.939> one's<00:05:07.089> perfect

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 
perfect and no one's perfect

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:10.589 
perfect and no one's perfect
right<00:05:07.599> that's<00:05:07.779> fine<00:05:09.059> what<00:05:10.059> I<00:05:10.089> hope<00:05:10.240> you<00:05:10.389> gather

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
right that's fine what I hope you gather

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:13.769 
right that's fine what I hope you gather
from<00:05:10.960> that<00:05:11.050> is<00:05:11.680> simply<00:05:12.279> I<00:05:12.490> was<00:05:13.479> using

00:05:13.769 --> 00:05:13.779 
from that is simply I was using

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:15.299 
from that is simply I was using
different<00:05:13.899> strumming<00:05:14.529> patterns<00:05:14.919> I<00:05:15.069> wasn't

00:05:15.299 --> 00:05:15.309 
different strumming patterns I wasn't

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:16.889 
different strumming patterns I wasn't
making<00:05:15.580> an<00:05:15.669> effort<00:05:15.789> to<00:05:16.059> keep<00:05:16.180> it<00:05:16.330> exactly<00:05:16.779> the

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:16.899 
making an effort to keep it exactly the

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:19.589 
making an effort to keep it exactly the
same<00:05:17.110> all<00:05:17.289> the<00:05:17.319> time<00:05:18.059> sometimes<00:05:19.059> I<00:05:19.479> was

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
same all the time sometimes I was

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.469 
same all the time sometimes I was
throwing<00:05:19.839> in<00:05:20.020> little<00:05:20.229> embellishment<00:05:20.860> notes

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
throwing in little embellishment notes

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.709 
throwing in little embellishment notes
sometimes<00:05:22.479> I<00:05:22.599> just<00:05:22.740> you<00:05:23.740> know<00:05:23.800> left<00:05:24.339> out<00:05:24.719> sharp

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:25.719 
sometimes I just you know left out sharp

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:30.269 
sometimes I just you know left out sharp
on<00:05:25.899> the<00:05:25.990> first<00:05:26.199> string<00:05:26.499> second<00:05:27.129> fret<00:05:29.279> those

00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:30.279 
on the first string second fret those

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:32.999 
on the first string second fret those
all<00:05:30.539> affects<00:05:31.539> the<00:05:31.749> kind<00:05:32.379> of<00:05:32.469> the<00:05:32.559> color<00:05:32.800> of

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
all affects the kind of the color of

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.170 
all affects the kind of the color of
your<00:05:33.159> playing<00:05:33.399> and<00:05:33.669> how<00:05:34.360> it<00:05:34.479> comes<00:05:34.689> across<00:05:34.809> but

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
your playing and how it comes across but

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.879 
your playing and how it comes across but
the<00:05:37.180> main<00:05:37.389> thing<00:05:37.689> for<00:05:37.899> today<00:05:38.289> is<00:05:38.529> that<00:05:38.740> you

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
the main thing for today is that you

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:40.469 
the main thing for today is that you
know<00:05:38.979> I<00:05:39.009> was<00:05:39.219> started<00:05:39.879> out<00:05:39.969> with<00:05:40.059> a<00:05:40.120> picking

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
know I was started out with a picking

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:43.769 
know I was started out with a picking
pattern<00:05:40.509> and<00:05:41.279> then<00:05:42.279> you<00:05:43.089> know<00:05:43.180> I<00:05:43.210> started<00:05:43.479> out

00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:43.779 
pattern and then you know I started out

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:52.249 
pattern and then you know I started out
doing<00:05:43.990> a<00:05:44.319> little<00:05:44.469> bit<00:05:44.620> of<00:05:44.649> picking

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:54.719 

and<00:05:53.259> then<00:05:53.650> you<00:05:53.740> could<00:05:53.919> alternate<00:05:54.460> picking

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
and then you could alternate picking

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.040 
and then you could alternate picking
with<00:05:54.969> strumming<00:05:55.300> maybe<00:05:55.449> you<00:05:55.539> picked<00:05:55.810> for<00:05:55.900> the

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
with strumming maybe you picked for the

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.480 
with strumming maybe you picked for the
first<00:05:56.259> half<00:05:56.439> of<00:05:56.469> the<00:05:56.620> bar<00:05:56.800> you<00:05:56.979> strum<00:05:57.249> for<00:05:57.430> the

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
first half of the bar you strum for the

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.200 
first half of the bar you strum for the
second<00:05:57.819> half

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
second half

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.610 
second half
and<00:05:58.509> then<00:05:58.629> eventually<00:05:58.870> I<00:05:59.050> got<00:05:59.259> to<00:05:59.439> just

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
and then eventually I got to just

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.019 
and then eventually I got to just
straight<00:06:00.039> strumming<00:06:00.520> right<00:06:00.669> and<00:06:00.789> it<00:06:00.849> really

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:01.029 
straight strumming right and it really

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:02.959 
straight strumming right and it really
kind<00:06:01.240> of<00:06:01.300> builds<00:06:01.659> the<00:06:01.779> momentum<00:06:02.199> of<00:06:02.289> the<00:06:02.409> song

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:02.969 
kind of builds the momentum of the song

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:05.010 
kind of builds the momentum of the song
builds<00:06:03.969> the<00:06:04.060> power<00:06:04.240> of<00:06:04.449> it<00:06:04.539> a<00:06:04.599> little<00:06:04.749> bit<00:06:04.810> and

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
builds the power of it a little bit and

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.230 
builds the power of it a little bit and
you<00:06:05.110> can<00:06:05.229> really<00:06:05.469> use<00:06:05.650> that<00:06:05.819> for<00:06:06.819> instance<00:06:07.120> if

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
you can really use that for instance if

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.790 
you can really use that for instance if
you're<00:06:07.360> coming<00:06:07.569> to<00:06:07.779> a<00:06:07.810> bridge<00:06:08.080> or<00:06:08.259> a<00:06:08.289> course<00:06:08.590> or

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
you're coming to a bridge or a course or

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.860 
you're coming to a bridge or a course or
something<00:06:09.129> and<00:06:09.249> you<00:06:09.310> want<00:06:09.400> to<00:06:09.689> increase<00:06:10.689> the

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
something and you want to increase the

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.779 
something and you want to increase the
intensity<00:06:11.319> of<00:06:11.469> the<00:06:11.590> song<00:06:11.800> you<00:06:12.430> can<00:06:12.610> use<00:06:12.759> a

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:12.789 
intensity of the song you can use a

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:16.409 
intensity of the song you can use a
technique<00:06:13.120> like<00:06:13.330> that<00:06:13.539> to<00:06:14.020> do<00:06:14.560> that<00:06:14.770> and<00:06:15.419> so

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
technique like that to do that and so

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.080 
technique like that to do that and so
that's<00:06:16.569> basically<00:06:17.310> today's<00:06:18.310> tip<00:06:18.550> use<00:06:18.789> credit
