00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.510
 and take everything well today is na na 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.690
 truth gives a hint about the 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.560
 assembly of this oil pump which is 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.490
 line of zetec rocam engines 1.0 and 1.6 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:25.350
 and every ford line there it can 2000 nca 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:28.920
 fiesta focus curry and everything that uses motor 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:33.030
 zetec rocam 1.0 and 1.6 uses this 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:37.079
 Oil is here and I'm really the idea. 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.809
 of the video do is give a hint at the one is 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.239
 a simple thing but a lot of 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.360
 not damage the pump 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.700
 oil is the front or the police and 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.600
 or the retainer here we're seeing 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.539
 oil pump 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.520
 we see here that boss that is 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.329
 where does the board of the chart go? 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.190
 here the oil fisherman the ball goes 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.250
 mounted in the engine right 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.040
 then what happens is this ball is 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.570
 by the crankshaft tip here 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.299
 I have an English entry until 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.450
 Rocam 1.6 not see 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.390
 he is the tip is here 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.670
 this is the tip of the beijing veil keeps a 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.130
 screw with the police here we see 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.790
 gear that touches the chain 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.439
 Oil pump control will mount from the face 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.560
 what is missing the block is not 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:33.390
 but it is mounted in front of the block 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.060
 yes you in that position you check 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.000
 check that you have a break it 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.810
 points to overbooking and is the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.579
 oil, right? 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.520
 so what happens in most of these 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.729
 engine that uses an oil pump in the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.049
 front of the crankshaft as for example the 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.540
 emmy and monza vectra this line where the 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.320
 sight pump is mounted in front of the 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.530
 block 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.530
 the tip of the king bb turns her 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.649
 generally it is made for 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.069
 fit the end of the bb king justy ne 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.599
 there was the baby who has comment here 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.670
 play the ball then the time you 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.950
 mount the oil pump 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.950
 the beque in the block there you arrived with the 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.010
 does not put it into the very 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.770
 bb king centers bomb in case of 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.790
 is the drive system here. 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.980
 is different 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:31.380
 the oil pump is mounted in front of the 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.360
 block nef this gap and enters it 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.580
 that the front police are not 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.860
 it's mounted there you put the 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.920
 pump in the block as it had already occurred small 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.349
 place the police enter here does not fit 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.030
 in this one in that accommodation here that 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:49.019
 turns that is what triggers the oil pump 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.459
 ee inside the pulley picks up here in the summer 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.250
 right here 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.360
 The key is top then what is it? 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.850
 happens 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.430
 we can look here, what these are 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.310
 the pump fixing holes 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.860
 so what happens or any way 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.650
 correct to install the oil pump 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.130
 you maybe a small block installed 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.830
 huh 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.700
 you go and put the oil pump in the 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.680
 place the screws in these 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.739
 wells right here 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.230
 but do not squeeze them just put in place 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.090
 you notice that the read for kitchen 6 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.790
 but these holes are 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.040
 very big, the bolt has a clearance 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.320
 Great idiot, can you move one? 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.150
 bit the oil pump from here 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.790
 So you can let her 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.440
 out of the center a little understood 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.390
 so what happens you will put the 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.900
 oil pump only in screw 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.910
 place does not squeeze them and places 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.840
 the front police, what happens in this 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.269
 procedure 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.920
 the oil pump will be right here the 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.769
 screws will be here in the little place 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.730
 but not tight you will get 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.640
 to stir oil pump 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.290
 There you put a poly in place. 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.209
 public to escape what happens 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.760
 The police are going to go in that place. 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.010
 into the oil pump and into the 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.190
 the tip of the beijing veil and the police itself 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.470
 will sit the oil pump exactly on the 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.150
 center after police in place 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.540
 you tighten the screws 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.479
 if you put the model place without the 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.190
 she had already claimed the bolts she did not 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.019
 will be perfectly in the center for 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.690
 The more you put there when you 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.060
 put the pulley will stay the retainer 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.370
 here the provider actually closes between 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.590
 the oil pump to polish the return will 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.310
 stay out a little bit outside the center 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.320
 will leak oil will pick up the oil seal and 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.240
 in a more extreme condition can break 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.550
 the oil pump we have already taken these 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.630
 cases, then this is the 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.070
 zytek oil pump mount rocam 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.530
 place the oil pump in the front not 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.170
 tightening of the screws only 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:55.830
 puts cops in front of her 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.990
 then tighten the pump screws 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.450
 oil there you are sure that the pump 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.520
 oil will get exactly 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.780
 that the seal assembly is going to 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.550
 stay perfect in the center 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.830
 We've already picked up many engines that 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.810
 mounted wrong right then he left 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.310
 outside the center was forcing the pulley 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.710
 break that was an oil pump 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.540
 leak because of that reason is 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.680
 It's a very simple thing, right? 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:23.160
 but that is very mechanical leave sometimes 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:26.400
 No, you do not know about that , right? 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.530
 I believe that the vast majority today already 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.330
 knows that engine has been running since 2000 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.669
 but it still happens sometimes in the first 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.520
 time you will build a motor, right? 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.320
 Sometimes you do not know the details of what 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.540
 I know it's just this particular bomb that 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.669
 has this question and that of the 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.250
 screws you take a photo of the center 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.720
 then maybe it can happen then this 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.910
 It's the tip Gurizada anything and 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.419
 I allow and it's a big hug for 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.419
 everyone
