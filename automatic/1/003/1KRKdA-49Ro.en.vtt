less<00:00:20.400> experience<00:00:20.880> for<00:00:21.060> Salina<00:00:21.359> making<00:00:21.689> a

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
less experience for Salina making a

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.720 
less experience for Salina making a
little<00:00:21.990> bit<00:00:22.140> harder<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:23.449> strategy<00:00:24.449> here<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.750> to

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
little bit harder a strategy here is to

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.470 
little bit harder a strategy here is to
yawn<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.390> truant<00:00:27.869> doesn't<00:00:28.970> affect<00:00:29.970> quite

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
yawn so that truant doesn't affect quite

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.299 
yawn so that truant doesn't affect quite
as<00:00:30.630> much<00:00:30.840> because<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.769> opponent<00:00:32.189> will<00:00:32.279> be

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
as much because the opponent will be

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.110 
as much because the opponent will be
attacking<00:00:32.880> less<00:00:33.059> often<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.860> won't<00:00:34.860> be<00:00:34.950> getting

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
attacking less often I won't be getting

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.440 
attacking less often I won't be getting
rid<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.149> beyond<00:00:36.420> at<00:00:36.630> some<00:00:36.840> point<00:00:37.140> just<00:00:38.329> to<00:00:39.329> make

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
rid of beyond at some point just to make

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.410 
rid of beyond at some point just to make
things<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.840> bit<00:00:39.870> more<00:00:40.170> challenging<00:00:40.700> but<00:00:41.700> for

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
things a bit more challenging but for

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.790 
things a bit more challenging but for
now<00:00:42.510> jaan<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.809> kind<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.440> saving<00:00:43.770> grace<00:00:45.800> and

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
that misclick didn't matter because I

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.680
