here to talk about the new polaroid pogo
instant<00:00:09.570> digital<00:00:10.050> camera<00:00:10.769> it's<00:00:11.400> this<00:00:11.580> product

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
instant digital camera it's this product

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.529 
instant digital camera it's this product
right<00:00:12.089> here<00:00:13.099> this<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.160> reminiscent<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.419> the

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:15.539 
right here this is reminiscent to the

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:17.300 
right here this is reminiscent to the
Polaroid<00:00:16.260> experience<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:16.920> know<00:00:17.100> and

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
Polaroid experience that you know and

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.179 
Polaroid experience that you know and
love<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:18.270> only<00:00:18.539> difference<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:19.109> it's<00:00:19.470> digital

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
love the only difference is it's digital

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.550 
love the only difference is it's digital
so<00:00:20.460> as<00:00:21.240> opposed<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.689> being<00:00:21.869> instant<00:00:22.320> film

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
so as opposed to being instant film

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.859 
so as opposed to being instant film
based<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.699> actually<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.150> digital

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
based this is actually a digital

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.650 
based this is actually a digital
experience<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.800> know<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.160> love<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:26.660> the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
experience that you know and love so the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.749 
experience that you know and love so the
camera<00:00:27.990> itself<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.589> a<00:00:28.890> full<00:00:29.250> functioning

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
actually printing it as opposed to the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.370 
actually printing it as opposed to the
old<00:01:17.159> Polaroids<00:01:17.490> you'd<00:01:18.299> print<00:01:18.719> it<00:01:18.840> out<00:01:18.960> you

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
old Polaroids you'd print it out you

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.590 
old Polaroids you'd print it out you
take<00:01:19.679> the<00:01:19.799> picture<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.280> if<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.240> wasn't<00:01:21.390> right

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
take the picture and if it wasn't right

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.450 
take the picture and if it wasn't right
you'd<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:21.929> to<00:01:22.020> print<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.259> again<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:23.249> this

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
you'd have to print it again so this

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.800 
you'd have to print it again so this
you're<00:01:23.640> able<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.939> review<00:01:24.210> before<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.630> do<00:01:24.780> it

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
you're able to review before you do it

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.719 
you're able to review before you do it
it's<00:01:25.200> fully<00:01:25.499> dry<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.920> touch<00:01:25.979> as<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.490> comes

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
it's fully dry to the touch as it comes

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.300 
it's fully dry to the touch as it comes
out<00:01:26.909> because<00:01:27.359> there<00:01:27.899> is<00:01:28.079> no<00:01:28.320> ink<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.770> couple<00:01:29.249> of

out because there is no ink a couple of

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.730 
out because there is no ink a couple of
things<00:01:29.520> about<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.969> the<00:01:30.329> process<00:01:30.719> here<00:01:30.929> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
things about the the process here the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.340 
things about the the process here the
paper<00:01:32.100> has<00:01:32.310> ink<00:01:32.939> embedded<00:01:33.539> into<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.140> die

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
paper has ink embedded into it in die

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.380 
paper has ink embedded into it in die
crystals<00:01:34.829> it's<00:01:35.399> passed<00:01:35.700> under<00:01:35.999> a<00:01:36.030> thermal

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
crystals it's passed under a thermal

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.389 
crystals it's passed under a thermal
print<00:01:36.630> head<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.649> thermal<00:01:38.009> print<00:01:38.249> head

activates<00:01:38.969> those<00:01:39.149> die<00:01:39.359> crystals<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.109> because

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
activates those die crystals and because

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.099 
activates those die crystals and because
there<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.399> no<00:01:41.609> ink<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.210> completely<00:01:42.749> dry<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.020> the

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
there is no ink is completely dry to the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.959 
touch as it comes out of the printer
it's<00:01:46.170> about<00:01:46.259> 45<00:01:46.829> seconds<00:01:47.399> from<00:01:47.609> the<00:01:47.670> time<00:01:47.759> you
