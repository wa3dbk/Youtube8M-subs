application<00:01:52.869> you<00:01:52.990> will<00:01:53.140> need<00:01:53.350> for<00:01:53.619> this<00:01:53.770> and

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
application you will need for this and

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.309 
application you will need for this and
again<00:01:54.909> in<00:01:55.060> order<00:01:55.179> to<00:01:55.359> do<00:01:55.600> this<00:01:55.749> you<00:01:55.960> just<00:01:55.990> need

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:56.319 
again in order to do this you just need

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:58.859 
again in order to do this you just need
to<00:01:56.439> first<00:01:56.619> of<00:01:56.740> all<00:01:57.270> going<00:01:58.270> after<00:01:58.659> all<00:01:58.719> these

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
to first of all going after all these

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.419 
to first of all going after all these
applications<00:01:59.469> which<00:01:59.619> are<00:01:59.740> called<00:02:00.009> active

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
applications which are called active

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.789 
applications which are called active
notify<00:02:00.969> so<00:02:01.810> I<00:02:01.840> mean<00:02:02.079> these<00:02:02.259> are<00:02:02.439> different

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
notify so I mean these are different

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.919 
notify so I mean these are different
application<00:02:03.369> doing<00:02:03.759> the<00:02:03.909> same<00:02:04.090> thing<00:02:04.329> but

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
application doing the same thing but

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.419 
application doing the same thing but
again<00:02:05.079> the<00:02:05.380> overall<00:02:05.710> functionality<00:02:06.069> is

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
again the overall functionality is

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.330 
again the overall functionality is
different<00:02:06.850> we<00:02:07.810> have<00:02:07.990> active<00:02:08.319> notify<00:02:08.830> which<00:02:09.130> is

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
different we have active notify which is

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.699 
different we have active notify which is
one<00:02:10.060> application<00:02:10.660> which<00:02:10.780> you<00:02:10.929> can<00:02:11.080> enable<00:02:11.380> and

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
then it will give you notification for

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.199 
then it will give you notification for
all<00:02:13.660> these<00:02:13.840> things<00:02:14.080> again<00:02:15.010> this<00:02:15.280> application

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
all these things again this application

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.420 
all these things again this application
is<00:02:16.300> not<00:02:16.540> that<00:02:16.810> great<00:02:17.350> but<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:17.890> application

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
is not that great but the application

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.890 
is not that great but the application
which<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:18.700> just<00:02:18.880> showed<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.330> which<00:02:19.720> was

working on the lockscreen on this device

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.330 
working on the lockscreen on this device
it<00:02:22.660> can<00:02:22.840> on<00:02:23.020> it<00:02:23.290> can<00:02:23.530> not<00:02:23.740> only<00:02:23.770> work<00:02:24.190> on

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
it can on it can not only work on
