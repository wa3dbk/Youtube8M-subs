 to 100 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:06.580
 but those 60 m to zero slide is budget 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.200
 smartphone 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.040
 slider form factor equipped 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.129
 telephone keypad 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:12.239
 the release of this model was apparently prompted 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:15.230
 high popularity from the phone 67 2 0 a 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.410
 classic attractive 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.919
 the side of the novelty is 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:19.470
 high-quality five-megapixel 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.489
 camera metal body and rich 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:23.130
 choice of color variations this on 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.210
 first glance but if you dig deeper 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.880
 to 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.089
 everything 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:31.589
 cover and edging of the screen but those 60 m to 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:33.820
 scratch slide made of aluminum and everything 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.579
 other parts of the plastic case 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.649
 the back cover sits tight but here 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.430
 parts of the slider are somewhat in 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.710
 hour 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.399
 hold the device comfortably in your hand 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.280
 good mechanism avtozavodsky it 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.149
 allows you to conveniently push the halves 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.059
 housing under the screen on the front panel 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.430
 is the control unit 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.399
 its design keys are neat and 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.269
 functional 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:52.779
 there are six around the joystick 

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:54.309
 Two buttons on top of the control 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.909
 context keys on the sides of the home 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:58.929
 page and cancel last action 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:01.199
 bottom call and hang up use 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.299
 The handset is user friendly and intuitive 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:05.619
 slider expansion is needed only 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.570
 for dialing and typing 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.800
 sliding numeric keypad is wrong 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.710
 conveniently the key is on the 100th and that 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.479
 plastic plate between each other 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.130
 delimited only by longitudinal 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.300
 parents will blindly recruit 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.070
 difficult 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.870
 also the top row of buttons is located 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.659
 too close to the top of the top 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.570
 devices and finger often engage 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.470
 tries on the right side of the smartphone 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.160
 there is a camera activation button 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.650
 top connector 2 millimeter for 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.950
 headphone charger format 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.000
 two and a half meters and no beaten 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.500
 note that when connecting via 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.110
 mechanisms so far this model 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.100
 charging 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.909
 in the end, it seems to us not quite 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.090
 a good solution 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.359
 It was to remove the adjustment rocker 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:45.399
 volume out of the case and replace 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:46.969
 standard audio output with three 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:48.899
 half by two chairs not millimeter 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.829
 rear panels switch novation to 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:52.579
 removed by pressing a button 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.710
 which is under the stub of rose 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.499
 michael beaten 

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:57.349
 not the most convenient way since 

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:59.349
 this is the bottom part of it all the time 

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:01.749
 the slider on the right under the cover is 

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:04.189
 micro sd smartphone slot 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:05.880
 equipped with lithium ion batteries

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.649
 work is 4 hours in mode 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.480
 talk time and 300 hours standby in 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.510
 real use 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.489
 the device showed itself well with no 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.349
 too active she exploited 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.379
 lasted a little over two days 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.069
 a strong point but those 67 to zero slide 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.089
 is a large number of color 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:27.519
 Selling options for this model can be found in 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.939

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:31.549

 pixels main minus on modern 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:46.319
 standards is the fact that he is not himself fortune 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.559
 although of course it affects 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:49.959
 positioning and budget targeting 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.429
 the devices themselves are as good with large 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:54.679
 viewing angles and rich colors 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:55.919
 integrated light sensor 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:57.489
 automatically adjusts the brightness 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.269
 images depending on 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:00.759
 environmental conditions in the sun display 

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:02.729
 slightly loses readability 

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:04.989
 but all displayed items remain 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.999
 visible also the device is equipped 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:07.759
 built-in accelerometer 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:10.039
 which really only works in 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:12.959
 some applications 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.029

 3rd generation symbian xc60 platform 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:22.019
 this operating system is good 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.029
 familiar to users 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:24.059
 smartphones note 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:25.389
 the device is equipped with 6

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.009
 which the user is available 53 megabytes 

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:32.989
 with a micro sd card it can be increased to 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.569
 16 gigabytes in the smartphone 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.639
 set good for this 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.199
 five-megapixel class 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:40.169

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:54.919
 video shooting is 640 by 480 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.609
 points only claim to work 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.039
 cameras this is slow when 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:01.359
 saving pictures and focusing also 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:02.969
 I need an extra crane 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:05.109
 Kelajak cameras designed to 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:05.899
 video calls 

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:07.869
 in but those 60 m to zero slide 

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:09.859
 preloaded services see in volume 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.389
 number and maps but a jeep with a receiver

 that is, them again and also enough 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:22.710
 convenient for frequent use

 Only bluetooth but Wi fi unfortunately 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.820

 relative of the subject 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.280
 models but those 60 m to zero make classic 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.009
 This review combines only 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:40.370
 only the concept of venison reliability 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.810
 the couple’s sanctions 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.199
 usability in 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.580
 the rest is different devices 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.520
 which is not even very similar friend 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.379
 on friend 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:48.909

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:51.319
 everything 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:53.599
 despite the fact that many 60 m to zero 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:55.460
 slide is based on a smartphone on the platform 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.490
 s60 save and it looks more like 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.649
 phone with extended 

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:00.490
 opportunities 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.449
 disadvantages of this model of course 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:02.929
 there is 

00:05:02.929 --> 00:05:04.549
 for example the absence of a paired key 

00:05:04.549 --> 00:05:06.269
 adjust the volume on the side 

00:05:06.269 --> 00:05:06.699
 edges 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:08.490
 but the big one would not hurt but at the same 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.340
 time 67 to zero slide is unique 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.539
 smartphone bz phones economy and what to 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:14.590
 combination with quality 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.990
 stylish design make it 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.069
 great choice 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:19.800
 for those users who often 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.289
 use voice communication but not 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:23.729
 want to deprive yourself more and 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.729
 smartphone functionality
