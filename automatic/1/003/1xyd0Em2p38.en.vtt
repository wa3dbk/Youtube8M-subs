00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
 hello to all i hope you go 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.140
 well we're here today for a 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.490
 review a little bit special 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.370
 since we pass a level above we 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.900
 go review zlatan ibrahimovic do you 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.759
 doubt it to be able to buy me this 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.019
 zlatan I had to buy credits he 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.420
 there is a very good reason for this is the 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.100
 passage to 50 subscribers so I you 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.480
 thank you all for that and at the beginning 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.420
 I planned to do a pack opening 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.560
 or during his pack opening precisely the 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.510
 best player I give it to you in 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.400
 yeah bah yeah unfortunately actually 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.140
 I thought 50 subscribers it was already 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.970
 not enough and in addition if we had to 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.040
 take that players who are on pc 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.630
 and whoever wanted mobile part huawei 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.730
 I find myself with big maximum ten 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.899
 people etc was not possible for me so 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.820
 I said to myself I'm going to buy the 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.469
 credits it will allow to propose you 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.239
 additional player content 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.590
 much more interesting of the kind one 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.520
 asked me the ski wadding several 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.829
 I could not do it 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.280
 so if you want me to do it 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.110
 ask me and so these credits this is 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.810
 a kind of 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.790
 special 50 subscribers let's say it's a 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.320
 little weird to say that but that's it 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.670
 it is to thank you so I have 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.770
 took out my little sousse where it was necessary 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.140
 buy all this but finally me it's me 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.460
 is always a pleasure and I hope that 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.600
 arrange you and you could me 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.950
 offer a lot more players 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.870
 interesting from now 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.700
 good I stop to tell you my life is 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.290
 now go to serious things 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.640
 have passed to the review tss zlatan is 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.530
 so there you asked but where is this 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.910
 that he's gone so there's a reason 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.979
 very simple I resold it before because 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.940
 that in fact its price started to fall and 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.260
 I told myself I must avoid 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.570
 lose is credited the first review 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.130
 so I resell kills but do 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.690
 worry I kept his general is 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.890
 by the way speaking of general we go 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.810
 immediately we go right to 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.400
 balance sheet of this damn could see when 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.460
 seven games and scored 14 goals and made 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.840
 no decisive pass this really very 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.369
 very good record and I bought them a 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.740
 million four hundred and eleven thousand credit this 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.640
 which is just exorbitant and the majority 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.290
 people watching us this 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.640
 video will never be able to afford it and 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.830
 me either if I had not bought 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.630
 these credits we go now point 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.520
 weak of this the latin ibrahimovic I 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.140
 have to say that his weak point is the 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.729
 one fact is the price the 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.810
 just exceptionally expensive it's 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.610
 amazing to see players who 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.450
 can be so dearly clear I 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.950
 found that it was justified 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.690
 unfortunately it's really too expensive 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.070
 finally I mean it's justified in 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.810
 the sense that it's really an excellent 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.370
 player but that could be justified to 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.740
 800,000 credit also and not a 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.940
 million four hundred and eleven thousand credit 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.920
 besides its price that makes me want to 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.970
 pulling out my hair I think it's 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.530
 is everything for its weak points and we 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.000
 now go to those points that do not 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.980
 are not strong points but who are 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.690
 not weak points in 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.370
 this box a little ambiguous you you 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.540
 ask what can I put all 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.040
 I just want to put his speed 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.080
 so it's fast but not too much 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.549
 explain to me you can have balloons 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.239
 in depth where you are alone 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:30.799
 pretty much and you're moving towards the goal of 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.570
 play defenders a little fast 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.970
 will not have much trouble with the 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.420
 catch up however her power she 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.010
 compensates 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.540
 obviously that's not all 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.489
 defenders who can catch the game 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.170
 by the fastest kind defenders 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.250
 thiago silva 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.870
 the second thing a little strange 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.549
 lucky the tan it's his placement 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.989
 so he low in defense which is a 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.880
 very good thing but he also has that 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.840
 only means in attack what makes 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.340
 that he will not always be at the forefront 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.709
 of attacked him as one would like he goes 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.360
 sometimes in quotation marks sit in 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.530
 out of the surface is for example on 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.750
 centers it's going to be a little bit 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.489
 problematic without and or his fists 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.450
 a little bit negative and we pass 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.040
 now to those real 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.050
 strong and god knows that there are many 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.790
 his first strong point you doubt it 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.110
 it's those shots so he's just 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.220
 incredible in this area 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.550
 frankly I've never seen a player 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.840
 as efficient at the level of shooting 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.819
 will end up with everything in the 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.810
 surface really I was amazed sometimes 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.220
 he manages to find angles 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.470
 really amazing to score 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.630
 goals her finish she's just 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.890
 exceptional I have rarely been taken to 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.870
 defect frankly whenever they 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.160
 end up in goals that will end at 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.140
 bottom of the nets it's just amazing 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.760
 in this area there and frankly shoot 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.129
 from any angle the guardian does 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.420
 can never catch it at least he 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.530
 will always end up in a corner and that's 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.880
 really something extremely 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.849
 pleasure when a player too 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.190
 powerful and as domineering as zlatan 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.540
 the second big highlight of this damn 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.310
 we will say that it is part of him 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.780
 even that's his power he's just 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.540
 incredible on the ground we say a 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.069
 defender so much that he is tall 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.000
 really they smash everyone on 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.620
 the field there are no other words 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.910
 it's just amazing everyone 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.440
 around him within a perimeter of a 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.190
 meter is on the ground it's just 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.930
 unbelievable 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.430
 I really advise you to leave 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.530
 just for that I typed 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.970
 huge bar have the defenders doing 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.280
 flights hovering all over the 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.989
 field at zlatan crossing is so 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.760
 you understood him his power is 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.220
 really one of those huge strong points 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.660
 his third big strong point can be 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.220
 to say it's his dribbling then his 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.780
 dribbling is a little mixed because 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.910
 that really I feel that his dribbling 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.620
 its relation to its size 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.780
 really he is exceptionally agile 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.090
 for its size unfortunately this is 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.010
 not at the level of a mba and company you 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.150
 do not wait for that it's really for his 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.830
 size he can really dribble 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.710
 defender he remains no less 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.060
 exceptional in this area this is 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.560
 pity he only has 4 stars 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.240
 joystick this year because my 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.860
 last I put a lot of fun 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.270
 with this player 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.770
 this year you just have to take in 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.820
 account that precisely he has four stars 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.770
 technical gesture etc this may not be 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.210
 not the best dribbler either 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.400
 you can find in the game 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.139
 another bridge really surprising on this 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.490
 only to not ccpt not if he really 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.260
 very impressed in this area 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.789
 it's not his precise enough 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.039
 powerful and she always comes to good 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.810
 wearing a thing that really surprised me 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.310
 on this zlatan so his free kicks then 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.690
 I fired three free kicks he my friend 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.789
 2 which is really amazing for 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.200
 a person who is as bad as me to 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:08.200
 take free kicks really I get you 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.510
 I put two 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.070
 in the video you can see that they 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.930
 are extremely accurate and she 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.550
 really falls well in the nets the 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.110
 last big highlight of that tan 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.880
 it's at the level of his head so already at 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.200
 level of its power they allow 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.150
 really move the defenders who are 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.890
 around him and reach for the head and he 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.450
 do not even need to jump because of its size 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.890
 and his heads are just extremely 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.230
 accurate and extremely powerful 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.360
 I put one but there was a 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.530
 corner which saved them on the line to 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.450
 last second and could see that 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.610
 it was really very good 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.020
 while this video just passed 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.000
 5 minutes there I really have 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.800
 think to conclude and so the only thing 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.850
 which you need to know about this 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.470
 morning is that its only weak point 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.450
 that's are taken otherwise it's just 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.790
 incredible it's the best player that 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.350
 I tested in this game that's why 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.060
 I mine the very good note of nine 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:55.660
 and a half on 10 and not 10 because 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:57.190
 its price is just incredible i hope 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.020
 that you liked this video you will see
