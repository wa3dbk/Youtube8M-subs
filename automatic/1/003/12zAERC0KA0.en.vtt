bigger scene than it really is the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.490

reason they got the name lowriders is

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.260

because<00:00:52.830> they<00:00:53.010> would<00:00:53.130> actually<00:00:53.280> be<00:00:53.670> driving

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
because they would actually be driving

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.480 
because they would actually be driving
solo<00:00:54.480> scraping<00:00:55.140> up<00:00:55.230> their<00:00:55.380> body<00:00:55.560> and<00:00:55.920> then

solo scraping up their body and then
from<00:00:56.700> there<00:00:56.910> he<00:00:57.030> eventually<00:00:57.270> grew<00:00:57.690> into<00:00:58.170> a
