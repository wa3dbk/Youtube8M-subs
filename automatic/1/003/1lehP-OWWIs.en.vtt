00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.740 

this<00:00:10.650> is<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:10.830> patient<00:00:11.400> who<00:00:12.090> came<00:00:12.120> in<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.630> us

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
this is a patient who came in to us

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.420 
this is a patient who came in to us
several<00:00:13.019> weeks<00:00:13.349> ago<00:00:13.500> who<00:00:14.460> had<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:15.980> red<00:00:16.980> scaly

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
several weeks ago who had a red scaly

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.900 
several weeks ago who had a red scaly
irritated<00:00:18.390> area<00:00:18.750> up<00:00:19.100> along<00:00:20.100> her<00:00:20.279> upper<00:00:20.609> chest

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
irritated area up along her upper chest

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.330 
irritated area up along her upper chest
here<00:00:21.210> we<00:00:21.510> did<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.750> shave<00:00:22.230> biopsy<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.160> came

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
here we did a shave biopsy and it came

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.759 
here we did a shave biopsy and it came
back<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.580> squamous<00:00:23.880> cell<00:00:24.210> carcinomas<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.590> so

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
back a squamous cell carcinomas and so

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.939 
back a squamous cell carcinomas and so
we're<00:00:25.980> basically<00:00:26.420> have<00:00:27.420> two<00:00:27.720> skin<00:00:28.529> cancers

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
we're basically have two skin cancers

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.220 
we're basically have two skin cancers
basal<00:00:29.429> cell<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.670> squamous<00:00:30.029> cell<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:31.019> one

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
basal cell and squamous cell this one

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.170 
basal cell and squamous cell this one
was<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.529> squamous<00:00:31.800> cell<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.669> girls<00:00:32.969> have

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
was the squamous cell the girls have

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.060 
was the squamous cell the girls have
already<00:00:33.450> come<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.780> as<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.020> can<00:00:34.170> see<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.890> go

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
already come in as you can see to go

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.260 
already come in as you can see to go
ahead<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.989> numb<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.170> area<00:00:37.940> what<00:00:38.940> I'm<00:00:39.059> going

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
ahead and numb the area what I'm going

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.850 
ahead and numb the area what I'm going
to<00:00:39.390> do<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.750> take<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.230> little<00:00:40.469> three

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
to do is I take this little three

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.190 
to do is I take this little three
millimeter<00:00:41.309> correct<00:00:41.850> when<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.420> correct

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
millimeter correct when I correct

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.610 
millimeter correct when I correct
normal<00:00:43.710> skin<00:00:44.149> it<00:00:45.149> will<00:00:45.390> not<00:00:45.840> come<00:00:46.110> off<00:00:46.140> with

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
normal skin it will not come off with

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.639 
normal skin it will not come off with
the<00:00:46.739> correct<00:00:47.070> but<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:48.390> cancer<00:00:48.930> itself<00:00:49.350> is

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
the correct but the the cancer itself is

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.680 
the correct but the the cancer itself is
almost<00:00:49.920> like<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.340> inside<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.820> an<00:00:51.059> apple<00:00:51.480> pie

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
almost like the inside of an apple pie

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.139 
almost like the inside of an apple pie
is<00:00:51.750> very<00:00:52.199> easy<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.680> scoop<00:00:53.100> out<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.820> helps<00:00:54.120> to

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
is very easy to scoop out so it helps to

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.990 
is very easy to scoop out so it helps to
find<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.809> border<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:56.039> do<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.399> not<00:00:56.699> all<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
find the border we do this not all the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000 
find the border we do this not all the
time<00:00:57.210> many<00:00:57.600> times<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:58.079> kind<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.350> better<00:00:58.559> define

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
time many times to kind of better define

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.700 
time many times to kind of better define
the<00:00:59.219> size<00:00:59.660> so<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.809> we<00:01:00.930> can<00:01:01.109> try<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.379> get<00:01:01.559> it

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
the size so that we can try and get it

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.579 
the size so that we can try and get it
in<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.010> first<00:01:02.190> pass<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:03.480> here's<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.290> little

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
in the first pass so here's a little

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.820 
in the first pass so here's a little
area<00:01:05.390> about<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> nickel<00:01:06.780> between<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> nickel<00:01:07.710> and

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
area about a nickel between a nickel and

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.160 
area about a nickel between a nickel and
quarter<00:01:08.250> size<00:01:08.490> now<00:01:09.330> when<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.600> kind<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.990> better

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
quarter size now when I kind of better

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.929 
quarter size now when I kind of better
describe<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.890> now<00:01:11.040> I'll<00:01:11.250> go<00:01:11.430> ahead<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.820> give

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
describe it now I'll go ahead and give

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.380 
describe it now I'll go ahead and give
it<00:01:12.060> about<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.360> one<00:01:12.689> or<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.990> two<00:01:13.020> millimeter

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
it about a one or a two millimeter

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.600 
it about a one or a two millimeter
border<00:01:15.390> around<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.140> then<00:01:16.650> we'll<00:01:16.860> take<00:01:17.580> it

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
border around it and then we'll take it

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.270 
border around it and then we'll take it
from<00:01:17.939> here<00:01:18.060> into<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> lab<00:01:19.049> where<00:01:19.799> we<00:01:19.979> do<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
from here into the lab where we do the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.899 
from here into the lab where we do the
frozen<00:01:20.729> section<00:01:21.290> we<00:01:22.290> will<00:01:22.530> create<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.400> frozen

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
frozen section we will create a frozen

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.359 
frozen section we will create a frozen
section<00:01:24.210> by<00:01:25.020> placing<00:01:25.590> them<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.860> what<00:01:26.040> we<00:01:26.159> call

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
section by placing them in what we call

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.179 
section by placing them in what we call
a<00:01:26.400> cryo<00:01:26.820> stat<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.600> then<00:01:27.659> my<00:01:28.020> tech<00:01:28.380> will<00:01:28.950> take

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
a cryo stat and then my tech will take

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.719 
a cryo stat and then my tech will take
very<00:01:29.579> thin<00:01:30.119> thin<00:01:30.900> slices<00:01:31.590> you'll<00:01:31.979> put<00:01:32.280> them<00:01:32.430> on

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
very thin thin slices you'll put them on

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.640 
very thin thin slices you'll put them on
a<00:01:32.759> slide<00:01:33.119> for<00:01:33.630> us<00:01:33.659> we'll<00:01:34.020> put<00:01:34.229> them<00:01:34.350> through<00:01:34.409> a

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
a slide for us we'll put them through a

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.130 
a slide for us we'll put them through a
staining<00:01:35.070> process<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.909> then<00:01:36.630> we<00:01:36.900> will

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
staining process and then we will

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.590 
staining process and then we will
observe<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.310> see<00:01:38.520> whether<00:01:38.700> or<00:01:38.820> not<00:01:39.030> we<00:01:39.299> have

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
observe and see whether or not we have

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.179 
observe and see whether or not we have
gotten<00:01:39.990> all<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.259> skin<00:01:40.500> cancer

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
gotten all the skin cancer

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.420 
gotten all the skin cancer
or<00:01:41.369> we<00:01:42.060> need<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.360> go<00:01:42.479> back<00:01:42.630> for<00:01:42.899> another<00:01:42.990> pass

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
or we need to go back for another pass

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.109 
or we need to go back for another pass
now<00:01:44.430> after<00:01:45.329> we<00:01:45.960> completed<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.890> Mo's<00:01:47.189> she<00:01:47.970> had

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
now after we completed that Mo's she had

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.740 
now after we completed that Mo's she had
a<00:01:48.149> one<00:01:48.420> stage<00:01:48.780> there<00:01:49.200> was<00:01:49.439> no<00:01:50.479> residual<00:01:51.479> tumor

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
a one stage there was no residual tumor

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.350 
a one stage there was no residual tumor
on<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.409> outside<00:01:52.890> border<00:01:53.340> or<00:01:53.520> on<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.939> complete

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
on the outside border or on the complete

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.170 
on the outside border or on the complete
bottom<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.500> what<00:01:55.649> we<00:01:55.829> did<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.310> we<00:01:56.340> undermined

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
bottom so what we did is we undermined

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.230 
bottom so what we did is we undermined
about<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.750> centimeter<00:01:58.469> on<00:01:58.710> each<00:01:58.950> side<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.610> then

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
about a centimeter on each side and then

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.300 
about a centimeter on each side and then
we<00:02:00.390> cut<00:02:00.659> out<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.140> superior<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.189> inferior

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
we cut out the superior and inferior

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.929 
we cut out the superior and inferior
poles<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.420> we<00:02:04.200> put<00:02:04.469> in<00:02:04.649> probably<00:02:05.460> six<00:02:05.490> or

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
poles and we put in probably six or

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.660 
poles and we put in probably six or
seven<00:02:06.299> deep<00:02:06.540> sutures<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.350> in<00:02:08.069> my<00:02:08.190> surgical

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
seven deep sutures and in my surgical
