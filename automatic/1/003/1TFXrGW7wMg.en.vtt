00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.750 
trying to play with this thing like

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.080 
trying to play with this thing like
halfway<00:06:51.020> on<00:06:51.410> there<00:06:51.710> and<00:06:51.919> it's<00:06:52.550> been<00:06:52.700> making<00:06:52.850> me

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.090 
halfway on there and it's been making me

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.170 
halfway on there and it's been making me
drop<00:06:53.540> notes<00:06:53.870> and<00:06:54.290> so<00:06:54.650> I<00:06:54.680> decided<00:06:55.160> to<00:06:55.790> take<00:06:56.000> it

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:56.180

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.710 
drop notes and so I decided to take it
off<00:06:56.560> I<00:06:57.560> don't<00:06:58.190> know<00:06:58.280> how<00:06:58.430> much<00:06:58.610> more<00:06:59.090> damage<00:06:59.360> is

00:06:59.710 --> 00:06:59.720 
off I don't know how much more damage is

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.390 
off I don't know how much more damage is
that's<00:07:00.050> doing<00:07:00.320> to<00:07:01.690> the<00:07:02.690> actual<00:07:03.020> pad<00:07:03.410> itself<00:07:03.800> if

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 
that's doing to the actual pad itself if

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.860 
that's doing to the actual pad itself if
y'all<00:07:04.610> can<00:07:04.790> give<00:07:04.940> me<00:07:05.000> some<00:07:05.150> feedback<00:07:05.330> on<00:07:05.750> that

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:05.870 
y'all can give me some feedback on that

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.719 
y'all can give me some feedback on that
that'd<00:07:06.050> be<00:07:06.169> great<00:07:06.500> because<00:07:06.860> I<00:07:07.070> don't<00:07:07.550> want<00:07:07.669> to

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:07.729 
that'd be great because I don't want to

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:09.490 
that'd be great because I don't want to
damage<00:07:08.150> it<00:07:08.360> any<00:07:08.540> more<00:07:08.660> than<00:07:08.810> it<00:07:08.930> is<00:07:09.080> even

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:09.500
