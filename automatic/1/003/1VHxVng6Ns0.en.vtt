00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
us know that the candy saga texture pack

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.640 
us know that the candy saga texture pack
or<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.220> candy<00:02:17.849> texture<00:02:18.299> pack<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.780> looking

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
or the candy texture pack is looking

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.619 
or the candy texture pack is looking
sweet<00:02:19.860> they<00:02:20.129> might<00:02:20.310> have<00:02:20.489> got<00:02:21.030> rid<00:02:21.360> of<00:02:21.390> the

what the candy texture pack is looking
like<00:02:40.470> i<00:02:40.650> guess<00:02:41.370> it's<00:02:41.610> kind<00:02:41.819> of<00:02:41.879> like<00:02:42.000> their<00:02:42.150> own

like i guess it's kind of like their own

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.229 
like i guess it's kind of like their own
strategy<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:43.079> they<00:02:43.200> didn't<00:02:43.560> introduce<00:02:43.829> it

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239

another<00:03:00.090> texture<00:03:00.390> pack<00:03:00.599> I<00:03:00.750> don't<00:03:00.900> know<00:03:00.989> I<00:03:01.200> know

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
another texture pack I don't know I know

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.410 
another texture pack I don't know I know
be<00:03:01.530> kind<00:03:01.709> of<00:03:01.739> hard<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:02.010> pick<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:03.000> choose<00:03:03.030> which

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
be kind of hard to pick and choose which

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.900 
be kind of hard to pick and choose which
ones<00:03:03.629> are<00:03:03.780> favorite<00:03:04.170> so<00:03:04.349> I<00:03:04.579> guess<00:03:05.579> it's<00:03:05.609> kind
