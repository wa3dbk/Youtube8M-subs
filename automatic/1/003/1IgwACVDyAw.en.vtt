00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.120
 there are numbers to all youtube tourists and 

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:07.700
 here we are in a new video of 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.259
 minecraft this time we are already in 1.8 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.870
 as you will be seeing by the english climate 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:14.719
 1.8 I just left today and they will be 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.970
 playing his rival and such but said in 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.520
 clear now the servers that it passes 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.860
 will lose everything I do not know what but look they have 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.770
 I have that it does not work is that I have and the 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.150
 mushroom that goes is or the cash network that you 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.640
 I'm going to teach it and well you can go 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.520
 playing some cool these first 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.339
 days until I get more than 1.8 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.019
 then to see this one basically you have to 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:37.809
 say having a very varied server does not 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:40.850
 It has many things but it's about mini-games 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.219
 has to project is that it is known by 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.060
 that you are seeing the scarce word 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:53.730
 then it has plate 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:53.730
 first fit has two squares 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.820
 but hey he has four game modes and 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:07.720
 is one of the few servers that is in the 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:09.040
 1.8 then let's play both a 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.870
 starting projectors can be very 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.800
 long I will not go alone so that 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.800
 see what works 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.810
 it was only for you to know that this 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.340

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.880

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.760
 I put myself in no red 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.760
 and well let's play a little 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.940

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.480

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.480

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.860

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:00.320

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.650

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:10.720
 here then 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:12.910
 well this was all werner before 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.190
 I was looking at it that brought the 1.8 nothing of the 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.170
 another world but nothing that is already here and 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.210
 that there are already servers or at least that I 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.220
 know is the server that already works 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.540
 so good to enjoy this 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.660
 new version chiquis account that they have 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.750
 some faults and if you go to my twitter 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.460
 you can see a tweet that I put 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.100
 an image that I was looking for 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.800
 everybody when I upload the ppa and I upload 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.480
 the rendering distance in the google 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.940
 everyone I will not do now 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.530
 I'm recording something but if 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.320
 you go to my twitter you will see the image that 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.430
 is the world where your level collapsed 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:51.100
 be a car exploding as what it is 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.910
 the world with a seed of the world is 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.160
 circling 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.980
 this when ramÃ³n you can see it there and 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.660
 nothing is for everything it is clear point 8 and 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:04.980
 little by little they will be removing more servers 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.980
 I was up to the next half to God
