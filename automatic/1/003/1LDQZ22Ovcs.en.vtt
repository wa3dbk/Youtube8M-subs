00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 good morning girls happy monday then 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.340
 today we talk about a new site like 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.380
 You have read with above products 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.559
 natural for how the site is called 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.550
 I know I know now I'll give myself peace with mine 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.699
 hair is finished touching them and it is a site 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.600
 which is fairly new the girl 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:28.140
 property that we say contacted me 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:30.150
 when i was in france for penultimate 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.620
 transfer and asked me if I had 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.320
 pleasure of choosing two three products 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.940
 from his website to approve them and tell you about them 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.640
 then decided to make a small video 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.410
 because I think the products are there 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.840
 interesting and therefore I came owe 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.579
 show and then these days I already have 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.280
 got to try a couple so vi 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.360
 I give a first impression then we leave 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:59.070
 assuming that my site if you 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:02.190
 involve this thing intrigued me 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.000
 immediately because different brands that 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.310
 are proposed are at least for me 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:18.689
 new or at least the brands I have 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:22.170
 seen less on the sites you hear harry than 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.150
 less seen on the various eco-organic sites then 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.150
 I put you in the infobox all the 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.020
 information about shipments on 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.180
 site www.cm show directly i 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.670
 products in order to deny the 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.060
 situation then of a product that you 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:43.020
 monster and this bio passion start files 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.890
 organic low and we succeed the gel of 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.860
 brand 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.630
 well but I have the fragrance 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.700
 shower gel and I do it first 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.939
 police with lemon handle fragrance 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:59.159
 have still tried but not breathed and 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.560
 I can tell you that it is very very very much 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.180
 good and I feel therefore in equal measure 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.460
 fifty fifty vanilla 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.190
 I also link products with 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.160
 from which we can derive we say the prices 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.070
 in the infobox so this looks like a lot 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.310
 good halfway between the mato crane of the lemon 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.820
 sweet vanilla a mix that I like 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:29.870
 very the second product that I show you 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:32.840
 and I feel a monitor is this cream 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.520
 100 per 100 natural perfume styling 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.350
 zero percent lost 0 percent 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.350
 silicones not tested on animals 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.230
 I tell you right away that this is the result 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.110
 hair with this cream 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.489
 when I put it in my neighbor's also a 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.980
 when by now it will be first time I have 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.110
 too much and I was smeared 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.880
 all here in front so then I have them a bit 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.820
 simply rinse with water 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.730
 so the result is a little longer 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.160
 and I must tell you the truth today 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.530
 Monday I washed my hair Saturday 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.840
 I found the gym without a diffuser 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.580
 the bassano used was not a 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.350
 particularly detangling balm 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.959
 so then I put this cream on a 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.360
 not well combed hair not well 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.790
 untangled in short we say that the base 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.030
 could be a little better then me 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.920
 I reserve the possibility to retry the 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.950
 before reviewing it because now the 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.950
 result is not ugly however to the touch the 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.290
 hair is a little tiled 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.420
 smeared we say I came in 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.519
 the poor mind lies another way 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.220
 tonight I wash so I can 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.049
 try it now and see months that i'm 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.340
 postponing the video on the last ones 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.549
 hair products that I am 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.350
 at this point I try this 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:49.870
 then I'll add it anyway it's called 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:55.280
 that i pur karité crème cofa mente 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:57.290
 naturelles party incriminated goal 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.820
 here it is also of this network 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:05.120
 in the info box the link then third product 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.970
 cool and this foundation melts them 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.720
 all 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:13.740
 to break the fuses many se or tiff 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.910
 the organic of the avril brand is my color 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.000
 and the dr 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:21.299
 and here it is I used the oil 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.640
 picked up this packet on Friday I have it 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.980
 used on Friday and Sunday is 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.500
 very very nice to the effect 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.560
 on the skin type of the baby cream then 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.230
 I will show you a slight uniforming 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.060
 also what is the color of hours I have 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.960
 still a bit of a tan but the 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:43.710
 face now you are not saying already bleached 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.450
 at winter levels but almost by now 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.620
 so I'm not putting the foundation 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:52.920
 but a nice dvb crisis I have already started 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:56.040
 to put it today I have almost made up 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.660
 any brawls anyway and I like this one 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.490
 above all what I know many of 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.030
 you are always looking for products 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.800
 new eco bio and then why what type 8 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.620
 euro therefore not enough 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.330
 there are only 30 milliliters but I don't know 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.950
 you, but I am not that just consumption 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.560
 fast foundation of light ie the 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.090
 end I put a little finger in the area 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.890
 central with the spread with the brush 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:21.630
 so it can easily last you one 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.300
 winter in my opinion is such a foundation 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.250
 and costs subject to the last euro product 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.500
 can only be used once 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.320
 so I do not review it 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.790
 let's say I only see it 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:38.370
 love planet is the albright gel brand 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:40.740
 apply gentili around the l'icaic ai the 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.419
 offense cure in a flash then a gel for 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.700
 the refreshing eye contour I have 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.050
 tried only one morning I do not feel 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.340
 no aloe-based arrangements 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.090
 however this is a piece 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.770
 absolutely honest and i like this one 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.540
 something of the glass bar in Turin maybe not 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:58.620
 it will be the top to pick up the product 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:00.240
 however it is nice to the concept is me 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:04.200
 collapsing the hairstyle now the 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.280
 retrieve a moment and I'll show you 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.620

 with every order you will get one 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:13.800

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.210
