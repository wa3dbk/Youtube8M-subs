processor<00:02:46.220> next<00:02:47.240> NFC<00:02:48.240> I<00:02:48.480> think<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.110> falconers

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
processor next NFC I think the falconers

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.590 
processor next NFC I think the falconers
will<00:02:50.010> beat<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.280> 49ers<00:02:50.490> and<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.330> low-scoring

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
will beat the 49ers and a low-scoring

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.259 
will beat the 49ers and a low-scoring
game<00:02:52.110> 926<00:02:53.450> so<00:02:54.450> they<00:02:54.600> move<00:02:54.780> on<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.200> Broncos

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
game 926 so they move on to the Broncos

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.410 
game 926 so they move on to the Broncos
put<00:02:57.269> it<00:02:57.360> on<00:02:57.480> its<00:02:57.840> Super<00:02:58.200> Bowl<00:02:58.320> time<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:59.670> here

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
put it on its Super Bowl time and here

we go broncos Falcon little closer and i

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.710 
we go broncos Falcon little closer and i
think<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.170> falcons<00:03:07.590> will<00:03:07.709> learn<00:03:07.890> 31<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:09.300> 28

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
think the falcons will learn 31 to 28

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.650 
think the falcons will learn 31 to 28
close<00:03:10.140> game<00:03:10.610> but<00:03:11.610> then<00:03:11.790> I<00:03:11.880> think<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.180> Falcons

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
close game but then I think the Falcons

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.940 
close game but then I think the Falcons
are<00:03:12.900> going<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.290> win<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.590> 2013<00:03:14.239> difficult<00:03:15.950> so

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
are going to win the 2013 difficult so

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.020 
are going to win the 2013 difficult so
um<00:03:17.600> yeah<00:03:18.600> I<00:03:18.930> think<00:03:19.709> it's<00:03:20.070> gonna<00:03:20.190> be<00:03:20.280> close<00:03:20.730> game

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
um yeah I think it's gonna be close game

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:47.170 
um yeah I think it's gonna be close game
but<00:03:21.600> there's<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.380> little<00:03:22.560> bracket

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.990 

so<00:03:47.840> yeah<00:03:48.230> I<00:03:48.590> think<00:03:48.769> the<00:03:49.159> Falcons<00:03:49.579> will<00:03:49.760> win<00:03:49.909> the

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
so yeah I think the Falcons will win the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.369 
so yeah I think the Falcons will win the
super<00:03:50.239> bowl<00:03:50.299> over<00:03:50.719> the<00:03:50.810> Broncos<00:03:51.260> and<00:03:53.109> yeah<00:03:54.109> so

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379
