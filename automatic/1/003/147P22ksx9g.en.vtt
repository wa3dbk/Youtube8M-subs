how to teach you to rope a dummy until
now<00:00:20.000> Guilhem<00:00:20.960> attic<00:00:21.260> systems<00:00:21.710> and<00:00:21.920> I<00:00:22.520> got

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
now Guilhem attic systems and I got

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.490 
now Guilhem attic systems and I got
together<00:00:22.910> and<00:00:23.150> we<00:00:23.300> have<00:00:23.539> got<00:00:23.750> a<00:00:23.779> roping<00:00:24.260> dummy

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
together and we have got a roping dummy

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.380 
together and we have got a roping dummy
now<00:00:24.740> that<00:00:24.920> will<00:00:25.039> teach<00:00:25.250> you<00:00:25.460> to<00:00:25.699> rope<00:00:26.000> the<00:00:26.180> neck

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
now that will teach you to rope the neck

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.960 
now that will teach you to rope the neck
when<00:00:26.930> the<00:00:27.019> cap<00:00:27.230> runs<00:00:27.529> calves<00:00:28.310> run<00:00:28.580> they<00:00:28.730> pull

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
when the cap runs calves run they pull

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.060 
when the cap runs calves run they pull
with<00:00:29.119> our<00:00:29.269> front<00:00:29.510> end<00:00:29.810> so<00:00:30.289> as<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:30.500> calves<00:00:30.740> runs

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
with our front end so as the calves runs

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.439 
with our front end so as the calves runs
that<00:00:31.189> he<00:00:31.310> pulls<00:00:31.609> with<00:00:31.820> his<00:00:31.939> front<00:00:32.210> end<00:00:32.269> his

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:32.449 
that he pulls with his front end his

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.779 
that he pulls with his front end his
neck<00:00:32.659> gets<00:00:32.870> longer<00:00:33.379> at<00:00:33.559> one<00:00:33.949> point<00:00:34.249> when<00:00:34.639> his

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:34.789 
neck gets longer at one point when his

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:37.329 
neck gets longer at one point when his
stride<00:00:35.059> catches<00:00:35.510> up<00:00:35.690> so<00:00:36.139> we<00:00:36.559> made<00:00:36.769> the<00:00:36.889> neck<00:00:37.129> at

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:37.339 
stride catches up so we made the neck at

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:39.729 
stride catches up so we made the neck at
a<00:00:37.399> long<00:00:37.729> stride<00:00:38.179> measurement<00:00:39.109> to<00:00:39.379> where<00:00:39.530> would

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
a long stride measurement to where would

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.680 
a long stride measurement to where would
people<00:00:39.920> rope<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:40.429> neck<00:00:40.609> they<00:00:40.909> actually<00:00:41.479> have

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
people rope the neck they actually have

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.289 
people rope the neck they actually have
a<00:00:41.719> feel<00:00:42.199> for<00:00:42.679> open<00:00:43.039> the<00:00:43.129> calf<00:00:43.339> in<00:00:43.609> a<00:00:43.670> mid<00:00:43.969> stride

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:44.299 
a feel for open the calf in a mid stride

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:46.239 
a feel for open the calf in a mid stride
with<00:00:44.600> his<00:00:44.749> net<00:00:44.959> run<00:00:45.199> out<00:00:45.379> the<00:00:45.769> cleaner<00:00:46.039> you

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:46.249 
with his net run out the cleaner you

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:48.369 
with his net run out the cleaner you
rope<00:00:46.459> them<00:00:46.639> the<00:00:46.850> faster<00:00:47.239> your<00:00:47.329> time<00:00:47.539> is<00:00:47.780> hence

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
rope them the faster your time is hence

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.469 
rope them the faster your time is hence
the<00:00:48.499> longer<00:00:48.829> neck<00:00:49.039> for<00:00:49.549> oppa<00:00:49.760> Bella<00:00:49.969> hey<00:00:50.209> it

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:50.479 
the longer neck for oppa Bella hey it

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:52.779 
the longer neck for oppa Bella hey it
doesn't<00:00:50.839> have<00:00:50.929> a<00:00:50.959> neck<00:00:51.229> we<00:00:52.010> wrote<00:00:52.219> the<00:00:52.369> bucket

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
doesn't have a neck we wrote the bucket

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:54.129 
doesn't have a neck we wrote the bucket
it's<00:00:52.999> sitting<00:00:53.299> on<00:00:53.359> the<00:00:53.420> ground<00:00:53.569> it<00:00:53.780> doesn't

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:54.139 
it's sitting on the ground it doesn't

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:55.899 
it's sitting on the ground it doesn't
have<00:00:54.229> a<00:00:54.260> neck<00:00:54.530> and<00:00:54.859> then<00:00:55.219> we<00:00:55.369> come<00:00:55.549> along<00:00:55.670> with

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:55.909 
have a neck and then we come along with

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:58.389 
have a neck and then we come along with
this<00:00:56.059> hard<00:00:56.329> plastic<00:00:56.409> black<00:00:57.409> dummy<00:00:57.859> get<00:00:58.219> your

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
this hard plastic black dummy get your

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.399 
this hard plastic black dummy get your
rope<00:00:58.549> slides<00:00:58.909> down<00:00:59.269> and<00:00:59.749> it<00:00:59.959> doesn't<00:01:00.289> have<00:01:00.379> a

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
rope slides down and it doesn't have a

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:01.389 
rope slides down and it doesn't have a
neck<00:01:00.649> to<00:01:00.799> stop<00:01:01.069> it

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
neck to stop it

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.129 
neck to stop it
so<00:01:01.639> guess<00:01:01.850> what<00:01:01.969> we<00:01:02.209> don't<00:01:02.329> know<00:01:02.510> we<00:01:02.539> do<00:01:02.959> not

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:03.139 
so guess what we don't know we do not

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:05.259 
so guess what we don't know we do not
know<00:01:03.289> how<00:01:03.409> to<00:01:03.440> open<00:01:03.649> it<00:01:03.949> until<00:01:04.489> now

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
know how to open it until now

know how to open it until now
the<00:01:05.719> next<00:01:06.109> roping<00:01:06.469> system<00:01:06.890> we've<00:01:07.460> come<00:01:07.729> up

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
the next roping system we've come up

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.300 
the next roping system we've come up
with<00:01:08.060> has<00:01:08.359> a<00:01:08.390> long<00:01:08.780> neck<00:01:09.109> it<00:01:09.859> even<00:01:10.130> has<00:01:10.280> a
