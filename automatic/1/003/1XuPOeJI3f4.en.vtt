00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.580
 a night as happy as that of 17 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.250
 January 2009 when it was crowned 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.010

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.670

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.099
 Exterior 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.880
 some eliminator and reposition 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:16.130

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.720
 Brazil 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:37.990
 angry the corner of the South African for 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:41.150
 because the referee antonio zaragoza 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.420
 stopped the fight just when it sounded 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.420
 the bell
