with<00:00:41.730> my<00:00:41.879> clarisonic<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.750> think<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.410> helps<00:00:43.530> to

with my clarisonic I think it helps to
prolong<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.640> usage<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.600> my<00:00:45.809> brush<00:00:46.079> heads<00:00:46.350> and

prolong the usage of my brush heads and

prolong the usage of my brush heads and
it's<00:00:49.079> sensitive<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.129> gentle<00:00:50.340> enough<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.700> use

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
it's sensitive and gentle enough to use

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.799 
it's sensitive and gentle enough to use
around<00:00:51.360> my<00:00:51.539> eye<00:00:51.570> area<00:00:53.000> so<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.270> always<00:00:54.629> switch
