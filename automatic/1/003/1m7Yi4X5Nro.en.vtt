any key you want but I'll play for now
on<00:03:21.569> the<00:03:21.720> twelfth<00:03:22.049> because<00:03:22.260> I<00:03:22.319> don't<00:03:22.440> want<00:03:22.470> to

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
on the twelfth because I don't want to

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:31.309 
on the twelfth because I don't want to
get<00:03:22.709> too<00:03:22.829> much<00:03:22.980> down<00:03:29.450> so<00:03:30.450> what<00:03:30.660> I<00:03:30.690> do<00:03:30.810> there<00:03:31.079> I

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
get too much down so what I do there I

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:38.000 
get too much down so what I do there I
slide<00:03:34.190> it<00:03:35.299> slide<00:03:36.299> from<00:03:36.660> anywhere<00:03:37.500> that's

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
slide it slide from anywhere that's

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:44.349 
slide it slide from anywhere that's
