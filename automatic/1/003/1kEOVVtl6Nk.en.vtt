obviously<00:00:55.969> what<00:00:56.969> else<00:00:57.120> we<00:00:57.300> got<00:00:57.390> we've<00:00:57.570> also

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
obviously what else we got we've also

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.990 
obviously what else we got we've also
got<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.050> weird<00:00:58.260> thing<00:00:58.469> calls<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:59.010> gear<00:00:59.760> mode

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
got this weird thing calls a gear mode

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.799 
got this weird thing calls a gear mode
which<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:00.930> because<00:01:01.500> if<00:01:01.680> we<00:01:01.770> come<00:01:01.949> round<00:01:02.809> there

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
which is because if we come round there

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.960 
which is because if we come round there
is<00:01:03.989> no<00:01:04.199> clutch<00:01:05.299> there<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.720> shifter<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:08.340> you

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
is no clutch there is a shifter so you

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.789 
is no clutch there is a shifter so you
can<00:01:09.119> do<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.510> semi<00:01:09.869> also<00:01:10.260> or<00:01:10.530> fully
