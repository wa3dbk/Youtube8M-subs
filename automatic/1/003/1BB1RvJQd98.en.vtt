00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
we're going to use it to take the slack

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.670 
we're going to use it to take the slack
out<00:02:19.780> of<00:02:19.930> strap<00:02:21.900> don't<00:02:22.900> want<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.200> make<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:23.500> too

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
out of strap don't want to make it too

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.349 
out of strap don't want to make it too
tight<00:02:23.890> just<00:02:24.280> snug<00:02:24.340> enough<00:02:24.700> that<00:02:25.060> there's<00:02:25.239> not

final thing we're going to do is go
ahead<00:02:30.639> and<00:02:30.790> tighten<00:02:31.209> down<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.480> strut<00:02:31.750> itself

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
ahead and tighten down the strut itself

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.580 
ahead and tighten down the strut itself
we'll<00:02:32.590> take<00:02:32.799> our<00:02:32.980> wrench<00:02:33.160> that<00:02:33.760> came<00:02:34.000> with<00:02:34.209> it

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
we'll take our wrench that came with it

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.050 
we'll take our wrench that came with it
on<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.709> Left<00:02:35.950> we<00:02:36.190> have<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.489> adjustment

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
on the Left we have the adjustment

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.789 
on the Left we have the adjustment
mechanism<00:02:37.090> on<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.139> right<00:02:38.319> we<00:02:38.530> have<00:02:38.560> the

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
mechanism on the right we have the

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.400 
mechanism on the right we have the
locking<00:02:39.250> we're<00:02:40.090> going<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.269> take<00:02:40.480> our<00:02:40.750> wrench

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
locking we're going to take our wrench

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.259

place it on the left the adjustment
mechanism<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:44.620> in<00:02:44.739> this<00:02:44.859> case<00:02:45.130> we'll<00:02:45.730> turn<00:02:45.910> it

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
mechanism and in this case we'll turn it

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.050 
mechanism and in this case we'll turn it
down<00:02:46.870> going<00:02:47.769> away<00:02:47.980> this<00:02:48.340> will<00:02:48.489> start<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.790> raise

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
down going away this will start to raise

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.180 
down going away this will start to raise
or<00:02:49.329> extend<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.750> strut<00:02:49.989> a<00:02:50.019> little<00:02:50.290> bit<00:02:50.440> all

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
or extend the strut a little bit all

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.589 
or extend the strut a little bit all
we're<00:02:51.370> trying<00:02:51.489> to<00:02:51.669> do<00:02:51.819> is<00:02:51.970> make<00:02:52.180> sure<00:02:52.209> that<00:02:52.450> the

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
we're trying to do is make sure that the

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.449 
we're trying to do is make sure that the
struts<00:02:52.870> extended<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:53.590> snug<00:02:53.799> so<00:02:54.130> probably

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
struts extended and snug so probably

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.940 
struts extended and snug so probably
won't<00:02:54.669> have<00:02:54.819> to<00:02:54.970> turn<00:02:55.120> it<00:02:55.299> very<00:02:55.510> much<00:02:55.950> once

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
won't have to turn it very much once

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.530 
won't have to turn it very much once
we've<00:02:57.160> done<00:02:57.340> that<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.760> everything<00:02:58.209> is<00:02:58.239> tight

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
we've done that and everything is tight

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.960 
we've done that and everything is tight
and<00:02:58.750> snug<00:02:58.810> on<00:02:59.139> the<00:02:59.260> strut<00:02:59.639> we'll<00:03:00.639> take<00:03:00.849> the

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
and snug on the strut we'll take the

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.819 
and snug on the strut we'll take the
ridge<00:03:01.150> insert<00:03:01.569> it<00:03:01.690> into<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:01.959> right<00:03:02.139> locking

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
ridge insert it into the right locking

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.319 
ridge insert it into the right locking
mechanism<00:03:03.370> goes<00:03:03.549> without<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:03.819> quarter<00:03:04.209> of<00:03:04.269> a

mechanism goes without a quarter of a
turn<00:03:04.560> that<00:03:05.560> will<00:03:05.769> prevent<00:03:06.099> our<00:03:06.340> latch<00:03:06.579> from

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
turn that will prevent our latch from

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.150 
turn that will prevent our latch from
being<00:03:07.299> activated<00:03:07.750> which<00:03:08.410> could<00:03:08.560> accidentally

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
being activated which could accidentally

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.580 
being activated which could accidentally
release<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.060> mechanism<00:03:10.630> once<00:03:11.200> you<00:03:11.290> got<00:03:11.440> the

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
release the mechanism once you got the

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.409 
release the mechanism once you got the
strut<00:03:11.829> place<00:03:12.130> in<00:03:12.340> there<00:03:12.489> have<00:03:12.940> done<00:03:13.209> what<00:03:13.329> you

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:13.419 
strut place in there have done what you

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:14.670 
strut place in there have done what you
need<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.630> do<00:03:13.750> on<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:13.989> vehicle<00:03:14.349> when<00:03:14.470> it<00:03:14.590> go

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
need to do on the vehicle when it go

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.960 
need to do on the vehicle when it go
ahead<00:03:14.739> and<00:03:14.859> remove<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.250> basically<00:03:15.579> you<00:03:15.760> just

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
ahead and remove it basically you just

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.759 
ahead and remove it basically you just
reverse<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.419> process<00:03:16.450> pretty<00:03:17.319> simple<00:03:17.650> and

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
reverse the process pretty simple and

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.379 
reverse the process pretty simple and
easy<00:03:17.889> you're<00:03:18.430> going<00:03:18.549> to<00:03:18.639> take<00:03:18.849> the<00:03:19.030> locking

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
easy you're going to take the locking

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.089 
easy you're going to take the locking
mechanism<00:03:19.930> that<00:03:20.049> you<00:03:20.139> like<00:03:20.349> take<00:03:20.769> your<00:03:20.889> wrench

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.830 
mechanism that you like take your wrench
and<00:03:21.489> go

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
and go

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.619 
and go
release<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.519> you're<00:03:23.519> then<00:03:23.670> gonna<00:03:23.819> take<00:03:23.910> your

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.350 
mechanism here next latch once again in
this<00:03:29.280> case<00:03:29.489> we're<00:03:29.700> going<00:03:29.819> to<00:03:29.879> go<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.180> right

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
this case we're going to go to the right

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.780 
this case we're going to go to the right
to<00:03:30.900> lower<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.319> strut<00:03:31.620> just<00:03:31.890> a<00:03:32.010> little<00:03:32.250> bit<00:03:32.400> to

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
to lower the strut just a little bit to

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.670 
to lower the strut just a little bit to
take<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.090> tension<00:03:33.330> off<00:03:33.599> of<00:03:33.629> it<00:03:33.989> probably

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
take the tension off of it probably

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.380 
take the tension off of it probably
shouldn't<00:03:35.069> take<00:03:35.220> more<00:03:35.550> than<00:03:35.610> maybe<00:03:35.819> one<00:03:36.120> turn

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
shouldn't take more than maybe one turn

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.479 
shouldn't take more than maybe one turn
and<00:03:36.840> see<00:03:37.019> the<00:03:37.140> struts<00:03:37.410> drop<00:03:37.709> back<00:03:37.950> down<00:03:38.190> so

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
and see the struts drop back down so

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.670 
and see the struts drop back down so
we're<00:03:38.640> good<00:03:38.819> at<00:03:39.720> that<00:03:39.930> point<00:03:40.230> then<00:03:40.470> we<00:03:40.650> can

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
we're good at that point then we can

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.460 
we're good at that point then we can
basically<00:03:41.209> take<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.420> strut<00:03:42.690> and<00:03:42.900> activate

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
basically take the strut and activate

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.350 
basically take the strut and activate
the<00:03:43.590> releasing<00:03:44.040> mechanism<00:03:44.190> go<00:03:45.030> ahead<00:03:45.239> and

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
the releasing mechanism go ahead and

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.680 
the releasing mechanism go ahead and
lower<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.629> strut<00:03:45.930> back<00:03:46.170> down<00:03:47.299> at<00:03:48.299> that<00:03:48.420> point

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
lower the strut back down at that point

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.300 
lower the strut back down at that point
you<00:03:48.870> can<00:03:48.989> simply<00:03:49.260> pick<00:03:49.410> it<00:03:49.470> up<00:03:49.650> walk<00:03:49.920> away<00:03:50.129> from

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
you can simply pick it up walk away from

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.789 
you can simply pick it up walk away from
the<00:03:50.430> vehicle<00:03:50.879> once<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:51.780> get<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:52.080> that<00:03:52.230> away

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
the vehicle once you get to that away

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.069 
the vehicle once you get to that away
from<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.099> vehicle<00:03:53.459> to<00:03:53.489> safe<00:03:53.760> area<00:03:54.180> simply

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
from the vehicle to safe area simply

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.190 
from the vehicle to safe area simply
would<00:03:55.230> take<00:03:55.440> your<00:03:56.250> crank<00:03:56.549> here<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:57.079> take<00:03:58.079> the

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
would take your crank here and take the

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.440 
would take your crank here and take the
strap<00:03:58.470> tight<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.160> back<00:03:59.340> up<00:03:59.519> in<00:03:59.640> the<00:03:59.700> place<00:03:59.940> you

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
strap tight the back up in the place you

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.080 
strap tight the back up in the place you
need<00:04:00.630> to<00:04:00.840> release<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:01.260> take<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:02.010> latch<00:04:02.160> all

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
need to release it take the latch all

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.050 
need to release it take the latch all
the<00:04:03.299> way<00:04:03.390> down<00:04:03.660> push<00:04:04.349> this<00:04:04.950> allow<00:04:05.280> you<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.640> free

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
the way down push this allow you to free

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.660 
the way down push this allow you to free
it<00:04:06.239> up<00:04:06.390> pull<00:04:07.379> it<00:04:07.410> slack<00:04:07.739> on<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:08.040> strap<00:04:08.310> and

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
it up pull it slack on the strap and

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.400 
it up pull it slack on the strap and
then<00:04:08.819> simply<00:04:09.150> take<00:04:09.360> the<00:04:09.480> crank<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:10.019> roll<00:04:10.290> it

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
then simply take the crank and roll it

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.890 
then simply take the crank and roll it
back<00:04:10.440> those<00:04:14.060> struts<00:04:15.060> ready<00:04:15.329> to<00:04:15.420> go<00:04:15.510> back<00:04:15.720> in

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
back those struts ready to go back in

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.560 
back those struts ready to go back in
the<00:04:15.959> bag<00:04:16.139> we're<00:04:16.410> done
