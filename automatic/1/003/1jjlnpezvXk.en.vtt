gold sword example and on the back side

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.619 
gold sword example and on the back side
we<00:01:00.960> will<00:01:01.230> see<00:01:01.500> empty<00:01:02.070> glass<00:01:02.340> bowls<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.030> arrows

so<00:01:04.199> that's<00:01:04.379> pretty<00:01:04.619> cool<00:01:04.820> now<00:01:05.840> this<00:01:06.840> turbo

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
so that's pretty cool now this turbo

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.590 
so that's pretty cool now this turbo
does<00:01:07.860> actually<00:01:08.159> go<00:01:08.610> invisible<00:01:08.880> if<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.450> use

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
does actually go invisible if you use

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.050 
does actually go invisible if you use
the<00:01:09.630> potion<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.220> invisibility<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.939> can

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
the potion of invisibility so you can

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.700 
the potion of invisibility so you can
still<00:01:12.240> might<00:01:13.020> hide<00:01:13.619> yourself<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:15.380> this<00:01:16.380> mod

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
still might hide yourself and this mod

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.370 
still might hide yourself and this mod
mod<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.280> always<00:01:17.729> purely<00:01:18.570> aesthetic<00:01:18.689> as<00:01:19.229> well

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
mod is always purely aesthetic as well

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.690 
mod is always purely aesthetic as well
it<00:01:19.560> doesn't<00:01:19.830> actually<00:01:19.979> have<00:01:20.280> any<00:01:20.310> proper

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
it doesn't actually have any proper

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.740 
it doesn't actually have any proper
purpose<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.210> don't<00:01:21.390> give<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.659> extra

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
purpose you don't give that extra

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.200 
purpose you don't give that extra
storage<00:01:22.380> or<00:01:22.619> anything<00:01:22.950> but<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:24.000> still

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
storage or anything but it's still

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.660 
storage or anything but it's still
pretty<00:01:24.540> cool-looking<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.409> like<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.920> now<00:01:26.490> there

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
pretty cool-looking I like it now there

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.690 
pretty cool-looking I like it now there
is<00:01:26.850> actually<00:01:27.299> other's<00:01:27.740> styles<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.920> tall<00:01:29.369> belts

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
is actually other's styles of tall belts

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.969 
is actually other's styles of tall belts
so<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.630> default<00:01:31.079> key<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.470> change<00:01:31.740> these

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
so the default key to change these

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.700 
so the default key to change these
styles<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.150> right<00:01:33.390> control<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.650> your

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
styles is the right control on your

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.580 
styles is the right control on your
keyboard<00:01:35.040> at<00:01:35.790> +<00:01:36.329> e<00:01:36.509> ad<00:01:36.659> symbol<00:01:37.140> which<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
keyboard at + e ad symbol which is the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.520 
keyboard at + e ad symbol which is the
plus<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.759> if<00:01:39.150> we<00:01:39.299> do<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.479> we<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:40.079> switch<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
plus so if we do that we can switch the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.550 
plus so if we do that we can switch the
Rambo<00:01:40.950> belt<00:01:41.220> which<00:01:41.430> looks<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:42.560> switch

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
Rambo belt which looks like this switch

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.340 
Rambo belt which looks like this switch
again<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.340> assassins<00:01:44.939> belt<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.509> don't<00:01:46.200> leave

again the assassins belt I don't leave
the<00:01:46.439> torch<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.890> potion<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.399> let's<00:01:47.670> have<00:01:47.790> a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
the torch and the potion is let's have a

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.510 
the torch and the potion is let's have a
look<00:01:48.500> we<00:01:49.500> actually<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> bow<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.100> our<00:01:50.340> back

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
look we actually have a bow in our back

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.230

now yeah torsion potion disappears ok

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.499 
now yeah torsion potion disappears ok
let's<00:01:55.020> try<00:01:55.290> again<00:01:55.880> we<00:01:56.880> have<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.030> simple

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
let's try again we have the simple

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.080
