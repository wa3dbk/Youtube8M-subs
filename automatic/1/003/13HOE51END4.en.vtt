00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello my friends all day a good evening group in the afternoon the staff 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.959
 back when you're watching is sensitive 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:11.200
 it only increases 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.549
 It's a great pleasure for me to see my husband as a 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.980
 accompanied by six months was the journey without sequel we can speak 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.919
 most of the rj 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:28.400
 It's just a little bit of the mobile gates I was preparing for you. 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:33.309
 try to actually get some things from my own experience is 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.220
 my coexistence with him 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.770
 life experiences 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.850
 I think it matters to be sharing with you. 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.880
 so you will see some examples 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.989
 after returning from the 70's TV I remember if they decide to live 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.359
 but images of these movies images that I have here that are a manufacture that 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:55.090
 wants to irritate me by insulting me 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.790
 today I can change changes and improvements in the lives of 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.160
 people 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.280
 have some examples there will also be any nature 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.980
 it's not a terrible accident that happened in the 80's 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.730
 I remember well as a teenager how I felt African led by the government with 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.650
 accident and the death of seven people who prove as the cause of the accident with the 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.330
 buses columbia 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.310
 has also placed with the children the artistic life of its own axis 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.600
 who has ukraine tied for my daughter at college time 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.230
 we have some agile methodologies to try to share a little of that 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.009
 that I am 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.580
 the rejection of corruption violence 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.760
 the injury that we take advantage of to the maximum without no sensitivity 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.640
 return to draw your attention to being very careful with the 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.520
 our 30 days these are not materials that you will perform in the Olympian in the 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.340
 computer alone at one or two o'clock at night when you talk 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.730
 eventually sit down to work in the maternity ward 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:07.300
 I strongly recommend that you cook and from now on, each of the activities you 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.709
 going of the normal movement he came 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.560
 if you will see during the week thinking about new activity besides the new 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.149
 activity carried youth to business friends activities 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:24.959
 you will see that at the time just sitting down and doing written part of letting 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.429
 this logged 

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:28.379
 but I did it 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:34.269
 but this will require a few hours in great human moments planning and 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.659
 thinking about how you are going to conduct the exercise 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.370
 so it has not been part 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.949
 she leaves you there is such a reason this money all our part 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:49.879
 do not go to tractor knocking down poles at midnight this morning we folks 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.889
 invented the exercises 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:56.399
 but it is for you really have an opportunity to feel on the skin even 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:03:00.869
 who principles and concepts of manufacture everywhere is easily 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:01.719
 to change 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:05.930
 deny that they can be applied at all times than in all their 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.989
 day to day activities 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.019
