us<00:01:27.500> some<00:01:27.740> mixed<00:01:28.250> reaction<00:01:28.760> and<00:01:28.940> of<00:01:29.630> course<00:01:29.930> we

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
us some mixed reaction and of course we

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.720 
us some mixed reaction and of course we
can<00:01:30.320> expect<00:01:30.710> that<00:01:30.890> when<00:01:31.070> you<00:01:31.160> say<00:01:31.400> that<00:01:31.610> the

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
can expect that when you say that the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.400 
can expect that when you say that the
bike<00:01:31.940> is<00:01:32.120> a<00:01:32.150> little<00:01:32.390> bit<00:01:32.690> similar<00:01:33.050> to<00:01:33.320> its

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
bike is a little bit similar to its

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.210 
bike is a little bit similar to its
predecessor<00:01:34.270> well<00:01:35.270> I<00:01:35.300> still<00:01:35.690> think<00:01:35.750> it<00:01:36.140> is<00:01:36.230> but

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
predecessor well I still think it is but

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.980 
predecessor well I still think it is but
on<00:01:37.340> to<00:01:37.550> the<00:01:37.640> c6<00:01:38.150> on<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.390> spot

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
on to the c6 on the spot

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.020 
on to the c6 on the spot
well<00:01:39.530> I<00:01:39.560> guess<00:01:39.830> my<00:01:40.070> opinion<00:01:40.340> will<00:01:40.670> be<00:01:40.700> a<00:01:40.820> little

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
well I guess my opinion will be a little

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.490 
well I guess my opinion will be a little
bit<00:01:41.270> different<00:01:41.570> this<00:01:41.870> time<00:01:41.930> around

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
bit different this time around

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.310 
bit different this time around
why<00:01:43.130> because<00:01:44.060> I'm<00:01:44.180> not<00:01:44.300> really<00:01:44.570> a<00:01:44.600> huge<00:01:44.990> fan<00:01:45.050> of

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
why because I'm not really a huge fan of

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.650 
why because I'm not really a huge fan of
a<00:01:45.530> scooter<00:01:45.770> motorcycle<00:01:46.490> let<00:01:47.210> alone<00:01:47.450> the

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
a scooter motorcycle let alone the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.140 
a scooter motorcycle let alone the
bigger<00:01:47.930> capacity<00:01:48.140> of<00:01:48.650> it<00:01:48.830> so<00:01:49.700> then<00:01:49.880> you<00:01:50.030> would

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
bigger capacity of it so then you would

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.000 
bigger capacity of it so then you would
expect<00:01:50.510> that<00:01:50.570> I<00:01:50.690> will<00:01:50.870> be<00:01:50.990> giving<00:01:51.320> a<00:01:51.440> dull<00:01:51.770> and

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
expect that I will be giving a dull and

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.060 
expect that I will be giving a dull and
negative<00:01:52.460> opinion<00:01:53.090> on<00:01:53.210> it<00:01:53.620> well<00:01:54.620> if<00:01:54.740> you<00:01:54.860> think

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
negative opinion on it well if you think

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.940 
negative opinion on it well if you think
that<00:01:55.310> then<00:01:56.000> you'll<00:01:56.240> be<00:01:56.450> wrong<00:01:56.690> similar<00:01:57.680> to<00:01:57.800> how

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
that then you'll be wrong similar to how

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.580 
that then you'll be wrong similar to how
wrong<00:01:58.250> I<00:01:58.430> am<00:01:58.580> about<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:59.060> bike<00:01:59.300> before<00:01:59.810> I<00:02:00.230> even

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
wrong I am about the bike before I even

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
get a chance to ride it and when I do

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.430

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
one gear the entire time but a great

great agility for the bike in turns yeah
you<00:03:12.600> need<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:12.960> use<00:03:13.140> your<00:03:13.350> brake<00:03:13.650> more<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:14.100> slow

you need to use your brake more to slow
it<00:03:14.460> down<00:03:14.490> but<00:03:15.390> with<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.630> smoothness<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.380> new

models and how well it will
gives<00:03:19.930> you<00:03:20.110> a<00:03:20.140> sense<00:03:20.260> of<00:03:20.740> stability<00:03:21.010> in

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
gives you a sense of stability in

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.930 
gives you a sense of stability in
mid-corner<00:03:22.510> well<00:03:23.260> maybe<00:03:23.920> I'm<00:03:24.190> exaggerating<00:03:24.370> a

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
mid-corner well maybe I'm exaggerating a

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:25.770 
mid-corner well maybe I'm exaggerating a
bit

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
bit

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.200 
bit
when<00:03:26.350> you<00:03:26.470> write<00:03:26.680> it<00:03:26.860> you<00:03:27.310> can<00:03:27.550> feel<00:03:27.880> that<00:03:27.910> it

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
when you write it you can feel that it

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.910 
when you write it you can feel that it
holds<00:03:28.570> the<00:03:28.690> line<00:03:28.840> pretty<00:03:29.110> well<00:03:29.380> for<00:03:29.650> a<00:03:29.710> big

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
holds the line pretty well for a big

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.310 
holds the line pretty well for a big
scooter<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:30.640> that<00:03:31.300> is<00:03:31.450> confident<00:03:31.960> inspiring

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
scooter and that is confident inspiring

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:45.660 
scooter and that is confident inspiring
and<00:03:32.770> I<00:03:33.310> like<00:03:33.520> that<00:03:44.160> understandably<00:03:45.160> this

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
and I like that understandably this

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.400 
and I like that understandably this
might<00:03:46.060> be<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.270> shortest<00:03:46.480> review<00:03:46.959> film<00:03:47.170> that

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
might be the shortest review film that

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.680 
might be the shortest review film that
we<00:03:47.530> have<00:03:47.680> done<00:03:47.920> this<00:03:48.160> year<00:03:48.459> but<00:03:49.240> I<00:03:49.300> think<00:03:49.330> that

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
we have done this year but I think that

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.290 
we have done this year but I think that
is<00:03:49.780> not<00:03:49.930> bad<00:03:50.230> it's<00:03:51.190> not<00:03:51.370> like<00:03:51.520> the<00:03:51.850> longer<00:03:52.209> the

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
is not bad it's not like the longer the

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.600 
is not bad it's not like the longer the
film<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.690> better<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.140> bite<00:03:53.320> will<00:03:53.530> be<00:03:53.740> it<00:03:54.459> just

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
film the better the bite will be it just

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.150 
film the better the bite will be it just
never<00:03:54.820> works<00:03:55.180> that<00:03:55.450> way<00:03:55.630> I'm<00:03:56.040> confident<00:03:57.040> to

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
never works that way I'm confident to

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.400 
never works that way I'm confident to
say<00:03:57.370> that<00:03:57.610> the<00:03:57.730> CSIs<00:03:58.209> under<00:03:58.510> sport<00:03:58.870> might<00:03:59.200> be
