00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.979
 for me 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.160
 the lesson 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.090
 in this week's video to recycle 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.610
 clothes let's learn to put pockets 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.610
 to a pity that does not have them 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.610
 evidently 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.660
 here we have the pocket pattern this 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.019
 It's a standard pocket pattern 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.919
 universal to say it somehow 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:35.120
 we will need for every pocket that 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:38.180
 We want to put two parts and we would go to 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.550
 the fabric folded and we passed the pattern by 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.290
 above and two parts per pocket in this 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.500
 case we are going to put some 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.750
 pockets to a somewhat longer shirt of 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.970
 we normally need four times this 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.400
 pattern this pattern I'll leave it in the 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.170
 blog so you can download and it's 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.840
 very important that when you go to 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.539
 pass it to the fabric these two pickets the 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.460
 let's mark a little with one with one 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.559
 scissors with scissors or a chalk 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.239
 mark because this is going to be what 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.930
 delimit the part where we are going to 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.490
 put your hand in your pocket 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.190
 then the first step would be 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.740
 download the blog pattern and move on to 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.900
 the fabric to have four parts 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.170
 we already have them cut here 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.250
 two would be for one pocket and two others 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.250
 would be for another pocket 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.450
 so when we have them all 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.450
 we started 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:38.420
 well we have cut the four 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.159
 parts that will form pockets 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.010
 so now what we have to do 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.780
 is to sew the shirt 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:49.100
 is the shirt that we are going to put 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.660
 the pockets and we're going to unstitch the 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.340
 shirt previously we have to have 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.900
 seen who we want to measure 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.560
 start in your pockets we mark it with 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.330
 a pin and we take advantage of the sewing that 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.690
 has on the side the shirt for 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.240
 to uncork the we help ourselves from a disc 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.310
 saylor and we do not know and we have to 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.080
 not knowing the distance between 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.080
 the two pickets of the pattern a tad more 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.870
 that is if we have 13 centimeters as one 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.470
 more for every dzeko site we would be 15 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.040
 centimeters from the mark that 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.780
 we have done on the shirt then 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.990
 let's sew the shirt for the 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.990
 lateral 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.050
 we have already ripped the sides of the 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.100
 shirt both on one side 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.100
 as for the other 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.450
 and now let's start putting the 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.450
 pockets 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.340
 we take one of the cloth parts and 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.650
 we have to place the 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.010
 curve that more pronounced the more 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.980
 wide down pocket that is 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.340
 yes the shirt 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.460
 it's like that 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.140
 then the widest part of the pocket 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.160
 down 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.440
 all right 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.030
 as we said we already have deposits 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.569
 the lateral 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.100
 and now we have in this case the fabric that 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.560
 we have chosen to put the pockets 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.580
 he has no right or setback if he had 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.440
 right and reverse 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.709
 we would have to face the right of the 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.610
 fabric with the right shirt and now 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.610
 is when we have to 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.710
 take into account the pickets that 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:40.540
 we had said at the beginning of the video 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.540
 we take well the edge of the cloth 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.350
 and we align the edge of the fabric of the 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.820
 shirt 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.820
 with green pocket 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.769
 in this way 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.090
 we hold ourselves with some pins 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.799
 we can win it if we like more 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.890
 A) Yes 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.630
 and we have to go to the sewing machine and 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.680
 sew the space that remains between 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.680
 pickets 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.090
 that is to say here we have the first picket 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.669
 this is a marker preserves the water 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.830
 here we have the second picket and 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.080
 we would spend a rest stitching finishing 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.479
 at the beginning and at the end in space 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.729
 which is between the two pickets this 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.680
 same step we will have to repeat it with 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.520
 the back of the pocket of the 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.280
 same way 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.979
 we face the widest part of pocket 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.780
 towards the bottom of the shirt 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.780
 right with right aligned 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.580
 and we hold with pins and sew 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.140
 the space between the two pickets 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.110
 this we have to do it four times 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:06.490
 the two parts of each pocket so 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.490
 let's sew the pockets 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.370
 all right 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:20.120
 we have already taken the two parties to 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.460
 external parts and the fabric of the shirt 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.290
 Now let's continue once already 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.930
 we have put them we have sewn the 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.620
 distance between the two pickets 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:33.970
 we put them in the shirt 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.970
 as if we were to pocket the pocket 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:45.830
 then now we would have the pocket in 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.830
 the inside of the shirt 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.620
 and what we have to do is square what 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:51.620
 all right 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.840
 we hold everything with pins 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.840
 all the contour 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.750
 So this way it is right above 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.750
 of the other 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.199
 and one last one here 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.380
 and now we are going to sew the other part that 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.510
 we would have left to close the 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.680
 pocket is to say if before we have sewn 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.980
 the distance between the two 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.040
 pickets now 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:25.650
 let's start in piquete we finish 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.710
 we got here here we turn and we go 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:30.540
 taking all the contour of the pocket 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.920
 when we get here we turn again and 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.820
 when they are finished we arrive at the picket 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.280
 we go back to finish 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.290
 that is to say 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.660
 in the first step this feels the pattern 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.850
 we have sewn the outer parts 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.370
 facing the front of the pocket to 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.900
 the front of the shirt these parts the 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:49.350
 little piece between the two pickets 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:51.300
 now we pocketed the pocket of such 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.400
 how they fit if the fabric had 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.470
 right and reverse that are both 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.950
 right sides of the facing fabric and 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:00.600
 we would know the rest of the pocket for 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.980
 leave them closed that is from the 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:06.050
 picket here all the outline 

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.520
 and what we have to do now in the 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.850
 two pockets once we have it 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:13.580
 stitched we rowed all and cleaned a little 

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:17.620
 the seams and we would practically have 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.620
 finished the pockets we go to it 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:25.300
 we already have the shirt with the 

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:27.860
 pockets and stays in the inside 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:30.440
 we have finished everything so that the fabric does not 

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:35.200
 if we were fighting, we would have to cut 

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.200
 threads that we have left and nothing 

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:42.409
 here they are like this on the outside 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.249
 so much 1 

00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:48.109
 like the other 

00:07:44.249 --> 00:07:48.109
 you see that the hand fits perfectly 

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.540
 Well, I do not encourage you to put your taste 

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:55.080
 to the pockets that you put into practice 

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:58.770
 this tutorial and see you in the next 

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.770
 video until next time
