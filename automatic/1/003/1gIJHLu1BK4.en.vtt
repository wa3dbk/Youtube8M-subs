almost<00:01:58.020> easier<00:01:58.560> because<00:01:58.680> you're<00:01:58.829> not<00:01:58.979> worried

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
almost easier because you're not worried

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.109 
almost easier because you're not worried
about<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.610> whole<00:01:59.820> thing

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
about that whole thing

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.429 
about that whole thing
what<00:02:00.600> I'm<00:02:00.719> going<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.930> do<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.170> I'm<00:02:01.229> just<00:02:01.259> going

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
what I'm going to do is I'm just going

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.230 
what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to<00:02:01.560> place<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.950> across<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.520> heat<00:02:02.729> wrap<00:02:02.939> here

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
to place it across the heat wrap here

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.300 
to place it across the heat wrap here
make<00:02:03.869> sure<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.049> sanitize<00:02:04.560> before<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.040> toss<00:02:05.280> it

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
make sure to sanitize before I toss it

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.449 
make sure to sanitize before I toss it
back<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:05.990> should<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.079> be<00:02:07.110> all<00:02:07.350> good

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
back in should it be all good

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.880 
back in should it be all good
so<00:02:10.030> I'm<00:02:10.090> just<00:02:10.149> gonna<00:02:10.299> pull<00:02:10.599> up<00:02:12.299> disgusting

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
so I'm just gonna pull up disgusting

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.030 
so I'm just gonna pull up disgusting

going to do D penetrate the car boy come
up<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.700> nice<00:02:31.510> little<00:02:31.540> sample<00:02:32.459> see<00:02:33.459> how<00:02:33.579> much<00:02:33.730> we

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
up a nice little sample see how much we

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:39.000 
up a nice little sample see how much we
get<00:02:34.090> here<00:02:37.139> so<00:02:38.139> now<00:02:38.290> it's<00:02:38.469> probably<00:02:38.650> not<00:02:38.920> quite

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
get here so now it's probably not quite

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.709 
get here so now it's probably not quite
enough<00:02:39.730> for<00:02:39.939> a<00:02:40.000> reading<00:02:40.329> so<00:02:40.450> I'm<00:02:40.510> just<00:02:40.629> gonna

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:40.719 
enough for a reading so I'm just gonna

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:43.199 
enough for a reading so I'm just gonna
try<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:40.989> drop<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.290> little<00:02:41.560> bit<00:02:41.709> more<00:02:42.069> which<00:02:42.849> also

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
try to drop a little bit more which also

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:43.979 
try to drop a little bit more which also
mean<00:02:43.329> that<00:02:43.359> there's<00:02:43.599> more<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.780> taste

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
mean that there's more to taste

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.289 
mean that there's more to taste
afterwards<00:02:44.590> which<00:02:44.799> is<00:02:44.950> really<00:02:45.909> what<00:02:46.030> it's<00:02:46.209> all

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
afterwards which is really what it's all

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:53.429 
afterwards which is really what it's all
about<00:02:46.359> so<00:02:51.540> now<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:52.750> want<00:02:52.959> to<00:02:52.989> drawing<00:02:53.260> off

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:53.439 
about so now I want to drawing off

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.199 
about so now I want to drawing off
probably<00:02:53.799> a<00:02:54.129> little<00:02:54.430> bit<00:02:54.609> more<00:02:54.639> than<00:02:54.939> I<00:02:55.030> need

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
probably a little bit more than I need

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.360 
probably a little bit more than I need
this<00:02:55.419> will<00:02:55.569> probably<00:02:55.780> overflow<00:02:56.620> and

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
this will probably overflow and

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.740 
this will probably overflow and
hydrometer<00:02:57.669> too<00:02:57.939> but<00:02:58.090> I<00:02:58.150> can<00:02:58.299> deal<00:02:58.450> with<00:02:58.599> that

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
hydrometer too but I can deal with that

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.500 
hydrometer too but I can deal with that
in<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.900> moment<00:02:59.669> set<00:03:00.669> my<00:03:00.819> seat<00:03:01.060> down<00:03:01.239> get<00:03:01.480> that

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
in a moment set my seat down get that

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.580 
in a moment set my seat down get that
out<00:03:01.780> of<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:01.959> way<00:03:02.250> now<00:03:03.250> of<00:03:03.519> course<00:03:03.700> of<00:03:04.590> the

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
out of the way now of course of the

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.459 
out of the way now of course of the
utmost<00:03:05.680> importance<00:03:06.280> here<00:03:06.400> is<00:03:06.489> maintaining<00:03:07.120> a

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:07.469 
utmost importance here is maintaining a

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:11.610 
utmost importance here is maintaining a
sanitary<00:03:08.469> situation<00:03:09.239> so<00:03:10.239> got<00:03:11.079> that<00:03:11.260> sprayed

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
sanitary situation so got that sprayed

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.469 
sanitary situation so got that sprayed
down<00:03:11.799> again<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:12.909> should<00:03:13.090> be<00:03:13.120> pretty<00:03:13.329> good

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:13.479 
down again it should be pretty good

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:15.479 
down again it should be pretty good
everything<00:03:13.930> was<00:03:13.959> clean<00:03:14.260> here<00:03:14.440> before<00:03:14.799> we're

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
everything was clean here before we're

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.110 
everything was clean here before we're
just<00:03:15.699> going<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:17.250> toss<00:03:18.250> that<00:03:18.430> back<00:03:18.669> in<00:03:18.879> there

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
just going to toss that back in there

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.270 
just going to toss that back in there
now<00:03:19.900> I've<00:03:20.530> got<00:03:20.949> a<00:03:20.979> hydrometer<00:03:21.629> sample<00:03:22.629> here

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
now I've got a hydrometer sample here

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.039 
now I've got a hydrometer sample here
but<00:03:24.280> this<00:03:24.430> was<00:03:24.579> sitting<00:03:24.699> at<00:03:24.879> 70<00:03:25.239> Fahrenheit<00:03:25.720> my

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
but this was sitting at 70 Fahrenheit my

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.319 
but this was sitting at 70 Fahrenheit my
hydrometers<00:03:26.620> actually<00:03:27.069> calibrated<00:03:27.639> for<00:03:27.760> 60<00:03:28.180> I

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
hydrometers actually calibrated for 60 I

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.059 
hydrometers actually calibrated for 60 I
could<00:03:28.840> just<00:03:29.019> throw<00:03:29.139> the<00:03:29.229> hydrometer<00:03:29.769> in<00:03:29.889> here

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
could just throw the hydrometer in here

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.819 
could just throw the hydrometer in here
and<00:03:30.449> do<00:03:31.449> the<00:03:31.569> little<00:03:31.689> adjustment<00:03:32.229> calculation

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
and do the little adjustment calculation

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.559 
and do the little adjustment calculation
but<00:03:33.189> honestly<00:03:33.549> I<00:03:33.609> like<00:03:33.849> to<00:03:33.970> get<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.239> exact

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
but honestly I like to get the exact

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.000 
but honestly I like to get the exact
temperature<00:03:35.109> and<00:03:35.319> then<00:03:35.439> you're<00:03:35.590> not<00:03:35.650> messing

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
temperature and then you're not messing

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
temperature and then you're not messing
around<00:03:36.040> with<00:03:36.280> that<00:03:36.340> you're<00:03:36.669> not<00:03:36.760> worried

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
around with that you're not worried

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.899 
around with that you're not worried
about<00:03:37.090> any<00:03:37.269> sort<00:03:37.629> of<00:03:38.639> discrepancies<00:03:39.639> at<00:03:39.790> all

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:39.909 
about any sort of discrepancies at all

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:41.099 
about any sort of discrepancies at all
you<00:03:40.030> just<00:03:40.090> know<00:03:40.359> you're<00:03:40.629> using<00:03:40.989> the

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
you just know you're using the

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.360 
you just know you're using the
hydrometer<00:03:41.560> at<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.709> temperature<00:03:42.129> that<00:03:42.159> it's

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
hydrometer at the temperature that it's

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.610 
hydrometer at the temperature that it's
intended<00:03:42.609> for<00:03:42.790> so<00:03:43.449> I<00:03:43.750> usually<00:03:44.139> just<00:03:44.319> like<00:03:44.530> to

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
intended for so I usually just like to

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.800 
intended for so I usually just like to
go<00:03:44.709> and<00:03:44.859> toss<00:03:45.040> that<00:03:45.069> in<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.489> freezer<00:03:45.759> for<00:03:46.120> a

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
go and toss that in the freezer for a

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.740 
go and toss that in the freezer for a
couple<00:03:46.870> of<00:03:47.199> minutes<00:03:47.470> it<00:03:47.680> drops<00:03:48.040> right<00:03:48.189> down

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
couple of minutes it drops right down

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.879 
couple of minutes it drops right down
use<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.870> probe<00:03:50.079> thermometer<00:03:50.259> and<00:03:50.650> make<00:03:50.739> sure

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
use the probe thermometer and make sure

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:51.979 
use the probe thermometer and make sure
it's<00:03:51.040> all<00:03:51.159> good

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
it's all good

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.139 
it's all good
