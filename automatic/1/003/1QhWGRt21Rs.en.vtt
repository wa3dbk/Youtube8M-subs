00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:10.189 
understand so let's take a look at the

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:14.649 
understand so let's take a look at the
solution<00:04:10.639> of<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:10.849> a<00:04:10.879> Christina<00:04:13.060> all<00:04:14.060> right<00:04:14.239> so

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:14.659 
solution of the a Christina all right so

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.199 
solution of the a Christina all right so
I'm<00:04:14.689> a<00:04:15.230> buyer<00:04:15.469> for<00:04:15.500> a<00:04:15.950> fast<00:04:16.220> fashion<00:04:16.519> merchant

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
I'm a buyer for a fast fashion merchant

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.890 
I'm a buyer for a fast fashion merchant
and<00:04:17.419> every<00:04:18.259> day<00:04:18.380> I<00:04:18.410> log<00:04:18.799> into<00:04:19.160> my<00:04:19.459> workspace

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
and every day I log into my workspace

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.659 
and every day I log into my workspace
what<00:04:20.900> resonates<00:04:21.380> with<00:04:21.560> me<00:04:21.590> about<00:04:21.829> this<00:04:22.220> that<00:04:22.639> I

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
what resonates with me about this that I

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.610 
what resonates with me about this that I
have<00:04:22.849> a<00:04:22.880> lot<00:04:23.090> of<00:04:23.120> complex<00:04:23.630> things<00:04:23.960> going<00:04:24.289> on<00:04:24.410> my

business but it's presented to me in a
way<00:04:26.810> it<00:04:26.960> is<00:04:26.990> very<00:04:27.259> visual<00:04:27.740> and<00:04:27.770> easy<00:04:28.160> to

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
way it is very visual and easy to

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.370 
way it is very visual and easy to
understand<00:04:28.820> I<00:04:29.150> can<00:04:29.660> stand<00:04:29.870> to<00:04:30.080> wear<00:04:30.229> my

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
understand I can stand to wear my

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.040 
understand I can stand to wear my
performances<00:04:31.130> on<00:04:31.520> all<00:04:31.909> my<00:04:32.090> items<00:04:32.270> and<00:04:32.780> I<00:04:32.870> can

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
performances on all my items and I can

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.230 
performances on all my items and I can
see<00:04:33.229> we<00:04:33.349> writing<00:04:33.620> to<00:04:33.740> take<00:04:33.889> action<00:04:34.340> so<00:04:35.060> if<00:04:35.090> I

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
see we writing to take action so if I

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.790 
see we writing to take action so if I
walk<00:04:35.449> around<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:35.870> screen<00:04:36.169> and<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:36.530> upper

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
walk around the screen and the upper

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.950 
walk around the screen and the upper
right<00:04:37.010> I<00:04:37.310> first<00:04:37.820> see<00:04:38.030> alerts<00:04:38.330> that<00:04:38.630> are<00:04:38.690> pushed

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
right I first see alerts that are pushed

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.409 
right I first see alerts that are pushed
to<00:04:39.110> me<00:04:39.260> it's<00:04:39.590> usually<00:04:39.979> my<00:04:40.099> biggest<00:04:40.430> risk<00:04:40.669> I<00:04:40.970> can

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
to me it's usually my biggest risk I can

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.210 
to me it's usually my biggest risk I can
take<00:04:41.570> action<00:04:41.750> very<00:04:42.199> quickly<00:04:42.470> on<00:04:42.620> addressing

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
take action very quickly on addressing

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.430 
take action very quickly on addressing
them<00:04:43.400> I<00:04:43.610> also<00:04:44.090> see<00:04:44.510> in<00:04:44.599> the<00:04:44.720> lower<00:04:44.870> right<00:04:45.199> by

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
them I also see in the lower right by

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.230 
them I also see in the lower right by
category<00:04:46.010> performance<00:04:46.669> which<00:04:46.820> gives<00:04:47.060> me<00:04:47.210> a

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
category performance which gives me a

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.719 
category performance which gives me a
sense<00:04:47.479> of<00:04:47.720> how<00:04:48.139> I'm<00:04:48.320> doing<00:04:48.620> against<00:04:48.800> plan<00:04:49.130> and

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
sense of how I'm doing against plan and

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:52.120 
sense of how I'm doing against plan and
what<00:04:49.880> I<00:04:49.940> like<00:04:50.210> doing<00:04:50.240> response<00:04:50.979> through<00:04:51.979> the

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
what I like doing response through the

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.920 
what I like doing response through the
location<00:04:52.430> performance<00:04:53.210> I<00:04:53.419> know<00:04:53.570> all<00:04:53.810> my

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
location performance I know all my

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.420 
location performance I know all my
stores<00:04:54.229> aren't<00:04:54.409> the<00:04:54.500> same<00:04:54.680> so<00:04:54.949> I<00:04:55.039> can<00:04:55.220> drill

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
stores aren't the same so I can drill

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.890 
stores aren't the same so I can drill
down<00:04:55.460> and<00:04:55.940> see<00:04:56.090> where<00:04:56.300> there<00:04:56.449> might<00:04:56.539> be

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
down and see where there might be

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.439 
down and see where there might be
in<00:04:57.590> my<00:04:57.949> performance<00:04:58.250> red<00:04:58.610> region<00:04:58.970> or<00:04:59.090> even<00:04:59.330> at

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
in my performance red region or even at

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.960 
in my performance red region or even at
the<00:04:59.540> store<00:04:59.720> level<00:05:00.100> finally<00:05:01.100> over<00:05:01.310> the<00:05:01.430> talib<00:05:01.820> I

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
the store level finally over the talib I

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.240 
the store level finally over the talib I
see<00:05:02.240> my<00:05:02.389> key<00:05:02.600> items<00:05:02.990> they<00:05:03.500> may<00:05:03.680> be<00:05:03.740> driving<00:05:03.979> my

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
see my key items they may be driving my

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.070 
see my key items they may be driving my
business<00:05:04.610> positively<00:05:05.240> or<00:05:05.360> negatively<00:05:05.389> and

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
business positively or negatively and

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.210 
business positively or negatively and
there's<00:05:06.259> probably<00:05:06.380> some<00:05:06.710> things<00:05:06.919> I'd<00:05:07.039> like<00:05:07.160> to

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
there's probably some things I'd like to

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.760 
there's probably some things I'd like to
do<00:05:07.460> to<00:05:07.639> address<00:05:07.820> them<00:05:08.150> and<00:05:08.360> then<00:05:09.139> over<00:05:09.590> on<00:05:09.620> the

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
do to address them and then over on the

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.040 
do to address them and then over on the
left<00:05:09.979> hand<00:05:10.220> side<00:05:10.340> I<00:05:10.880> have<00:05:11.120> a<00:05:11.150> navigation<00:05:11.389> bar

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
left hand side I have a navigation bar

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.260 
left hand side I have a navigation bar
that<00:05:12.710> easily<00:05:13.160> leads<00:05:13.430> me<00:05:13.669> into<00:05:13.820> all<00:05:14.030> of<00:05:14.090> the

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
that easily leads me into all of the

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.969 
that easily leads me into all of the
applications<00:05:14.419> that<00:05:14.990> I<00:05:15.229> access<00:05:15.710> throughout

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
applications that I access throughout

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:18.249 
applications that I access throughout
the<00:05:16.160> day<00:05:16.340> to<00:05:16.970> make<00:05:17.090> playing<00:05:17.389> decisions<00:05:18.020> and

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:18.259 
the day to make playing decisions and

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:21.580 
the day to make playing decisions and
then<00:05:18.380> execute<00:05:18.919> on<00:05:19.100> those<00:05:19.660> so<00:05:20.660> it's<00:05:21.139> Monday

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
then execute on those so it's Monday

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.070 
then execute on those so it's Monday
morning<00:05:22.039> and<00:05:22.280> I've<00:05:22.639> come<00:05:22.880> in<00:05:23.090> and<00:05:23.449> what<00:05:23.900> should

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
morning and I've come in and what should

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.320 
morning and I've come in and what should
I<00:05:24.139> focus<00:05:24.320> on<00:05:24.650> monday<00:05:25.580> is<00:05:25.729> a<00:05:25.759> really<00:05:26.150> big<00:05:26.270> deal

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
I focus on monday is a really big deal

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.749 
I focus on monday is a really big deal
for<00:05:26.539> me<00:05:26.780> because<00:05:26.990> most<00:05:27.740> of<00:05:28.009> my<00:05:28.160> sales<00:05:28.460> just

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 
for me because most of my sales just

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:30.520 
for me because most of my sales just
like<00:05:28.850> most<00:05:29.090> retailers<00:05:29.630> happen<00:05:30.260> over<00:05:30.440> the

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
like most retailers happen over the

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.400 
like most retailers happen over the
weekend<00:05:30.860> so<00:05:31.550> every<00:05:31.940> weekend<00:05:32.389> is<00:05:32.690> a<00:05:32.750> pass<00:05:33.169> or

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
weekend so every weekend is a pass or

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.340 
weekend so every weekend is a pass or
fail<00:05:33.470> test<00:05:33.979> I<00:05:34.370> have<00:05:34.910> a<00:05:34.940> plan<00:05:35.270> that<00:05:35.810> i<00:05:35.840> hope<00:05:36.139> that

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:42.949 
eating it what's really valuable here is

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:44.950 
eating it what's really valuable here is
i'm<00:05:43.100> in<00:05:43.220> week<00:05:43.430> 4<00:05:43.729> and<00:05:44.060> i<00:05:44.389> see<00:05:44.660> that<00:05:44.690> i'm
