enter a match we're gonna fast forward a
little<00:04:50.130> bit<00:04:50.310> if<00:04:50.490> it<00:04:50.580> sits<00:04:50.940> there<00:04:51.060> for<00:04:51.120> like<00:04:51.390> a

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
little bit if it sits there for like a

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.630 
little bit if it sits there for like a
minute<00:04:51.900> and<00:04:52.020> a<00:04:52.140> half<00:04:52.169> a<00:04:52.710> ridiculous<00:04:53.310> amount<00:04:53.430> of

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
minute and a half a ridiculous amount of

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.850 
minute and a half a ridiculous amount of
time<00:04:53.820> and<00:04:54.030> you<00:04:54.090> can't<00:04:54.330> cancel<00:04:54.570> out<00:04:54.840> of<00:04:54.870> it<00:04:55.110> it's

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
time and you can't cancel out of it it's

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.380 
time and you can't cancel out of it it's
trying<00:04:56.250> to<00:04:56.310> get<00:04:56.430> in<00:04:56.550> the<00:04:56.610> lobby<00:04:56.820> but<00:04:57.120> failing

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
trying to get in the lobby but failing

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.390 
trying to get in the lobby but failing
to<00:04:57.750> negotiate<00:04:58.380> it<00:04:58.500> for<00:04:58.710> whatever<00:04:58.860> reason

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
to negotiate it for whatever reason

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.120 
to negotiate it for whatever reason
so<00:05:00.030> hopefully<00:05:00.210> PopCap<00:05:01.080> will<00:05:01.320> fix<00:05:01.590> that<00:05:01.770> in<00:05:02.040> a

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
so hopefully PopCap will fix that in a

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.340 
so hopefully PopCap will fix that in a
future<00:05:02.340> update<00:05:02.960> really<00:05:03.960> would<00:05:04.080> have<00:05:04.169> liked<00:05:04.320> to

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
future update really would have liked to

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.620 
future update really would have liked to
have<00:05:04.590> played<00:05:04.620> it<00:05:05.300> another<00:05:06.300> little<00:05:06.480> thing

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
is colorblind mode which is something

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.220 
is colorblind mode which is something
that<00:05:11.400> the<00:05:11.669> original<00:05:12.030> game<00:05:12.210> always<00:05:12.480> had<00:05:12.690> so

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
that the original game always had so

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.320 
that the original game always had so
players<00:05:14.010> who<00:05:14.190> are<00:05:14.250> colorblind<00:05:14.520> will<00:05:15.150> have<00:05:15.300> a

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
players who are colorblind will have a

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.300 
players who are colorblind will have a
harder<00:05:15.630> time<00:05:15.660> playing<00:05:16.110> it<00:05:16.290> one<00:05:16.980> last<00:05:17.190> feature
