00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:02.080
 oui 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.680
 Good, I'll teach you how to put the Netherlands. 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.879
 I do not know who buys. 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:11.879
 You're going to get the emerald undertaker who is 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:17.859
 investigated yesterday however this is not what you think you can put 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:20.730
 at points on the street 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.730
 so you're going to do it like it's a new die 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.899
 it was so good 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:29.859
 this is a pull 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.330
 I still had to leave, I'll leave the little one. 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.859
 and it's not that, I'm going to put 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:38.220
 on the needle 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.750
 about the absurd the panthers 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.720
 one with pointed mud 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.940
 and the other is that at the time did not give 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.750
 so it's a pull 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.750
 and this is the first point 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.300

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.930

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.430

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.030

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.800

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.650
 on the stage that in the month 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.180
 then these three floors will embrace a part of life 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.780
 and I'm going to become a court 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.700
