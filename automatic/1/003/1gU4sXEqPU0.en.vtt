what<00:00:24.570> we're<00:00:24.660> going<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.810> do<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.050> quick

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
what we're going to do is a quick

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.589 
what we're going to do is a quick
comparison<00:00:25.820> we're<00:00:26.820> all<00:00:26.880> going<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.119> try<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.390> out

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
comparison we're all going to try it out

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.419 
comparison we're all going to try it out
and<00:00:27.960> we're<00:00:28.199> looking<00:00:28.439> at<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.590> recoil<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.279> see

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
and we're looking at the recoil to see

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.939 
and we're looking at the recoil to see
if<00:00:29.519> we<00:00:29.670> think<00:00:29.939> which<00:00:30.630> one<00:00:30.869> mitigates<00:00:31.380> requital

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
if we think which one mitigates requital

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.639 
if we think which one mitigates requital
better<00:00:32.189> if<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.790> all<00:00:32.940> deported<00:00:33.690> or<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.500> dual

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
better if it all deported or the dual

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.569 
better if it all deported or the dual

think<00:01:54.770> that's<00:01:55.770> us<00:01:56.009> I'm<00:01:56.189> killing<00:01:56.600> cartel

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.480 

I<00:02:01.630> should<00:02:02.590> have<00:02:02.680> expected<00:02:02.890> spike<00:02:03.250> to<00:02:03.340> say

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
I should have expected spike to say

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.640 
I should have expected spike to say
something<00:02:03.790> like<00:02:03.880> that<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:05.140> almost<00:02:05.290> feels<00:02:05.560> like

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
something like that it almost feels like

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.570 
something like that it almost feels like
there's<00:02:05.860> a<00:02:05.920> little<00:02:06.070> less<00:02:06.340> with<00:02:06.550> the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
there's a little less with the

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.150 
there's a little less with the
compensated<00:02:07.270> I<00:02:07.590> definitely<00:02:08.590> felt<00:02:08.770> like<00:02:08.950> the

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
compensated I definitely felt like the

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.780 
compensated I definitely felt like the
compensated<00:02:09.700> was<00:02:09.790> less<00:02:10.000> I<00:02:10.240> I<00:02:10.780> really<00:02:11.140> did<00:02:11.410> and

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
compensated was less I I really did and

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.220 
compensated was less I I really did and
but<00:02:12.790> that<00:02:12.970> could<00:02:13.150> just<00:02:13.300> be<00:02:13.330> that's<00:02:13.630> my<00:02:13.780> gun<00:02:14.050> and

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
but that could just be that's my gun and

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.690 
but that could just be that's my gun and
that's<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.560> gun<00:02:14.950> that<00:02:14.980> I<00:02:15.130> shoot<00:02:15.340> all<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.520> time

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
that's the gun that I shoot all the time

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.360 
that's the gun that I shoot all the time
so<00:02:16.330> that<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.410> gin<00:02:17.590> for<00:02:17.800> just<00:02:18.100> seemed<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.340> little

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
so that the gin for just seemed a little

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.420 
so that the gin for just seemed a little
bit<00:02:18.580> snappier<00:02:19.090> on<00:02:19.240> the<00:02:19.600> recoil<00:02:19.990> to<00:02:20.380> me<00:02:20.530> and

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
bit snappier on the recoil to me and

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.360 
bit snappier on the recoil to me and
they<00:02:21.550> were<00:02:21.610> really<00:02:21.910> close<00:02:22.180> but<00:02:22.920> yeah<00:02:23.920> you<00:02:24.250> go
