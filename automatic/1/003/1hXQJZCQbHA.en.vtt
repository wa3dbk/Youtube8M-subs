00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 
of this video first I'll draw a nice big

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:28.690 
of this video first I'll draw a nice big
circle

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:28.700 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.150 

so<00:00:29.240> once<00:00:29.450> I<00:00:29.570> have<00:00:29.720> the<00:00:29.870> circle<00:00:30.110> done<00:00:30.440> I'll<00:00:30.680> draw

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
so once I have the circle done I'll draw

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:44.320 
so once I have the circle done I'll draw
two<00:00:31.280> vertical<00:00:31.880> lines<00:00:32.090> inside<00:00:42.880> and<00:00:43.880> I'll<00:00:44.090> turn

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.330 
two vertical lines inside and I'll turn

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:50.740 
two vertical lines inside and I'll turn
it<00:00:44.480> into<00:00:45.190> almost<00:00:46.190> like<00:00:46.400> a<00:00:46.520> letter<00:00:46.820> Y<00:00:49.480> so<00:00:50.480> here

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
it into almost like a letter Y so here

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.119 
it into almost like a letter Y so here
is<00:00:50.900> the<00:00:51.940> vertical<00:00:52.940> lines<00:00:53.150> again<00:00:53.480> and<00:00:54.129> I'll

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
is the vertical lines again and I'll

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:07.469 
is the vertical lines again and I'll
finish<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:55.730> y

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.359 

okay<00:01:08.479> so<00:01:08.750> once<00:01:08.990> we<00:01:09.200> have<00:01:09.380> this<00:01:09.799> middle<00:01:10.190> part

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
okay so once we have this middle part

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:20.020 
okay so once we have this middle part
I'll<00:01:10.640> draw<00:01:11.119> another<00:01:11.150> circle<00:01:11.630> inside

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.580 

so<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.210> curve<00:01:21.480> connected<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.080> top<00:01:22.350> part

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
so this curve connected this top part

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.440 
so this curve connected this top part
with<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.100> part<00:01:23.160> here<00:01:25.670> I'll<00:01:26.670> continue<00:01:27.120> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
with this part here I'll continue the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:45.920 
with this part here I'll continue the
circle<00:01:32.270> and<00:01:33.270> I'll<00:01:34.230> draw<00:01:34.440> it<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.680> side

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.170 

okay<00:01:46.930> so<00:01:46.990> once<00:01:47.320> we<00:01:47.500> have<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:48.280> peace<00:01:48.520> sign<00:01:48.790> done

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
okay so once we have the peace sign done

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.590 
okay so once we have the peace sign done
I'll<00:01:49.510> draw<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.200> cute<00:01:50.590> little<00:01:50.770> mouth<00:01:51.600> just

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
I'll draw the cute little mouth just

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.840 
I'll draw the cute little mouth just
right<00:01:52.930> in<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:53.170> middle<00:01:53.380> there<00:01:53.590> and<00:01:54.490> let's<00:01:54.670> get

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
right in the middle there and let's get

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:03.929 
right in the middle there and let's get
some<00:01:55.030> big<00:01:55.300> fun2draw<00:01:55.630> eyes

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.219 

so<00:02:04.270> there<00:02:04.509> is<00:02:04.659> a<00:02:04.689> leaf<00:02:04.930> shape<00:02:06.659> one<00:02:07.659> more<00:02:07.930> curve

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
so there is a leaf shape one more curve

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.290 
so there is a leaf shape one more curve
inside<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:08.830> eye<00:02:08.860> here<00:02:09.280> and<00:02:09.399> I'll<00:02:09.970> make<00:02:10.000> this

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
inside the eye here and I'll make this

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.220 
inside the eye here and I'll make this
really<00:02:10.899> dark

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.530 

okay<00:02:14.230> now<00:02:14.500> draw<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:14.950> big<00:02:15.250> view<00:02:15.640> bowl<00:02:15.910> like<00:02:16.330> that

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
okay now draw a big view bowl like that

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.000 
okay now draw a big view bowl like that
and<00:02:16.900> a<00:02:17.380> highlight<00:02:18.150> inside<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:20.440> shade<00:02:20.769> the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
and a highlight inside and to shade the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.660 
and a highlight inside and to shade the
eye

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
eye

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.130 
eye
I'll<00:02:22.090> start<00:02:22.510> really<00:02:22.930> dark<00:02:23.280> at<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.550> top<00:02:24.790> here

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
I'll start really dark at the top here

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.990 
I'll start really dark at the top here
but<00:02:26.140> as<00:02:26.260> I<00:02:26.440> work<00:02:26.620> my<00:02:26.650> way<00:02:26.800> down<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.250> eye<00:02:27.280> and

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
but as I work my way down the eye and

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.210 
but as I work my way down the eye and
spread<00:02:28.300> out<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.450> lines<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:29.260> they'll<00:02:30.099> get

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
spread out the lines and they'll get

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.990 
spread out the lines and they'll get
short<00:02:32.130> so<00:02:33.130> it<00:02:33.190> looks<00:02:33.340> like<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.580> shading<00:02:33.819> is

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
short so it looks like the shading is

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.870 
short so it looks like the shading is
getting<00:02:34.239> light<00:02:35.910> onto<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.060> side
