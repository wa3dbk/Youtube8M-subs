00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
another black screw for those two and

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.640 
another black screw for those two and
not<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.269> silver<00:02:56.570> screws<00:02:59.230> okay<00:03:00.230> i<00:03:00.260> just<00:03:00.319> took

the<00:03:00.800> liberty<00:03:01.160> of<00:03:01.400> moving<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.360> plastic

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
the liberty of moving the plastic

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.440 
the liberty of moving the plastic
sheeting<00:03:04.930> from<00:03:05.930> these<00:03:06.140> aisles<00:03:06.590> here<00:03:07.329> over<00:03:08.329> way

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
sheeting from these aisles here over way

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.509 
sheeting from these aisles here over way
to<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.840> end<00:03:09.140> point<00:03:09.890> where<00:03:10.340> they<00:03:10.430> actually

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
to the end point where they actually

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.380 
to the end point where they actually
attached<00:03:11.440> similarly<00:03:12.440> up<00:03:12.829> here<00:03:13.250> and<00:03:14.209> that's

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
attached similarly up here and that's

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.520 
attached similarly up here and that's
because<00:03:14.570> these<00:03:14.930> were<00:03:15.140> causing<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:18.200> metal

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
because these were causing the metal

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.520 
because these were causing the metal
panel<00:03:18.890> that<00:03:19.370> we're<00:03:19.519> going<00:03:19.610> to<00:03:19.670> put<00:03:19.850> on<00:03:20.110> and<00:03:21.110> to

countersunk screw
from<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:11.810> old<00:04:12.020> motherboard<00:04:14.110> so<00:04:15.110> using<00:04:15.290> these

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
from the old motherboard so using these

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:24.780 
from the old motherboard so using these
screws<00:04:16.269> I'm<00:04:17.269> going<00:04:17.690> to<00:04:17.870> install<00:04:18.320> one<00:04:21.160> in<00:04:22.160> every

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.910 

possible<00:04:25.790> location<00:04:26.600> I<00:04:28.270> can<00:04:29.270> find<00:04:29.620> on<00:04:30.620> the

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
possible location I can find on the

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.590 
possible location I can find on the
outside<00:04:31.280> in<00:04:31.610> order<00:04:31.820> to<00:04:31.910> give<00:04:32.060> this<00:04:32.210> chassis

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
outside in order to give this chassis

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:47.010 
outside in order to give this chassis
some<00:04:32.990> strength<00:04:33.320> back

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:05:06.009 

it

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:06.019 

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:14.020 

mr.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.530 

so

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.500 

it<00:05:19.140> gets<00:05:19.410> even<00:05:19.560> plays<00:05:19.890> in<00:05:20.130> just<00:05:21.030> preaching<00:05:21.390> on

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
it gets even plays in just preaching on

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.060 
it gets even plays in just preaching on
the<00:05:21.630> inside<00:05:22.020> and<00:05:22.170> push<00:05:22.410> down<00:05:22.440> the<00:05:22.890> little

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
the inside and push down the little

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.430 
the inside and push down the little
metal<00:05:23.340> latch<00:05:24.680> we're<00:05:25.680> going<00:05:25.770> to<00:05:25.860> walk<00:05:26.010> in<00:05:26.190> place

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
metal latch we're going to walk in place

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:50.410 
metal latch we're going to walk in place
a<00:05:32.090> mythical<00:05:33.090> inch<00:05:33.390> long<00:05:33.750> skirt
