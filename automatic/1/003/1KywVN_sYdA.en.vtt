00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
go off the red again I would have to

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.710 
go off the red again I would have to
turn<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.100> truck<00:01:11.990> all<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.260> way<00:01:13.380> back<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:14.720> turn

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
turn the truck all the way back on turn

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.270 
turn the truck all the way back on turn
it<00:01:15.840> back<00:01:16.020> off<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.290> then<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.860> lights<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
it back off and then the lights of the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.120 
it back off and then the lights of the
money<00:01:17.630> so<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.900> think<00:01:19.259> there's<00:01:19.500> some<00:01:19.740> sort<00:01:19.979> of

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
money so I think there's some sort of

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.749 
money so I think there's some sort of
flaw<00:01:20.460> here<00:01:21.380> maybe<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.869> software<00:01:25.759> update

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
flaw here maybe in the software update

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.640 
flaw here maybe in the software update
or<00:01:28.880> whatever<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.970> can<00:01:30.119> show<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:31.229> the
