00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
first of all but you know it's very good

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.370 
first of all but you know it's very good
to<00:01:40.580> drivers<00:01:41.060> well<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.360> handling<00:01:41.720> is<00:01:41.840> fine<00:01:42.050> so

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
to drivers well the handling is fine so

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.460 
to drivers well the handling is fine so
it's<00:01:42.500> just<00:01:42.740> right<00:01:42.980> it's<00:01:43.280> not<00:01:43.430> out<00:01:43.700> of<00:01:43.730> balance

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
it's just right it's not out of balance

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.190 
it's just right it's not out of balance
you<00:01:45.470> know<00:01:45.620> in<00:01:45.800> other<00:01:46.660> other<00:01:47.660> cars<00:01:47.960> who

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
you know in other other cars who

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.690 
you know in other other cars who
sometimes<00:01:48.440> have<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:48.890> feeling<00:01:49.190> I<00:01:49.310> it's<00:01:49.490> a<00:01:49.550> bit

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
sometimes have the feeling I it's a bit

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.370 
sometimes have the feeling I it's a bit
lazy<00:01:49.910> or<00:01:50.240> it's<00:01:50.390> too<00:01:50.540> aggressive<00:01:50.750> you<00:01:51.140> can't

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
lazy or it's too aggressive you can't

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.290 
lazy or it's too aggressive you can't
really<00:01:51.680> put<00:01:52.040> it<00:01:52.160> on<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.400> track<00:01:52.580> but<00:01:52.850> here<00:01:53.090> the

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
really put it on the track but here the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.600 
really put it on the track but here the
balance<00:01:53.660> is<00:01:53.780> just<00:01:54.050> right<00:01:54.260> and<00:01:54.530> as<00:01:54.890> I<00:01:55.040> said<00:01:55.220> the

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
balance is just right and as I said the

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.660 
balance is just right and as I said the
grip<00:01:55.850> is<00:01:56.150> a<00:01:56.840> new<00:01:57.050> dimension<00:01:57.340> all<00:01:58.340> of<00:01:58.490> that

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
grip is a new dimension all of that

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:08.990 
grip is a new dimension all of that
makes<00:01:58.910> it<00:01:59.090> so<00:01:59.480> enjoy

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
you know we're talking about speeds

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.570 
you know we're talking about speeds
around<00:02:13.020> 400<00:02:13.770> so

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
around 400 so

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.250 
around 400 so
right<00:02:16.580> around<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:17.090> Nurburgring<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:17.930> think<00:02:18.140> the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
right around the Nurburgring I think the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.059 
right around the Nurburgring I think the
first<00:02:18.500> time<00:02:18.740> and<00:02:18.980> there<00:02:19.100> was<00:02:19.220> a

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
first time and there was a

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.459

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:23.469 
you know straight away 20 or 30 seconds

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:24.929 
you know straight away 20 or 30 seconds
quicker<00:02:23.590> than<00:02:23.859> I<00:02:23.980> was<00:02:24.159> in<00:02:24.189> the<00:02:24.459> in<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.700> real

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:24.939
