00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.910
 portal glass and finger all mobile 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:19.320
 entertainment on glafi.com 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:20.880
 and hello to all friends with you again I 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.759
 huskies rusher and today we talk about 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.820
 so interesting tanks like me panzar 4 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:29.880
 it's on foot at the sixth level of the nation 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.840
 Germany, what does it stand out along with 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.880
 their fellows such as su-100 and 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.690
 jackson first of all with his small 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.460
 dimensions 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.130
 he has kept such a feature with us 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.950
 precisely due to the small size of 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.680
 tank pieces yes he is as mobile 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.590
 It has substantially the same gun as 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.560
 tank pieces i.e. his top gun 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.110
 what's interesting here from the tank itself 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.600
 First of all, what we do not have at all 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.850
 booking but there is a good mask 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.329
 it is in the hands there at least some 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.000
 armor 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.450
 available if you specify the figure who we have 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.990
 here 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:09.390
 forehead 80 millimeters bead and feed 40 and 20 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.509
 that is, we are punched by absolutely everything 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.210
 tanks except of course if we 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.850
 we get and floss and there just will be 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.280
 machine gunners then they naturally us not 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.850
 but they are such tanks as can 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.880
 to be given a load and the like but here 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.189
 we have a good masking factor 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.609
 if we pump our crew like that 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.340
 feast as a disguise and plus still hang 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:37.319
 here the mass network and in addition also add 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.479
 the enemy then our us will be just 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.170
 It is perfect here as the example in this battle in 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.829
 I'm completely off here perk 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.289
 masking and 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.810
 my crew is exactly 100 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.999
 interest type plus is still worth the masses 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.859
 net and horns and this tank 

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:55.439
 thanks to this set just 

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:58.020
 great but what else is the gameplay 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.200
 we wrote though we have good dynamics 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.770
 if you specify the figure who is 38 maximum 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.200
 speed with a mass of 24 tons and power 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.270
 engine 440 horsepower tank 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.250
 gaining his max speed calm plus 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.959
 he has no armor so he doesn't 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.230
 it's hard to get your maximum 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.550
 speed well and if we talk about exactly 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.490
 tools then we have it 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.580
 masterpiece 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.820
 the same as the tank pieces 3 exactly in 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.030
 rate of break through of course 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.100
 a little bit better but still has 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.420
 place to be with us here rate of fire 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.580
 eight and six shots per minute 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.210
 put here rammer and how i already 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.980
 said on the net and pipes it will just 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.350
 gorgeous we will have 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.410
 rate of fire at about 9 and 1 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.780
 shot per minute with an average damage of 220 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.830
 units and conventional armor piercing 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.230
 132a gold projectile 171 this is quite 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.540
 enough against the sixth levels 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.750
 against the seventh where he most often 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.150
 Level 8 falls he rarely sees 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.370
 but the eights there you will not be clean with 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.280
 8th level fight there will be the same 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.620
 your brothers plus everything we have here 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.420
 time information is just instant and 1 of 7 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.970
 seconds that is here reinforced drives 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.810
 tips just do not have sense we have 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.610
 will be just mixing instant 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.130
 every second and just do not have time to blink 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.740
 and your tank has already come down so friends 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.260
 tank dynamics how to say very 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.450
 good chassis turning speed 35 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.370
 degrees per second is good now and 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.620
 pro is demonstrated in the fight against that 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.010
 Jackson himself has 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.470
 the tower but it will not help him this one 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.720
 moment we just turn around and give 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.210
 Splash on it and we went to 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.170
 hangar on let's let you down already by 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.350
