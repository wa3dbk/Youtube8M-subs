00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
kind of building on a little bit of what

amps<00:00:36.450> according<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.200> my<00:00:37.290> battery<00:00:37.500> charger

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
amps according to my battery charger

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.319 
amps according to my battery charger
there<00:00:38.309> which<00:00:38.460> has<00:00:38.579> been<00:00:38.730> pretty<00:00:38.910> accurate

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
there which has been pretty accurate

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.000 
there which has been pretty accurate
I've<00:00:39.450> compared<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.320> one<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.500> had<00:00:40.770> on<00:00:40.920> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
I've compared it to the one I had on the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.049 
I've compared it to the one I had on the
bus<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:43.219> this<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.340> what<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.610> get

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
bus and this is what you get

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.779 
bus and this is what you get
now<00:00:45.989> I've<00:00:46.110> mounted<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:47.539> unit<00:00:48.539> here<00:00:49.670> to<00:00:50.670> an

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
now I've mounted this unit here to an

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.580 
now I've mounted this unit here to an
ultrasonic<00:00:53.180> transducer<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.390> wanted<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.469> see

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
ultrasonic transducer I wanted to see

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.830 
ultrasonic transducer I wanted to see
what<00:00:55.710> ultrasonics<00:00:56.340> would<00:00:56.520> do<00:00:56.670> that's<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.690> way

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
what ultrasonics would do that's a way

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.770 
what ultrasonics would do that's a way
of<00:00:57.870> vibrating<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.710> water<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.730> it's<00:01:00.090> come<00:01:00.629> up

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
of vibrating the water and it's come up

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.789 
of vibrating the water and it's come up
with<00:01:00.899> some<00:01:01.050> interesting<00:01:02.750> just<00:01:03.750> data<00:01:04.140> it's<00:01:04.619> not

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
with some interesting just data it's not

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.590 
with some interesting just data it's not
really<00:01:05.100> producing<00:01:05.250> anymore<00:01:05.790> gas<00:01:06.060> but<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.420> want

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
really producing anymore gas but I want

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.719 
really producing anymore gas but I want
you<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.720> watch<00:01:06.900> what<00:01:07.080> happens<00:01:07.560> here<00:01:07.799> when<00:01:08.640> I

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
you to watch what happens here when I

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.109 
you to watch what happens here when I
turn<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.450> on<00:01:09.950> you<00:01:10.950> see<00:01:11.159> how<00:01:11.189> cloudy<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.909> water

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
turn it on you see how cloudy the water

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.520 
turn it on you see how cloudy the water
is<00:01:12.330> it's<00:01:12.510> pretty<00:01:12.689> normal<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.110> know<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.409> give

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
is it's pretty normal you know you give

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.940 
is it's pretty normal you know you give
milky<00:01:13.979> water<00:01:14.159> when<00:01:14.549> you're<00:01:15.560> got<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.590> unit

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
milky water when you're got the unit

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.660 
milky water when you're got the unit
running<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.610> take<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> look<00:01:18.750> at<00:01:18.900> this

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.460 

but<00:01:25.299> you<00:01:25.420> may<00:01:25.540> not<00:01:25.659> be<00:01:25.810> able<00:01:25.960> to<00:01:26.020> see<00:01:26.259> in<00:01:26.380> the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
but you may not be able to see in the

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.200 
but you may not be able to see in the
video<00:01:26.740> I<00:01:26.799> know<00:01:26.950> you<00:01:27.130> can<00:01:27.310> see<00:01:27.520> it<00:01:27.549> clearing<00:01:28.060> up

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
video I know you can see it clearing up

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.749 
video I know you can see it clearing up
but<00:01:28.900> what<00:01:28.990> it's<00:01:29.170> doing<00:01:29.200> it<00:01:29.590> looks<00:01:30.490> like<00:01:30.610> it's

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
but what it's doing it looks like it's

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.270 
but what it's doing it looks like it's
making<00:01:30.909> the<00:01:31.180> bubbles<00:01:31.330> larger<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:32.950> making

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
making the bubbles larger and making

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.749 
making the bubbles larger and making
them<00:01:33.430> collide<00:01:33.909> or<00:01:34.860> bond<00:01:35.860> to<00:01:36.070> each<00:01:36.100> other<00:01:36.490> and

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
them collide or bond to each other and

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.260 
them collide or bond to each other and
rise<00:01:36.939> to<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.270> top<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.950> I<00:01:39.130> was<00:01:39.340> interested<00:01:40.119> to

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
rise to the top and I was interested to

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.330 
rise to the top and I was interested to
see<00:01:40.479> if<00:01:40.600> that<00:01:40.750> was<00:01:40.899> making<00:01:41.289> it<00:01:41.440> more<00:01:41.649> efficient

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
see if that was making it more efficient

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.200 
see if that was making it more efficient
as<00:01:43.180> far<00:01:43.330> as<00:01:43.720> not<00:01:43.899> having<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:45.210> micro-fine

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
as far as not having the micro-fine

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.940 
as far as not having the micro-fine
bubbles

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
bubbles

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.450 
bubbles
turned<00:01:48.490> back<00:01:48.610> into<00:01:48.729> water<00:01:50.100> I'm<00:01:51.100> a<00:01:51.130> little

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
turned back into water I'm a little

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.219 
turned back into water I'm a little
bubbler<00:01:51.789> setup<00:01:52.180> over<00:01:52.509> here<00:01:52.539> and<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.869> bubbles

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
bubbler setup over here and the bubbles

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.499 
bubbler setup over here and the bubbles
really<00:01:56.409> aren't<00:01:56.710> aren't<00:01:57.039> any<00:01:57.159> different<00:01:58.409> then

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
really aren't aren't any different then

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.730 
really aren't aren't any different then
without<00:02:01.509> the<00:02:01.569> ultrasonics<00:02:02.350> running<00:02:02.619> but

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
without the ultrasonics running but

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.440 
without the ultrasonics running but
right<00:02:03.130> now<00:02:03.310> Alex<00:02:03.520> that<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:03.759> ultrasonics<00:02:04.299> are

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
right now Alex that the ultrasonics are

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.389 
right now Alex that the ultrasonics are
on<00:02:04.630> I<00:02:05.819> just<00:02:06.819> turned<00:02:07.030> it<00:02:07.210> back<00:02:07.390> off<00:02:07.659> and<00:02:08.399> you'll

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
on I just turned it back off and you'll

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.460 
on I just turned it back off and you'll
watch<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.640> water<00:02:10.030> cloud<00:02:10.390> cloud<00:02:10.929> back<00:02:11.230> up

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
watch the water cloud cloud back up

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.410 
watch the water cloud cloud back up
it'll<00:02:11.739> turn<00:02:11.860> back<00:02:12.130> into<00:02:12.340> micro-fine<00:02:13.000> bubbles

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
it'll turn back into micro-fine bubbles

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.600 
it'll turn back into micro-fine bubbles
you<00:02:16.020> see<00:02:16.200> here<00:02:16.410> I<00:02:16.440> don't<00:02:17.010> have<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.280> whole<00:02:17.430> lot<00:02:17.459> of

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
you see here I don't have a whole lot of

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.699 
you see here I don't have a whole lot of
confidence<00:02:18.240> in<00:02:18.420> this<00:02:18.540> bubbler<00:02:18.959> as<00:02:19.170> my<00:02:19.349> unit

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
confidence in this bubbler as my unit

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.100 
confidence in this bubbler as my unit
here<00:02:20.069> is<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.280> believe<00:02:20.610> it's<00:02:20.849> leaking<00:02:21.270> I've<00:02:21.420> been

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
here is I believe it's leaking I've been

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.059 
here is I believe it's leaking I've been
plagued<00:02:22.560> with<00:02:23.270> vacuum<00:02:24.270> leaks<00:02:24.830> so<00:02:25.830> I<00:02:25.860> don't

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
plagued with vacuum leaks so I don't

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.680 
plagued with vacuum leaks so I don't
have<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.250> whole<00:02:26.520> lot<00:02:26.550> of<00:02:26.849> confidence<00:02:27.090> in<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.569> up

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
have a whole lot of confidence in it up

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.380 
have a whole lot of confidence in it up
here<00:02:27.900> around<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.260> top<00:02:28.500> but<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.790> top<00:02:30.030> seal

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
here around the top but the top seal

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.440 
here around the top but the top seal
here<00:02:30.690> got<00:02:30.900> real<00:02:31.170> hot<00:02:31.910> when<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:32.940> had<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.239> in<00:02:33.330> the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
here got real hot when I had it in the

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.130 
here got real hot when I had it in the
bus<00:02:33.630> this<00:02:33.840> past<00:02:34.140> week<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:35.420> is<00:02:36.420> warped

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
bus this past week and is warped

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.530 
bus this past week and is warped
I'm<00:02:37.709> using<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.310> polycarbonate<00:02:39.060> bottle<00:02:39.420> these

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
I'm using a polycarbonate bottle these

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.479 
I'm using a polycarbonate bottle these
days<00:02:39.810> but<00:02:40.110> that's<00:02:40.260> just<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.590> really<00:02:40.860> hot<00:02:41.069> engine

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
days but that's just a really hot engine

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.240 
days but that's just a really hot engine
compartment<00:02:42.560> especially<00:02:43.560> it's<00:02:43.800> not<00:02:43.950> so<00:02:44.069> hot

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
compartment especially it's not so hot

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.589 
compartment especially it's not so hot
when<00:02:44.459> you're<00:02:44.580> running<00:02:44.730> down<00:02:44.849> the<00:02:45.090> road<00:02:45.239> but<00:02:45.480> if

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
when you're running down the road but if

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:46.790 
when you're running down the road but if
you're<00:02:45.720> sitting<00:02:46.019> at<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.140> stoplight<00:02:46.500> or

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
you're sitting at a stoplight or

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.220 
you're sitting at a stoplight or
something<00:02:47.250> like<00:02:47.370> that<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.880> can<00:02:48.720> get<00:02:48.870> pretty

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
something like that it can get pretty

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.759 
something like that it can get pretty
darn<00:02:49.560> hot<00:02:50.150> so<00:02:51.150> I'll<00:02:51.750> turn<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.140> ultrasonics

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
darn hot so I'll turn the ultrasonics

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.400 
darn hot so I'll turn the ultrasonics
back<00:02:52.980> on

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.220 

you<00:02:57.890> see<00:02:58.130> how<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.340> gas<00:02:59.000> is<00:02:59.300> immediately<00:02:59.780> lifts

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
you see how the gas is immediately lifts

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.300 
you see how the gas is immediately lifts
off<00:03:01.720> into<00:03:02.720> March<00:03:02.960> much<00:03:03.380> Laurel<00:03:03.770> larger

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
off into March much Laurel larger

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.190 
off into March much Laurel larger
bubbles

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.729 

I'll<00:03:08.740> turn<00:03:08.920> it<00:03:09.069> back<00:03:09.100> off

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.970 

let<00:03:14.220> it<00:03:14.340> fill<00:03:14.579> back<00:03:14.819> in<00:03:14.849> I<00:03:15.769> think<00:03:16.769> it's<00:03:16.920> a

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
let it fill back in I think it's a

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.569 
let it fill back in I think it's a
really<00:03:17.280> interesting<00:03:17.310> effect<00:03:19.430> haven't<00:03:20.430> seen

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
really interesting effect haven't seen

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.319 
really interesting effect haven't seen
anyone<00:03:20.939> else<00:03:22.340> messing<00:03:23.340> with<00:03:23.370> ultrasonics<00:03:24.180> at

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
anyone else messing with ultrasonics at

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.929 
anyone else messing with ultrasonics at
least<00:03:24.510> on<00:03:24.659> youtube<00:03:25.159> haven't<00:03:26.159> seen<00:03:26.310> much<00:03:26.489> on<00:03:26.730> it

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:26.939 
least on youtube haven't seen much on it

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:28.520 
least on youtube haven't seen much on it
and<00:03:27.090> maybe<00:03:27.420> this<00:03:27.629> is<00:03:27.810> why<00:03:27.989> they're<00:03:28.379> not

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
and maybe this is why they're not

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.339 
and maybe this is why they're not
getting<00:03:28.860> a<00:03:28.920> big<00:03:29.099> benefit<00:03:29.519> from<00:03:29.760> it<00:03:29.939> but<00:03:30.780> it

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
getting a big benefit from it but it

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.580 
getting a big benefit from it but it
might<00:03:31.530> prove<00:03:32.340> beneficial<00:03:32.519> in<00:03:33.500> keeping<00:03:34.500> the

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
might prove beneficial in keeping the

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.640 
might prove beneficial in keeping the
plates<00:03:34.890> clean<00:03:35.250> as<00:03:35.519> well<00:03:36.140> and<00:03:37.140> if<00:03:37.260> interested

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
plates clean as well and if interested

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.170 
plates clean as well and if interested
in<00:03:37.799> how<00:03:37.980> many<00:03:38.220> how<00:03:38.430> much<00:03:38.519> energy<00:03:39.060> the

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
in how many how much energy the

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.910 
in how many how much energy the
ultrasonics<00:03:39.840> are<00:03:39.959> taking<00:03:40.290> is<00:03:40.409> taking<00:03:40.739> less

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
ultrasonics are taking is taking less

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.360 
ultrasonics are taking is taking less
than<00:03:41.099> 40<00:03:41.459> watts<00:03:42.140> to<00:03:43.140> run<00:03:43.319> the<00:03:43.470> ultrasonics<00:03:44.159> and

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
than 40 watts to run the ultrasonics and

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.910 
than 40 watts to run the ultrasonics and
this<00:03:47.370> has<00:03:47.579> been<00:03:47.760> been<00:03:48.090> pretty<00:03:48.299> interesting<00:03:48.920> to

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
this has been been pretty interesting to

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:57.180 
this has been been pretty interesting to
see<00:03:50.209> ok<00:03:51.209> I'm<00:03:51.299> going<00:03:51.420> to<00:03:51.510> cut<00:03:51.659> it<00:03:51.750> back<00:03:51.900> on<00:03:52.139> now

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.370 

you<00:03:57.760> see<00:03:57.970> how<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:58.120> bubbles<00:03:58.570> are<00:03:58.750> combining

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
you see how the bubbles are combining

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.910 
you see how the bubbles are combining
and<00:03:59.530> getting<00:03:59.770> larger

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.820 

well<00:04:04.460> that<00:04:04.670> was<00:04:04.790> pretty<00:04:05.000> interesting

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:23.520 

now<00:04:11.370> turn<00:04:12.060> it<00:04:12.180> back<00:04:12.360> off

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.510 

turn<00:04:24.040> it<00:04:24.160> back<00:04:24.190> on
