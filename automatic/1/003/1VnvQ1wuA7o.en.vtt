of the map i do go in the middle for a

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.719 
of the map i do go in the middle for a
little<00:01:43.259> bit<00:01:43.439> but<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.009> try<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.220> stay<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.520> the

edges of the map I try to use my

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.130 
edges of the map I try to use my

and<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.940> awareness<00:02:09.149> like<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.599> said<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.929> see

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110
