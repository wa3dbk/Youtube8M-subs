00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
later but these are the second candidate

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
abdomen together it's holding you up

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.650 
abdomen together it's holding you up
right<00:02:20.870> they<00:02:21.440> become<00:02:21.740> lacks<00:02:22.090> so<00:02:23.090> there<00:02:23.480> are<00:02:23.510> not

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
right they become lacks so there are not

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.600 
right they become lacks so there are not
any<00:02:23.720> more<00:02:23.959> stretch<00:02:24.500> they're<00:02:24.830> not<00:02:24.980> together

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
any more stretch they're not together

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.030 
any more stretch they're not together
anymore<00:02:26.090> they're<00:02:26.420> stretched<00:02:26.840> out<00:02:27.050> there<00:02:27.709> week

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
anymore they're stretched out there week

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.900 
anymore they're stretched out there week
so<00:02:28.730> we<00:02:28.880> tighten<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:29.450> muscle<00:02:29.870> as<00:02:29.990> well<00:02:30.200> and

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
so we tighten that muscle as well and

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.060 
so we tighten that muscle as well and
the<00:02:31.910> third<00:02:32.180> part<00:02:32.870> of<00:02:33.050> this<00:02:33.140> procedure<00:02:33.590> most<00:02:33.980> of

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
the third part of this procedure most of

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.040 
the third part of this procedure most of
the<00:02:34.130> that<00:02:34.310> we<00:02:34.460> need<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.730> do

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
the that we need to do

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.260 
the that we need to do
liposuction<00:02:35.530> of<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:35.830> flanks<00:02:36.340> so<00:02:36.940> basically

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
liposuction of the flanks so basically

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.570 
liposuction of the flanks so basically
we<00:02:37.420> can<00:02:37.570> contour<00:02:38.080> it<00:02:38.230> better<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:38.830> then<00:02:39.370> the

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
we can contour it better and then the

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.090 
we can contour it better and then the
clients<00:02:40.300> will<00:02:40.420> have<00:02:40.600> a<00:02:40.630> nice<00:02:40.930> waist<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.710> curve

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
clients will have a nice waist and curve

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.980 
clients will have a nice waist and curve
line<00:02:42.340> on<00:02:42.490> their<00:02:42.640> waist<00:02:42.880> so<00:02:43.510> three<00:02:43.750> things

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
line on their waist so three things

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.720 
line on their waist so three things
together<00:02:44.140> now<00:02:44.500> what<00:02:44.740> what<00:02:44.890> happens<00:02:45.190> when<00:02:45.610> we

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
together now what what happens when we

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.220 
together now what what happens when we
cut<00:02:45.910> through<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.150> skin<00:02:46.270> we<00:02:46.750> go<00:02:46.900> down<00:02:46.930> to

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
cut through the skin we go down to

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.320 
cut through the skin we go down to
subcutaneous<00:02:47.500> tissue<00:02:48.040> we<00:02:48.700> reach<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.300> the

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
subcutaneous tissue we reach to the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.570 
subcutaneous tissue we reach to the
level<00:02:49.690> where<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.960> muscle<00:02:50.290> is<00:02:50.440> right<00:02:50.800> and<00:02:50.980> then

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
level where the muscle is right and then

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.180 
level where the muscle is right and then
basically<00:02:51.910> we<00:02:52.390> go<00:02:52.600> we<00:02:52.960> undermine<00:02:53.320> it<00:02:53.620> all<00:02:53.800> the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
basically we go we undermine it all the

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.640 
basically we go we undermine it all the
way<00:02:54.340> from<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.850> bottom<00:02:55.240> to<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.510> top<00:02:56.080> almost<00:02:56.560> to

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
way from the bottom to the top almost to

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.950 
way from the bottom to the top almost to
the<00:02:56.770> chest<00:02:57.040> area<00:02:57.280> right<00:02:57.640> so<00:02:58.060> we<00:02:58.240> free<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.660> skin

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
the chest area right so we free the skin

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.690 
the chest area right so we free the skin
right<00:02:59.350> then<00:02:59.680> we<00:02:59.830> pull<00:03:00.100> it<00:03:00.220> as<00:03:00.370> much<00:03:00.670> as

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
right then we pull it as much as

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.660 
right then we pull it as much as
possible<00:03:01.000> right<00:03:01.600> we<00:03:02.260> make<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.740> clients<00:03:03.550> on

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
possible right we make the clients on

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.910 
possible right we make the clients on
the<00:03:03.880> operating<00:03:04.120> table<00:03:04.330> more<00:03:05.320> of<00:03:05.470> a<00:03:05.590> sitting

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
the operating table more of a sitting

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.030 
the operating table more of a sitting
position<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:07.180> any<00:03:07.510> extra<00:03:08.080> elasticity<00:03:08.500> will<00:03:08.860> be

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
position so any extra elasticity will be

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.370 
position so any extra elasticity will be
gone<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:09.490> extra<00:03:10.480> skin<00:03:10.750> would<00:03:10.840> be<00:03:11.020> gone<00:03:11.230> we

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
gone and extra skin would be gone we

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.100 
gone and extra skin would be gone we
pull<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:11.710> down<00:03:11.920> I<00:03:12.190> we<00:03:12.640> cut<00:03:12.910> it<00:03:13.060> and<00:03:13.270> then<00:03:13.750> we<00:03:13.900> put

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
pull it down I we cut it and then we put

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.320 
pull it down I we cut it and then we put
it<00:03:14.200> we<00:03:14.380> reconstructed<00:03:15.010> together<00:03:15.310> now<00:03:15.970> we<00:03:16.030> make

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
it we reconstructed together now we make

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.900 
it we reconstructed together now we make
a<00:03:16.360> new<00:03:16.720> hole<00:03:16.750> for<00:03:17.740> the<00:03:17.770> umbilicus<00:03:18.400> to<00:03:18.580> come<00:03:18.760> out

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
a new hole for the umbilicus to come out

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.760 
a new hole for the umbilicus to come out
right<00:03:19.360> now<00:03:19.570> have<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.780> belly<00:03:19.960> button<00:03:20.140> back<00:03:20.530> in

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
right now have the belly button back in

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.400 
right now have the belly button back in
its<00:03:21.190> original<00:03:21.310> place<00:03:21.760> but<00:03:22.210> of<00:03:22.360> course<00:03:22.630> you

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
its original place but of course you

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.590 
its original place but of course you
know<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.770> extra<00:03:24.160> skin<00:03:24.370> is<00:03:24.520> gone<00:03:24.730> I<00:03:24.970> was<00:03:25.480> going

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
know the extra skin is gone I was going

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.630 
know the extra skin is gone I was going
to<00:03:25.690> say<00:03:25.870> because<00:03:26.080> now<00:03:26.950> if<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.340> skin<00:03:27.610> is

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
to say because now if the skin is

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.730 
to say because now if the skin is
stretched<00:03:28.210> down<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.810> belly<00:03:29.020> button<00:03:29.230> needs<00:03:29.530> to

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
stretched down the belly button needs to

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.620 
stretched down the belly button needs to
pop<00:03:30.010> up<00:03:30.040> somewhere<00:03:30.370> exact<00:03:31.120> and<00:03:31.390> so<00:03:31.570> you

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
pop up somewhere exact and so you

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.410 
pop up somewhere exact and so you
redefine<00:03:32.350> redeposition<00:03:33.250> based<00:03:34.180> on<00:03:34.330> the

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
redefine redeposition based on the

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.640 
redefine redeposition based on the
amount<00:03:34.630> of<00:03:34.840> skin<00:03:35.080> that<00:03:35.110> you've<00:03:35.350> stretched

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
amount of skin that you've stretched

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.350 
amount of skin that you've stretched
down<00:03:35.860> absolutely<00:03:36.610> I<00:03:36.640> want<00:03:36.820> to<00:03:36.880> go<00:03:36.970> back<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:37.330> the

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
down absolutely I want to go back to the

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.090 
down absolutely I want to go back to the
point<00:03:37.690> where<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:37.900> talked<00:03:38.110> about<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.530> muscle

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
point where you talked about the muscle

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.170 
point where you talked about the muscle
so<00:03:40.410> basically<00:03:41.410> when<00:03:41.590> you<00:03:41.620> detach<00:03:42.520> the<00:03:42.850> skin

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
so basically when you detach the skin

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.070 
so basically when you detach the skin
you<00:03:44.170> make<00:03:44.380> sure<00:03:44.590> that<00:03:44.770> there's<00:03:45.190> no<00:03:46.080> connection

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
you make sure that there's no connection

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.380 
you make sure that there's no connection
between<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:47.890> skin<00:03:48.130> and<00:03:48.190> the<00:03:48.340> muscle<00:03:48.580> all<00:03:48.970> the

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
between the skin and the muscle all the

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.750 
between the skin and the muscle all the
way<00:03:49.510> up<00:03:49.750> to<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.930> chest<00:03:50.260> area<00:03:50.580> absolutely<00:03:51.580> what

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
way up to the chest area absolutely what

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.790 
way up to the chest area absolutely what
happens<00:03:52.150> if<00:03:52.300> you<00:03:52.390> don't<00:03:52.600> do<00:03:52.750> that<00:03:52.780> well<00:03:53.500> what

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
happens if you don't do that well what

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.410 
happens if you don't do that well what
happens<00:03:54.100> if<00:03:54.220> you<00:03:54.310> don't<00:03:54.430> do<00:03:54.610> that<00:03:54.790> first<00:03:55.120> we

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
happens if you don't do that first we

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.440 
happens if you don't do that first we
cannot<00:03:55.660> pull<00:03:56.050> the<00:03:56.650> skin<00:03:57.010> down<00:03:57.070> right<00:03:57.940> as<00:03:58.120> much

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
cannot pull the skin down right as much

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.479 
cannot pull the skin down right as much
as<00:03:58.600> we<00:03:58.750> should<00:03:58.780> and<00:03:59.320> then<00:03:59.920> if<00:04:00.010> you<00:04:00.130> don't<00:04:00.250> pull

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
as we should and then if you don't pull

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.790 
as we should and then if you don't pull
it<00:04:00.520> enough<00:04:00.910> we<00:04:01.570> cut<00:04:01.840> whatever<00:04:02.050> we<00:04:02.380> have<00:04:02.560> and

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
it enough we cut whatever we have and

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.040 
it enough we cut whatever we have and
then<00:04:02.890> we<00:04:02.980> stated<00:04:03.220> after<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:04.540> month<00:04:04.870> or<00:04:04.989> two

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
then we stated after a month or two

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.050 
then we stated after a month or two
there<00:04:05.560> was<00:04:05.680> beast<00:04:05.920> a<00:04:06.040> little<00:04:06.340> bit<00:04:06.459> laxity<00:04:06.850> left

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
there was beast a little bit laxity left

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.090 
there was beast a little bit laxity left
right<00:04:07.420> so<00:04:07.690> it's<00:04:07.810> not<00:04:07.900> tight<00:04:08.230> anymore<00:04:08.260> right

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
right so it's not tight anymore right

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.180 
right so it's not tight anymore right
the<00:04:09.430> second<00:04:09.880> of<00:04:10.030> that<00:04:10.209> if<00:04:10.480> we<00:04:10.660> need<00:04:10.870> to

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
the second of that if we need to

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.740 
the second of that if we need to
reconstruct<00:04:12.190> and<00:04:12.610> tighten<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.270> muscle<00:04:13.600> I

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
reconstruct and tighten the muscle I

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.930 
reconstruct and tighten the muscle I
need<00:04:14.170> to<00:04:14.320> free<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.860> subcutaneous<00:04:15.190> tissue<00:04:15.790> the

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
need to free the subcutaneous tissue the

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.120 
need to free the subcutaneous tissue the
fat<00:04:16.150> from<00:04:16.359> it<00:04:16.570> then<00:04:17.080> I<00:04:17.109> have<00:04:17.290> only<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:17.770> muscles

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
fat from it then I have only the muscles

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.099 
fat from it then I have only the muscles
visible<00:04:18.640> in<00:04:18.730> front<00:04:19.030> of<00:04:19.180> me<00:04:19.330> and<00:04:19.540> then<00:04:19.660> I<00:04:19.810> start

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
visible in front of me and then I start

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.200 
visible in front of me and then I start
to<00:04:20.230> suture<00:04:20.890> them<00:04:21.190> bring<00:04:21.459> them<00:04:21.609> together<00:04:21.790> and

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
to suture them bring them together and

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.909 
to suture them bring them together and
that<00:04:22.690> would<00:04:22.900> give<00:04:22.930> you<00:04:23.200> the<00:04:23.260> strength<00:04:23.650> of<00:04:23.890> your

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
that would give you the strength of your

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.540 
that would give you the strength of your
abdomen<00:04:24.600> so<00:04:25.800> like<00:04:26.800> doctors<00:04:27.130> are<00:04:27.250> here<00:04:27.400> we're

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
abdomen so like doctors are here we're

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.240 
abdomen so like doctors are here we're
saying<00:04:27.760> it's<00:04:27.940> a<00:04:28.000> three-part<00:04:28.660> process<00:04:29.250> you

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
saying it's a three-part process you

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.760 
saying it's a three-part process you
actually<00:04:30.669> redefine<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:32.080> muscles<00:04:32.560> as<00:04:32.740> well

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
actually redefine the muscles as well

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.980 
actually redefine the muscles as well
pull<00:04:33.460> them<00:04:33.640> in<00:04:33.790> together<00:04:33.970> so<00:04:34.630> there's<00:04:34.810> not

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
pull them in together so there's not

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.620 
pull them in together so there's not
just<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.740> skin<00:04:36.130> being<00:04:36.730> pulled<00:04:37.120> down<00:04:37.360> there's

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
just the skin being pulled down there's

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.560 
just the skin being pulled down there's
a<00:04:37.690> lot<00:04:37.840> more<00:04:37.890> complexity<00:04:38.890> to<00:04:38.919> it<00:04:39.360> we<00:04:40.360> talked

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
a lot more complexity to it we talked

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.320 
a lot more complexity to it we talked
about<00:04:40.720> who's<00:04:41.230> the<00:04:41.919> right<00:04:42.070> candidate<00:04:42.790> you

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
about who's the right candidate you

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.000 
about who's the right candidate you
talked<00:04:43.570> about<00:04:43.660> people<00:04:44.169> who<00:04:44.410> have<00:04:44.770> lost

talked about people who have lost

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.100 
talked about people who have lost
substantial<00:04:45.430> weight<00:04:46.210> yeah

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
substantial weight yeah

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
distribution is in their trunk mainly in

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.480 
distribution is in their trunk mainly in
the<00:05:13.180> abdomen<00:05:13.510> area<00:05:13.810> and<00:05:14.080> the<00:05:14.170> flanks<00:05:14.560> now<00:05:15.190> they

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
the abdomen area and the flanks now they

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.580 
the abdomen area and the flanks now they
have<00:05:15.640> two<00:05:15.880> problems<00:05:16.240> one<00:05:16.720> of<00:05:16.780> them<00:05:17.080> is<00:05:17.230> the<00:05:17.410> fat

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
have two problems one of them is the fat

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.260 
have two problems one of them is the fat
deposit<00:05:18.070> there<00:05:18.250> they're<00:05:18.490> trying<00:05:18.730> to<00:05:18.880> do<00:05:19.000> some

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
deposit there they're trying to do some

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.060 
deposit there they're trying to do some
diet<00:05:19.570> and<00:05:19.870> there's<00:05:19.990> some<00:05:20.230> stubborn<00:05:20.530> fat<00:05:20.860> as

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
diet and there's some stubborn fat as

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.610 
diet and there's some stubborn fat as
well<00:05:21.250> but<00:05:21.910> the<00:05:22.360> amount<00:05:22.720> of<00:05:22.870> the<00:05:23.020> fat<00:05:23.260> if<00:05:23.470> it's

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
well but the amount of the fat if it's

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.950 
well but the amount of the fat if it's
little<00:05:23.950> bit<00:05:24.070> slightly<00:05:24.340> higher<00:05:24.850> than<00:05:25.210> what

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
little bit slightly higher than what

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.330 
little bit slightly higher than what
happened<00:05:26.350> this<00:05:26.530> skin<00:05:27.100> will<00:05:27.250> stretch

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
happened this skin will stretch

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.240 
happened this skin will stretch
automatically<00:05:28.300> now<00:05:28.930> such<00:05:29.470> a<00:05:29.500> candidate<00:05:30.040> what

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
automatically now such a candidate what

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.330 
automatically now such a candidate what
we<00:05:30.400> do<00:05:30.580> normally<00:05:31.120> we<00:05:31.270> as<00:05:31.510> we<00:05:32.110> advise<00:05:32.830> them<00:05:33.100> for

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
we do normally we as we advise them for

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.040 
we do normally we as we advise them for
we're<00:05:33.550> going<00:05:33.700> to<00:05:33.760> do<00:05:33.850> journalize<00:05:34.270> liposuction

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
we're going to do journalize liposuction

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.620 
we're going to do journalize liposuction
and<00:05:35.430> then<00:05:36.430> with<00:05:36.700> the<00:05:36.820> newer<00:05:37.000> method<00:05:37.510> of

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
and then with the newer method of

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.540 
and then with the newer method of
liposuction<00:05:38.110> their<00:05:38.500> likelihood<00:05:38.890> of<00:05:39.130> them<00:05:39.310> of

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
liposuction their likelihood of them of

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.160 
liposuction their likelihood of them of
the<00:05:39.850> skin<00:05:40.150> growth<00:05:40.300> chart<00:05:40.600> is<00:05:40.750> much<00:05:40.930> better

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.170 
the skin growth chart is much better

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.050 
the skin growth chart is much better
than<00:05:41.350> before<00:05:41.410> right<00:05:42.130> but<00:05:42.520> there<00:05:42.670> is<00:05:42.700> a<00:05:42.820> small

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
than before right but there is a small

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.350 
than before right but there is a small
percentage<00:05:43.600> that<00:05:43.660> the<00:05:44.850> actually<00:05:45.850> skin<00:05:46.180> does

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
percentage that the actually skin does

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.990 
percentage that the actually skin does
not<00:05:46.410> recall<00:05:47.410> very<00:05:47.710> well<00:05:47.920> and<00:05:48.130> if<00:05:48.580> it<00:05:48.730> doesn't

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
not recall very well and if it doesn't

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.640 
not recall very well and if it doesn't
recall<00:05:49.240> very<00:05:49.420> one<00:05:49.690> they<00:05:49.900> might<00:05:50.080> need<00:05:50.200> a<00:05:50.320> tummy

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
recall very one they might need a tummy

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.870 
recall very one they might need a tummy
tuck<00:05:50.740> now<00:05:51.130> there<00:05:51.820> might<00:05:52.090> be<00:05:52.120> a<00:05:52.330> candidate<00:05:52.840> for
