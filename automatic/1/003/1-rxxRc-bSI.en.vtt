00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.960

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.329
 so I decided to take away a peek 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.519
 a little what happens are three days 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.739
 very funny because there are reviews 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.649
 joe insect workshop of course 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.950
 music from the 70s 80s therefore definitely 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.110
 vinyls only vinyls and above all many 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.970
 accessories and lots of clothes definitely 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.420
 very glamorous 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.420
 Let's check 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.700
 the first to host co2 otherwise we finish 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.970
 but in those days they are like veronica 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.940
 brown is not very good 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.159
 napoli styling investigation has seen tones 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.760
 we miss 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.800
 I was not 5 years old 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.770
 in conclusion 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.540
 of how many friends 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.320
 a small bag 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.260
 always at the maximum 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.960
 well clear 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.020
 the list of Goranians obviously missed and 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.000
 earrings no 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.060
 we completed everything with a shoe 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.200
 in the 50s style although in reality it is a 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.599
 more recent because it was an 80s 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.910
 nice to mix a background too 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.410
 let's say that for the 50's the lace 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.720
 as well as those at the collegiate were 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.430
 a bit of a classic yes absolutely yes ai 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.769
 vices that embroider 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.500
 and in any case the three gowns and dresses 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.350
 accolades that then go to those 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.510
 dramatic in this case 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.430
 but glasses a little more gritty dress 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.410

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.760
 trunk he returns from 1890 before I was 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.610
 looking for some news on the net 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.410

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.810
 most searched word party was own 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.340
 vintage a French term that 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.190
 originally it was used for 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.390
 refer to vintage wines then arrived in 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.030
 common use case instead for 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.480
 clothing and accessories no longer in 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.680
 production for this very rare and 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.680
 in short, prestige charm 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.140
 well now to the fifties we do 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.610
 a leap forward over the years 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.610
 with a lot of change 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.780
 ie 80 years of such a beautiful goggle a 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.880
