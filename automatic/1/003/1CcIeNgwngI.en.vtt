00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
point but i still feel like it's

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.790 
point but i still feel like it's
stronger<00:03:34.120> against<00:03:34.300> wind<00:03:34.600> ups<00:03:34.720> because<00:03:35.320> priest

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
stronger against wind ups because priest

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.590 
stronger against wind ups because priest

powerful very strong very swarm like it
does<00:05:32.439> lose<00:05:32.650> two<00:05:32.800> dimensional<00:05:33.279> fissure<00:05:33.400> in

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
does lose two dimensional fissure in

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.339 
does lose two dimensional fissure in
macro<00:05:33.909> if<00:05:34.090> they<00:05:34.240> can't<00:05:34.449> get<00:05:34.749> it<00:05:34.840> off<00:05:34.930> the<00:05:35.080> board

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:35.349 
macro if they can't get it off the board

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:38.339
