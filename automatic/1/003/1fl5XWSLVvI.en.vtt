00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.250 
that hand before you bring it right back
up<00:03:03.010> now<00:03:03.819> it's<00:03:03.969> really<00:03:04.239> easy<00:03:04.480> to<00:03:04.629> try<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:04.930> choose

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
up now it's really easy to try to choose

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.929 
up now it's really easy to try to choose
a<00:03:05.290> weight<00:03:05.590> that's<00:03:05.620> too<00:03:06.069> heavy<00:03:06.340> that<00:03:06.459> you<00:03:06.670> can't

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:06.939 
a weight that's too heavy that you can't

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.119 
a weight that's too heavy that you can't
control<00:03:07.329> you<00:03:07.959> can't<00:03:08.230> get<00:03:08.439> a<00:03:08.469> full<00:03:08.739> range<00:03:09.040> of

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
control you can't get a full range of

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.160 
control you can't get a full range of
motion<00:03:09.340> on<00:03:09.639> so<00:03:09.879> make<00:03:10.120> sure<00:03:10.150> you<00:03:10.540> pick<00:03:10.719> a<00:03:10.780> weight

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
motion on so make sure you pick a weight

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.899 
motion on so make sure you pick a weight
that's<00:03:11.200> actually<00:03:11.739> light<00:03:11.950> enough<00:03:12.219> that<00:03:12.430> you

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:12.909 
that's actually light enough that you

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.550 
that's actually light enough that you
can<00:03:13.060> comfortably<00:03:13.510> get<00:03:13.719> a<00:03:13.780> full<00:03:14.139> range<00:03:14.379> of

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
can comfortably get a full range of

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.199 
can comfortably get a full range of
motion<00:03:14.680> out<00:03:14.950> of<00:03:14.980> that<00:03:15.099> shoulder<00:03:15.370> you<00:03:15.969> want<00:03:16.120> to

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.290 

go<00:05:58.330> ahead<00:05:58.449> and<00:05:58.539> get<00:05:58.629> ready

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.230 

and<00:06:01.960> begin<00:06:02.470> now<00:06:03.160> this<00:06:03.310> is<00:06:03.400> a<00:06:03.430> cross<00:06:03.730> between<00:06:03.970> a

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
and begin now this is a cross between a

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.510 
and begin now this is a cross between a
mountain<00:06:04.570> climber<00:06:05.020> and<00:06:05.320> burpees<00:06:05.800> so<00:06:06.400> you're

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
mountain climber and burpees so you're

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.370 
mountain climber and burpees so you're
gonna<00:06:06.610> drop<00:06:06.880> down<00:06:07.060> to<00:06:07.180> the<00:06:07.270> ground<00:06:07.330> do<00:06:07.900> five

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
gonna drop down to the ground do five

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.290 
gonna drop down to the ground do five
repetitions<00:06:08.740> of<00:06:09.400> a<00:06:09.580> regular<00:06:09.970> mountain

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
repetitions of a regular mountain

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.700 
repetitions of a regular mountain
climber<00:06:10.540> and<00:06:10.750> then<00:06:10.870> you<00:06:10.960> stand<00:06:11.290> up<00:06:11.470> like<00:06:11.620> you

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
climber and then you stand up like you

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.380 
climber and then you stand up like you
would<00:06:11.890> for<00:06:12.040> a<00:06:12.070> Burpee<00:06:12.430> and<00:06:12.550> then<00:06:12.850> drop<00:06:13.150> right

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390 
would for a Burpee and then drop right

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:14.970 
would for a Burpee and then drop right
back<00:06:13.600> down<00:06:13.810> into<00:06:14.050> those<00:06:14.200> mountain<00:06:14.620> climbers

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980 
back down into those mountain climbers

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.620 
back down into those mountain climbers
now<00:06:15.490> the<00:06:15.550> reason<00:06:15.910> why<00:06:16.000> we're<00:06:16.180> doing<00:06:16.270> an<00:06:16.450> odd

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
now the reason why we're doing an odd

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.330 
now the reason why we're doing an odd
number<00:06:17.050> of<00:06:17.080> leg<00:06:17.320> motions<00:06:17.740> on<00:06:17.860> those<00:06:17.980> mountain

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
number of leg motions on those mountain

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.800 
number of leg motions on those mountain
climbers<00:06:18.670> is<00:06:18.790> because<00:06:19.060> every<00:06:19.390> single<00:06:19.630> time<00:06:19.780> we

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
climbers is because every single time we

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.870 
climbers is because every single time we
come<00:06:20.080> back<00:06:20.200> down<00:06:20.470> you<00:06:21.070> want<00:06:21.250> to<00:06:21.310> start<00:06:21.640> with

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
come back down you want to start with

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.420 
come back down you want to start with
the<00:06:22.000> opposite<00:06:22.510> leg<00:06:22.750> forward<00:06:23.160> so<00:06:24.160> it's<00:06:24.310> gonna

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
the opposite leg forward so it's gonna

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.080 
the opposite leg forward so it's gonna
be<00:06:24.640> one<00:06:25.090> two<00:06:25.570> three<00:06:25.710> four<00:06:26.710> five<00:06:27.190> and<00:06:27.430> up<00:06:27.610> other

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
be one two three four five and up other

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.290 
be one two three four five and up other
leg<00:06:28.330> forward<00:06:28.630> and<00:06:28.930> one<00:06:29.020> two<00:06:29.740> three<00:06:30.040> four<00:06:30.790> five

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300 
leg forward and one two three four five

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.780 
leg forward and one two three four five
and<00:06:31.540> up<00:06:31.720> back<00:06:32.140> to<00:06:32.290> the<00:06:32.380> original<00:06:32.740> leg<00:06:32.890> one<00:06:33.370> two
