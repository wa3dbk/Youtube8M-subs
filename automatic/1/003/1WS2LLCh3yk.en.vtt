here<00:00:00.780> we're<00:00:00.960> looking<00:00:00.989> at<00:00:02.030> ETA<00:00:03.080> 2830<00:00:04.080> 6-2<00:00:05.240> it's

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
here we're looking at ETA 2830 6-2 it's

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.310 
here we're looking at ETA 2830 6-2 it's
a<00:00:06.509> very<00:00:06.839> new<00:00:07.790> movement<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:09.000> just<00:00:09.540> put<00:00:10.050> it<00:00:10.170> back

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
a very new movement I just put it back

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.220 
a very new movement I just put it back
after<00:00:10.590> doing<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.550> cleaning<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.230> after

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
after doing the cleaning and after

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.950 
after doing the cleaning and after
putting<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.710> back<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:14.099> was<00:00:14.340> having<00:00:14.370> issue<00:00:14.960> with

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
putting it back I was having issue with

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.810 
putting it back I was having issue with
a<00:00:15.990> winding<00:00:16.529> system<00:00:17.660> basically<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:19.820> clutch

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
a winding system basically the clutch

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.060 
a winding system basically the clutch
wheel<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.769> it<00:00:22.769> wasn't<00:00:23.660> it<00:00:24.660> wasn't<00:00:25.070> emerging

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
wheel and it wasn't it wasn't emerging

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.060 
wheel and it wasn't it wasn't emerging
with<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.550> winding<00:00:27.090> pinion<00:00:27.710> so<00:00:28.710> while<00:00:28.920> you

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
with the a winding pinion so while you

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.439 
with the a winding pinion so while you
see<00:00:29.250> what<00:00:29.460> I'm<00:00:29.550> doing<00:00:29.760> right<00:00:29.880> now<00:00:29.939> we<00:00:30.090> show<00:00:30.390> you

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
see what I'm doing right now we show you

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.490 
see what I'm doing right now we show you
how<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.900> solve<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.439> problem<00:00:32.420> in<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.630> what<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.410> a

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
how to solve that problem in a what in a

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.350 
how to solve that problem in a what in a
movement<00:00:34.710> like<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.160> first<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.059> have<00:00:36.329> to

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
movement like this first you have to

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.450 
movement like this first you have to
remove<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.110> keyless<00:00:37.469> work<00:00:37.710> or<00:00:37.950> what<00:00:38.340> they

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
remove the keyless work or what they

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.330 
remove the keyless work or what they
call<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.730> setting<00:00:39.180> level<00:00:39.510> jumper<00:00:42.920> I'm<00:00:43.920> really

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
call the setting level jumper I'm really

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.220 
call the setting level jumper I'm really
I<00:00:44.550> remove<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.090> setting<00:00:45.600> level<00:00:45.960> jumper<00:00:46.410> and

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
I remove the setting level jumper and

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.600 
I remove the setting level jumper and
then<00:00:49.230> what<00:00:49.500> we<00:00:49.680> look<00:00:49.950> under<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.789> lot<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.809> is

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
then what we look under a lot of that is

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.670 
then what we look under a lot of that is
the<00:00:53.610> level<00:00:53.879> clutch<00:00:54.329> return<00:00:54.840> or<00:00:55.170> what<00:00:55.530> they

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
the level clutch return or what they

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.549 
the level clutch return or what they
call<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.190> yoke<00:00:56.489> pin<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.210> then<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.379> other

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
call the yoke pin and then the other

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.219 
call the yoke pin and then the other
part<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.309> below<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:01.620> stem<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
part that is below the the stem is the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.789 
part that is below the the stem is the
the<00:01:04.229> set<00:01:04.530> level<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.820> basically<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.530> main

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
the set level so basically the main

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.600 
the set level so basically the main
issue<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.659> not<00:01:09.659> having<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.320> clutch<00:01:11.010> way<00:01:11.400> of

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
issue of not having that clutch way of

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.420 
issue of not having that clutch way of
engaging<00:01:11.880> with<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.630> winding<00:01:13.229> pinion<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:14.070> that

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
engaging with the winding pinion is that

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.890 
engaging with the winding pinion is that
the<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.890> level<00:01:17.369> clutch<00:01:17.640> return<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.689> job

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
the the level clutch return of the job

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.490 
the the level clutch return of the job
or<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.140> job<00:01:19.320> pin<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:20.310> not<00:01:20.930> touching<00:01:21.930> all<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
or the job pin is not touching all the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.469 
or the job pin is not touching all the
way<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:23.060> into<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> winding<00:01:24.659> opinion<00:01:26.240> so<00:01:27.240> what

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
way in into the winding opinion so what

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.050 
way in into the winding opinion so what
I'm<00:01:27.570> doing<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:27.900> right<00:01:28.080> now<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.640> just<00:01:29.640> showing

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
I'm doing this right now is just showing

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.170 
I'm doing this right now is just showing
you<00:01:30.270> back<00:01:30.530> what<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.560> did<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.310> what<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.759> find

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
you back what I did and what that I find

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.020 
you back what I did and what that I find
out<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.750> know<00:01:33.869> after<00:01:34.560> many<00:01:35.130> hours<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.670> figure

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
out you know after many hours of figure

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.649 
out you know after many hours of figure
it<00:01:36.060> out<00:01:37.759> I'm<00:01:38.759> putting<00:01:39.090> back<00:01:39.240> again<00:01:39.509> the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
it out I'm putting back again the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.929 
it out I'm putting back again the
keyless<00:01:40.290> work<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.740> setting<00:01:41.070> la<00:01:41.220> setting

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
keyless work the setting la setting

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:49.219 
keyless work the setting la setting
level<00:01:42.299> jumper<00:01:45.829> okay<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.299> as<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.600> can<00:01:48.720> see<00:01:49.020> I

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
level jumper okay and as you can see I

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.120 
level jumper okay and as you can see I
put<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:50.329> I<00:01:51.329> pull<00:01:52.049> all<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.409> way<00:01:52.439> back<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:52.799> I

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
put the the I pull all the way back so I

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.499 
put the the I pull all the way back so I
can<00:01:53.460> set<00:01:53.700> up<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:55.460> mechanism<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.299> hour

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
can set up the mechanism to the hour

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.450 
can set up the mechanism to the hour
setting<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.469> way<00:01:58.619> it's<00:01:58.979> easier<00:01:59.280> for<00:01:59.310> me

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
setting so that way it's easier for me

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.530 
setting so that way it's easier for me
to<00:01:59.579> set<00:01:59.909> up<00:02:00.049> so<00:02:01.049> I'm<00:02:01.170> tying<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.860> down<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:03.240> far

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
to set up so I'm tying it it down so far

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.529 
to set up so I'm tying it it down so far
so<00:02:03.869> good<00:02:03.899> everything<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.950> engaged<00:02:06.439> the

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
so good everything is engaged the

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.869 
so good everything is engaged the
setting<00:02:09.539> level<00:02:09.840> jumper<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.440> right<00:02:10.679> now<00:02:10.860> on<00:02:11.190> top

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
setting level jumper is right now on top

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:22.699 
setting level jumper is right now on top
of<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:17.430> correct<00:02:17.790> level<00:02:19.190> but<00:02:21.709> not

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
of the the the correct level but not

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.890 
of the the the correct level but not
working<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:23.580> I'm<00:02:23.879> going<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.360> show<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:24.569> you<00:02:24.870> see
