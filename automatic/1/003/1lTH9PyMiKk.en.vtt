00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
on the graphic the weren't free channels

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.760 
on the graphic the weren't free channels
all<00:00:40.240> independent<00:00:40.660> before

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
all independent before

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.460 
all independent before
because<00:00:42.550> you<00:00:42.640> only<00:00:42.820> had<00:00:43.120> a<00:00:43.260> 6.7<00:00:44.260> stop<00:00:44.620> range

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
because you only had a 6.7 stop range

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.060 
because you only had a 6.7 stop range
all<00:00:45.830> the<00:00:46.040> heads<00:00:46.250> smooth<00:00:46.880> within<00:00:47.240> that

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
all the heads smooth within that

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.810 
all the heads smooth within that
okay<00:00:48.910> so<00:00:49.329> that<00:00:49.570> if<00:00:49.750> you<00:00:49.960> had<00:00:50.489> heading<00:00:51.489> channel

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
okay so that if you had heading channel

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.600 
okay so that if you had heading channel
3<00:00:52.410> generally<00:00:53.410> that<00:00:53.590> was<00:00:53.770> the<00:00:54.070> one<00:00:54.220> that<00:00:54.400> wasn't

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
3 generally that was the one that wasn't

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.190 
3 generally that was the one that wasn't
linked<00:00:55.000> to<00:00:55.090> the<00:00:55.180> color<00:00:55.360> temperature<00:00:55.600> control

all<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.870> independent<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:01.920> go

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
all the independent so you can go

the<00:01:51.189> last<00:01:51.369> 30<00:01:51.610> years<00:01:51.759> okay<00:01:52.390> so<00:01:52.750> if<00:01:52.840> you<00:01:52.960> have

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
the last 30 years okay so if you have

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.929 
the last 30 years okay so if you have
kids<00:01:53.380> from<00:01:53.409> 30<00:01:53.710> years<00:01:53.950> ago<00:01:54.070> it<00:01:54.549> was<00:01:54.700> still

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
kids from 30 years ago it was still

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:55.680 
kids from 30 years ago it was still
silver<00:01:55.149> from<00:01:55.390> you

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
silver from you

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.370 
silver from you
back<00:01:55.840> okay<00:01:56.410> see<00:01:56.860> I<00:01:57.190> guess<00:01:57.700> now<00:01:58.180> to<00:01:59.140> achieve

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
back okay see I guess now to achieve

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.750 
back okay see I guess now to achieve
these<00:01:59.500> new<00:01:59.650> numbers<00:01:59.920> for<00:02:00.070> like<00:02:00.310> say<00:02:00.430> for<00:02:00.460> flash

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
these new numbers for like say for flash

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.370 
these new numbers for like say for flash
duration<00:02:00.910> do<00:02:01.240> you<00:02:01.300> need<00:02:01.450> any<00:02:01.600> new<00:02:01.750> as<00:02:02.080> a<00:02:02.140> light

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
duration do you need any new as a light

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.350 
duration do you need any new as a light
modifiers<00:02:02.800> or<00:02:03.040> those<00:02:03.550> specific<00:02:03.970> pages<00:02:04.120> can<00:02:04.270> be

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
modifiers or those specific pages can be

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.730 
modifiers or those specific pages can be
realized<00:02:04.750> with<00:02:04.900> all<00:02:05.050> existing<00:02:05.170> like<00:02:05.590> more

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
realized with all existing like more

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.850 
realized with all existing like more
offices<00:02:06.040> yeah<00:02:06.280> difference<00:02:06.940> there

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
offices yeah difference there

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.620 
offices yeah difference there
as<00:02:08.100> far<00:02:08.280> as<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.520> specs<00:02:08.820> concern<00:02:09.210> is<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.509> is

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
as far as the specs concern is it is

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.820 
as far as the specs concern is it is
internal<00:02:10.170> circuitry<00:02:10.530> issue<00:02:10.740> which

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
sorry and it so this figure the power

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.890 
sorry and it so this figure the power
thing<00:03:44.450> all<00:03:45.370> right<00:03:46.370> so<00:03:46.700> bad<00:03:46.940> okay<00:03:47.269> no<00:03:47.510> sounds

thing all right so bad okay no sounds
good<00:03:48.080> I<00:03:48.349> guess<00:03:48.769> and<00:03:48.920> then<00:03:49.010> what<00:03:49.220> about<00:03:49.310> price

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
good I guess and then what about price

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.610 
good I guess and then what about price
difference<00:03:49.909> like<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.510> prices<00:03:51.200> you<00:03:51.230> gave<00:03:51.470> me

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
difference like the prices you gave me

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.460 
difference like the prices you gave me
were<00:03:51.769> they<00:03:51.920> more<00:03:52.159> like<00:03:52.690> cinnamon<00:03:53.690> icing<00:03:54.140> piece

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
were they more like cinnamon icing piece

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.380 
were they more like cinnamon icing piece
I<00:03:54.590> guess<00:03:54.739> getting<00:03:55.040> an<00:03:55.519> S<00:03:55.670> model<00:03:56.060> versus<00:03:56.360> a

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
I guess getting an S model versus a

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.720 
I guess getting an S model versus a
regular<00:03:56.450> model<00:03:57.019> that<00:03:57.830> would<00:03:57.950> be<00:03:58.069> the<00:03:58.190> esposo

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
regular model that would be the esposo

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.080 
regular model that would be the esposo
my<00:03:58.819> quote<00:03:59.030> a<00:03:59.299> poke<00:04:00.489> center<00:04:01.489> figures<00:04:01.640> are<00:04:01.849> still

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
my quote a poke center figures are still

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.840 
my quote a poke center figures are still
going

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
going

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:09.140 
going
the<00:04:04.850> difference<00:04:05.660> between<00:04:05.870> an<00:04:06.230> AP<00:04:06.590> 4s

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
the difference between an AP 4s

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.590 
the difference between an AP 4s
ok<00:04:09.659> ah

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
ok ah

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.690 
ok ah
probably<00:04:11.050> about<00:04:11.230> it's<00:04:12.220> going<00:04:12.370> to<00:04:12.460> be<00:04:12.520> between

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
probably about it's going to be between

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.900 
probably about it's going to be between
about<00:04:12.790> 35

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
about 35

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.720 
about 35
also<00:04:14.570> is<00:04:14.720> no<00:04:15.020> great<00:04:15.290> difference<00:04:15.530> so<00:04:16.370> for<00:04:16.610> me

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
also is no great difference so for me

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.550 
also is no great difference so for me
that<00:04:16.760> yes<00:04:17.390> is<00:04:17.600> the<00:04:17.720> way<00:04:17.840> to<00:04:17.900> go<00:04:19.120> okay<00:04:20.120> excellent

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
that yes is the way to go okay excellent

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.470 
that yes is the way to go okay excellent
okay<00:04:21.560> well<00:04:21.769> sorry<00:04:22.610> what<00:04:22.790> is<00:04:22.820> your<00:04:23.000> name<00:04:23.120> my
