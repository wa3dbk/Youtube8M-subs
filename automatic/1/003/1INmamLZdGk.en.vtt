essential to give them UV and this bulb
will<00:00:45.899> certainly<00:00:46.260> do<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:47.309> does<00:00:47.610> come<00:00:47.969> in

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
will certainly do that it does come in

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.360 
will certainly do that it does come in
two<00:00:48.270> sizes<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:49.379> comes<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.860> one<00:00:49.950> hundred<00:00:50.280> and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
two sizes it comes in one hundred and

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.340 
two sizes it comes in one hundred and
sixty<00:00:50.730> watt<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.480> comes<00:00:51.719> in<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.989> hundred

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
sixty watt and it comes in a hundred

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.959 
sixty watt and it comes in a hundred
watt<00:00:52.559> one<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.250> things<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.550> want<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.789> point

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
watt one of the things I want to point

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.180 
watt one of the things I want to point
out<00:00:54.120> about<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.539> hundred<00:00:54.870> watt<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.860> it

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
out about the hundred watt is that it

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.500 
out about the hundred watt is that it
comes<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.379> eyes<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.190> very<00:00:59.430> similar<00:00:59.820> to

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
comes in a eyes that is very similar to

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.470 
comes in a eyes that is very similar to
a<00:01:00.539> basking<00:01:01.379> bulb<00:01:01.710> which<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.430> quite<00:01:02.850> unique<00:01:03.239> in

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
a basking bulb which is quite unique in

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.179 
a basking bulb which is quite unique in
the<00:01:03.600> industry<00:01:03.719> all<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.379> other<00:01:04.739> brands<00:01:05.159> that

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
the industry all the other brands that

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.670 
the industry all the other brands that
make<00:01:05.430> mercury<00:01:05.970> vapour<00:01:06.180> bulbs<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.900> hundred

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
make mercury vapour bulbs in hundred

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.429 
make mercury vapour bulbs in hundred
watt<00:01:07.890> make<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.760> into<00:01:08.970> much<00:01:09.180> larger<00:01:09.659> size<00:01:09.840> which

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
watt make it into much larger size which

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.170 
watt make it into much larger size which
is<00:01:10.650> something<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.280> would<00:01:11.490> be<00:01:11.549> about<00:01:11.880> this

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
is something that would be about this

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.499 
is something that would be about this
much<00:01:12.240> bigger<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.820> essentially<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.299> that

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
much bigger so essentially I like that

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.660 
much bigger so essentially I like that
because<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:16.259> unique<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.009> can<00:01:17.159> go<00:01:17.310> into<00:01:17.520> a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
because it's unique and it can go into a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.170 
because it's unique and it can go into a
little<00:01:17.939> smaller<00:01:18.270> dome<00:01:18.619> but<00:01:19.790> basically<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.820> want

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
little smaller dome but basically I want

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.800 
little smaller dome but basically I want
to<00:01:21.240> talk<00:01:21.450> about<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:22.080> particular<00:01:22.350> bulb<00:01:22.950> and

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
to talk about this particular bulb and

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.230 
to talk about this particular bulb and
the<00:01:24.810> 160<00:01:25.500> watt<00:01:25.710> should<00:01:26.040> definitely<00:01:26.820> go<00:01:27.000> in

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
the 160 watt should definitely go in

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.590 
the 160 watt should definitely go in
this<00:01:27.540> extra<00:01:28.500> deep<00:01:28.770> dome<00:01:29.100> made<00:01:29.790> by<00:01:30.060> zoomit

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
this extra deep dome made by zoomit

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.749 
this extra deep dome made by zoomit
that's<00:01:30.810> available<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.530> our<00:01:31.680> fixture<00:01:32.250> section

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
that's available in our fixture section

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.330 
that's available in our fixture section
on<00:01:32.880> our<00:01:32.909> website<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:34.409> 100<00:01:34.740> watt<00:01:34.829> could<00:01:35.070> go<00:01:35.189> in

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
on our website the 100 watt could go in

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.950 
on our website the 100 watt could go in
smaller<00:01:35.640> but<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.880> still<00:01:36.180> recommend<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.810> because

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
smaller but I still recommend it because

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.859 
smaller but I still recommend it because
it<00:01:37.140> sits<00:01:37.470> nice<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.100> deep<00:01:38.310> into<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.299> dome<00:01:39.540> and

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
it sits nice and deep into the dome and

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.480 
it sits nice and deep into the dome and
you<00:01:39.990> can<00:01:40.140> put<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.409> right<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> screen<00:01:40.979> top

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
you can put it right on the screen top

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.700 
you can put it right on the screen top
and<00:01:41.790> then<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.780> don't<00:01:42.960> have<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.350> worry<00:01:43.560> about

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
and then you don't have to worry about

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.740 
and then you don't have to worry about
the<00:01:43.950> bulb<00:01:44.159> touching<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:45.270> don't<00:01:45.450> have<00:01:45.630> to

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
the bulb touching you don't have to

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.210 
the bulb touching you don't have to
worry<00:01:45.899> about<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.200> animal<00:01:46.590> getting<00:01:46.770> too<00:01:46.950> close

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
worry about the animal getting too close

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.429 
worry about the animal getting too close
to<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.909> same<00:01:48.210> thing<00:01:48.450> with<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.659> 160<00:01:49.290> the

to it the same thing with the 160 the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.770 
to it the same thing with the 160 the
one<00:01:49.619> thing<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.979> don't<00:01:50.280> want<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.759> do<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.390> have

one thing you don't want to do is have
this<00:01:52.020> type<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.320> bulb<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.950> an<00:01:53.340> incorrect<00:01:53.729> dome

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
this type of bulb in an incorrect dome

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.569 
this type of bulb in an incorrect dome
put<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.110> on<00:01:55.229> top<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.500> your<00:01:55.619> screen<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.009> have<00:01:56.399> it

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
put it on top of your screen and have it

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.819 
put it on top of your screen and have it
just<00:01:56.610> barely<00:01:57.210> touching<00:01:57.780> or<00:01:57.930> close<00:01:58.649> to

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
just barely touching or close to

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.649 
just barely touching or close to
touching<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.310> metal<00:01:59.610> screen<00:01:59.909> because<00:02:00.450> what

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
touching that metal screen because what

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.470 
touching that metal screen because what
it<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.869> going<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.110> do

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
it is going to do

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.450 
it is going to do
it's<00:02:01.660> going<00:02:01.900> to<00:02:01.960> superheat<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.530> bulb<00:02:02.860> and<00:02:03.100> the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
it's going to superheat the bulb and the

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.710 
it's going to superheat the bulb and the
bulb<00:02:03.610> is<00:02:03.790> either<00:02:03.910> going<00:02:04.120> to<00:02:04.180> shut<00:02:04.360> on<00:02:04.480> and<00:02:04.690> a

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
bulb is either going to shut on and a

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.870 
bulb is either going to shut on and a
lot<00:02:04.840> more<00:02:04.900> than<00:02:05.320> supposed<00:02:05.710> to<00:02:05.860> or<00:02:06.010> simply<00:02:06.700> burn

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
lot more than supposed to or simply burn

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.630 
lot more than supposed to or simply burn
it<00:02:07.030> out<00:02:07.210> so<00:02:07.780> get<00:02:08.680> the<00:02:08.830> proper<00:02:09.190> fixture<00:02:09.550> if

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
it out so get the proper fixture if

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.680 
it out so get the proper fixture if
you're<00:02:09.760> going<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:09.940> get<00:02:10.060> this<00:02:10.240> type<00:02:10.390> of<00:02:10.420> ball

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
you're going to get this type of ball

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.320 
you're going to get this type of ball
now<00:02:11.470> um<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.460> other<00:02:12.550> thing<00:02:12.670> I<00:02:12.880> like<00:02:13.000> to<00:02:13.150> talk

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
now um the other thing I like to talk

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.180 
now um the other thing I like to talk
about<00:02:13.450> is<00:02:13.750> these<00:02:14.200> bulbs<00:02:14.650> have<00:02:14.830> excellent

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
about is these bulbs have excellent

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.180 
about is these bulbs have excellent
heating<00:02:15.640> potential<00:02:16.240> if<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.380> animals<00:02:17.770> within

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
heating potential if the animals within

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.340 
heating potential if the animals within
eight<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.670> ten<00:02:19.090> inches<00:02:19.300> you<00:02:19.900> can<00:02:20.080> definitely

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
eight to ten inches you can definitely

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.270 
eight to ten inches you can definitely
in<00:02:20.710> the<00:02:20.800> 164<00:02:21.520> sure<00:02:21.760> get<00:02:22.390> over<00:02:22.840> 100<00:02:23.410> degrees<00:02:23.980> so

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
in the 164 sure get over 100 degrees so

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.370 
in the 164 sure get over 100 degrees so
if<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.430> have<00:02:24.520> a<00:02:24.550> bearded<00:02:24.910> dragon<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.810> 160

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
if you have a bearded dragon the 160

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.820 
if you have a bearded dragon the 160
watt<00:02:26.560> is<00:02:26.800> great<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:28.270> 100<00:02:28.720> watt<00:02:28.870> is<00:02:29.170> is<00:02:29.440> also

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
watt is great the 100 watt is is also

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.250 
watt is great the 100 watt is is also
very<00:02:30.220> good<00:02:30.310> in<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:31.270> you<00:02:31.390> could<00:02:31.600> put<00:02:31.810> it<00:02:31.900> into

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
very good in that you could put it into

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.160 
very good in that you could put it into
enclosures<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:32.950> are<00:02:33.220> probably<00:02:33.760> 30<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.720> 40

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
enclosures that are probably 30 to 40

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.320 
enclosures that are probably 30 to 40
gallons<00:02:35.710> maybe<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.370> little<00:02:36.640> bigger<00:02:36.880> than<00:02:37.000> that

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
gallons maybe a little bigger than that

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.560 
gallons maybe a little bigger than that
um<00:02:38.250> if<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.460> don't<00:02:39.550> have<00:02:39.820> much<00:02:40.030> height<00:02:40.300> you

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
um if you don't have much height you

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.090 
um if you don't have much height you
definitely<00:02:40.990> want<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.140> go<00:02:41.290> hundred<00:02:41.680> watt<00:02:41.830> if

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
definitely want to go hundred watt if

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.360 
definitely want to go hundred watt if
you<00:02:42.580> if<00:02:42.970> you're<00:02:43.210> going<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.810> something<00:02:44.050> like<00:02:44.380> 18

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
you if you're going to something like 18

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.910 
you if you're going to something like 18
inches<00:02:45.400> high<00:02:45.940> or<00:02:46.270> over<00:02:46.660> you<00:02:46.900> absolutely<00:02:47.590> want

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
inches high or over you absolutely want

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.810 
inches high or over you absolutely want
to<00:02:47.980> go<00:02:48.100> with<00:02:48.330> 161<00:02:49.330> so<00:02:49.990> um<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:51.280> other<00:02:51.700> thing

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
to go with 161 so um the other thing

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.630 
to go with 161 so um the other thing
that<00:02:52.090> I<00:02:52.120> want<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.390> mention<00:02:52.750> is<00:02:53.080> that<00:02:53.550> there's<00:02:54.550> a

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
that I want to mention is that there's a

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.870 
that I want to mention is that there's a
difference<00:02:55.300> if<00:02:55.540> you<00:02:56.170> have<00:02:56.530> this<00:02:56.860> on<00:02:57.160> top<00:02:57.670> of

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
difference if you have this on top of

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.480 
difference if you have this on top of
your<00:02:58.030> cage<00:02:58.300> without<00:02:58.630> a<00:02:58.900> screen<00:02:59.350> and<00:02:59.680> if<00:03:00.370> you

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
your cage without a screen and if you

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.000 
your cage without a screen and if you
have<00:03:00.790> it<00:03:00.970> with<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:01.870> if<00:03:02.200> you<00:03:02.410> have<00:03:02.590> it<00:03:02.620> with<00:03:02.980> the

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
have it with it if you have it with the

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.650 
have it with it if you have it with the
screen<00:03:03.370> there's<00:03:03.640> a<00:03:03.700> variance<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.300> the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
screen there's a variance and the

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.949 
screen there's a variance and the
variance<00:03:05.110> is<00:03:05.290> simply<00:03:05.680> this<00:03:05.950> that<00:03:06.390> it<00:03:07.390> with<00:03:07.930> the

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
variance is simply this that it with the

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.820 
variance is simply this that it with the
screen<00:03:08.440> and<00:03:09.030> by<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.090> way<00:03:10.270> this<00:03:10.870> is<00:03:11.080> a<00:03:11.110> UV<00:03:11.350> meter

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
screen and by the way this is a UV meter

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.120 
screen and by the way this is a UV meter
it's<00:03:12.160> called<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.550> solar<00:03:12.790> meter<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:14.170> what<00:03:15.100> I

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
it's called the solar meter and what I

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.180 
it's called the solar meter and what I
use<00:03:15.550> this<00:03:15.730> for<00:03:16.030> is<00:03:16.300> basically<00:03:17.170> to<00:03:17.380> tell<00:03:17.590> us<00:03:17.770> how

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
use this for is basically to tell us how

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.190 
use this for is basically to tell us how
much<00:03:18.370> UV<00:03:18.880> that<00:03:19.090> we're<00:03:19.239> getting<00:03:19.390> so<00:03:19.720> at<00:03:19.900> about

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
much UV that we're getting so at about

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.199 
much UV that we're getting so at about
12<00:03:20.530> inches<00:03:20.770> we're<00:03:21.459> going<00:03:21.580> to<00:03:21.640> hit<00:03:21.820> somewhere

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
12 inches we're going to hit somewhere

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.010 
12 inches we're going to hit somewhere
around<00:03:22.300> 16<00:03:23.080> microwatts<00:03:23.770> now<00:03:24.750> that<00:03:25.750> probably

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
around 16 microwatts now that probably

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.620 
around 16 microwatts now that probably
doesn't<00:03:26.470> necessarily<00:03:27.160> make<00:03:27.340> much<00:03:27.610> sense<00:03:27.910> but

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
doesn't necessarily make much sense but

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.630 
doesn't necessarily make much sense but
let's<00:03:28.900> put<00:03:29.110> into<00:03:29.440> a<00:03:29.470> perspective<00:03:29.770> of<00:03:30.160> this<00:03:30.400> on

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
let's put into a perspective of this on

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.660 
let's put into a perspective of this on
a<00:03:31.450> sunny<00:03:32.140> day<00:03:32.260> in<00:03:32.800> the<00:03:32.950> middle<00:03:33.220> of<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.459> United

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
a sunny day in the middle of the United

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.120 
a sunny day in the middle of the United
States<00:03:33.880> you<00:03:34.600> might<00:03:34.840> get<00:03:35.020> a<00:03:35.050> hundred<00:03:35.620> and<00:03:35.770> fifty

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
States you might get a hundred and fifty

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.570 
States you might get a hundred and fifty
microwatts<00:03:36.670> of<00:03:36.850> UVB<00:03:37.239> okay<00:03:38.230> so<00:03:38.290> here<00:03:38.950> are<00:03:39.100> with

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
microwatts of UVB okay so here are with

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.820 
microwatts of UVB okay so here are with
the<00:03:39.760> screen<00:03:40.090> at<00:03:40.420> 12<00:03:40.959> inches<00:03:41.320> we're<00:03:41.530> getting

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
the screen at 12 inches we're getting
