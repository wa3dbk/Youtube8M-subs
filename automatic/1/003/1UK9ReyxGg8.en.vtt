00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
number two goldfish are orange in color

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.910 
number two goldfish are orange in color
instead<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.970> yellow<00:01:09.479> even<00:01:10.170> though<00:01:10.290> yellow<00:01:10.770> is

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
instead of yellow even though yellow is

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.010 
instead of yellow even though yellow is
actually<00:01:11.310> genetically<00:01:11.700> easier<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.720> breathe

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
actually genetically easier to breathe

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.600 
actually genetically easier to breathe
so<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.409> easier<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.830> get<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.130> color<00:01:14.340> yellow

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
so it's easier to get the color yellow

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.580 
so it's easier to get the color yellow
than<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.180> get<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.509> orange<00:01:15.960> gold<00:01:16.290> color

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
than it is to get the orange gold color

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.320 
than it is to get the orange gold color
that<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:16.860> see<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.610> reason<00:01:17.880> for<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.270> is

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
that we see and the reason for this is

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.140 
that we see and the reason for this is
that<00:01:18.500> yellow<00:01:19.500> was<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.920> Imperial<00:01:20.520> color<00:01:20.820> in

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
that yellow was the Imperial color in

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.810 
that yellow was the Imperial color in
China<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.740> was<00:01:22.950> forbidden<00:01:23.460> for<00:01:23.580> people

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
China so it was forbidden for people

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.609 
China so it was forbidden for people
outside<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.570> imperial<00:01:24.990> family<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.470> house

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
outside of the imperial family and house

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.310 
outside of the imperial family and house
or<00:01:25.860> whatever<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.390> keep<00:01:27.390> yellow<00:01:27.750> fish<00:01:28.049> they

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
or whatever to keep yellow fish they

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.219 
or whatever to keep yellow fish they
bred<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.799> orange<00:01:29.310> goldfish<00:01:30.180> if<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.630> will<00:01:30.900> so

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
bred the orange goldfish if you will so

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.380 
bred the orange goldfish if you will so
that's<00:01:31.409> why<00:01:31.650> there's<00:01:32.159> more<00:01:32.250> orange<00:01:32.820> goldfish

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
that's why there's more orange goldfish

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.670 
that's why there's more orange goldfish
than<00:01:33.630> there<00:01:33.750> are<00:01:33.780> yellow<00:01:34.140> even<00:01:34.500> though<00:01:34.590> it's

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
than there are yellow even though it's

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.760 
than there are yellow even though it's
easier<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.159> make<00:01:35.310> yellow<00:01:35.670> goldfish<00:01:36.770> number

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
easier to make yellow goldfish number

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.149 
easier to make yellow goldfish number
