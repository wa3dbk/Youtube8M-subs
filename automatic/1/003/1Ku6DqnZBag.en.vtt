so the feeling when you're in the car

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.520 
so the feeling when you're in the car
when<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.740> boost<00:01:34.980> kicks<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.990> it's<00:01:36.990> an<00:01:37.140> amazing

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
when that boost kicks in it's an amazing

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.590 
when that boost kicks in it's an amazing
feeling<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:38.040> really<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.700> pushes<00:01:39.450> your<00:01:39.540> head

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
feeling it really is it pushes your head

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.260 
feeling it really is it pushes your head
back<00:01:39.960> into<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.410> headrest<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:42.090> never

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
back into the headrest and you never

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.330 
back into the headrest and you never
want<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.510> to<00:01:42.570> stop<00:01:42.870> but<00:01:43.440> unfortunately<00:01:44.190> it

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
want it to stop but unfortunately it

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.670 
want it to stop but unfortunately it
does<00:01:44.580> and<00:01:44.930> you're<00:01:45.930> back<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.260> the<00:01:46.380> combustion

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
does and you're back to the combustion

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.020 
does and you're back to the combustion
engine<00:01:47.190> but<00:01:47.340> when<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.550> have<00:01:47.580> the<00:01:47.850> two

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
engine but when you have the two

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.790 
engine but when you have the two
combined<00:01:48.480> together<00:01:48.660> the<00:01:49.020> hybrid<00:01:49.440> and<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
combined together the hybrid and the

00:01:49.800 --> 00:02:05.040 
combined together the hybrid and the
combustion<00:01:50.130> it's<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.150> seriously<00:01:51.630> fast<00:01:51.900> car
