00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
of splitting of the measures but it's

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.740 
of splitting of the measures but it's
just<00:00:47.640> gonna<00:00:47.760> be<00:00:47.940> right<00:00:48.149> smack<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.629> middle

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
just gonna be right smack in the middle

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.830 
just gonna be right smack in the middle
so<00:00:49.110> for<00:00:49.320> playing<00:00:49.700> 1<00:00:50.700> &amp;<00:00:51.120> 2<00:00:52.910> so<00:00:53.910> it's<00:00:54.059> C<00:00:54.329> one<00:00:54.570> time

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
so for playing 1 &amp; 2 so it's C one time

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.090 
so for playing 1 &amp; 2 so it's C one time
and<00:00:55.620> G<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.039> next<00:00:56.280> time

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
and G the next time

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.050 
and G the next time
and<00:00:57.340> back<00:00:57.640> to<00:00:57.730> the<00:00:57.820> next<00:00:58.000> measure<00:00:58.410> see<00:01:00.000> okay<00:01:01.000> so

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.060 
and back to the next measure see okay so

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.640 
and back to the next measure see okay so
just<00:01:01.390> watch<00:01:01.630> where<00:01:01.840> the<00:01:01.960> cord<00:01:02.170> is<00:01:02.320> if<00:01:02.470> there's

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
just watch where the cord is if there's

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.079 
just watch where the cord is if there's
two<00:01:02.829> in<00:01:02.950> a<00:01:03.010> measure<00:01:03.220> then<00:01:03.790> you'll<00:01:03.970> be

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
two in a measure then you'll be

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.940 
two in a measure then you'll be
switching<00:01:04.390> in<00:01:04.690> the<00:01:04.989> middle<00:01:05.229> of<00:01:05.379> them<00:01:05.530> of<00:01:05.680> the

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
switching in the middle of them of the

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.740 
switching in the middle of them of the
measure<00:01:06.160> so<00:01:06.910> I'll<00:01:07.240> play<00:01:07.450> that<00:01:07.600> and<00:01:07.780> sing<00:01:07.990> it

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
measure so I'll play that and sing it

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:28.730 
measure so I'll play that and sing it
one<00:01:10.750> two<00:01:11.619> three

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.590 

a<00:01:28.829> little<00:01:29.460> bit<00:01:29.579> slower<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.150> can<00:01:30.299> play<00:01:30.450> that

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
a little bit slower so you can play that

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.289 
a little bit slower so you can play that
