and how kind of what range this thing

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.890 
and how kind of what range this thing
has<00:03:08.130> and<00:03:08.489> so<00:03:08.790> over<00:03:09.030> here<00:03:09.060> in<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.450> corner<00:03:09.780> is

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:15.890 
know why I have them stacked like that
probably<00:03:14.849> because<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.299> other<00:03:15.420> side<00:03:15.599> is<00:03:15.660> full

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
probably because the other side is full

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.970 
probably because the other side is full
of<00:03:15.989> other<00:03:16.080> stuff<00:03:16.410> because<00:03:16.530> I'm<00:03:16.739> trying<00:03:16.890> to

off<00:05:12.879> a<00:05:12.909> lot<00:05:13.120> of<00:05:13.210> people<00:05:13.449> since<00:05:13.870> its<00:05:14.050> kind<00:05:14.199> of

off a lot of people since its kind of

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:16.140 
off a lot of people since its kind of
high<00:05:14.469> but<00:05:15.069> you're<00:05:15.460> getting<00:05:15.699> some<00:05:15.849> pretty<00:05:16.000> good

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
high but you're getting some pretty good

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.999 
high but you're getting some pretty good
quality<00:05:16.389> and<00:05:16.719> I<00:05:17.080> really<00:05:17.319> didn't<00:05:17.529> notice<00:05:17.800> any

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:18.009 
quality and I really didn't notice any

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:20.369

streaming quality loss in terms of audio

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:22.769 
streaming quality loss in terms of audio
I<00:05:20.620> really<00:05:21.490> can't<00:05:22.000> tell<00:05:22.150> much<00:05:22.330> of<00:05:22.449> a<00:05:22.509> difference

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:22.779 
I really can't tell much of a difference

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:24.209 
I really can't tell much of a difference
when<00:05:22.990> ever<00:05:23.110> it's<00:05:23.259> plugged<00:05:23.590> straight<00:05:23.740> in<00:05:24.009> my

00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:24.219 
when ever it's plugged straight in my

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:26.129 
when ever it's plugged straight in my
phone<00:05:24.729> plug<00:05:24.969> straight<00:05:25.180> on<00:05:25.330> my<00:05:25.419> stereo<00:05:25.810> stereo

compared<00:05:27.099> to<00:05:27.279> the<00:05:27.430> adapter<00:05:27.909> being<00:05:28.180> used<00:05:28.419> and

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:28.659 
compared to the adapter being used and

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:31.290 
compared to the adapter being used and
so<00:05:29.110> it<00:05:29.560> produces<00:05:29.710> great<00:05:30.190> quality<00:05:30.639> it<00:05:31.029> works

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
so it produces great quality it works

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.119 
so it produces great quality it works
great<00:05:31.569> great<00:05:31.930> range<00:05:32.199> and<00:05:32.500> so<00:05:32.830> I<00:05:32.860> definitely

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:33.129 
great great range and so I definitely

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:34.379 
great great range and so I definitely
suggested<00:05:33.759> if<00:05:33.849> you're<00:05:34.000> looking<00:05:34.270> for

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
suggested if you're looking for

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:35.939 
suggested if you're looking for
something<00:05:34.719> that's<00:05:34.870> long<00:05:35.110> range<00:05:35.379> of<00:05:35.560> Bluetooth

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:35.949 
something that's long range of Bluetooth

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:38.249 
something that's long range of Bluetooth
and<00:05:36.190> like<00:05:36.909> I<00:05:37.000> said<00:05:37.060> the<00:05:37.270> price<00:05:37.509> a<00:05:37.750> little<00:05:37.810> bit

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:38.259 
and like I said the price a little bit

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:39.839 
and like I said the price a little bit
iffy<00:05:38.440> but<00:05:38.650> that's<00:05:38.800> up<00:05:39.069> to<00:05:39.129> you<00:05:39.279> to<00:05:39.580> decide

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:39.849 
iffy but that's up to you to decide

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:41.309 
iffy but that's up to you to decide
whether<00:05:40.060> or<00:05:40.240> not<00:05:40.330> you<00:05:40.509> think<00:05:40.659> it's<00:05:40.810> worth<00:05:41.020> it

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:41.319 
whether or not you think it's worth it

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:42.570 
whether or not you think it's worth it
personally<00:05:41.919> if<00:05:41.979> I've<00:05:42.099> been<00:05:42.219> looking<00:05:42.460> for

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
personally if I've been looking for

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.040 
personally if I've been looking for
something<00:05:42.819> long<00:05:42.969> range<00:05:43.240> I'd<00:05:43.629> probably<00:05:43.839> pick

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
something long range I'd probably pick

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.749 
something long range I'd probably pick
it<00:05:44.169> up<00:05:44.289> because<00:05:44.500> it<00:05:44.830> does<00:05:44.979> a<00:05:45.009> great<00:05:45.310> job<00:05:45.430> of

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 
what it's supposed to do and it's pretty

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:49.230 
what it's supposed to do and it's pretty
sturdy<00:05:47.469> as<00:05:47.680> well<00:05:47.860> doesn't<00:05:48.099> feel<00:05:48.370> flimsy<00:05:48.580> has<00:05:49.210> a

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
sturdy as well doesn't feel flimsy has a

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.059 
sturdy as well doesn't feel flimsy has a
nice<00:05:49.449> glossy<00:05:49.659> finish<00:05:50.169> on<00:05:50.289> top<00:05:50.560> but<00:05:50.889> it's<00:05:51.009> a

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:51.069 
nice glossy finish on top but it's a

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:52.379 
nice glossy finish on top but it's a
really<00:05:51.279> nice<00:05:51.430> solid<00:05:51.729> little<00:05:52.029> piece<00:05:52.270> of

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:52.389 
really nice solid little piece of

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:53.820 
really nice solid little piece of
equipment<00:05:52.779> and<00:05:53.050> one<00:05:53.229> other<00:05:53.379> thing<00:05:53.620> that<00:05:53.800> I

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
equipment and one other thing that I

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.829 
equipment and one other thing that I
really<00:05:54.190> like<00:05:54.370> about<00:05:54.400> this<00:05:54.699> adapter<00:05:55.210> is<00:05:55.360> that

00:05:55.829 --> 00:05:55.839 
really like about this adapter is that

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:58.379 
really like about this adapter is that
it<00:05:55.960> has<00:05:56.110> both<00:05:56.440> the<00:05:56.650> RCA<00:05:57.069> and<00:05:57.400> the<00:05:57.789> 3.5

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:58.389 
it has both the RCA and the 3.5

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:01.200 
it has both the RCA and the 3.5
millimeter<00:05:58.900> out<00:05:59.139> a<00:05:59.529> lot<00:06:00.279> of<00:06:00.400> stereos<00:06:00.759> I<00:06:01.000> only

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
millimeter out a lot of stereos I only

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.579 
millimeter out a lot of stereos I only
have<00:06:01.419> one<00:06:01.659> they<00:06:01.839> don't<00:06:01.930> have<00:06:02.080> both<00:06:02.289> of<00:06:02.469> them

00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:02.589 
have one they don't have both of them

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:04.829 
have one they don't have both of them
and<00:06:02.740> so<00:06:03.159> if<00:06:03.250> your<00:06:03.370> stereo<00:06:03.729> stereo<00:06:04.210> only<00:06:04.599> has

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:04.839 
and so if your stereo stereo only has

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:07.740 
and so if your stereo stereo only has
3.5<00:06:05.349> milimeter<00:06:06.190> input<00:06:06.580> you<00:06:06.940> can<00:06:06.969> use<00:06:07.270> the<00:06:07.389> RCA

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
3.5 milimeter input you can use the RCA

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.469 
3.5 milimeter input you can use the RCA
output<00:06:08.259> if<00:06:08.589> it<00:06:08.680> only<00:06:08.830> has<00:06:09.009> RCA<00:06:09.430> input<00:06:09.969> you<00:06:10.300> can

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 
output if it only has RCA input you can

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.659 
output if it only has RCA input you can
use<00:06:10.599> a<00:06:10.629> 3.5<00:06:11.020> millimeter<00:06:11.500> output<00:06:12.159> and<00:06:12.520> so

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669 
use a 3.5 millimeter output and so

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:14.010 
use a 3.5 millimeter output and so
that's<00:06:12.849> a<00:06:12.940> really<00:06:13.150> nice<00:06:13.360> advantage<00:06:13.810> of<00:06:13.900> this

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
that's a really nice advantage of this

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.600 
that's a really nice advantage of this
thing<00:06:14.199> has<00:06:14.349> that<00:06:14.770> has<00:06:14.889> two<00:06:15.190> methods<00:06:15.550> of

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
thing has that has two methods of

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.149 
thing has that has two methods of
getting<00:06:16.180> your<00:06:16.449> audio<00:06:17.110> to<00:06:17.560> your<00:06:17.589> stereo<00:06:18.129> system

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:18.159 
getting your audio to your stereo system

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:20.730 
getting your audio to your stereo system
and<00:06:18.699> so<00:06:19.060> that's<00:06:19.210> my<00:06:19.360> review<00:06:19.539> on<00:06:19.870> the<00:06:20.379> amped

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
and so that's my review on the amped

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.189 
and so that's my review on the amped
