colors<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.290> material<00:00:14.360> we're<00:00:15.360> going<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.900> now

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.110 
colors to a material we're going to now

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.599 
colors to a material we're going to now
do<00:00:16.250> how<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.280> apply<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:18.150> texture<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.920> material

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
do how to apply a texture to a material

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.330 
do how to apply a texture to a material
or<00:00:21.000> texture<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:22.609> face<00:00:23.609> or<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.420> mesh<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.340> we're

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
or texture to a face or a mesh and we're

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.849 
or texture to a face or a mesh and we're
just<00:00:26.519> going<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.760> do<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.939> plane<00:00:27.380> so<00:00:28.380> let's<00:00:28.410> start

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
just going to do a plane so let's start

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.780 
just going to do a plane so let's start
off<00:00:29.009> by<00:00:29.279> creating<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:30.029> plane<00:00:30.980> and<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.520> got<00:00:32.670> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
off by creating a plane and I got the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.090 
off by creating a plane and I got the
dynamic<00:00:33.270> space<00:00:33.570> bar<00:00:33.840> plug<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.469> so<00:00:34.829> we're<00:00:34.980> going

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
dynamic space bar plug in so we're going

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.400 
dynamic space bar plug in so we're going
to<00:00:35.190> hit<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.180> space<00:00:36.390> bar<00:00:36.420> do<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.079> I'm<00:00:37.260> going

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
to hit the space bar do that I'm going

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.410 
to hit the space bar do that I'm going
to<00:00:37.500> rotate<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.520> x-axis<00:00:39.350> 90<00:00:40.350> degrees<00:00:41.420> so

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
to rotate on the x-axis 90 degrees so

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.990 
to rotate on the x-axis 90 degrees so
it's<00:00:42.660> looking<00:00:42.930> at<00:00:43.110> us<00:00:43.370> going<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.430> kind<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.700> zoom

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
it's looking at us going to kind of zoom

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.600 
it's looking at us going to kind of zoom
in<00:00:45.180> here<00:00:45.539> I'm<00:00:46.079> going<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.469> control<00:00:46.710> out<00:00:47.190> zero

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
in here I'm going to do control out zero

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.779 
in here I'm going to do control out zero
so<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.059> camera<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.750> now<00:00:48.960> looking<00:00:49.530> at<00:00:50.629> our

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
so the camera is now looking at our

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.880 
so the camera is now looking at our
plane<00:00:53.840> I'm<00:00:54.840> going<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.079> select<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.440> camera

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
plane I'm going to select the camera

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.130 
plane I'm going to select the camera
shifts<00:00:56.280> if<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:57.000> want<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.329> fly<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.899> little

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
shifts if I want to fly in a little

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.000 
shifts if I want to fly in a little
closer<00:00:58.410> just<00:00:59.329> to<00:01:00.329> match<00:01:00.539> up<00:01:00.840> my<00:01:01.230> output<00:01:01.680> from

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
closer just to match up my output from

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.640 
closer just to match up my output from
before<00:01:02.550> which<00:01:03.180> will<00:01:03.480> I'll<00:01:03.930> give<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.379> link

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
before which will I'll give you a link

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.550 
before which will I'll give you a link
for<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.790> can<00:01:05.940> see<00:01:06.150> how<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.450> texture<00:01:07.320> is

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
for and you can see how the texture is

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.650 
for and you can see how the texture is
on<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:09.180> boat<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:10.020> both<00:01:10.260> sides<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.860> plane

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
on the boat on both sides of the plane

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.390 
on the boat on both sides of the plane
okay<00:01:12.660> so<00:01:12.870> I<00:01:13.020> got<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.290> plane<00:01:13.530> selected<00:01:14.190> and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
okay so I got the plane selected and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.400 
okay so I got the plane selected and
somebody<00:01:14.910> asked<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.660> main<00:01:15.870> reason<00:01:16.170> I'm<00:01:16.290> doing

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
somebody asked the main reason I'm doing

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.770 
somebody asked the main reason I'm doing
this<00:01:16.530> tutorial<00:01:16.800> somebody<00:01:17.550> asked<00:01:17.970> how<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.450> put

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
this tutorial somebody asked how you put

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.430 
this tutorial somebody asked how you put
a<00:01:18.810> texture<00:01:19.230> on<00:01:19.470> both<00:01:19.680> sides<00:01:19.980> of<00:01:20.190> a<00:01:20.310> face<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.440> by

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
a texture on both sides of a face and by

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.830 
a texture on both sides of a face and by
default<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.520> when<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.820> put<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> texture<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.810> a

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
default and when you put a texture on a

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.440 
default and when you put a texture on a
face<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.530> goes<00:01:26.100> both<00:01:26.490> sides<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.090> that's<00:01:27.240> what

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
face it goes both sides and that's what

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.260 
face it goes both sides and that's what
we'll<00:01:27.600> see<00:01:27.840> here<00:01:28.010> so<00:01:29.010> the<00:01:29.610> main<00:01:29.820> thing<00:01:30.090> to

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
we'll see here so the main thing to

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.390 
we'll see here so the main thing to
remember<00:01:30.300> is<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.200> when<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.860> want<00:01:32.010> to<00:01:32.160> put<00:01:32.370> a

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
remember is that when you want to put a

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.270 
remember is that when you want to put a
texture<00:01:32.880> on<00:01:33.120> a<00:01:33.150> face<00:01:33.560> you<00:01:34.560> can't<00:01:34.890> put<00:01:35.250> a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
texture on a face you can't put a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:43.490 
texture on a face you can't put a
texture<00:01:35.940> on<00:01:36.300> a<00:01:36.830> materialists<00:01:39.350> face<00:01:40.350> or<00:01:42.500> object

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
texture on a materialists face or object

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.790 
texture on a materialists face or object
let's<00:01:44.280> call<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.640> an<00:01:44.760> object<00:01:45.260> you<00:01:46.260> can't<00:01:46.530> put<00:01:46.770> a

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
let's call it an object you can't put a

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.660 
let's call it an object you can't put a
texture<00:01:47.730> on<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.410> materialist<00:01:49.580> object<00:01:50.580> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
texture on a materialist object the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.690 
texture on a materialist object the
object<00:01:50.850> has<00:01:51.270> had<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.600> material<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:53.040> on<00:01:53.460> this

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
object has had a material so on this

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.460 
object has had a material so on this
plane<00:01:54.060> let's<00:01:54.960> go<00:01:55.230> and<00:01:55.590> first<00:01:56.070> put<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:57.470> material

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
plane let's go and first put a material

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.220 
plane let's go and first put a material
and<00:01:59.090> let's<00:02:00.410> just<00:02:01.410> make<00:02:01.620> it<00:02:01.650> the<00:02:01.890> default<00:02:02.190> gray

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
and let's just make it the default gray

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.540 
and let's just make it the default gray
we<00:02:04.230> don't<00:02:04.410> have<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.680> do<00:02:04.830> anything<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.400> then

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
we don't have to do anything and then

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.880 
we don't have to do anything and then
turn<00:02:05.940> the<00:02:06.210> specular<00:02:06.840> off<00:02:07.080> because<00:02:07.560> we<00:02:07.710> don't

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
turn the specular off because we don't

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.960 
turn the specular off because we don't
want<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.550> material<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:09.239> give<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.629> shiny<00:02:10.970> kind

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
want the material to give a shiny kind

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.170 
want the material to give a shiny kind
of<00:02:12.060> oily<00:02:12.540> face<00:02:12.840> reflection<00:02:13.710> we<00:02:14.310> want

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
of oily face reflection we want

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.800 
of oily face reflection we want
the<00:02:15.799> texture<00:02:16.799> to<00:02:17.040> be<00:02:17.700> in<00:02:17.849> control<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.269> how<00:02:18.659> it

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
the texture to be in control of how it

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.860 
the texture to be in control of how it
looks<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.379> and<00:02:20.150> you<00:02:21.150> know<00:02:21.239> you<00:02:21.330> can<00:02:21.569> do<00:02:21.690> that

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
looks and and you know you can do that

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.460 
looks and and you know you can do that
later<00:02:22.530> if<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.069> want<00:02:23.310> or<00:02:23.580> you<00:02:23.760> can<00:02:24.110> do<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.140> some

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
later if you want or you can do it some

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.369 
later if you want or you can do it some

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
there it is and now if you render you

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.020

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.930 
get a black black thing why is that well
when<00:04:24.419> I<00:04:24.450> hit<00:04:24.630> 7<00:04:25.110> you<00:04:25.740> can<00:04:25.890> see<00:04:25.950> that<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.610> light

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
when I hit 7 you can see that the light

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.430 
when I hit 7 you can see that the light
is<00:04:26.969> behind<00:04:27.599> it

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
is behind it

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.710 
is behind it
so<00:04:28.530> we<00:04:28.800> have<00:04:28.920> to<00:04:29.040> grab<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.520> head<00:04:29.640> with<00:04:29.790> G<00:04:30.090> bring

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
so we have to grab the head with G bring

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.930 
so we have to grab the head with G bring
it<00:04:30.870> over<00:04:31.020> here<00:04:31.140> in<00:04:31.200> the<00:04:31.290> front<00:04:31.470> and<00:04:31.890> I'm<00:04:32.700> just

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
going to change that the Sun just

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.920 
going to change that the Sun just
because<00:04:35.400> Sun<00:04:36.360> is<00:04:36.540> a<00:04:36.570> little<00:04:36.780> more

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
because Sun is a little more

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.760 
because Sun is a little more
omnidirectional<00:04:38.630> and<00:04:39.630> I'm<00:04:39.870> going<00:04:40.050> to<00:04:40.080> paint

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
omnidirectional and I'm going to paint

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.010 
omnidirectional and I'm going to paint
it<00:04:40.910> position<00:04:41.910> it<00:04:42.060> toward<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:42.420> material<00:04:42.990> just

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
it position it toward the material just

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.010 
it position it toward the material just
for<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:43.440> heck<00:04:43.560> of<00:04:43.590> it<00:04:44.180> okay<00:04:45.180> so<00:04:45.240> now<00:04:45.540> let's<00:04:45.870> go

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
for the heck of it okay so now let's go

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.720 
for the heck of it okay so now let's go

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
hit the render there it is

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.820 
hit the render there it is
you've<00:04:53.430> got<00:04:53.700> your<00:04:53.910> texture<00:04:54.540> on<00:04:54.750> your<00:04:55.230> panel

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
you've got your texture on your panel

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.120 
you've got your texture on your panel
now<00:04:56.700> I<00:04:56.730> wasn't<00:04:57.030> that<00:04:57.240> pretty<00:04:57.420> easy

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
now I wasn't that pretty easy

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.810 
now I wasn't that pretty easy
alright<00:04:59.130> escape<00:05:01.100> let's<00:05:02.100> look<00:05:02.370> at<00:05:02.490> some<00:05:02.670> other

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
alright escape let's look at some other

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.230 
alright escape let's look at some other
stuff<00:05:03.120> here<00:05:03.510> so<00:05:04.200> we<00:05:04.380> just<00:05:04.410> created<00:05:05.400> a<00:05:05.460> material

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
stuff here so we just created a material

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.580 
stuff here so we just created a material
and<00:05:07.130> then<00:05:08.130> we<00:05:08.450> went<00:05:09.450> over<00:05:09.690> textures<00:05:10.260> and<00:05:10.530> we

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
and then we went over textures and we

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.650 
and then we went over textures and we
added<00:05:10.770> a<00:05:11.010> texture<00:05:11.490> and<00:05:11.610> image<00:05:11.850> texture<00:05:12.300> and

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
added a texture and image texture and

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.410 
added a texture and image texture and
then<00:05:13.560> we<00:05:13.710> told<00:05:13.950> it<00:05:14.190> where<00:05:14.430> to<00:05:14.610> find<00:05:14.880> that<00:05:15.150> image

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.420 
then we told it where to find that image

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.950 
then we told it where to find that image
texture<00:05:15.930> and<00:05:17.240> that's<00:05:18.240> basically<00:05:18.720> it

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
texture and that's basically it

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.200 
texture and that's basically it
now<00:05:19.620> another<00:05:19.980> little<00:05:20.280> trick<00:05:20.490> I'll<00:05:20.790> just<00:05:21.000> show

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
now another little trick I'll just show

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.670 
now another little trick I'll just show
you<00:05:21.270> the<00:05:21.420> since<00:05:21.630> this<00:05:21.750> is<00:05:21.930> the<00:05:22.050> basics<00:05:22.530> of<00:05:22.620> how

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
you the since this is the basics of how

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.390 
you the since this is the basics of how
to<00:05:22.830> apply<00:05:24.470> well<00:05:25.470> let<00:05:25.590> me<00:05:25.620> show<00:05:25.830> you<00:05:25.920> first<00:05:26.190> that

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
to apply well let me show you first that

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.370 
to apply well let me show you first that
it<00:05:26.550> is<00:05:26.670> on<00:05:26.910> both<00:05:27.150> sides<00:05:27.480> okay<00:05:27.900> so<00:05:27.960> go<00:05:28.260> up<00:05:28.290> here

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
it is on both sides okay so go up here

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.130 
it is on both sides okay so go up here
to<00:05:28.530> seven<00:05:29.070> okay<00:05:30.000> we've<00:05:30.180> rendered<00:05:30.540> it<00:05:30.660> one<00:05:30.870> time

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
to seven okay we've rendered it one time

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.750 
to seven okay we've rendered it one time
we've<00:05:31.470> already<00:05:31.650> seen<00:05:32.040> that<00:05:32.220> it's<00:05:32.400> on<00:05:32.550> this

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
we've already seen that it's on this

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.990 
we've already seen that it's on this
side<00:05:32.870> okay<00:05:33.870> I<00:05:34.080> hit<00:05:34.290> escape<00:05:34.520> now<00:05:35.520> I've<00:05:35.640> got<00:05:35.850> the

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
side okay I hit escape now I've got the

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.060 
side okay I hit escape now I've got the
plane<00:05:36.270> selected<00:05:36.930> I'm<00:05:37.230> going<00:05:37.410> to<00:05:37.470> rotate<00:05:37.740> it

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
plane selected I'm going to rotate it

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.190 
plane selected I'm going to rotate it
and<00:05:38.960> I'm<00:05:39.960> going<00:05:40.050> to<00:05:40.140> rotate<00:05:40.260> it<00:05:40.590> 180<00:05:41.550> degrees

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
and I'm going to rotate it 180 degrees

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.460 
and I'm going to rotate it 180 degrees
and<00:05:43.200> we're<00:05:43.830> going<00:05:44.070> to<00:05:44.480> render<00:05:45.480> again<00:05:45.720> there<00:05:46.320> it

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
and we're going to render again there it

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.250 
and we're going to render again there it
is<00:05:46.590> on<00:05:46.740> that<00:05:46.770> side<00:05:47.160> as<00:05:47.340> well<00:05:47.550> so<00:05:47.990> it's<00:05:48.990> on<00:05:49.110> both

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
is on that side as well so it's on both

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.680 
is on that side as well so it's on both
sides<00:05:49.560> and<00:05:49.830> and<00:05:50.760> I'm<00:05:50.910> going<00:05:51.090> to<00:05:51.120> give<00:05:51.330> a<00:05:51.360> link

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
sides and and I'm going to give a link

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.740 
sides and and I'm going to give a link
down<00:05:51.960> at<00:05:52.169> the<00:05:52.260> bottom<00:05:52.440> that<00:05:52.800> shows<00:05:53.630> in<00:05:54.630> a

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
down at the bottom that shows in a

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.080 
down at the bottom that shows in a
little<00:05:54.990> movie<00:05:55.110> file<00:05:55.500> it<00:05:55.830> just<00:05:55.890> rotating<00:05:56.700> so

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
little movie file it just rotating so

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.150 
little movie file it just rotating so
you<00:05:57.180> can<00:05:57.780> actually<00:05:57.960> see<00:05:58.410> that<00:05:58.620> it's<00:05:58.800> on<00:05:58.950> both

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
you can actually see that it's on both

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.930 
you can actually see that it's on both
sides<00:05:59.490> but<00:06:00.270> another<00:06:00.480> little<00:06:00.840> thing<00:06:01.100> just<00:06:02.100> like

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
sides but another little thing just like

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.430 
sides but another little thing just like
a<00:06:03.000> basic<00:06:03.330> thing<00:06:03.660> I'm<00:06:03.810> going<00:06:03.930> to<00:06:04.020> tell<00:06:04.230> you<00:06:04.350> is

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
a basic thing I'm going to tell you is

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.990 
a basic thing I'm going to tell you is
the<00:06:04.620> geometry<00:06:05.310> you<00:06:05.340> can<00:06:05.610> also<00:06:06.230> select<00:06:07.230> this

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
the geometry you can also select this

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.780 
the geometry you can also select this
and<00:06:09.000> now<00:06:10.100> you<00:06:11.100> can<00:06:11.280> see<00:06:11.550> that<00:06:12.860> the<00:06:13.860> image<00:06:14.280> has

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
and now you can see that the image has

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.120 
and now you can see that the image has
affected<00:06:15.390> the<00:06:15.540> normals<00:06:16.020> now<00:06:16.560> this<00:06:16.740> isn't<00:06:17.040> the

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
affected the normals now this isn't the

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.300 
affected the normals now this isn't the
best<00:06:17.280> way<00:06:17.430> to<00:06:17.580> do<00:06:17.880> it<00:06:18.060> there's<00:06:19.040> programs<00:06:20.040> that

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
best way to do it there's programs that

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.260 
best way to do it there's programs that
will<00:06:20.520> generate<00:06:21.030> a<00:06:21.330> a<00:06:21.980> normal<00:06:22.980> map<00:06:23.190> and<00:06:23.550> then

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
will generate a a normal map and then

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.440 
will generate a a normal map and then
you<00:06:24.510> can<00:06:24.720> use<00:06:24.990> that<00:06:25.020> as<00:06:25.590> on<00:06:26.550> another<00:06:26.880> textured

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:27.450 
you can use that as on another textured

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.720 
you can use that as on another textured
layer<00:06:27.750> and<00:06:28.110> then<00:06:28.320> have<00:06:28.860> that<00:06:29.160> effect<00:06:29.550> of

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:29.730 
layer and then have that effect of

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.510 
layer and then have that effect of
normals<00:06:30.180> but<00:06:30.960> just<00:06:31.230> quick<00:06:31.500> and<00:06:31.650> dirty<00:06:31.830> you<00:06:32.160> can

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
normals but just quick and dirty you can

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.560 
normals but just quick and dirty you can
you<00:06:32.910> can<00:06:33.090> have<00:06:33.330> the<00:06:34.080> image<00:06:34.880> effect<00:06:35.880> of<00:06:36.120> normals

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.570 
you can have the image effect of normals

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:37.909 
you can have the image effect of normals
so<00:06:36.750> I'm<00:06:36.870> going<00:06:37.020> to<00:06:37.080> turn<00:06:37.229> this<00:06:37.410> down<00:06:37.650> like

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 
so I'm going to turn this down like

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:41.990 
so I'm going to turn this down like
point2<00:06:38.550> because<00:06:38.820> this<00:06:38.970> is<00:06:39.120> pretty<00:06:39.360> pretty

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 
point2 because this is pretty pretty

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.580 
point2 because this is pretty pretty
pretty<00:06:43.000> severe<00:06:43.360> so<00:06:43.930> that<00:06:44.020> looks<00:06:44.230> a<00:06:44.320> little<00:06:44.410> bit

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590 
pretty severe so that looks a little bit

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.890 
pretty severe so that looks a little bit
more<00:06:44.770> natural<00:06:44.980> and<00:06:45.460> it<00:06:46.060> works<00:06:46.300> in<00:06:46.600> color

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:46.900 
more natural and it works in color

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.320 
more natural and it works in color
because<00:06:47.350> basically<00:06:47.680> it's<00:06:48.070> taken<00:06:48.490> the<00:06:49.000> dark

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
because basically it's taken the dark

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.680 
because basically it's taken the dark
and<00:06:50.460> depressing<00:06:51.460> it<00:06:51.760> and<00:06:52.000> taking<00:06:52.390> the<00:06:52.420> light

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:52.690 
and depressing it and taking the light

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.500 
and depressing it and taking the light
areas<00:06:53.080> and<00:06:53.260> raising<00:06:53.710> it<00:06:53.830> and<00:06:54.040> then<00:06:54.190> if<00:06:55.030> you<00:06:55.240> go

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:55.510 
areas and raising it and then if you go

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.440 
areas and raising it and then if you go
into<00:06:55.900> the<00:06:56.020> negative<00:06:56.260> zone<00:06:56.910> it'll<00:06:57.910> do<00:06:58.180> it<00:06:58.300> the

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:58.450 
into the negative zone it'll do it the

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.770 
into the negative zone it'll do it the
other<00:06:58.480> way<00:06:58.870> so<00:06:58.930> if<00:06:59.290> it<00:06:59.380> doesn't<00:06:59.650> look<00:06:59.800> right

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:00.780 
other way so if it doesn't look right

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.270 
other way so if it doesn't look right
see<00:07:01.780> that<00:07:01.990> kind<00:07:02.230> of<00:07:02.290> looks<00:07:02.470> like<00:07:02.680> it's

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 
see that kind of looks like it's

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.540 
see that kind of looks like it's
indented<00:07:04.230> and<00:07:05.230> you<00:07:05.710> may<00:07:05.830> like<00:07:06.070> that<00:07:06.100> better

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:06.550 
indented and you may like that better

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.720 
indented and you may like that better
but<00:07:06.850> that's<00:07:07.750> what's<00:07:08.200> nice<00:07:08.350> about<00:07:08.410> the<00:07:09.190> new

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:09.730 
but that's what's nice about the new

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.520 
but that's what's nice about the new
blender<00:07:10.180> version<00:07:10.630> is<00:07:10.810> that<00:07:11.020> you<00:07:11.080> don't<00:07:11.440> have

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:11.530 
blender version is that you don't have

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:14.550 
blender version is that you don't have
to<00:07:11.890> click<00:07:12.160> a<00:07:12.190> button<00:07:12.310> say<00:07:12.910> inverse<00:07:13.750> it<00:07:14.020> you

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 
to click a button say inverse it you

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.040 
to click a button say inverse it you
either<00:07:14.710> go<00:07:15.640> on<00:07:15.790> one<00:07:16.000> side<00:07:16.270> of<00:07:16.450> zero<00:07:16.690> or<00:07:16.900> on

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.050 
either go on one side of zero or on

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.320 
either go on one side of zero or on
together<00:07:17.290> to<00:07:17.440> effect<00:07:17.950> the<00:07:18.100> normals<00:07:18.930> and

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.330 
together to effect the normals and

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.060 
together to effect the normals and
that's<00:07:22.330> it<00:07:22.570> I<00:07:22.660> think<00:07:22.930> that's<00:07:23.380> basically<00:07:23.800> all<00:07:23.920> I

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:24.070 
that's it I think that's basically all I

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:31.430 
that's it I think that's basically all I
wanted<00:07:24.490> to<00:07:24.580> say<00:07:24.840> very<00:07:25.840> quick<00:07:26.200> little<00:07:26.470> tutorial

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.440 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:37.170 

we<00:07:32.440> can<00:07:32.590> add<00:07:32.740> some<00:07:33.090> stars<00:07:34.090> in<00:07:34.450> here<00:07:36.150> make<00:07:37.150> it

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:37.180 
we can add some stars in here make it

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.660 
we can add some stars in here make it
look<00:07:37.300> like<00:07:37.570> it's<00:07:37.720> out<00:07:37.870> in<00:07:37.990> outer<00:07:38.500> space

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:38.670 
look like it's out in outer space

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:41.610 
look like it's out in outer space
floating<00:07:39.670> and<00:07:40.540> that's<00:07:40.840> what<00:07:41.020> I<00:07:41.050> did<00:07:41.320> in<00:07:41.350> the

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:41.620 
floating and that's what I did in the

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.820 
floating and that's what I did in the
little<00:07:41.860> video<00:07:42.130> so<00:07:42.480> that's<00:07:43.480> a<00:07:43.720> very<00:07:44.650> quick

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:44.830 
little video so that's a very quick

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.100 
little video so that's a very quick
little<00:07:45.040> tip<00:07:45.370> on<00:07:45.580> how<00:07:45.910> to<00:07:45.940> apply<00:07:46.240> a<00:07:46.330> texture<00:07:46.810> to

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:47.110 
little tip on how to apply a texture to

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:52.110 
little tip on how to apply a texture to
the<00:07:47.200> material<00:07:48.120> pretty<00:07:49.120> simple<00:07:49.510> and<00:07:50.460> I<00:07:51.460> believe

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:52.120 
the material pretty simple and I believe

00:07:52.120 --> 00:08:00.960 
the material pretty simple and I believe
that's<00:07:52.330> it<00:07:52.510> so<00:07:59.010> and<00:08:00.010> thanks<00:08:00.580> for<00:08:00.730> subscribing
