your gaming experience um and so the two

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.580 
your gaming experience um and so the two
ones<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.210> again<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.420> will<00:00:45.539> be<00:00:45.750> going<00:00:45.899> over<00:00:46.050> is

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
ones that again I will be going over is

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.029 
ones that again I will be going over is
the<00:00:46.620> questing<00:00:47.370> feature<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.690> arm<00:00:49.039> exceed

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
the questing feature and the arm exceed

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.860 
the questing feature and the arm exceed
the<00:00:50.129> end<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.820> gold<00:00:51.059> making<00:00:51.210> feature<00:00:51.480> arm

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the end of the gold making feature arm

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.049 
the end of the gold making feature arm
and<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:52.860> basically<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.309> question<00:00:53.610> feature<00:00:53.820> is

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
and so basically the question feature is

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.619 
and so basically the question feature is
basically<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.410> list<00:00:56.000> or<00:00:57.000> basically<00:00:57.510> it's

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
basically just a list or basically it's

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.939 
basically just a list or basically it's
just<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.989> strategizes<00:00:58.739> all<00:00:59.579> the<00:01:00.030> quests<00:01:00.510> out

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
just it strategizes all the quests out

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.910 
just it strategizes all the quests out
to<00:01:01.949> make<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.520> me<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.820> maximize<00:01:03.589> or<00:01:04.589> actually

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
to make it to me to maximize or actually

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.859 
to make it to me to maximize or actually
minimize<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.489> time<00:01:05.670> spent<00:01:06.330> questing<00:01:06.750> you

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
minimize the time spent questing you

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.850 
minimize the time spent questing you
know<00:01:06.960> because<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.170> have<00:01:07.290> all<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:08.330> quests<00:01:09.330> oh

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
know because I have all the quests oh

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.960 
know because I have all the quests oh
it's<00:01:10.860> gained<00:01:11.159> all<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.400> quests<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.850> it

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
it's gained all the quests and it

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.570 
it's gained all the quests and it
organizes<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.689> for<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.159> then<00:01:14.250> tells<00:01:14.460> you

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
organizes it for you and then tells you

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.100 
organizes it for you and then tells you
exactly<00:01:14.670> what<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.150> do<00:01:15.330> for<00:01:15.540> each<00:01:15.659> one<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.049> you

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
exactly what to do for each one so you

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.630 
exactly what to do for each one so you
just<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.590> pass<00:01:16.799> out<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.070> quest<00:01:17.280> really

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
just you pass out the quest really

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.969 
just you pass out the quest really
really<00:01:17.850> quickly<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:19.049> again<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.560> want<00:01:19.799> if

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
really quickly and again if you want if

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.230 
really quickly and again if you want if
I<00:01:20.130> probably<00:01:20.400> not<00:01:20.580> doing<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.880> best<00:01:21.119> job

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
I probably not doing the best job

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.260 
I probably not doing the best job
describing<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:21.960> if<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.110> just<00:01:22.229> click<00:01:22.500> um

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
describing it so if you just click um

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.160 
describing it so if you just click um
there's<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> couple<00:01:24.420> places<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:24.900> can<00:01:24.990> just

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
there's a couple places we can just

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.810 
there's a couple places we can just
click<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.530> actually<00:01:26.250> go<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.610> site<00:01:26.790> where

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
click and actually go to the site where

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.539 
click and actually go to the site where
actually<00:01:27.150> explains<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.600> lot<00:01:27.750> more<00:01:27.840> depth<00:01:28.140> um

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
actually explains it a lot more depth um

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.560 
actually explains it a lot more depth um
but<00:01:29.549> yeah<00:01:29.670> that's<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.450> basically

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
but yeah that's that and so basically

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.319 
but yeah that's that and so basically
the<00:01:31.020> whole<00:01:31.140> purpose<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:31.829> just<00:01:32.070> to

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
the whole purpose of that is just to

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.749 
the whole purpose of that is just to
maximize<00:01:33.329> or<00:01:33.740> actually<00:01:34.740> back<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.430> must<00:01:35.579> net

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
maximize or actually back you must net

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.080 
maximize or actually back you must net
up<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.540> minimize<00:01:36.960> arm<00:01:37.640> minimize<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.790> time<00:01:38.939> of

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
up to minimize arm minimize the time of

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.460 
up to minimize arm minimize the time of
questing<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.720> can<00:01:39.840> level<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.079> faster

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
questing just you can level it faster

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.920 
questing just you can level it faster
and<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:41.159> does<00:01:41.340> work<00:01:41.369> um<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:42.240> anyways<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
and it does work um but anyways and the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.880 
and it does work um but anyways and the
other<00:01:43.079> one<00:01:43.170> who's<00:01:43.290> being<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.530> gold<00:01:43.710> making

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
other one who's being the gold making

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.740 
other one who's being the gold making
guide<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.220> baseball<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.700> Matt<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.570> may

levels of insane insane leveling so I

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.320 
levels of insane insane leveling so I

had that system down um but this one
this<00:03:38.480> made<00:03:38.660> even<00:03:38.840> faster<00:03:39.470> because<00:03:39.620> it<00:03:39.920> cuts

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
this made even faster because it cuts

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.479

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
down it cuts out the qett or it actually

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.199 
down it cuts out the qett or it actually
includes<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.400> quest<00:03:46.670> that<00:03:46.820> you<00:03:46.910> know<00:03:47.000> for

feeling that you you know you're not

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:57.970 
feeling that you you know you're not
really<00:04:56.660> focused<00:04:57.110> on<00:04:57.200> leveling<00:04:57.620> you<00:04:57.740> kind<00:04:57.920> of

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
really focused on leveling you kind of

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.470 
really focused on leveling you kind of
focus<00:04:58.190> on<00:04:58.310> seeing<00:04:58.550> how<00:04:58.640> fast<00:04:58.850> you<00:04:59.000> the<00:04:59.150> quests

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480

focus on seeing how fast you the quests
out<00:04:59.600> so<00:04:59.750> it's<00:04:59.840> a<00:04:59.870> little<00:04:59.960> bit<00:05:00.050> of<00:05:00.170> a

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
out so it's a little bit of a

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.140 
out so it's a little bit of a
distraction<00:05:00.320> which<00:05:01.190> enables<00:05:01.730> you<00:05:01.790> to<00:05:01.820> quest

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
distraction which enables you to quest

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.870 
distraction which enables you to quest
longer<00:05:02.740> so<00:05:03.740> I<00:05:03.770> that's<00:05:04.100> a<00:05:04.160> little<00:05:04.370> interesting

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
longer so I that's a little interesting
