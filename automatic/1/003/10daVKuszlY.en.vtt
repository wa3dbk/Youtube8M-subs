00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.940 
because I've heard from some girls that
you<00:03:52.709> know<00:03:52.860> inside<00:03:54.319> places<00:03:55.319> where<00:03:55.530> they<00:03:55.709> have

you know inside places where they have

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.720 
you know inside places where they have
black<00:03:56.400> light<00:03:56.760> some<00:03:57.510> girls<00:03:58.220> they<00:03:59.220> put<00:03:59.489> way<00:03:59.700> too

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
black light some girls they put way too

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.550 
black light some girls they put way too
much<00:03:59.940> glue<00:04:00.329> on<00:04:00.480> through<00:04:00.720> their<00:04:00.900> eyelash<00:04:01.349> glue

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
much glue on through their eyelash glue

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.220 
much glue on through their eyelash glue
was<00:04:01.769> showing<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:02.670> then<00:04:03.239> I<00:04:03.450> think<00:04:03.510> my<00:04:03.870> guy

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
was showing and then I think my guy

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.140 
was showing and then I think my guy
friends<00:04:04.709> actually<00:04:04.890> told<00:04:05.310> me<00:04:05.400> about<00:04:05.549> that<00:04:05.910> and

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
friends actually told me about that and

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.699 
friends actually told me about that and
I<00:04:06.239> was<00:04:06.329> like<00:04:06.540> oh<00:04:06.690> my<00:04:06.720> goodness<00:04:07.170> you<00:04:07.319> noticed

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
I was like oh my goodness you noticed

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.699 
I was like oh my goodness you noticed
that<00:04:07.859> but<00:04:08.819> I<00:04:09.329> guess<00:04:09.690> you<00:04:09.900> put<00:04:10.260> on<00:04:10.379> the<00:04:10.500> way<00:04:10.650> too

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
that but I guess you put on the way too

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.770 
that but I guess you put on the way too
much<00:04:11.040> glue<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:11.670> like<00:04:11.879> the<00:04:12.030> black<00:04:12.269> light<00:04:12.540> was

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
much glue and like the black light was

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.180 
much glue and like the black light was
like<00:04:13.049> making<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:14.010> eyelash<00:04:14.459> glue<00:04:14.819> glow<00:04:15.799> so<00:04:16.799> I

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
like making the eyelash glue glow so I

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.650 
like making the eyelash glue glow so I
think<00:04:17.340> that's<00:04:17.579> pretty<00:04:17.820> embarrassing<00:04:18.449> but

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
think that's pretty embarrassing but

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.129 
think that's pretty embarrassing but
anyway<00:04:19.079> so<00:04:19.709> it's<00:04:20.130> on<00:04:20.459> if<00:04:20.970> you<00:04:21.209> want<00:04:21.510> to<00:04:21.870> curl

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
anyway so it's on if you want to curl

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.520 
anyway so it's on if you want to curl
your<00:04:22.699> eyelashes<00:04:23.699> with<00:04:24.060> your<00:04:24.419> false<00:04:24.690> eyelashes

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
your eyelashes with your false eyelashes

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.360 
your eyelashes with your false eyelashes
you<00:04:26.130> can<00:04:26.340> definitely<00:04:26.610> do<00:04:27.270> so<00:04:27.600> and<00:04:28.190> you<00:04:29.190> can

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
you can definitely do so and you can

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.719 
you can definitely do so and you can
just<00:04:29.550> curl<00:04:29.970> if<00:04:30.539> you<00:04:31.200> curl<00:04:31.500> too<00:04:31.950> much<00:04:32.280> it's

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
just curl if you curl too much it's

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.589 
just curl if you curl too much it's
really<00:04:33.330> noticeable<00:04:34.099> so<00:04:35.099> just<00:04:35.820> curl<00:04:36.210> a<00:04:36.539> little

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
really noticeable so just curl a little

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.290 
really noticeable so just curl a little
bit<00:04:37.110> just<00:04:37.860> so<00:04:38.010> that<00:04:38.130> you<00:04:38.370> can<00:04:38.520> combine<00:04:38.789> your
