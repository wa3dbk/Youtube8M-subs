00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
the exiled specifically deals with ideas

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.550 
the exiled specifically deals with ideas
of<00:00:14.059> existentialism<00:00:15.059> but<00:00:15.929> then<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.139> started

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
of existentialism but then I started

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.310 
of existentialism but then I started
branching<00:00:16.859> out<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.699> basic<00:00:18.180> ideas<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:18.660> the

branching out to basic ideas of the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.880 
branching out to basic ideas of the
human<00:00:19.680> condition<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:21.449> human<00:00:21.890> response

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
human condition and the human response

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.140 
human condition and the human response
to<00:00:23.130> how<00:00:23.460> we<00:00:23.519> are<00:00:24.359> with<00:00:25.260> each<00:00:25.320> other<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:26.430> as<00:00:26.640> with

every ballet my direct link to to the
human<00:00:32.790> condition<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.450> communication<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.680> is

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
human condition is communication that is

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.540 
human condition is communication that is
still<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.090> utmost<00:00:36.210> importance<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.230> have<00:00:38.219> a

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
still of the utmost importance I have a

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.479 
still of the utmost importance I have a
set<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.930> piece<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.649> includes<00:00:41.190> a

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
set in this piece that includes a

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.479 
set in this piece that includes a
plexiglass<00:00:42.329> front<00:00:42.899> wall<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:44.070> interestingly

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
plexiglass front wall so interestingly

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.540 
plexiglass front wall so interestingly
I've<00:00:45.239> put<00:00:45.780> up<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:46.050> wall<00:00:47.360> -<00:00:48.360> if<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:49.530> will<00:00:49.710> stop

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
I've put up a wall - if you will stop

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.670 
I've put up a wall - if you will stop
that<00:00:50.579> communication<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:51.600> I've<00:00:51.840> even<00:00:52.110> created

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
that communication so I've even created

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.209 
that communication so I've even created
one<00:00:53.520> more<00:00:53.789> barrier<00:00:54.149> for<00:00:54.660> myself<00:00:55.110> within<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
one more barrier for myself within the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.029 
one more barrier for myself within the
effort<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.699> reach<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.480> audience<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:58.230> thought

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
effort to reach the audience I thought

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.520 
effort to reach the audience I thought
that<00:00:59.250> was<00:00:59.489> quite<00:01:00.090> interesting<00:01:00.239> when<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.260> looked

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
that was quite interesting when I looked

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.560 
that was quite interesting when I looked
at<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.219> set<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.640> thought<00:01:02.789> boom<00:01:03.120> look<00:01:03.420> what

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
at the set and I thought boom look what

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.630 
at the set and I thought boom look what
I've<00:01:03.690> done<00:01:03.719> that's<00:01:04.589> an<00:01:04.890> interesting<00:01:05.400> choice

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
I've done that's an interesting choice

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.960 
I've done that's an interesting choice
but<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.750> think<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.680> has<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> lot<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.130> do<00:01:08.369> with<00:01:08.400> what

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
but I think it has a lot to do with what

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.539 
but I think it has a lot to do with what
these<00:01:09.869> five<00:01:10.170> characters<00:01:10.920> are<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.280> through

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
these five characters are going through

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.240 
these five characters are going through
in<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.850> play<00:01:12.470> there<00:01:13.470> are<00:01:13.500> two<00:01:13.979> characters

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
in this play there are two characters

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.630 
in this play there are two characters
called<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.090> reckoners<00:01:15.600> they<00:01:16.200> are<00:01:16.640> handing

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
called the reckoners they are handing

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.429 
called the reckoners they are handing
out<00:01:17.869> justice<00:01:19.310> in<00:01:20.310> their<00:01:20.549> own<00:01:20.759> terms<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:22.290> is

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
out justice in their own terms and it is

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.899 
out justice in their own terms and it is
not<00:01:22.830> something<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:24.890> condone<00:01:25.890> at<00:01:26.250> all<00:01:26.580> I

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
not something that I condone at all I

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.120 
not something that I condone at all I
thought<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.330> was<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> very<00:01:27.659> interesting

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
thought it was a very interesting

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.679 
thought it was a very interesting
dramatic<00:01:29.130> element<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.909> see<00:01:30.119> two<00:01:30.479> people

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
dramatic element to see two people

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.140 
dramatic element to see two people
handing<00:01:31.259> down<00:01:31.290> justice<00:01:31.920> on<00:01:32.100> three<00:01:32.729> people

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
handing down justice on three people

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.770 
handing down justice on three people
that<00:01:33.689> they<00:01:33.930> consider<00:01:34.880> as<00:01:35.880> criminals

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
that they consider as criminals

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.620 
that they consider as criminals
so<00:01:37.340> things<00:01:38.340> they<00:01:38.549> have<00:01:38.670> done<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.210> their<00:01:39.360> life

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
so things they have done in their life

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.859 
so things they have done in their life
to<00:01:39.990> warrant<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.740> vigilantes<00:01:41.549> justice<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.329> don't

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
to warrant a vigilantes justice I don't

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.139 
to warrant a vigilantes justice I don't
know<00:01:43.020> if<00:01:43.140> there<00:01:43.320> are<00:01:43.350> any<00:01:43.590> good<00:01:43.860> guys<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.520> this

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
know if there are any good guys in this

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.740 
know if there are any good guys in this
piece<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:46.500> what<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.070> attempt<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.820> illustrate

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
piece but what I attempt to illustrate

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.030 
piece but what I attempt to illustrate
is<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:50.119> no<00:01:51.119> human<00:01:51.540> being<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:52.110> all<00:01:52.560> good<00:01:52.829> or

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
is that no human being is all good or

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.539 
is that no human being is all good or
all<00:01:53.100> bad<00:01:53.310> all<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.299> all<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:55.259> these<00:01:55.439> sides<00:01:55.799> live

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
all bad all of all of these sides live

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.660 
all bad all of all of these sides live
in<00:01:56.790> us<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.450> what<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.170> point<00:01:58.500> where<00:01:59.219> we<00:01:59.460> get

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
in us and what is the point where we get

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.990 
in us and what is the point where we get
pushed<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.869> react<00:02:01.619> although<00:02:02.520> we<00:02:02.640> might<00:02:02.820> not

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
pushed to react although we might not

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.600 
pushed to react although we might not
have<00:02:03.060> seen<00:02:03.479> this<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:03.899> ballets<00:02:04.469> before<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.369> I'm

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
have seen this in ballets before and I'm

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.790 
have seen this in ballets before and I'm
sure<00:02:05.850> we<00:02:06.030> have

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
sure we have

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.310 
sure we have
it<00:02:07.580> is<00:02:07.730> evident<00:02:08.180> in<00:02:08.360> film<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:08.990> in<00:02:09.110> literature

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
it is evident in film and in literature

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.830 
it is evident in film and in literature
so<00:02:09.950> again<00:02:10.370> my<00:02:10.760> whole<00:02:11.030> idea<00:02:11.270> of<00:02:11.750> bringing<00:02:12.710> dance

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
so again my whole idea of bringing dance

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.430 
so again my whole idea of bringing dance
into<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:15.260> with<00:02:16.070> and<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:17.510> communicate<00:02:18.050> with

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
into and with and to communicate with

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.610 
into and with and to communicate with
other<00:02:18.770> art<00:02:19.460> forms<00:02:19.970> is<00:02:20.210> also<00:02:20.750> very<00:02:21.050> important

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
other art forms is also very important

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.990 
other art forms is also very important
to<00:02:21.680> me<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:22.130> deal<00:02:22.370> with<00:02:22.400> subjects<00:02:23.150> that<00:02:23.840> we<00:02:25.000> see
