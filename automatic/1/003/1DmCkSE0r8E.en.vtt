00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
action doesn't go all the way around so

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.289 
action doesn't go all the way around so
if<00:03:29.980> it<00:03:30.220> was<00:03:30.310> plugged<00:03:30.609> in<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:30.850> other<00:03:31.030> way<00:03:31.239> you

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
if it was plugged in the other way you

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.199 
if it was plugged in the other way you
could<00:03:31.720> actually<00:03:31.980> point<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.190> at<00:03:33.400> your<00:03:33.730> mouth

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209
