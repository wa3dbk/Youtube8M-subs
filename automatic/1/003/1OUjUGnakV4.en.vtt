00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.370 
n t7 3 and forehand and next measure
with<00:02:50.530> G<00:02:50.920> all<00:02:51.100> by<00:02:51.340> itself

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.900 

ah<00:02:55.910> and<00:02:56.660> so<00:02:56.990> it<00:02:57.170> ends<00:02:57.440> with<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.860> word<00:02:58.580> live

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
ah and so it ends with the word live

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.830 
ah and so it ends with the word live
from<00:02:59.240> the<00:02:59.390> last<00:03:00.190> line<00:03:01.190> of<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.840> previous

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
from the last line of the previous

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.920 
from the last line of the previous
measure<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:04.400> it's<00:03:04.550> one<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:04.820> two<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.690> three

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
measure and it's one and two and three

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.320 
measure and it's one and two and three
and<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.740> on<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.610> floor<00:03:07.880> and<00:03:08.090> we're<00:03:08.300> saying<00:03:08.920> ah

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
and and on the floor and we're saying ah

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.400 
and and on the floor and we're saying ah
because<00:03:11.330> we're<00:03:11.720> going<00:03:11.930> into<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.230> next

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
because we're going into the next

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.790 
because we're going into the next
measure<00:03:12.710> with<00:03:13.040> above<00:03:13.850> so<00:03:14.240> it's<00:03:14.390> above<00:03:14.800> this

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
measure with above so it's above this

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.290 
measure with above so it's above this
next<00:03:16.190> measure<00:03:16.430> it's<00:03:16.640> going<00:03:16.850> to<00:03:16.910> be<00:03:17.000> shared

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
next measure it's going to be shared

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.070 
next measure it's going to be shared
with<00:03:17.450> with<00:03:18.190> two<00:03:19.190> piece<00:03:19.400> of<00:03:19.610> G<00:03:19.880> and<00:03:20.120> two<00:03:20.840> beats

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
with with two piece of G and two beats

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:30.250 
with with two piece of G and two beats
of<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.410> e7<00:03:22.750> so<00:03:27.580> so<00:03:28.580> it's<00:03:28.730> one<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.540> two<00:03:29.870> and

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
of the e7 so so it's one and two and

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.790 
of the e7 so so it's one and two and
seven<00:03:31.160> three<00:03:31.520> and<00:03:31.550> for<00:03:32.270> him<00:03:32.660> to<00:03:32.960> get<00:03:33.110> down<00:03:33.440> up
