00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
can see I put the controls right up here

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.039 
can see I put the controls right up here
on<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.489> up<00:01:02.809> on<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.989> post<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:05.840> go<00:01:06.840> back

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
on the up on the post and go back

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.520 
on the up on the post and go back
outside<00:01:07.290> here<00:01:07.979> push<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.090> UP<00:01:09.330> button<00:01:11.930> and<00:01:12.930> it

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
outside here push the UP button and it

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.039 
outside here push the UP button and it
goes<00:01:13.770> up<00:01:13.979> about<00:01:14.280> oh<00:01:14.340> four<00:01:15.090> or<00:01:15.119> five<00:01:15.420> inches<00:01:15.720> I

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
goes up about oh four or five inches I

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.200 
goes up about oh four or five inches I
guess<00:01:16.259> walk<00:01:16.950> around<00:01:17.340> here<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:18.000> see

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
guess walk around here and you can see

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.170 
guess walk around here and you can see
that<00:01:18.390> it's<00:01:18.740> up<00:01:19.740> fairly<00:01:20.250> easy<00:01:20.400> with<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.700> small

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
that it's up fairly easy with that small

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.899 
that it's up fairly easy with that small
winch<00:01:21.450> assembly<00:01:21.680> with<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.830> old<00:01:23.640> light

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.790 

you<00:01:30.120> can<00:01:30.300> hear<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.750> unloads<00:01:31.140> well<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.770> also

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
you can hear that it unloads well I also

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.220 
you can hear that it unloads well I also
melted<00:01:34.800> some<00:01:34.920> auxilary<00:01:35.460> lights<00:01:35.960> come<00:01:36.960> around

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230 
melted some auxilary lights come around

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.790 
melted some auxilary lights come around
and<00:01:37.500> see<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:38.780> now<00:01:39.780> has<00:01:40.050> plenty<00:01:40.260> of<00:01:40.500> light

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
and see that now has plenty of light

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.970 
and see that now has plenty of light
from<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.850> tractor<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.660> from<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.170> light<00:01:43.710> bars

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:50.420 
from the tractor and from the light bars
I<00:01:44.160> made<00:01:44.400> and<00:01:46.130> I<00:01:47.420> also<00:01:48.420> installed<00:01:49.080> a<00:01:49.830> remote

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
I made and I also installed a remote

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.860 
I made and I also installed a remote
shoot<00:01:51.560> mechanism<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:53.370> that<00:01:53.400> I<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.970> spin<00:01:54.690> the

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
shoot mechanism so that I can spin the

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.180 
shoot mechanism so that I can spin the
shoot<00:01:55.110> remotely<00:01:55.890> from<00:01:56.010> the<00:01:56.190> cab<00:01:57.950> on<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.010> other

side<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.760> snow<00:02:00.000> cab<00:02:00.270> here<00:02:00.660> a<00:02:02.210> small<00:02:03.210> motor

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
side of the snow cab here a small motor

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.100 
side of the snow cab here a small motor
mount<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.320> underneath<00:02:04.590> here<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.870> just

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
mount it underneath here and you just

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.760 
mount it underneath here and you just
use<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> small<00:02:07.680> toggle<00:02:08.160> switch<00:02:08.369> which<00:02:09.560> runs<00:02:10.560> it

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
use a small toggle switch which runs it

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.810 
use a small toggle switch which runs it
from<00:02:10.980> one<00:02:11.190> side<00:02:11.430> or<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.700> other<00:02:13.610> so<00:02:14.610> now

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
from one side or the other so now

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.580 
from one side or the other so now
everything's<00:02:15.300> inside<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.930> cab<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.440> never

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
everything's inside the cab you never

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.090 
everything's inside the cab you never
have<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.950> reach<00:02:17.130> outside<00:02:18.500> it's<00:02:19.500> quite<00:02:19.740> easy<00:02:19.920> to

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
have to reach outside it's quite easy to

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.460 
have to reach outside it's quite easy to
operate<00:02:22.850> I<00:02:23.850> made<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.060> small<00:02:24.420> bracket<00:02:24.780> here<00:02:25.260> to

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
operate I made a small bracket here to

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.170 
operate I made a small bracket here to
carry<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.950> motor<00:02:26.160> off<00:02:26.430> of<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.670> back<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:27.090> the

little<00:02:32.580> motors<00:02:32.880> right<00:02:33.090> in<00:02:33.239> there<00:02:33.800> so<00:02:34.800> it's

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
little motors right in there so it's

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.160 
little motors right in there so it's
just<00:02:35.160> driving<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.700> same<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:37.470> same<00:02:37.770> screw<00:02:38.580> and

just driving the same the same screw and

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.870 
just driving the same the same screw and
I<00:02:40.170> just<00:02:40.500> made<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.680> coupling<00:02:41.160> here<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.580> couple<00:02:41.850> to

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
I just made a coupling here to couple to

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.140 
I just made a coupling here to couple to
the<00:02:42.090> motor<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:43.830> there's<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.220> close-up<00:02:44.550> of<00:02:44.940> the
