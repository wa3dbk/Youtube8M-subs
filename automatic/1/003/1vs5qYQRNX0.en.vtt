requirement<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.390> don't<00:00:24.570> have<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.900> have

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
requirement so you don't have to have

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.890 
requirement so you don't have to have
super<00:00:25.949> high<00:00:26.070> range<00:00:26.340> or<00:00:26.760> super<00:00:27.390> high<00:00:27.510> anything

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
super high range or super high anything

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.359 
super high range or super high anything
to<00:00:28.050> kill<00:00:28.199> them<00:00:28.349> honestly<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.920> would<00:00:29.220> just

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
to kill them honestly I would just

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.330 
to kill them honestly I would just
recommend<00:00:29.519> maybe<00:00:29.880> like<00:00:30.150> 75<00:00:30.929> maybe<00:00:31.500> 70<00:00:32.040> at<00:00:32.219> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
recommend maybe like 75 maybe 70 at the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.549 
recommend maybe like 75 maybe 70 at the
lowest<00:00:32.700> range<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.390> then<00:00:33.960> everything<00:00:34.380> else

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
lowest range and then everything else

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.319 
lowest range and then everything else
you<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:34.770> have<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.250> know<00:00:35.280> any<00:00:35.520> level<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.090> little

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
you can have you know any level a little

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.060 
you can have you know any level a little
bit<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.660> Defense<00:00:37.020> would<00:00:37.200> help<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.530> lot<00:00:37.739> but

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
bit of Defense would help a lot but

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.500 
bit of Defense would help a lot but
overall<00:00:38.610> they<00:00:38.820> don't<00:00:38.969> really<00:00:39.059> hit<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.360> that

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
overall they don't really hit you that

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.990 
overall they don't really hit you that
much<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.989> my<00:00:40.530> setup<00:00:40.800> for<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.250> most<00:00:41.460> part<00:00:41.790> I

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
much and my setup for the most part I

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.209 
much and my setup for the most part I
was<00:00:42.300> using<00:00:42.480> yak<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.710> know<00:00:43.829> banking

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
was using yak and you know banking

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.889 
was using yak and you know banking
everything<00:00:44.340> but<00:00:45.180> then<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.360> realized<00:00:45.719> there

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
everything but then I realized there

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.600 
everything but then I realized there
wasn't<00:00:46.200> really<00:00:46.260> anything<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.770> bank<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.219> then

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
wasn't really anything to bank and then

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.040 
wasn't really anything to bank and then
after<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:47.969> summoning<00:00:48.390> update<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.899> make

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
after that summoning update to make

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.350 
after that summoning update to make
summoning<00:00:49.620> familiars<00:00:50.129> more<00:00:50.430> useful<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:51.149> terms

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
summoning familiars more useful in terms

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.569 
summoning familiars more useful in terms
of<00:00:51.539> like<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> fighting<00:00:51.960> ones<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.469> switched<00:00:53.340> to

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
of like the fighting ones I switched to

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.520 
of like the fighting ones I switched to
the<00:00:53.789> steel<00:00:54.180> Titan<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.840> really<00:00:55.110> did<00:00:55.260> speed

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the steel Titan and it really did speed

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.799 
the steel Titan and it really did speed
up<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.800> kills<00:00:56.010> I'm<00:00:56.850> not<00:00:57.000> gonna<00:00:57.120> lie<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.360> really

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
up the kills I'm not gonna lie it really

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.360 
up the kills I'm not gonna lie it really
did<00:00:57.989> speed<00:00:58.230> up<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> kills<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.890> sped<00:00:59.160> up<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
did speed up the kills and sped up the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.459 
did speed up the kills and sped up the
tasks<00:00:59.789> by<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.359> think<00:01:00.870> like<00:01:00.989> five<00:01:01.230> minutes

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
tasks by I think like five minutes

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.219 
tasks by I think like five minutes
forgot<00:01:01.949> quicker<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.609> definitely<00:01:03.420> use<00:01:04.049> this

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
forgot quicker so definitely use this

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.469 
forgot quicker so definitely use this
steel<00:01:04.439> Titan<00:01:04.710> or<00:01:05.100> any<00:01:05.460> combat<00:01:05.909> familiar<00:01:06.360> that

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
steel Titan or any combat familiar that

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.090 
steel Titan or any combat familiar that
you<00:01:06.600> can<00:01:06.720> use<00:01:06.960> if<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.500> have<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.830> summoning

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
you can use if you have the summoning

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.590 
you can use if you have the summoning
level<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.430> guess<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.180> not<00:01:09.360> really

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
level I guess but it's not really

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.030 
level I guess but it's not really
required<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:10.140> mean<00:01:10.290> they're<00:01:10.439> super<00:01:10.740> easy<00:01:10.770> to

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
required I mean they're super easy to

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.370 
required I mean they're super easy to
kill<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:12.330> mean<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.659> experience<00:01:13.049> isn't<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
kill and I mean the experience isn't the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.399 
kill and I mean the experience isn't the
greatest<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.920> think<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.460> three<00:01:14.820> hours

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
greatest I think in like three hours

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.359 
greatest I think in like three hours
considering<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.500> video<00:01:16.770> took<00:01:16.860> like<00:01:17.130> two<00:01:17.280> to

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
considering this video took like two to

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.530 
considering this video took like two to
three<00:01:17.400> hours<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.880> don't<00:01:18.030> really<00:01:18.150> know<00:01:18.330> it's

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
three hours I don't really know it's

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.810 
three hours I don't really know it's
probably<00:01:18.630> like<00:01:18.930> two<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> half<00:01:19.439> on<00:01:20.400> total

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
probably like two and a half on total

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.530 
probably like two and a half on total
hours<00:01:21.150> but<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.659> got<00:01:22.409> 540<00:01:23.369> K<00:01:23.520> range<00:01:24.000> experience

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
hours but I got 540 K range experience

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.480 
hours but I got 540 K range experience
so<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.590> know<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:25.860> not<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.100> best<00:01:26.250> range

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
so you know it's not the best range

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.130 
so you know it's not the best range
experience<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.119> game<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.810> still

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
experience in the game but it is still

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.710 
experience in the game but it is still
like<00:01:28.320> 200<00:01:28.740> K<00:01:28.920> arranged<00:01:29.790> for<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.210> really<00:01:30.600> low

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
like 200 K arranged for a really low

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.940 
like 200 K arranged for a really low

decent and you guys will see in the
price<00:01:33.930> check<00:01:34.170> if<00:01:34.320> it's<00:01:34.500> worth<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.100> even

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
worth it to camp them if the ADI bars

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.260 
worth it to camp them if the ADI bars
ever<00:01:40.560> go<00:01:40.710> back<00:01:40.860> up<00:01:41.100> but<00:01:41.700> right<00:01:42.000> now<00:01:42.119> they're

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
do arma and not do these a B&amp;C but in my

tasks<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.689> any<00:02:07.049> kind<00:02:07.380> but<00:02:07.710> yeah<00:02:07.860> that's<00:02:08.069> just

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
tasks of any kind but yeah that's just

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.910 
tasks of any kind but yeah that's just
me<00:02:08.459> so<00:02:08.670> yeah<00:02:09.000> these<00:02:09.209> rates<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.840> mean<00:02:10.050> I'm<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.590> max

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
me so yeah these rates I mean I'm a max

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.680 
me so yeah these rates I mean I'm a max
player<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.489> obviously<00:02:11.940> I'm<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.300> lot<00:02:12.480> faster

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
player so obviously I'm a lot faster

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.130 
player so obviously I'm a lot faster
that

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
that

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.040 
that
like<00:02:13.380> a<00:02:13.410> level<00:02:13.920> 70<00:02:14.220> player<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:15.090> 200k<00:02:15.720> tower<00:02:15.930> I

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
like a level 70 player so 200k tower I

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.199 
like a level 70 player so 200k tower I
guess<00:02:16.350> isn't<00:02:16.740> that<00:02:16.950> plausible<00:02:17.430> if<00:02:17.880> you<00:02:18.000> don't

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
guess isn't that plausible if you don't

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.449 
guess isn't that plausible if you don't
have<00:02:18.420> ninety<00:02:18.750> nine<00:02:18.959> range<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:20.100> know<00:02:20.190> steel

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
have ninety nine range you know steel

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.280 
have ninety nine range you know steel
Titan<00:02:20.670> all<00:02:20.880> that<00:02:21.030> kind<00:02:21.240> of<00:02:21.300> stuff<00:02:21.420> but<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:22.050> could

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
Titan all that kind of stuff but I could

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.710 
Titan all that kind of stuff but I could
still<00:02:22.560> see<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:22.950> being<00:02:23.250> like<00:02:23.400> 150<00:02:24.240> K<00:02:24.390> per<00:02:24.569> hour

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
still see it being like 150 K per hour

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.960 
still see it being like 150 K per hour
at<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.110> lower<00:02:25.590> level<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:26.340> yeah<00:02:26.520> I<00:02:26.550> think<00:02:26.700> that's

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
at a lower level and yeah I think that's

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.280 
at a lower level and yeah I think that's
pretty<00:02:27.120> much<00:02:27.240> all<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.630> need<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.930> know<00:02:28.080> about

and then the runes are kind of mediocre
so<00:03:00.600> mainly<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.019> money<00:03:01.200> you're<00:03:01.380> gonna<00:03:01.440> get

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
so mainly the money you're gonna get

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.979 
so mainly the money you're gonna get
here<00:03:01.950> is<00:03:02.070> from<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.519> D<00:03:02.700> bars<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.390> that's<00:03:03.810> why

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
here is from the a D bars and that's why

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.620 
here is from the a D bars and that's why
people<00:03:04.500> even<00:03:04.830> kill<00:03:05.010> these<00:03:05.160> guys<00:03:05.310> so<00:03:05.670> let's

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
people even kill these guys so let's

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.360 
people even kill these guys so let's
price<00:03:06.840> check<00:03:07.050> pretty<00:03:07.320> quick<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:07.830> see<00:03:08.040> what<00:03:08.340> I

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
price check pretty quick and see what I

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.940 
price check pretty quick and see what I
actually<00:03:08.670> made<00:03:09.090> from<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.230> roughly<00:03:10.769> two<00:03:10.920> to

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
actually made from the roughly two to

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.820 
actually made from the roughly two to
three<00:03:11.220> hours<00:03:11.519> of<00:03:11.730> a<00:03:12.060> beam<00:03:12.360> C<00:03:12.570> so<00:03:13.170> it<00:03:13.350> netted<00:03:13.560> me

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
three hours of a beam C so it netted me

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.090 
three hours of a beam C so it netted me
around<00:03:14.280> 3.1<00:03:15.060> mill<00:03:15.560> you<00:03:16.560> can<00:03:16.680> probably<00:03:16.830> get<00:03:17.040> rid

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
around 3.1 mill you can probably get rid

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.830 
around 3.1 mill you can probably get rid
of<00:03:17.190> like<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.400> hundred<00:03:17.640> K<00:03:17.730> of<00:03:17.850> supplies<00:03:18.150> but<00:03:18.570> yeah

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
of like a hundred K of supplies but yeah

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.720 
of like a hundred K of supplies but yeah
three<00:03:19.260> mill<00:03:19.470> that's<00:03:19.709> not<00:03:19.950> too<00:03:20.310> horrible

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
three mill that's not too horrible

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.340 
three mill that's not too horrible
honestly<00:03:21.000> that's<00:03:21.420> like<00:03:21.570> about<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:21.900> mill<00:03:22.170> per

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
honestly that's like about a mill per

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.350 
honestly that's like about a mill per
hour<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:22.799> they're<00:03:23.280> very<00:03:23.430> easy<00:03:23.730> very<00:03:24.090> low

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
hour and they're very easy very low

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.390 
hour and they're very easy very low
requirements<00:03:24.989> so<00:03:25.140> if<00:03:25.290> you<00:03:25.440> wanted<00:03:25.739> to<00:03:25.860> get<00:03:26.010> you

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
requirements so if you wanted to get you

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.030 
requirements so if you wanted to get you
know<00:03:26.430> pretty<00:03:26.790> decent<00:03:27.209> money<00:03:27.329> and<00:03:27.630> okay<00:03:28.040> range

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
know pretty decent money and okay range

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.590 
know pretty decent money and okay range
experience<00:03:29.549> I<00:03:29.730> guess<00:03:29.910> you<00:03:30.090> could<00:03:30.239> kill<00:03:30.450> these

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
experience I guess you could kill these

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.810 
experience I guess you could kill these
guys<00:03:30.780> if<00:03:31.079> these<00:03:31.350> addy<00:03:31.620> bars<00:03:31.890> ever<00:03:32.160> go<00:03:32.340> back<00:03:32.549> up

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
guys if these addy bars ever go back up

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.630 
guys if these addy bars ever go back up
to<00:03:33.060> what<00:03:33.360> they<00:03:33.480> used<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.750> be<00:03:33.840> like<00:03:34.019> 4<00:03:34.290> K<00:03:34.640> then

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
to what they used to be like 4 K then

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.430 
to what they used to be like 4 K then
this<00:03:35.850> would<00:03:36.000> be<00:03:36.120> a<00:03:36.150> lot<00:03:36.570> more<00:03:36.750> viable<00:03:36.989> as<00:03:37.410> a

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
this would be a lot more viable as a

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.130 
this would be a lot more viable as a
method<00:03:37.860> but<00:03:38.400> because<00:03:38.940> of<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.299> recent<00:03:39.810> like

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
method but because of the recent like

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.860 
method but because of the recent like
artisans<00:03:40.650> workshop<00:03:40.829> and<00:03:41.600> double<00:03:42.600> experience

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
artisans workshop and double experience

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.060 
artisans workshop and double experience
weekend<00:03:43.320> they<00:03:43.440> still<00:03:43.650> haven't<00:03:43.920> recovered

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
weekend they still haven't recovered

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.880 
weekend they still haven't recovered
completely<00:03:44.630> so<00:03:45.630> that's<00:03:45.870> partly<00:03:46.500> why<00:03:46.709> it's

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
completely so that's partly why it's

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.880 
completely so that's partly why it's
only<00:03:46.980> 3.1<00:03:47.549> mill<00:03:47.790> so<00:03:48.090> if<00:03:48.840> you<00:03:48.989> you<00:03:49.230> know<00:03:49.350> updated

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
only 3.1 mill so if you you know updated

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.979 
only 3.1 mill so if you you know updated
the<00:03:49.950> prices<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.579> what<00:03:50.730> it<00:03:50.850> should<00:03:50.880> be<00:03:51.299> back

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
the prices to what it should be back

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.710 
the prices to what it should be back
when<00:03:52.230> addy<00:03:52.860> bars<00:03:53.160> were<00:03:53.400> at<00:03:53.549> a<00:03:53.579> fair<00:03:54.030> price<00:03:54.060> I

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
when addy bars were at a fair price I

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.090 
when addy bars were at a fair price I
would<00:03:55.019> say<00:03:55.110> probably<00:03:55.410> four<00:03:55.650> meals<00:03:55.829> a<00:03:55.950> good

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
would say probably four meals a good

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.490 
would say probably four meals a good
estimate<00:03:56.430> for<00:03:56.640> three<00:03:56.820> hours<00:03:56.940> so<00:03:57.390> yeah<00:03:58.170> pretty

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
estimate for three hours so yeah pretty

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.289 
estimate for three hours so yeah pretty
much<00:03:58.650> one<00:03:58.950> meal<00:03:59.130> per<00:03:59.160> hour<00:03:59.489> that<00:03:59.880> isn't

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
much one meal per hour that isn't

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.080 
much one meal per hour that isn't
horrible<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:00.810> I<00:04:01.320> still<00:04:02.160> enjoyed<00:04:02.459> this<00:04:02.640> loot

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
horrible I I still enjoyed this loot

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.789 
horrible I I still enjoyed this loot
video<00:04:03.329> I<00:04:03.390> mean<00:04:03.600> killing<00:04:04.140> them<00:04:04.320> on<00:04:04.410> Slayer<00:04:04.620> was

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
video I mean killing them on Slayer was

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.620 
video I mean killing them on Slayer was
kind<00:04:04.980> of<00:04:05.010> boring<00:04:05.220> because<00:04:05.579> you'd<00:04:06.030> go<00:04:06.269> from<00:04:06.540> a

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
kind of boring because you'd go from a

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.600 
kind of boring because you'd go from a
really<00:04:06.750> good<00:04:06.900> task<00:04:07.200> like<00:04:07.500> I<00:04:07.650> rats<00:04:07.920> to<00:04:08.250> like<00:04:08.459> you

terms of money in the experience but I
mean<00:04:12.329> it<00:04:12.420> was<00:04:12.510> different<00:04:12.720> from<00:04:13.140> you<00:04:13.530> know<00:04:13.650> just
