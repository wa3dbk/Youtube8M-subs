00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
we're in the Skoda Fabia don't get

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.330 
we're in the Skoda Fabia don't get
worried<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.259> do<00:01:22.470> get<00:01:22.619> color<00:01:22.830> options<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.280> you

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
managed to do is use high quality

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.289
