her they would put teddy bear in every
code<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.799> it's<00:01:32.310> from<00:01:32.820> her<00:01:33.150> they<00:01:33.479> got<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.750> idea

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
code and it's from her they got the idea

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.440 
code and it's from her they got the idea
of<00:01:34.110> sam<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.650> zombies<00:01:35.070> because<00:01:35.970> apparently<00:01:36.360> a

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
of sam in zombies because apparently a

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.929 
of sam in zombies because apparently a
name<00:01:36.600> was<00:01:36.750> Samantha<00:01:37.369> now<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.549> does<00:01:38.759> all

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
name was Samantha now this does all

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.210 
name was Samantha now this does all
sound<00:01:39.240> very<00:01:39.479> likely<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.380> could<00:01:40.530> be<00:01:40.560> true

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
sound very likely and it could be true

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.100 
sound very likely and it could be true
however<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.759> last<00:01:42.270> statement<00:01:42.450> about<00:01:42.810> her

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
however that last statement about her

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.200 
however that last statement about her
name<00:01:43.290> being<00:01:43.470> Samantha<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.280> have<00:01:44.549> evidence<00:01:44.909> to

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
name being Samantha I have evidence to

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.170 
name being Samantha I have evidence to
say<00:01:45.450> otherwise<00:01:45.720> but<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:47.159> may<00:01:47.340> be<00:01:47.369> reason<00:01:47.939> why

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
say otherwise but that may be reason why

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.700 
say otherwise but that may be reason why
