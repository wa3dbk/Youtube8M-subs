one<00:00:42.910> of<00:00:43.030> the<00:00:43.180> things<00:00:43.570> that<00:00:43.720> I've<00:00:43.840> devised<00:00:44.140> on

one of the things that I've devised on

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.080 
one of the things that I've devised on
my<00:00:44.530> farm<00:00:44.800> for<00:00:45.780> fly<00:00:46.780> prevention<00:00:47.410> is<00:00:48.070> I<00:00:48.670> guess

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
my farm for fly prevention is I guess

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.880 
my farm for fly prevention is I guess
the<00:00:49.210> thing<00:00:49.390> that's<00:00:49.600> come<00:00:50.079> to<00:00:50.230> be<00:00:50.260> known<00:00:50.530> as<00:00:50.770> the

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
the thing that's come to be known as the

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:51.540 
the thing that's come to be known as the
fly<00:00:51.100> barrel

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
fly barrel

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.330 
fly barrel
it's<00:00:52.210> basically<00:00:53.020> an<00:00:53.230> expanded<00:00:53.800> version<00:00:53.980> of

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
it's basically an expanded version of

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.490 
it's basically an expanded version of
the<00:00:54.400> little<00:00:55.000> one<00:00:55.300> gallon<00:00:55.660> containers<00:00:56.200> that

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
the little one gallon containers that

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.430 
the little one gallon containers that
you<00:00:56.950> put<00:00:57.129> a<00:00:57.390> bait<00:00:58.390> for<00:00:58.750> the<00:00:58.870> attractant<00:00:59.379> for

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
you put a bait for the attractant for

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.009 
you put a bait for the attractant for
the<00:00:59.650> Flies<00:00:59.860> in<00:01:00.129> into<00:01:00.550> it<00:01:00.699> the<00:01:01.239> flies<00:01:01.480> fly<00:01:01.780> in

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
the Flies in into it the flies fly in

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:03.390 
the Flies in into it the flies fly in
there's<00:01:02.410> a<00:01:02.470> little<00:01:02.680> liquid<00:01:02.830> in<00:01:03.040> the<00:01:03.129> bottom

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
there's a little liquid in the bottom

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.829 
there's a little liquid in the bottom
they<00:01:03.519> get<00:01:03.699> trapped<00:01:03.940> and<00:01:04.210> they<00:01:04.269> can't<00:01:04.510> get<00:01:04.660> out

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
they get trapped and they can't get out

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.370 
they get trapped and they can't get out
so<00:01:05.500> this<00:01:05.740> is<00:01:05.979> is<00:01:06.310> basically<00:01:06.700> just<00:01:06.970> an<00:01:07.810> expanded

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
so this is is basically just an expanded

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.530 
so this is is basically just an expanded
version<00:01:08.710> of<00:01:08.830> that<00:01:09.040> I<00:01:09.250> took<00:01:09.910> a<00:01:09.940> 55-gallon

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
version of that I took a 55-gallon

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.160 
version of that I took a 55-gallon
barrel<00:01:11.400> kind<00:01:12.400> of<00:01:12.460> hole<00:01:12.610> on<00:01:12.759> the<00:01:12.880> top<00:01:13.090> and<00:01:13.720> put<00:01:13.780> a

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
barrel kind of hole on the top and put a

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.260 
barrel kind of hole on the top and put a
big<00:01:14.500> piece<00:01:14.710> of<00:01:14.740> plexiglass<00:01:15.460> for<00:01:15.820> for<00:01:16.180> the

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
big piece of plexiglass for for the

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.999 
big piece of plexiglass for for the
light<00:01:16.450> so<00:01:16.810> when<00:01:16.990> flying<00:01:17.259> one<00:01:17.680> throw<00:01:17.860> in<00:01:17.920> the

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
light so when flying one throw in the

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:19.580 
light so when flying one throw in the
barrel<00:01:18.280> they<00:01:18.399> fly<00:01:18.610> towards<00:01:18.940> the<00:01:19.030> light

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
barrel they fly towards the light

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.980 
barrel they fly towards the light
there's<00:01:20.590> about<00:01:21.240> eight<00:01:22.240> to<00:01:22.479> ten<00:01:22.660> inches<00:01:22.690> of

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
there's about eight to ten inches of

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.680 
there's about eight to ten inches of
water<00:01:23.289> in<00:01:23.440> the<00:01:23.590> bottom<00:01:23.979> with<00:01:24.670> a<00:01:24.940> few<00:01:25.240> drops<00:01:25.509> of

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
water in the bottom with a few drops of

dish<00:01:25.899> soap<00:01:25.930> as<00:01:26.289> a<00:01:26.320> suspect<00:01:26.830> and<00:01:27.009> so<00:01:27.160> when<00:01:27.280> the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
dish soap as a suspect and so when the

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.389 
dish soap as a suspect and so when the
Flies<00:01:27.550> get<00:01:27.820> in<00:01:27.970> it<00:01:28.119> they<00:01:28.360> they<00:01:29.020> drown<00:01:29.259> and<00:01:30.190> then

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
Flies get in it they they drown and then

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.570 
Flies get in it they they drown and then
the<00:01:30.550> entrance<00:01:31.000> is<00:01:31.300> on<00:01:31.770> there's<00:01:32.770> there's<00:01:33.280> four

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.779 
the entrance is on there's there's four
PVC<00:01:34.210> pipes<00:01:34.990> on<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.259> sides<00:01:35.590> with<00:01:36.340> an<00:01:36.490> elbow

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
PVC pipes on the sides with an elbow

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.210 
PVC pipes on the sides with an elbow
that<00:01:36.820> goes<00:01:37.210> in<00:01:37.479> and<00:01:37.810> down<00:01:38.140> through<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:39.009> Flies

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
that goes in and down through the Flies

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.330 
that goes in and down through the Flies
fly<00:01:39.550> into<00:01:39.940> the<00:01:40.090> barrel<00:01:40.830> they<00:01:41.830> see<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.160> light

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
fly into the barrel they see the light

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.249 
fly into the barrel they see the light
from<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.850> top<00:01:42.880> window<00:01:43.300> and<00:01:43.660> they<00:01:43.720> fly<00:01:43.899> towards

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
from the top window and they fly towards

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:45.690 
from the top window and they fly towards
the<00:01:44.289> light<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:44.560> they<00:01:45.009> don't<00:01:45.039> know<00:01:45.280> how<00:01:45.430> to<00:01:45.460> get

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
the light and they don't know how to get

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.650 
the light and they don't know how to get
out<00:01:45.850> and<00:01:46.349> to<00:01:47.349> get<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.679> fibril<00:01:48.069> started

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
out and to get the fibril started

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.790 
out and to get the fibril started
basically<00:01:49.660> you<00:01:49.750> just<00:01:49.810> need<00:01:50.020> to<00:01:50.229> use<00:01:50.349> something

basically you just need to use something
that<00:01:50.830> doesn't<00:01:51.459> smell<00:01:52.149> very<00:01:52.209> good<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:53.590> know

awful<00:02:01.179> and<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.450> Flies<00:02:01.660> will<00:02:01.869> go<00:02:01.990> for<00:02:02.289> it<00:02:02.319> and

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
awful and the Flies will go for it and

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.499 
awful and the Flies will go for it and
and<00:02:02.890> once<00:02:03.459> you've<00:02:03.610> got<00:02:03.789> enough<00:02:04.030> flies<00:02:04.240> in

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
and once you've got enough flies in

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.960 
and once you've got enough flies in
there<00:02:04.720> I<00:02:04.899> just<00:02:05.140> use<00:02:05.649> like<00:02:06.160> a<00:02:06.220> little<00:02:06.399> aquarium

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
there I just use like a little aquarium

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.449 
there I just use like a little aquarium
fish<00:02:07.179> net<00:02:07.450> to<00:02:08.080> dip<00:02:08.259> out<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.590> dead<00:02:08.770> flies<00:02:09.069> and

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
fish net to dip out the dead flies and

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.940 
fish net to dip out the dead flies and
as<00:02:10.300> a<00:02:10.390> flies<00:02:10.750> decompose<00:02:11.440> in<00:02:11.650> there<00:02:11.800> they

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
as a flies decompose in there they

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.309 
as a flies decompose in there they
continue<00:02:12.489> to<00:02:12.520> to<00:02:13.090> make<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.450> own<00:02:13.569> attractive

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
continue to to make the own attractive

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.410 
continue to to make the own attractive
so<00:02:14.590> is<00:02:14.709> it<00:02:14.890> all<00:02:15.310> summer<00:02:15.670> long<00:02:15.760> when<00:02:16.120> it's<00:02:16.270> hot

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
so is it all summer long when it's hot

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.420 
so is it all summer long when it's hot
out<00:02:16.599> if<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:16.900> smells<00:02:17.200> pretty<00:02:17.290> bad<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:17.920> and

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
out if it smells pretty bad and and

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.710 
out if it smells pretty bad and and
fills<00:02:18.790> up<00:02:18.970> with<00:02:19.000> lice<00:02:20.310> so<00:02:21.310> how<00:02:21.849> many<00:02:21.910> flies<00:02:22.420> did

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
fills up with lice so how many flies did

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.640 
fills up with lice so how many flies did
you<00:02:22.840> get<00:02:23.020> recently<00:02:23.530> oh<00:02:24.090> well<00:02:25.090> I<00:02:25.380> got<00:02:26.380> three

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
you get recently oh well I got three

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.280 
you get recently oh well I got three
bales<00:02:26.860> of<00:02:27.190> these<00:02:27.310> on<00:02:27.489> my<00:02:27.520> farm<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:29.170> other

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
bales of these on my farm and the other

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.260 
bales of these on my farm and the other
day<00:02:29.530> I<00:02:29.560> went<00:02:29.860> around<00:02:29.980> with<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.700> five<00:02:30.880> gallon

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
day I went around with the five gallon

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.780 
day I went around with the five gallon
bucket<00:02:31.630> and<00:02:31.780> my<00:02:32.050> left<00:02:32.470> my

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
bucket and my left my

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:41.140 
bucket and my left my
bitman<00:02:33.769> fill<00:02:34.769> the<00:02:34.920> whole<00:02:35.040> 5-gallon<00:02:35.640> bucket

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.670 

today<00:02:42.150> we're<00:02:42.810> trying<00:02:43.049> to<00:02:43.140> estimate<00:02:43.230> how<00:02:43.620> many

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
today we're trying to estimate how many

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.259 
today we're trying to estimate how many
flies<00:02:44.069> were<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:44.400> there<00:02:44.579> and<00:02:44.700> we<00:02:44.849> come<00:02:45.000> up<00:02:45.180> with

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
flies were in there and we come up with

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.970 
flies were in there and we come up with
a<00:02:45.329> round<00:02:45.569> figure<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:45.959> about<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.349> million<00:02:46.620> flies

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
a round figure of about a million flies

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.789 
a round figure of about a million flies
so<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.000> was<00:02:48.420> pretty<00:02:48.930> happy<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.440> think<00:02:49.680> that

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
so I was pretty happy to think that

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.080 
so I was pretty happy to think that
there's<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.040> million<00:02:50.280> flies<00:02:50.610> they<00:02:50.879> weren't

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
there's a million flies they weren't

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.930 
there's a million flies they weren't
bugging<00:02:51.420> my<00:02:51.569> cows<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:52.709> how<00:02:52.920> often<00:02:53.549> do<00:02:53.849> you

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
bugging my cows and so how often do you

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.839 
bugging my cows and so how often do you
have<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.239> clean<00:02:54.390> out<00:02:54.659> those<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.200> fly<00:02:55.409> traps

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
have to clean out those the fly traps

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.130 
have to clean out those the fly traps
depends<00:02:56.849> on<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.000> time<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.209> year<00:02:57.329> yeah<00:02:57.900> you

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
depends on the time of year yeah you

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.780 
depends on the time of year yeah you
know<00:02:58.200> it<00:02:58.500> depends<00:02:58.920> on<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.099> fly<00:02:59.280> level<00:02:59.640> on<00:02:59.760> a

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
know it depends on the fly level on a

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.309 
know it depends on the fly level on a
cool<00:03:00.060> day<00:03:00.090> like<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:00.810> know<00:03:00.900> that<00:03:01.079> we're<00:03:01.200> gonna

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
cool day like you know that we're gonna

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.289 
cool day like you know that we're gonna
get<00:03:01.500> today<00:03:01.799> in<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.099> next<00:03:02.340> few<00:03:02.519> days<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:03.090> fly

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
get today in the next few days the fly

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.940 
get today in the next few days the fly
levels<00:03:03.720> really<00:03:03.900> drop<00:03:04.200> down<00:03:04.439> and<00:03:04.680> they<00:03:04.739> stay

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
levels really drop down and they stay

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.710 
levels really drop down and they stay
pretty<00:03:05.220> dormant<00:03:05.489> but<00:03:05.909> when<00:03:06.060> it's<00:03:06.209> hot<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.599> dry

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
pretty dormant but when it's hot and dry

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.110 
pretty dormant but when it's hot and dry
and<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.530> Flies<00:03:07.739> are<00:03:07.769> active<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:09.030> know<00:03:09.090> I

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
and the Flies are active you know I

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.849 
and the Flies are active you know I
might<00:03:09.299> have<00:03:09.329> to<00:03:09.569> scoop<00:03:10.109> them<00:03:10.260> out<00:03:10.379> every<00:03:10.680> week

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
might have to scoop them out every week

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.729 
might have to scoop them out every week
and<00:03:11.870> they<00:03:12.870> just<00:03:13.049> keep<00:03:13.200> working<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:13.650> know

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
and they just keep working you know

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:14.930 
and they just keep working you know
that's<00:03:13.889> the<00:03:13.980> nice<00:03:14.129> thing<00:03:14.159> about<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.639> barrels

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
that's the nice thing about the barrels

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.210 
that's the nice thing about the barrels
is<00:03:15.060> once<00:03:15.209> you've<00:03:15.359> got<00:03:15.389> them<00:03:15.629> started<00:03:16.220> there's

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
is once you've got them started there's

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.830 
is once you've got them started there's
you<00:03:17.819> know<00:03:17.849> there's<00:03:18.030> really<00:03:18.150> nothing<00:03:18.569> to<00:03:18.599> do

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
you know there's really nothing to do

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.809 
you know there's really nothing to do
nothing<00:03:19.079> to<00:03:19.290> add<00:03:19.530> nothing<00:03:19.889> to<00:03:20.099> worry<00:03:20.579> about

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
nothing to add nothing to worry about

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.640 
nothing to add nothing to worry about
you<00:03:21.000> just<00:03:21.209> drive<00:03:21.659> by<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.079> scoop<00:03:22.319> off<00:03:22.470> the

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
you just drive by and scoop off the

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.379 
you just drive by and scoop off the
Flies<00:03:22.889> and<00:03:22.920> then<00:03:23.340> they<00:03:23.639> keep<00:03:23.819> working<00:03:24.120> for<00:03:24.150> it

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
Flies and then they keep working for it

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.050 
Flies and then they keep working for it
I<00:03:24.480> see<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.930> have<00:03:25.139> it<00:03:25.319> near<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:26.190> place<00:03:26.700> where<00:03:26.940> the

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
I see you have it near a place where the

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.910 
I see you have it near a place where the
cattle<00:03:27.450> will<00:03:27.629> congregate<00:03:28.200> near<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.680> water

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
cattle will congregate near the water

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.949 
cattle will congregate near the water
tank<00:03:29.280> there<00:03:29.579> no<00:03:30.060> one<00:03:30.269> though<00:03:30.450> when<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.780> cows

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
tank there no one though when the cows

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.539 
tank there no one though when the cows
come<00:03:31.290> in<00:03:31.409> there's<00:03:31.590> lots<00:03:31.799> of<00:03:31.920> flies<00:03:32.129> on<00:03:32.159> them

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
come in there's lots of flies on them

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.550 
come in there's lots of flies on them
any<00:03:32.639> time<00:03:32.879> the<00:03:33.000> cows<00:03:33.180> move<00:03:33.480> around<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.959> flies

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
any time the cows move around the flies

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.649 
any time the cows move around the flies
off<00:03:34.829> and<00:03:35.159> the<00:03:35.819> Flies<00:03:36.030> will<00:03:36.329> look<00:03:36.510> to

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
off and the Flies will look to

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.960 
off and the Flies will look to
congregate<00:03:37.260> on<00:03:37.290> on<00:03:37.709> you<00:03:38.280> know<00:03:38.340> solid<00:03:38.639> dark

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
fence post right behind it will be

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.129 
fence post right behind it will be
covered<00:03:44.220> in<00:03:44.400> flies<00:03:44.699> so<00:03:45.540> I<00:03:45.599> sent<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:45.930> pole

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
covered in flies so I sent the pole

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.860 
covered in flies so I sent the pole
right<00:03:46.379> next<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.970> five<00:03:48.449> rail<00:03:48.660> right

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
right next to the the five rail right

right next to the the five rail right
next<00:03:49.079> to<00:03:49.139> the<00:03:49.230> pole<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.680> when<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.430> cows

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
next to the pole and when the cows

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.280 
next to the pole and when the cows
walked<00:03:50.970> by<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.239> whole<00:03:51.540> side<00:03:51.780> of<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.959> barrel

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
walked by the whole side of the barrel

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.379 
walked by the whole side of the barrel
becomes<00:03:52.650> covered<00:03:53.010> with<00:03:53.160> flies<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.940> as<00:03:54.209> we're

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
becomes covered with flies and as we're

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.509 
becomes covered with flies and as we're
milking<00:03:54.629> all<00:03:55.019> those<00:03:55.260> flies<00:03:55.530> we'll<00:03:55.799> slowly<00:03:56.129> you

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
milking all those flies we'll slowly you

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:57.890 
milking all those flies we'll slowly you
know<00:03:56.579> filter<00:03:56.940> their<00:03:57.120> way<00:03:57.209> into<00:03:57.389> the<00:03:57.599> barrel

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
know filter their way into the barrel

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.830 
know filter their way into the barrel
the<00:03:58.889> other<00:03:59.040> thing<00:03:59.310> that<00:03:59.340> I've<00:04:00.209> noticed<00:04:00.449> is

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
the other thing that I've noticed is

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.240 
the other thing that I've noticed is
that<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:01.079> color<00:04:01.290> of<00:04:01.379> the<00:04:01.470> barrel<00:04:01.769> makes<00:04:01.949> a<00:04:02.069> big

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
that the color of the barrel makes a big

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.949 
that the color of the barrel makes a big
difference<00:04:02.639> that<00:04:02.910> a<00:04:02.940> darker<00:04:03.449> barrel<00:04:03.810> will

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
difference that a darker barrel will

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.409 
difference that a darker barrel will
attract<00:04:04.290> flies<00:04:04.530> from<00:04:04.980> farther<00:04:05.190> away<00:04:05.419> because

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
attract flies from farther away because

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.180 
attract flies from farther away because
flies<00:04:06.660> tend<00:04:07.019> to<00:04:07.109> look<00:04:07.260> for<00:04:07.530> you<00:04:07.829> know<00:04:07.919> a<00:04:07.949> cow

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
flies tend to look for you know a cow

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.250 
flies tend to look for you know a cow
like<00:04:08.489> object<00:04:09.120> so<00:04:09.870> they'll<00:04:10.079> look<00:04:10.199> for

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
like object so they'll look for

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.069 
like object so they'll look for
something<00:04:10.769> dark<00:04:11.030> and<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.569> other<00:04:12.690> thing<00:04:12.930> is

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
something dark and the other thing is

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.930 
something dark and the other thing is
the<00:04:13.260> dark<00:04:13.440> barrel<00:04:13.889> you<00:04:14.370> know<00:04:14.430> warms<00:04:14.760> the

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
the dark barrel you know warms the

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.909 
the dark barrel you know warms the
inside<00:04:15.599> of<00:04:15.690> the<00:04:15.780> barrel<00:04:15.959> up<00:04:16.169> to<00:04:16.500> keep<00:04:16.680> that

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
inside of the barrel up to keep that

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.569 
inside of the barrel up to keep that
bait<00:04:17.159> in<00:04:17.430> there<00:04:17.699> you're<00:04:18.090> really<00:04:18.419> smelling<00:04:18.720> it

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
bait in there you're really smelling it

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.060 
bait in there you're really smelling it
and<00:04:20.579> I<00:04:21.000> have<00:04:21.209> I<00:04:21.539> always<00:04:22.380> have<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:22.560> barrel<00:04:22.919> right

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
and I have I always have a barrel right

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
next to each water tank and then I've

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.750 
next to each water tank and then I've
got<00:04:25.199> one<00:04:25.229> other<00:04:25.530> barrel<00:04:25.949> that<00:04:26.070> I<00:04:26.130> will<00:04:26.340> that's

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
barrel

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.670 
barrel
you<00:04:33.520> know<00:04:33.580> in<00:04:33.700> the<00:04:33.820> vicinity<00:04:34.090> there<00:04:34.540> and<00:04:34.990> you

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
you know in the vicinity there and you

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.900 
you know in the vicinity there and you
kind<00:04:35.920> of<00:04:35.950> leave<00:04:36.130> it<00:04:36.160> even<00:04:36.460> a<00:04:36.520> couple<00:04:36.700> days

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
kind of leave it even a couple days

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.430 
kind of leave it even a couple days
afterwards<00:04:37.330> to<00:04:37.600> help<00:04:37.750> clean<00:04:37.960> up<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.140> flies

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
afterwards to help clean up the flies

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.820 
afterwards to help clean up the flies
that<00:04:38.470> remain<00:04:39.390> and<00:04:40.390> and<00:04:40.810> probably<00:04:41.350> -<00:04:41.560> this

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
that remain and and probably - this

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.270 
that remain and and probably - this
prevents<00:04:42.520> more<00:04:42.850> flies<00:04:43.390> from<00:04:44.280> continuously

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
prevents more flies from continuously

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.190 
prevents more flies from continuously
reproducing<00:04:46.090> it<00:04:46.330> really<00:04:46.570> helps<00:04:46.810> break<00:04:47.050> that

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
reproducing it really helps break that

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.800 
reproducing it really helps break that
one<00:04:47.380> I<00:04:47.530> know<00:04:48.070> and<00:04:48.370> I<00:04:48.790> guess<00:04:49.000> in<00:04:49.150> addition<00:04:49.630> to

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
one I know and I guess in addition to

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.710 
one I know and I guess in addition to
the<00:04:49.990> fly<00:04:50.590> barrel<00:04:51.060> with<00:04:52.060> our<00:04:52.210> rotational

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
grazing system I manage our pastures so

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.540 
grazing system I manage our pastures so
that<00:04:55.090> the<00:04:55.450> cows<00:04:55.660> are<00:04:55.990> in<00:04:56.290> one<00:04:56.620> pasture<00:04:56.860> close
