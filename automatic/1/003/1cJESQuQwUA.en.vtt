00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
but it is also in my opinion the most

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.260 
but it is also in my opinion the most
powerful

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270

you<00:02:37.290> know<00:02:37.410> all<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.220> other<00:02:38.430> companies<00:02:38.550> that

make screens they're pretty much the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.610

best Samsung maybe even will go better

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.220

in<00:02:43.620> terms<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:44.040> screen<00:02:44.340> size<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:45.090> PS<00:02:45.900> vita

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
in terms of screen size the PS vita

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.620 
in terms of screen size the PS vita
screen<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:46.860> almost<00:02:47.250> as<00:02:47.490> large<00:02:47.550> as<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.150> entire

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
screen is almost as large as the entire

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.750 
screen is almost as large as the entire
device<00:02:48.990> itself<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:50.130> you<00:02:50.190> are<00:02:50.430> getting<00:02:50.700> a

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
device itself so you are getting a

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.230 
device itself so you are getting a
smaller<00:02:51.060> screen<00:02:51.390> on<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.720> smartphone<00:02:52.490> but<00:02:53.490> in

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
smaller screen on the smartphone but in

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.590 
smaller screen on the smartphone but in
comparison<00:02:54.960> to<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.410> size<00:02:55.620> and<00:02:56.010> like<00:02:56.670> you<00:02:57.510> know

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
comparison to the size and like you know

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.520 
comparison to the size and like you know
pixel<00:02:58.440> per<00:02:58.650> inch<00:02:59.090> PPI<00:03:00.320> they're<00:03:01.320> almost

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
pixel per inch PPI they're almost

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.220 
pixel per inch PPI they're almost
identical<00:03:01.800> I<00:03:02.250> mean<00:03:02.430> their<00:03:03.030> colors<00:03:03.870> are<00:03:04.020> both

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
identical I mean their colors are both

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.090 
identical I mean their colors are both
fantastic<00:03:05.570> but<00:03:06.570> really<00:03:07.200> it's<00:03:07.980> not

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
fantastic but really it's not

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.920 
fantastic but really it's not
necessarily<00:03:08.820> about<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.210> display<00:03:09.570> itself

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
necessarily about the display itself

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.720 
necessarily about the display itself
it's<00:03:10.440> what's<00:03:10.710> coming<00:03:10.860> out<00:03:11.250> of<00:03:11.310> it

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
it's what's coming out of it

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.770 
it's what's coming out of it
so<00:03:12.210> as<00:03:12.720> we<00:03:13.260> all<00:03:13.350> know<00:03:13.500> PS<00:03:14.130> Vita<00:03:14.370> actually<00:03:14.820> maybe

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
so as we all know PS Vita actually maybe

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.990 
so as we all know PS Vita actually maybe
not<00:03:15.870> in<00:03:16.110> front<00:03:16.230> but<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.650> PSP<00:03:17.040> that<00:03:17.220> has<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.640> quad

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
not in front but the PSP that has a quad

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.510 
not in front but the PSP that has a quad
core<00:03:18.209> processor<00:03:18.560> 512<00:03:19.560> megabytes<00:03:19.920> of<00:03:20.010> RAM<00:03:20.250> and

this has a dual core processor 1
gigabyte<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.520> RAM<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:27.000> I<00:03:27.060> don't<00:03:27.720> believe<00:03:27.900> it

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990

has<00:03:28.080> any<00:03:28.320> video<00:03:28.650> RAM<00:03:28.860> so<00:03:29.100> it<00:03:29.190> is<00:03:29.810> faster<00:03:30.810> in

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
has any video RAM so it is faster in

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.770 
has any video RAM so it is faster in
terms<00:03:31.260> of<00:03:31.800> RAM<00:03:32.430> which<00:03:33.240> doesn't<00:03:33.450> actually<00:03:33.570> make

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
terms of RAM which doesn't actually make

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.860 
terms of RAM which doesn't actually make
it<00:03:33.930> faster<00:03:34.260> but<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:34.860> does<00:03:35.040> have<00:03:35.220> more<00:03:35.400> RAM

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
it faster but it does have more RAM

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.260 
it faster but it does have more RAM
overall<00:03:36.870> but<00:03:37.650> that<00:03:38.130> being<00:03:38.340> said<00:03:38.670> the

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
overall but that being said the

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.000 
overall but that being said the
PlayStation<00:03:39.870> Vita<00:03:39.959> is<00:03:40.200> much<00:03:40.470> more<00:03:40.709> of<00:03:40.920> a

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
PlayStation Vita is much more of a

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.560 
PlayStation Vita is much more of a
graphic<00:03:41.340> powerhouse<00:03:42.240> so<00:03:44.000> you<00:03:45.000> know<00:03:45.090> if<00:03:45.209> you're

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
graphic powerhouse so you know if you're

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.560 
graphic powerhouse so you know if you're
thinking<00:03:45.800> smartphone<00:03:46.800> versus<00:03:47.250> uh<00:03:47.330> vs.<00:03:48.330> Vita

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
thinking smartphone versus uh vs. Vita

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.570 
thinking smartphone versus uh vs. Vita
it's<00:03:48.900> not<00:03:49.140> necessarily<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:49.920> it<00:03:50.580> is<00:03:50.670> a<00:03:50.700> fair<00:03:52.580> call

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
it's not necessarily a it is a fair call

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.580 
it's not necessarily a it is a fair call
because<00:03:54.060> you<00:03:54.240> know<00:03:54.330> they<00:03:54.510> are<00:03:54.690> about<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.440> same

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
because you know they are about the same

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.290 
because you know they are about the same
price<00:03:55.800> range<00:03:56.130> they<00:03:56.520> are<00:03:56.550> about<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.120> same<00:03:57.240> size

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
price range they are about the same size

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.940 
price range they are about the same size
and<00:03:57.780> they<00:03:57.870> are<00:03:57.959> about<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.410> same<00:03:58.590> you<00:03:58.890> know

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
and they are about the same you know

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.830 
and they are about the same you know
they're<00:03:59.100> both<00:03:59.190> gonna<00:03:59.370> be<00:03:59.430> carried<00:03:59.880> around<00:04:00.000> but

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
they're both gonna be carried around but

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.620 
they're both gonna be carried around but
the<00:04:01.260> smart<00:04:01.650> phone<00:04:01.800> is<00:04:01.980> made<00:04:02.250> for<00:04:02.610> basically<00:04:03.090> to

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
the smart phone is made for basically to

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.229 
the smart phone is made for basically to
be<00:04:03.750> your<00:04:04.080> phone<00:04:04.350> your<00:04:04.800> your<00:04:05.430> manager<00:04:06.000> and

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
be your phone your your manager and

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.120 
be your phone your your manager and
basically<00:04:06.989> you<00:04:07.320> know<00:04:07.410> something<00:04:07.800> you<00:04:07.860> always

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
basically you know something you always

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.030

great games don't get me wrong but

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:43.290 
great games don't get me wrong but
they're<00:04:41.530> not<00:04:41.740> even<00:04:42.190> close<00:04:42.460> to<00:04:42.729> the<00:04:42.820> level<00:04:42.970> of

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
they're not even close to the level of

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.920 
they're not even close to the level of
you<00:04:43.509> know<00:04:43.539> uncharted<00:04:44.199> so<00:04:45.509> that's<00:04:46.509> the<00:04:46.720> kind<00:04:46.900> of

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
you know uncharted so that's the kind of

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.659 
you know uncharted so that's the kind of
comparison<00:04:47.320> I'm<00:04:47.650> giving<00:04:47.919> between<00:04:48.250> these<00:04:48.400> two

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
comparison I'm giving between these two

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.540 
comparison I'm giving between these two
yes<00:04:49.479> this<00:04:49.630> one<00:04:49.810> does<00:04:49.960> have<00:04:50.139> 4G<00:04:50.620> antenna<00:04:51.070> this

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
yes this one does have 4G antenna this

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.330 
yes this one does have 4G antenna this
one<00:04:51.699> only<00:04:51.849> maxes<00:04:52.630> out<00:04:52.750> a<00:04:52.810> 3G<00:04:53.440> if<00:04:53.680> you<00:04:53.949> if<00:04:54.250> you

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
one only maxes out a 3G if you if you

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.310 
one only maxes out a 3G if you if you
purchased<00:04:54.699> that<00:04:54.789> one<00:04:54.970> III<00:04:55.419> don't<00:04:55.780> have<00:04:55.990> that<00:04:56.289> I

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
purchased that one III don't have that I

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.610 
purchased that one III don't have that I
just<00:04:56.590> have<00:04:56.680> my<00:04:56.860> Wi-Fi<00:04:57.160> version<00:04:57.220> but<00:04:58.020> still<00:04:59.020> you

just have my Wi-Fi version but still you
know<00:04:59.680> a<00:04:59.889> good<00:05:00.190> a<00:05:00.250> good<00:05:00.699> comparison<00:05:01.000> now<00:05:02.220> PSP<00:05:03.220> go

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
know a good a good comparison now PSP go

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.879 
know a good a good comparison now PSP go
I<00:05:04.389> already<00:05:04.840> talked<00:05:05.050> about<00:05:05.139> how<00:05:05.289> the<00:05:05.410> games<00:05:05.710> are

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
I already talked about how the games are

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.890 
I already talked about how the games are
so<00:05:06.160> much<00:05:06.370> much<00:05:06.580> superior<00:05:06.940> screen<00:05:07.690> odds

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
so much much superior screen odds

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.900 
so much much superior screen odds
obviously<00:05:08.349> superior<00:05:08.680> it<00:05:09.009> it's<00:05:09.370> Sony<00:05:09.759> they're

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
obviously superior it it's Sony they're

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.670 
obviously superior it it's Sony they're
gonna<00:05:10.030> improve<00:05:10.509> on<00:05:10.720> whatever<00:05:10.900> they<00:05:11.169> created

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
gonna improve on whatever they created

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.939 
gonna improve on whatever they created
now<00:05:12.580> the<00:05:12.639> one<00:05:13.150> thing<00:05:13.570> I<00:05:13.780> will<00:05:14.050> say<00:05:14.080> is<00:05:14.680> that<00:05:14.860> the

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 
now the one thing I will say is that the

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:17.670 
now the one thing I will say is that the
PSP<00:05:15.430> go<00:05:15.639> that<00:05:16.270> has<00:05:16.419> above<00:05:16.900> the<00:05:17.110> via<00:05:17.320> its

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
PSP go that has above the via its

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.649 
PSP go that has above the via its
internal<00:05:18.550> storage<00:05:18.940> the<00:05:19.150> one<00:05:19.330> thing<00:05:19.539> that

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:19.659 
internal storage the one thing that

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:21.330 
internal storage the one thing that
people<00:05:19.750> didn't<00:05:20.199> like<00:05:20.349> about<00:05:20.500> it<00:05:20.650> now<00:05:21.280> the

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
people didn't like about it now the

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.250 
people didn't like about it now the
reason<00:05:21.669> I<00:05:21.760> say<00:05:21.970> that<00:05:22.000> is<00:05:22.150> because<00:05:22.389> the<00:05:22.659> PS<00:05:22.930> Vita

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
reason I say that is because the PS Vita

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.740 
reason I say that is because the PS Vita
doesn't<00:05:23.710> have<00:05:23.919> any<00:05:24.250> internal<00:05:24.849> storage<00:05:25.300> at<00:05:25.510> all

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
doesn't have any internal storage at all

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.750 
doesn't have any internal storage at all
I<00:05:25.990> think<00:05:26.800> this<00:05:26.919> should<00:05:27.039> have<00:05:27.159> opted<00:05:27.490> in<00:05:27.610> at

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:27.760 
I think this should have opted in at

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.330 
I think this should have opted in at
least<00:05:28.090> for<00:05:28.510> probably<00:05:29.380> 16<00:05:29.889> would<00:05:30.099> have<00:05:30.220> been

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
least for probably 16 would have been

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.029 
least for probably 16 would have been
more<00:05:30.639> sufficient<00:05:31.000> and<00:05:31.419> the<00:05:32.409> the<00:05:32.650> memory<00:05:32.860> card

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
more sufficient and the the memory card

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:35.460 
more sufficient and the the memory card
should<00:05:33.190> have<00:05:33.340> been<00:05:33.430> an<00:05:33.550> add-on<00:05:33.880> but<00:05:34.810> the

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
should have been an add-on but the

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.070 
should have been an add-on but the
PlayStation<00:05:35.949> Vita<00:05:36.070> has<00:05:36.340> no<00:05:36.940> internal<00:05:37.599> storage

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
PlayStation Vita has no internal storage

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.560 
PlayStation Vita has no internal storage
you<00:05:38.470> have<00:05:38.740> to<00:05:38.979> buy<00:05:39.099> a<00:05:39.130> car<00:05:39.460> which<00:05:40.030> I<00:05:40.210> feel<00:05:40.419> like

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
at this point in time

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.700 
at this point in time
that's<00:05:42.010> pretty<00:05:42.389> 1999<00:05:43.389> oh<00:05:43.659> well<00:05:44.110> yeah<00:05:44.349> maybe<00:05:44.560> a

that's pretty 1999 oh well yeah maybe a

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.050 
that's pretty 1999 oh well yeah maybe a

don't<00:05:53.830> know<00:05:53.919> I<00:05:54.159> just<00:05:54.190> feel<00:05:54.610> that<00:05:55.050> they<00:05:56.050> could

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
don't know I just feel that they could

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.080 
don't know I just feel that they could
have<00:05:56.380> you<00:05:56.889> know<00:05:56.919> done<00:05:57.310> something<00:05:57.729> with<00:05:57.849> that

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
have you know done something with that

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.469 
have you know done something with that
that<00:05:58.720> being<00:05:58.930> said<00:05:59.909> other<00:06:00.909> things<00:06:01.270> we<00:06:01.419> can

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 
that being said other things we can

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:04.230 
that being said other things we can
compare<00:06:02.169> are<00:06:02.409> the<00:06:02.530> controls<00:06:02.979> the<00:06:03.760> Vita<00:06:03.970> has

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
compare are the controls the Vita has

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.670 
compare are the controls the Vita has
much<00:06:04.479> better<00:06:04.659> controls<00:06:05.110> on<00:06:05.259> both<00:06:05.289> of<00:06:05.560> them

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
much better controls on both of them

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.620 
much better controls on both of them
simply<00:06:06.250> because<00:06:06.729> of<00:06:06.759> dual<00:06:07.150> analog<00:06:07.599> sticks

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
simply because of dual analog sticks

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:31.150 
case probably anyway because you don't

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.730 
case probably anyway because you don't
want<00:07:31.330> this<00:07:31.479> landing<00:07:31.840> onto<00:07:32.110> the<00:07:32.199> back<00:07:32.349> you
