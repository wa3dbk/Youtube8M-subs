and<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:43.080> an<00:00:43.200> awesome<00:00:43.380> system<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.880> has<00:00:44.940> radar

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
and it's an awesome system it has radar

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.660 
and it's an awesome system it has radar
jammers<00:00:46.470> in<00:00:46.650> the<00:00:46.740> front<00:00:47.010> bed<00:00:47.220> end<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
jammers in the front bed end in the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.729 
jammers in the front bed end in the
front<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.270> car<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.780> in<00:00:48.990> the<00:00:49.080> rear<00:00:49.320> so

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
front of the car and in the rear so

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.420 
front of the car and in the rear so
actually<00:00:50.100> jams<00:00:50.550> radar<00:00:50.970> signals<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.630> as<00:00:52.470> all

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
actually jams radar signals and as all

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.890 
actually jams radar signals and as all
the<00:00:53.580> X<00:00:53.730> bands<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.330> stuff<00:00:54.390> builds<00:00:54.690> into<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
the X bands and stuff builds into the

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.720 
the X bands and stuff builds into the
front<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.290> back<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.800> into<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.250> dash<00:00:56.430> up

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
here let me see mr. 7-speed and I guess

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.080 
here let me see mr. 7-speed and I guess
by<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.070> coolest<00:01:05.430> thing<00:01:05.520> is<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:05.759> to<00:01:05.850> go<00:01:06.030> on

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
by the coolest thing is just to go on

by the coolest thing is just to go on
the<00:01:06.180> highway<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.540> freaking<00:01:06.810> launch<00:01:06.990> this

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
the highway and freaking launch this

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.800 
the highway and freaking launch this
thing<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.520> see<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.270> speedometer

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
thing so you can see the speedometer

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.190 
thing so you can see the speedometer
goes<00:01:09.930> up<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.229> 200<00:01:11.420> those<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.450> regulator<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.080> all

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
goes up to 200 those a regulator and all

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.760 
goes up to 200 those a regulator and all
bmws<00:01:13.800> of<00:01:13.979> 160<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.960> regulator<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.590> car

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
bmws of 160 so the regulator in this car

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.140 
bmws of 160 so the regulator in this car
hasn't<00:01:16.979> been<00:01:17.130> turned<00:01:17.310> off<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.910> really

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
hasn't been turned off and I really

hasn't been turned off and I really
don't<00:01:18.300> plan<00:01:18.330> on<00:01:18.479> getting<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.869> past<00:01:19.110> 160<00:01:19.790> anyway

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
don't plan on getting it past 160 anyway

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.190 
don't plan on getting it past 160 anyway
because<00:01:22.740> Pat<00:01:23.640> being<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.210> get<00:01:24.780> myself<00:01:24.960> in
