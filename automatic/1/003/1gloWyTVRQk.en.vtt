you<00:00:12.929> guys<00:00:12.960> my<00:00:13.110> new<00:00:13.590> phone<00:00:13.980> it<00:00:14.429> was<00:00:15.179> quite<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.570> hit

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.500 
so I thought that another iPhone type
video<00:00:20.029> would<00:00:21.029> be<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.180> nice<00:00:21.390> follow-up<00:00:22.130> so<00:00:23.510> yeah

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
video would be a nice follow-up so yeah
