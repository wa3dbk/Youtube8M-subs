00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.170
 we find 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.670
 all in Russian writes 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.560
 accordingly, we choose languages here 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.750
 at this building 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.790
 usually 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.990
 default user start here 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.980
 goes into multiplayer mode 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.810
 can I fix run here to me 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.090
 just didn't do one two three four 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.090
 five there are up to 5 other skin masters 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.150
 but there is nothing to anyone 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.300
 so 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.070
 choose what kind of car 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.660
 countries like you turned 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:44.880
 well let's not know the standard either 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.880
 right here responsibly with markers and 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.680
 back without branson 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.890
 we kind of 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.710
 accordingly we appeared here and 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.390
 adjustment and what should be there 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.310
 front rear parameter 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.850
 becomes here we enter if something 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.020
 not so but push on 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.460
 ride height in 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.219
 Yes, we want to continue because Mars 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.659
 fighting they are air suspension sometimes 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.729
 so when here were 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.610
 accordingly here we are heading 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.590
 we should start when what parameters 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.689
 front and back left to right because 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.509
 not on the agenda because they were not ordered and 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:53.709
 that what may be inaccurate is just with 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.709
 mercedes so this we have everything set 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.780
 but radiation on the car 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.840
 11 others must tick the carcass 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.840
 here 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.399
 continue here accordingly 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.860
 procedures we can choose something 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.629
 specific want yes if we want to 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.030
 In principle, everything in the standard was nothing 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.819
 don't choose start just further now 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.760

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.050
 booths he do more rolling much 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.370
 Once two three times there is a menu 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.370
 enough to pass once 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.700
 at 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.870
 was conducted 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.230
 sharden green 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.230

 here we show accordingly 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.150
 all degree on this machine is understandable 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.330
 that this is not a mercedes positioning costaki 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.330
 before 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.760
 and we were given and 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.870
 here we have the next wheel alignment 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.490
 respectively 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.890
 the back of the car that is with us 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.810
 here the icon does not show which 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:37.570
 polishing the night of this car is not 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:39.860
 regulated poorly what are we 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.540
 we press further accordingly will 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.490
 along the front end to the front end then 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.590
 there is from the wrong side there is no collapse 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.330
 descent eat click on the plus sign 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.340
 execute cross out 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.090
 key on make up is 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.800
 immediate 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:57.349
 with interesting pictures 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.349
 how how to regulate just not traction 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:01.770
 collapse 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.240
 respectively, this thing looked at all 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.850
 understand that we need to adjust 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.470
 pressed back again turntables and in all 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:11.810
 other cars there can tell just 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:14.270
 suppress all of us pressed further 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.370
 respectively 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.550
 simply 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.550
 we their 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:23.720
 accordingly , we got the parameters 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.940
 here 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.180
 you can do everything with data there 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.500
 sleep here before 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.639
 here, respectively, you can as with 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.670
 logo 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:34.000
 on 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.990
 through 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.310
 can 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.800
 respectively 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.230
 Here you can from the logo , respectively 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.060
 lacquer branded printing that is here on

 top will be written there company at home 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:49.570
 there rat and so on yes yes further more 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.070
 we have in my opinion this kind 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.020
 that can still in this embodiment, in such 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.820
 print that is possible when printing 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.620
 do and also do put 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.140
 tick and here's a letterhead and 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.030
 here let's put a tick and 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.940
 choose from us and would appear either 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.590
 trommelberg is missing 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:09.780
 Well, the principle on this adjustment 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.780
 finished now press print
