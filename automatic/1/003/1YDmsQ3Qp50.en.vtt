00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:05.410
 hello everyone I'm alejandro and this is a small social trick video tutorial 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.740
 which is neither allows 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.609
 let us begin 

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:13.589
 to activate the trick or you have to create a profile like any 

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:17.319
 but you have to put a specific name 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.609
 this is mandatory to activate it 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.779
 pay attention 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.779
 in the name of the profile we have to put them 0 0 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.320
 dbb 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.980
 as it is today 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.980
 I think that is very important 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.040
 it will look like a profile 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.040
 do not worry that means the trick is active 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.880
 the ski 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.980
 the cops supposed that does not vary in the trick hehe 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.980
 the good thing about this is that you have all the missions 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.730
 from the first to the secret mission or the last one exists 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.800
 dentinho 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.240

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.200

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.240

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.259
 the selection to me already have the tricks the tricks are the following 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.560

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.190
