00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
meant something meaningful to me and I

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.240 
meant something meaningful to me and I
wasn't<00:01:21.869> sure<00:01:22.200> how<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.440> judges<00:01:22.950> were<00:01:23.070> gonna

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
wasn't sure how the judges were gonna

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.770

perceive<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.729> or<00:01:23.820> not<00:01:24.000> but<00:01:24.180> for<00:01:24.240> me<00:01:24.510> it<00:01:24.659> was

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
perceive it or not but for me it was

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.210 
perceive it or not but for me it was
about<00:01:24.930> reaching<00:01:25.229> out<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.560> everybody<00:01:25.920> else

don't ever really have an offseason
I find<00:02:10.850> that<00:02:11.150> if<00:02:11.690> I<00:02:11.840> stay<00:02:12.020> five<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.470> seven

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
I find that if I stay five to seven

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.340 
I find that if I stay five to seven
pounds<00:02:13.010> between<00:02:13.160> contest<00:02:13.760> prep<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:15.110> just

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
where I need to pull back on I started

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.020 
where I need to pull back on I started
working<00:02:20.720> with<00:02:20.960> George<00:02:21.110> Farah<00:02:21.410> this<00:02:21.650> year<00:02:21.970> so<00:02:22.970> I

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
working with George Farah this year so I

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.120 
working with George Farah this year so I
think<00:02:23.120> working<00:02:23.630> with<00:02:23.810> him<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.380> working<00:02:24.890> in

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
think working with him and working in

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.800 
think working with him and working in
the<00:02:25.580> gym<00:02:25.730> with<00:02:25.910> my<00:02:26.060> husband<00:02:26.450> I<00:02:26.540> think<00:02:26.570> the

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
the gym with my husband I think the

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.890 
the gym with my husband I think the
combination<00:02:26.990> has<00:02:27.770> worked<00:02:28.130> really<00:02:28.370> well<00:02:28.900> just

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
combination has worked really well just

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.210 
combination has worked really well just
you<00:02:30.080> know<00:02:30.170> what<00:02:30.350> training<00:02:30.590> smarter<00:02:31.100> and

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
you know what training smarter and

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.250 
you know what training smarter and
fitness<00:02:31.550> I<00:02:31.610> used<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:31.850> over<00:02:32.120> train<00:02:32.270> so<00:02:32.900> for<00:02:33.140> me<00:02:33.230> I

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
fitness I used to over train so for me I

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.930 
fitness I used to over train so for me I
think<00:02:33.440> getting<00:02:33.800> older<00:02:34.160> now<00:02:34.190> it's<00:02:34.550> less<00:02:34.760> is

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
think getting older now it's less is

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.610 
think getting older now it's less is
more<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:35.510> just<00:02:35.690> when<00:02:35.870> I'm<00:02:35.990> in<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.260> gym<00:02:36.410> I

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
more and just when I'm in the gym I

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.380 
more and just when I'm in the gym I
really<00:02:36.950> put<00:02:37.190> everything<00:02:37.880> mind<00:02:38.210> muscle

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
really put everything mind muscle

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.750 
really put everything mind muscle
connection<00:02:38.540> into<00:02:39.260> my<00:02:39.530> training<00:02:39.740> so<00:02:40.130> just<00:02:40.640> the

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
connection into my training so just the

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.480 
connection into my training so just the
combination<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.450> obviously<00:02:41.960> paid<00:02:42.230> off<00:02:42.440> so<00:02:42.710> so

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
combination and obviously paid off so so

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:44.800 
combination and obviously paid off so so
now<00:02:43.670> I<00:02:43.700> guess<00:02:44.060> we're<00:02:44.240> headed<00:02:44.480> toward<00:02:44.750> the

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
now I guess we're headed toward the

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.410 
now I guess we're headed toward the
Olympia<00:02:45.350> what<00:02:46.130> is<00:02:46.250> our<00:02:46.400> plan<00:02:46.640> now<00:02:46.970> heading

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
into those months just before the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.020 
into those months just before the
Olympia<00:02:50.590> I'm<00:02:51.590> not<00:02:51.800> really<00:02:52.010> sure<00:02:52.430> I'm<00:02:52.760> going<00:02:52.910> to

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
Olympia I'm not really sure I'm going to

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.940 
Olympia I'm not really sure I'm going to
sit<00:02:53.180> down<00:02:53.210> with<00:02:53.360> my<00:02:53.660> coaches<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:54.110> see<00:02:54.440> what

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
sit down with my coaches and see what

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.860 
sit down with my coaches and see what
the<00:02:55.070> next<00:02:55.220> step<00:02:55.490> is<00:02:55.700> do<00:02:55.940> we<00:02:56.030> do<00:02:56.270> another<00:02:56.540> show

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
the next step is do we do another show

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.350 
the next step is do we do another show
or<00:02:57.170> do<00:02:57.380> we<00:02:57.500> just<00:02:57.680> take<00:02:57.860> this<00:02:58.010> rest<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.610> work<00:02:59.180> on

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
or do we just take this rest and work on

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.060 
or do we just take this rest and work on
those<00:02:59.480> weaknesses<00:02:59.750> so<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:00.260> can<00:03:00.530> crack<00:03:00.710> the<00:03:00.920> top

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
those weaknesses so I can crack the top
