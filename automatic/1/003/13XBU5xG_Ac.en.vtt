a little scorpion here if I push it that
way<00:02:53.790> that's<00:02:54.300> how<00:02:54.480> easy<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.870> is<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.140> swap<00:02:55.320> the

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
way that's how easy it is to swap the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.810 
way that's how easy it is to swap the
shield<00:02:55.680> on<00:02:55.830> this<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.100> I'll<00:02:56.160> show<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.310> how<00:02:56.700> it

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
goes back on really really that simple

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.280 
goes back on really really that simple
so<00:02:59.970> continuing<00:03:00.480> on<00:03:00.600> with<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.780> exterior<00:03:01.080> and

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
so continuing on with the exterior and

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.540 
so continuing on with the exterior and
some<00:03:01.380> of<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.560> key<00:03:01.650> changes<00:03:02.010> here<00:03:02.190> over<00:03:02.459> the

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
some of the key changes here over the

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.940 
some of the key changes here over the
400<00:03:03.090> also<00:03:03.630> notice<00:03:03.989> that<00:03:04.140> there's<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.650> locking

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
400 also notice that there's a locking

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.590 
400 also notice that there's a locking
mechanism<00:03:05.610> on<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.790> side<00:03:05.820> that's<00:03:06.239> a<00:03:06.390> nice

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
mechanism on the side that's a nice

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.660 
mechanism on the side that's a nice
little<00:03:06.900> upgrade<00:03:07.260> now<00:03:07.830> you<00:03:07.890> might<00:03:08.070> say<00:03:08.220> well<00:03:08.430> a

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
little upgrade now you might say well a

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.040 
little upgrade now you might say well a
lot<00:03:08.940> of<00:03:09.060> times<00:03:09.239> do<00:03:09.420> I<00:03:09.480> really<00:03:09.690> need<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.840> be

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
lot of times do I really need to be

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.470 
lot of times do I really need to be
locked<00:03:10.260> down<00:03:10.380> most<00:03:11.130> times<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.730> answer<00:03:12.000> is<00:03:12.150> no

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
locked down most times the answer is no

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.120 
locked down most times the answer is no
but<00:03:12.930> in<00:03:13.019> a<00:03:13.110> lot<00:03:13.290> of<00:03:13.320> cases<00:03:13.590> now<00:03:13.830> you<00:03:13.890> have<00:03:14.040> the

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
but in a lot of cases now you have the

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.160 
but in a lot of cases now you have the
ability<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.489> lock<00:03:14.700> it<00:03:14.910> up<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.570> by<00:03:15.720> ratcheting

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
ability to lock it up so by ratcheting

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.810 
ability to lock it up so by ratcheting
it<00:03:16.260> due<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.620> down<00:03:16.860> position<00:03:17.130> now<00:03:17.670> I've

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
it due to the down position now I've

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.759 
it due to the down position now I've
done<00:03:18.000> this<00:03:18.150> forced<00:03:18.600> City<00:03:18.959> position<00:03:19.440> that

kind of pulling it out here me it came
out<00:04:03.150> that<00:04:03.299> simply<00:04:03.750> but<00:04:04.260> I<00:04:04.440> will<00:04:04.739> tell<00:04:04.980> you<00:04:05.100> this

and you can see how that works
they<00:04:06.780> actually<00:04:06.959> slide<00:04:07.620> down<00:04:08.010> I<00:04:08.310> think<00:04:08.970> it

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
they actually slide down I think it

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.160 
they actually slide down I think it
could<00:04:09.180> work<00:04:09.209> a<00:04:09.420> little<00:04:09.450> easier<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:09.959> I<00:04:09.989> think

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
could work a little easier and I think

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.630 
could work a little easier and I think
if<00:04:10.230> you<00:04:10.290> work<00:04:10.470> it<00:04:10.590> in<00:04:10.680> a<00:04:10.769> little<00:04:10.980> bit<00:04:11.100> it<00:04:11.459> would

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
if you work it in a little bit it would

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.640 
if you work it in a little bit it would
work<00:04:11.790> too<00:04:12.000> but<00:04:12.180> you<00:04:12.299> have<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.650> encapsulation

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
work too but you have the encapsulation

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.340 
work too but you have the encapsulation
here<00:04:13.980> of<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.609> entire<00:04:15.000> neck<00:04:15.810> roll<00:04:16.019> is<00:04:16.140> one

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
here of the entire neck roll is one

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.690 
here of the entire neck roll is one
piece<00:04:16.590> so<00:04:16.950> it<00:04:17.010> creates<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.340> little<00:04:17.489> bit<00:04:17.609> more

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
piece so it creates a little bit more

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.539 
piece so it creates a little bit more
friction<00:04:18.329> so<00:04:19.169> as<00:04:19.380> I<00:04:19.709> finish<00:04:20.070> my<00:04:20.220> kind<00:04:20.459> of

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
friction so as I finish my kind of

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:21.830 
friction so as I finish my kind of
rotation<00:04:20.850> I'm<00:04:21.030> gonna<00:04:21.150> move<00:04:21.269> that<00:04:21.390> cheek<00:04:21.660> pad

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
rotation I'm gonna move that cheek pad

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.270 
rotation I'm gonna move that cheek pad
around<00:04:21.959> here<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.740> back<00:04:22.860> I<00:04:22.890> want<00:04:23.130> to<00:04:23.190> give

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280

gonna make it a little easier to

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.290 
gonna make it a little easier to

bring my donut back on the table and I

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.080 
bring my donut back on the table and I
already<00:04:56.949> showed<00:04:57.130> you<00:04:57.280> one<00:04:57.460> emergency<00:04:57.790> cheek

the other one out bring in the guts and
remember<00:05:01.750> I<00:05:01.780> told<00:05:01.870> you<00:05:02.110> there's<00:05:02.680> my<00:05:02.889> whoop

there's my cheek pad release and

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.300 
there's my cheek pad release and
remember<00:05:04.900> what<00:05:05.080> happens<00:05:05.410> is<00:05:05.560> cheek<00:05:06.070> pads

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
remember what happens is cheek pads

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.279 
remember what happens is cheek pads
typically<00:05:06.820> snap<00:05:07.090> in<00:05:07.330> but<00:05:07.750> the<00:05:07.840> way<00:05:07.930> this<00:05:08.139> is

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
typically snap in but the way this is

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:10.260 
typically snap in but the way this is
designed<00:05:08.410> that<00:05:08.770> they're<00:05:08.919> on<00:05:09.070> sliders<00:05:09.610> so<00:05:10.180> what

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
designed that they're on sliders so what

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.670 
designed that they're on sliders so what
happens<00:05:10.570> is<00:05:10.690> they<00:05:10.810> snap<00:05:11.110> in<00:05:11.320> but<00:05:11.470> when<00:05:11.590> you

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
happens is they snap in but when you

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.529 
happens is they snap in but when you
slide<00:05:12.010> it<00:05:12.190> down<00:05:12.340> it<00:05:12.610> actually<00:05:13.060> slides<00:05:13.300> away

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
slide it down it actually slides away

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:15.150 
slide it down it actually slides away
and<00:05:13.780> it<00:05:13.840> leaves<00:05:14.110> the<00:05:14.350> little<00:05:14.590> pieces<00:05:14.860> that

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
and it leaves the little pieces that

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.590 
and it leaves the little pieces that
actually<00:05:15.610> pop<00:05:15.820> into<00:05:16.060> the<00:05:16.150> shell<00:05:16.389> actually

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
actually pop into the shell actually

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.689 
actually pop into the shell actually
intact<00:05:17.289> within<00:05:17.590> the<00:05:17.680> shell<00:05:17.889> but<00:05:18.340> if<00:05:18.460> we<00:05:18.550> look

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:18.699 
intact within the shell but if we look

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:20.939 
intact within the shell but if we look
at<00:05:18.850> it<00:05:19.000> contoured<00:05:19.810> cheek<00:05:20.020> pad<00:05:20.229> it's<00:05:20.740> going<00:05:20.889> to

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 
at it contoured cheek pad it's going to

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:22.230 
at it contoured cheek pad it's going to
have<00:05:21.070> the<00:05:21.130> easy<00:05:21.310> fit<00:05:21.580> system<00:05:21.789> which<00:05:22.030> means

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
have the easy fit system which means

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.279 
have the easy fit system which means
it's<00:05:22.360> a<00:05:22.419> little<00:05:22.510> bit<00:05:22.720> less<00:05:22.840> dense<00:05:23.110> in<00:05:23.229> the

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
it's a little bit less dense in the
