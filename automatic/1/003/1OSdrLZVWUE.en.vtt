 going to read above we find the 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.139
 written or ex haven that means 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.920
 literally refuge of wax e 

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:54.100
 should be a reference to 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.679
 hollywood blacks museum where 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.139
 in fact there are waxes and it is a kind 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:01.850
 of museum of the most important celebrities 

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:04.920
 of history and films 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:09.410
 there is also the front of the building 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.500
 the same mural you can find it all 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:17.550
 north of los santos 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.820
 we open the map exactly here in van 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.820
 wood 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.600
 let's move on to something far stranger if 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.880
 watched and jimmy playing video games 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.640
 when playing this fps could 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.000
 happen a rather anomalous scene 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.020
 let's call it so harassing 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.910
 this sexual scene to how strange in 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.060
 a fps because precisely with giving to the game 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.790
 in which scope from the crickets instead to the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.490
 cinema can happen to you before a film 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.240
 to receive these classic warnings 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.700
 before the beginning there is one though 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.210
 really special, here it is shots 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.210
 prepare yourself 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.710
 you got it right i hope someone 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.230
 but have ever tried this thing 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.510
 evidently it is not so at santos in the 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.600
 instead, a masterpiece film can happen to you 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.489
 see a fantastic thing or the 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.790
 heart of the statue of thoughtlessness 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:20.220
 of gta iv that would not be anything pooed by 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.440
 less than the new statue of liberty 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.690
 york 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.959
 here it is the same as in the movie 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.770
 there were also chains in fact we pass 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.280
 at the clothing store 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:39.530
 even if this would not appear from the logo 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:45.140
 is here we are going to zoom in here it is 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:48.890
 here at the intersection in the name is white widow e 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.840
 that is precisely to the symbol of the grass because 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.650
 all this we first look at those from 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.560
 which on the tent we find two written 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.440
 city ​​or liberty city of gta iv 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.470
 on the right and the beautiful left instead 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.130
 santos that of gta 5 and also of gta san 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.350
 andreas 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.560
 white widow I said to you precisely is the name 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.800
 of a very powerful type of marijuana 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:16.790
 white widow is so named for the 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:20.180
 white pollen vice city city of gta 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.860
 vice city and vice city stories therefore 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.940
 this clothing store has spread 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.410
 a bit in all the cities of the past gta 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.700
 however, let us move on to something else 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:34.209
 the first Italian pizzeria chain 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.640
 so very interesting pizza this 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.440
 pizza this is this logo 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.500
 this and this place the logo of 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.180
 pitzalis because he holds his hand so for 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.410
 make fun of us Italians 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:51.080
 which we managed we give a lot while we talk 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:56.930
 and you can find it a little in everything are 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:59.480
 andrea aspro here I went in 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:03.590
 gta 5 trophies we find references 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.900
 to other video games and not only in 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.570
 first let's look at the reference to 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.600
 a game always of the midnight rock star 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.970
 tuning game club indeed the trophy 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:18.160
 cice to win precisely with vehicles 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:21.470
 custom five other trophy races 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.590
 live and die in los santos reference 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.980
 to the song of tupac sell them and in moses 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.500
 angeles and finally you will have noticed it all 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.960
 this just landed the same name as the 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.380
 gta iv trophy just worth 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.640
 just landed 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.080
 that you will receive immediately after having 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:42.660
 reached Rome we are absent shores in 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.980
 phillips trevor company to see 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.960
 two other little things aldo queen boulevard 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:53.220
 reference obviously to the neighborhood of 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:56.370
 liberty city by gta iv ae not less 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.140
 important in the street right here in 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.120
 side 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.250
 armadillo avenue reference to the city 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:06.690
 of red dead redemption armadillo for 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:10.460
 the note can be found here in saint georges 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.460
 just near the tattoo shop 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.360
 sanche nes who is this the name of the 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.790
 mount where we are now situated mountain 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.500
 a little further south of the edge of the mountain 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.090
 It was the name of a boar and wild 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.310
 to hunt on red dead redemption 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:27.390
 hence from this the name of that 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:29.790
 mountain and on top of the sun ski dinners we find 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.530
 this tomb without a name does not know who 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.260
 only the cross belongs to the 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.290
 pit where the corpse is contained 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.540
 of the theories that there is john marston the 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.460
 protagonist of the dead redemption though 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.810
 it is not so because if it is not against this 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.000
 the area where he was stupid was 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.650
 buried in the red dead video 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.720
 redemption is also full of the 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.870
 relatives next to him so this is 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.060
 surely a hoax another theory is 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.280
 that a victim of is buried there 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:59.340
 ursula the psychopathy that lives in this 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.660
 villa in front of the lighthouse indeed yes 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.130
 also tells the story of a 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.710
 gardener who fell from the cliff 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.090
 by accident or it is also said that 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.600
 there is buried johnny klebitz 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.740
 protagonist of the lost and damned 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.120
 in fact to which among other things there was the 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.090
 ghost and many gordo you have already seen 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.910
 on ania anyway johnny klebitz later 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.740
 having been killed by trevor wade or ron 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.870
 now I don't remember telling him about 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.290
 but burying him in the desert is not 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:26.040
 so I 'm me johnny klebitz 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.830
 simply because here we are in one 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:32.210
 quite green area not in the desert 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:35.130
 in fact if we open the map here is here 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:38.310
 see this non-desert green area 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:40.320
 so I'm the most plausible theory 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.520
 is that of ursula and the gardener o 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.340
 anyway of his victim 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.620
 for this video it's all guys i hope and
