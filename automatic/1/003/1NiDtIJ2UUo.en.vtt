wondered<00:03:03.730> why<00:03:04.299> we're<00:03:04.540> here<00:03:04.900> on<00:03:05.079> this<00:03:05.439> island

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:06.419 
wondered why we're here on this island

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.199 
wondered why we're here on this island
if<00:03:07.419> there<00:03:07.629> are<00:03:07.780> any<00:03:08.019> other<00:03:08.169> worlds<00:03:08.560> out<00:03:08.680> there

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
if there are any other worlds out there

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.009 
if there are any other worlds out there
why<00:03:10.209> did<00:03:10.419> we<00:03:10.599> end<00:03:10.810> up<00:03:10.930> on<00:03:11.109> this<00:03:11.319> one<00:03:11.530> and

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
why did we end up on this one and

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.659 
why did we end up on this one and
suppose<00:03:14.019> there<00:03:14.260> are<00:03:14.439> other<00:03:14.739> worlds<00:03:17.340> then<00:03:18.340> ours

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:18.669 
suppose there are other worlds then ours

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:20.550 
suppose there are other worlds then ours
is<00:03:18.760> just<00:03:18.969> a<00:03:19.120> little<00:03:19.450> piece<00:03:19.689> of<00:03:19.719> something<00:03:20.290> much

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
is just a little piece of something much

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.860 
is just a little piece of something much
greater<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:24.000> we<00:03:25.000> could<00:03:25.209> have<00:03:25.299> just<00:03:25.569> as<00:03:25.719> easily

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
greater so we could have just as easily

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.890 
greater so we could have just as easily
ended<00:03:26.319> up<00:03:26.439> somewhere<00:03:26.680> else<00:03:26.980> right<00:03:27.400> I<00:03:27.900> don't

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
ended up somewhere else right I don't

ended up somewhere else right I don't
know<00:03:29.700> exactly<00:03:31.469> that's<00:03:32.469> why<00:03:32.709> we<00:03:32.919> need<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.159> go

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
know exactly that's why we need to go

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.409
